Vaccines Reason 5 O O
protect Reason 5 O O
you Reason 5 O O
(and Reason 5 O O
everyone Reason 5 O O
around Reason 5 O O
you) Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
highly Reason 5 O O
infectious Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
potentially Reason 5 O O
deadly Reason 5 O O
pathogens Reason 5 O O
(disease-causing Reason 5 O O
organisms Reason 5 O O
such Reason 5 O O
as Reason 5 O O
bacteria Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
viruses) Reason 5 O O
without Reason 5 O O
you Reason 5 O O
needing Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
be Reason 5 O O
exposed Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
actual Reason 5 O O
pathogen. Reason 5 O O
Vaccines Reason 5 O O
allow Reason 5 O O
your Reason 5 O O
body Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
produce Reason 5 O O
infection-fighting Reason 5 O O
cells Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
pathogen-specific Reason 5 O O
antibodies, Reason 5 O O
which Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
molecules Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
remain Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
your Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
system Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
recognize Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
attack Reason 5 O O
pathogens. Reason 5 O O
A Reason 5 O O
vaccine Reason 5 O O
mimics Reason 5 O O
an Reason 5 O O
infection Reason 5 O O
by Reason 5 O O
exposing Reason 5 O O
your Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
system Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
weakened Reason 5 O O
or Reason 5 O O
dead Reason 5 O O
pathogen, Reason 5 O O
allowing Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
system Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
"see" Reason 5 O O
this Reason 5 O O
pathogen Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
build Reason 5 O O
up Reason 5 O O
protection Reason 5 O O
against Reason 5 O O
it Reason 5 O O
(without Reason 5 O O
you Reason 5 O O
actually Reason 5 O O
being Reason 5 O O
exposed Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
infectious Reason 5 O O
pathogen Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
getting Reason 5 O O
sick). Reason 5 O O
Then, Reason 5 O O
if Reason 5 O O
you Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
exposed Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
real Reason 5 O O
pathogen, Reason 5 O O
you Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
protected, Reason 5 O O
or Reason 5 O O
at Reason 5 O O
least Reason 5 O O
much Reason 5 O O
less Reason 5 O O
likely Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
acquire Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
particular Reason 5 O O
disease Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
experience Reason 5 O O
complications Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
it. Reason 5 O O
It Reason 4 O O
takes Reason 4 O O
up Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
two Reason 4 O O
weeks Reason 4 O O
for Reason 4 O O
you Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
be Reason 4 O O
fully Reason 4 O O
protected Reason 4 O O
after Reason 4 O O
getting Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
vaccine Reason 4 O O
because Reason 4 O O
it Reason 4 O O
takes Reason 4 O O
that Reason 4 O O
long Reason 4 O O
for Reason 4 O O
pathogen-specific Reason 4 O O
antibodies Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
be Reason 4 O O
produced. Reason 4 O O
If Reason 4 O O
you Reason 4 O O
are Reason 4 O O
exposed Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
pathogen Reason 4 O O
before Reason 4 O O
or Reason 4 O O
right Reason 4 O O
after Reason 4 O O
getting Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
vaccine Reason 4 O O
for Reason 4 O O
it, Reason 4 O O
you Reason 4 O O
may Reason 4 O O
get Reason 4 O O
sick Reason 4 O O
simply Reason 4 O O
because Reason 4 O O
your Reason 4 O O
immune Reason 4 O O
system Reason 4 O O
hasn't Reason 4 O O
had Reason 4 O O
time Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
produce Reason 4 O O
enough Reason 4 O O
antibodies. Reason 4 O O
You Reason 4 O O
may Reason 4 O O
have Reason 4 O O
minor Reason 4 O O
symptoms Reason 4 O O
after Reason 4 O O
getting Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
vaccine, Reason 4 O O
such Reason 4 O O
as Reason 4 O O
aches Reason 4 O O
and Reason 4 O O
fever, Reason 4 O O
that Reason 4 O O
feel Reason 4 O O
like Reason 4 O O
you're Reason 4 O O
getting Reason 4 O O
sick, Reason 4 O O
but Reason 4 O O
you Reason 4 O O
aren't Reason 4 O O
(vaccines Reason 4 O O
almost Reason 4 O O
never Reason 4 O O
cause Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
illness Reason 4 O O
they Reason 4 O O
aim Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
protect Reason 4 O O
you Reason 4 O O
from). Reason 4 O O
The Reason 4 O O
symptoms Reason 4 O O
you Reason 4 O O
feel Reason 4 O O
are Reason 4 O O
your Reason 4 O O
immune Reason 4 O O
system Reason 4 O O
responding Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
vaccine Reason 4 O O
and Reason 4 O O
producing Reason 4 O O
protection Reason 4 O O
against Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
pathogen. Reason 4 O O
Vaccination Reason 5 O O
not Reason 5 O O
only Reason 5 O O
protects Reason 5 O O
yourself, Reason 5 O O
it Reason 5 O O
also Reason 5 O O
protects Reason 5 O O
everyone Reason 5 O O
around Reason 5 O O
you. Reason 5 O O
If Reason 5 O O
enough Reason 5 O O
people Reason 5 O O
get Reason 5 O O
vaccinated Reason 5 O O
(between Reason 5 O O
75-94% Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
population, Reason 5 O O
depending Reason 5 O O
on Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
disease), Reason 5 O O
it Reason 5 O O
will Reason 5 O O
likely Reason 5 O O
protect Reason 5 O O
those Reason 5 O O
who Reason 5 O O
don't Reason 5 O O
get Reason 5 O O
vaccinated. Reason 5 O O
When Reason 5 O O
enough Reason 5 O O
people Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
vaccinated Reason 5 O O
against Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
disease, Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
pathogen Reason 5 O O
has Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
hard Reason 5 O O
time Reason 5 O O
being Reason 5 O O
passed Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
person Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
person Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
can't Reason 5 O O
spread Reason 5 O O
easily Reason 5 O O
through Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
community. Reason 5 O O
Herd Reason 5 O O
immunity Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
especially Reason 5 O O
important Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
those Reason 5 O O
who Reason 5 O O
can't Reason 5 O O
get Reason 5 O O
vaccinated Reason 5 O O
because Reason 5 O O
they Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
too Reason 5 O O
young, Reason 5 O O
too Reason 5 O O
old, Reason 5 O O
too Reason 5 O O
sick, Reason 5 O O
or Reason 5 O O
have Reason 5 O O
an Reason 5 O O
allergy Reason 5 O O
or Reason 5 O O
chronic Reason 5 O O
condition Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
prevents Reason 5 O O
them Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
receiving Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
specific Reason 5 O O
vaccine. Reason 5 O O
It Reason 5 O O
can Reason 5 O O
even Reason 5 O O
protect Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
few Reason 5 O O
people Reason 5 O O
who Reason 5 O O
have Reason 5 O O
been Reason 5 O O
vaccinated Reason 5 O O
but Reason 5 O O
didn't Reason 5 O O
have Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
strong Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
response Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
them, Reason 5 O O
leaving Reason 5 O O
them Reason 5 O O
vulnerable Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
disease. Reason 5 O O
Protecting Reason 5 O O
yourself Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
your Reason 5 O O
community Reason 5 O O
aren't Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
only Reason 5 O O
reasons Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
vaccinate. Reason 5 O O
As Reason 5 O O
more Reason 5 O O
people Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
region Reason 5 O O
vaccinate, Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
diseases Reason 5 O O
they Reason 5 O O
protect Reason 5 O O
against Reason 5 O O
become Reason 5 O O
rarer; Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
fact, Reason 5 O O
if Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
vast Reason 5 O O
majority Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
people Reason 5 O O
immunize Reason 5 O O
for Reason 5 O O
long Reason 5 O O
enough, Reason 5 O O
diseases Reason 5 O O
can Reason 5 O O
be Reason 5 O O
eradicated Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
their Reason 5 O O
region. Reason 5 O O
Smallpox, Reason 5 O O
for Reason 5 O O
example, Reason 5 O O
was Reason 5 O O
eradicated Reason 5 O O
worldwide. Reason 5 O O
On Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
flip Reason 5 O O
side, Reason 5 O O
if Reason 5 O O
we Reason 5 O O
stop Reason 5 O O
vaccinating, Reason 5 O O
we Reason 5 O O
make Reason 5 O O
ourselves Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
our Reason 5 O O
communities Reason 5 O O
much Reason 5 O O
more Reason 5 O O
vulnerable Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
diseases Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
epidemics. Reason 5 O O
Like Reason 4 O O
any Reason 4 O O
medicine, Reason 4 O O
vaccines Reason 4 O O
can Reason 4 O O
cause Reason 4 O O
side Reason 4 O O
effects, Reason 4 O O
but Reason 4 O O
they Reason 4 O O
are Reason 4 O O
usually Reason 4 O O
mild Reason 4 O O
(low-grade Reason 4 O O
fever, Reason 4 O O
sore Reason 4 O O
throat, Reason 4 O O
soreness Reason 4 O O
around Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
injection Reason 4 O O
site) Reason 4 O O
and Reason 4 O O
go Reason 4 O O
away Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
few Reason 4 O O
days Reason 4 O O
after Reason 4 O O
getting Reason 4 O O
vaccinated. Reason 4 O O
However, Reason 2 O O
there Reason 2 O O
is Reason 2 O O
an Reason 2 O O
extremely Reason 2 O O
small Reason 2 O O
chance Reason 2 O O
you Reason 2 O O
could Reason 2 O O
have Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
more Reason 2 O O
serious Reason 2 O O
rare Reason 2 O O
side Reason 2 O O
effect, Reason 2 O O
such Reason 2 O O
as Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
severe Reason 2 O O
allergic Reason 2 O O
reaction, Reason 2 O O
other Reason 2 O O
serious Reason 2 O O
injury, Reason 2 O O
or Reason 2 O O
death. Reason 2 O O
There Reason 2 O O
is Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
one Reason 2 O O
in Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
million Reason 2 O O
chance Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
having Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
serious Reason 2 O O
reaction Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O

The Reason 2 O O
risks Reason 2 O O
and Reason 2 O O
complications Reason 2 O O
associated Reason 2 O O
with Reason 2 O O
many Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
the Reason 2 O O
serious Reason 2 O O
diseases Reason 2 O O
that Reason 2 O O
vaccines Reason 2 O O
protect Reason 2 O O
against Reason 2 O O
have Reason 2 O O
much Reason 2 O O
higher Reason 2 O O
odds Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
causing Reason 2 O O
problems Reason 2 O O
if Reason 2 O O
you Reason 2 O O
were Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
get Reason 2 O O
sick Reason 2 O O
with Reason 2 O O
them. Reason 2 O O
Aside Reason 4 O O
from Reason 4 O O
being Reason 4 O O
sick Reason 4 O O
with Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
potentially Reason 4 O O
serious Reason 4 O O
illness, Reason 4 O O
not Reason 4 O O
vaccinating Reason 4 O O
can Reason 4 O O
also Reason 4 O O
increase Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
risk Reason 4 O O
of Reason 4 O O
you Reason 4 O O
spreading Reason 4 O O
disease Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
people Reason 4 O O
around Reason 4 O O
you. Reason 4 O O
This Reason 4 O O
is Reason 4 O O
especially Reason 4 O O
troubling Reason 4 O O
if Reason 4 O O
they Reason 4 O O
are Reason 4 O O
at Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
higher Reason 4 O O
risk Reason 4 O O
of Reason 4 O O
complications Reason 4 O O
due Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
age Reason 4 O O
or Reason 4 O O
other Reason 4 O O
health Reason 4 O O
conditions. Reason 4 O O
Outbreaks Reason 4 O O
can Reason 4 O O
happen Reason 4 O O
when Reason 4 O O
people Reason 4 O O
hesitate Reason 4 O O
or Reason 4 O O
refuse Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
vaccinate Reason 4 O O
themselves Reason 4 O O
or Reason 4 O O
their Reason 4 O O
kids Reason 4 O O
(usually Reason 4 O O
called Reason 4 O O
being Reason 4 O O
"vaccine Reason 4 O O
hesitant" Reason 4 O O
or Reason 4 O O
"anti-vax"). Reason 4 O O
When Reason 4 O O
an Reason 4 O O
entire Reason 4 O O
community Reason 4 O O
has Reason 4 O O
low Reason 4 O O
enough Reason 4 O O
vaccination Reason 4 O O
rates, Reason 4 O O
outbreaks Reason 4 O O
can Reason 4 O O
occur Reason 4 O O
because Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
pathogen Reason 4 O O
can Reason 4 O O
circulate, Reason 4 O O
spreading Reason 4 O O
from Reason 4 O O
person Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
person. Reason 4 O O
The Reason 4 O O
World Reason 4 ScientificAuthority O
Health Reason 4 ScientificAuthority O
Organization Reason 4 ScientificAuthority O
declared Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
anti-vaccine Reason 4 O O
movement Reason 4 O O
as Reason 4 O O
one Reason 4 O O
of Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
top Reason 4 O O
ten Reason 4 O O
threats Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
global Reason 4 O O
human Reason 4 O O
health Reason 4 O O
in Reason 4 O O
2019. Reason 4 O O
Developing Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
vaccine Reason 4 O O
against Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
pathogen Reason 4 O O
depends Reason 4 O O
on Reason 4 O O
multiple Reason 4 O O
factors, Reason 4 O O
such Reason 4 O O
as Reason 4 O O
if Reason 4 O O
it Reason 4 O O
is Reason 4 O O
a Reason 4 O O
bacteria Reason 4 O O
or Reason 4 O O
virus, Reason 4 O O
what Reason 4 O O
part Reason 4 O O
of Reason 4 O O
it Reason 4 O O
is Reason 4 O O
infectious, Reason 4 O O
and Reason 4 O O
how Reason 4 O O
the Reason 4 O O
immune Reason 4 O O
system Reason 4 O O
responds Reason 4 O O
to Reason 4 O O
it. Reason 4 O O
Therefore, Reason 5 O O
there Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
many Reason 5 O O
different Reason 5 O O
kinds Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
vaccines: Reason 5 O O
Live, Reason 5 O O
attenuated: Reason 5 O O
Contain Reason 5 O O
live Reason 5 O O
but Reason 5 O O
weakened Reason 5 O O
pathogens Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
don't Reason 5 O O
cause Reason 5 O O
serious Reason 5 O O
disease Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
healthy Reason 5 O O
people. Reason 5 O O
These Reason 5 O O
vaccines Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
extremely Reason 5 O O
effective Reason 5 O O
because Reason 5 O O
they Reason 5 O O
resemble Reason 5 O O
infection Reason 5 O O
with Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
live, Reason 5 O O
full-strength Reason 5 O O
pathogen, Reason 5 O O
so Reason 5 O O
they Reason 5 O O
produce Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
robust Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
response. Reason 5 O O
However, Reason 5 O O
because Reason 5 O O
these Reason 5 O O
vaccines Reason 5 O O
contain Reason 5 O O
live Reason 5 O O
(though Reason 5 O O
attenuated) Reason 5 O O
pathogens, Reason 5 O O
not Reason 5 O O
everyone Reason 5 O O
can Reason 5 O O
receive Reason 5 O O
them. Reason 5 O O
Inactivated: Reason 5 O O
Contain Reason 5 O O
killed Reason 5 O O
pathogens Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O

immune Reason 5 O O
responses Reason 5 O O
without Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
risk Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
causing Reason 5 O O
disease. Reason 5 O O
Multiple Reason 5 O O
doses Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
usually Reason 5 O O
needed Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
build Reason 5 O O
up Reason 5 O O
or Reason 5 O O
maintain Reason 5 O O
protection. Reason 5 O O
Subunit: Reason 5 O O
Contain Reason 5 O O
parts Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
pathogens Reason 5 O O
(called Reason 5 O O
subunits) Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
system Reason 5 O O
can Reason 5 O O
recognize Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
use Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
build Reason 5 O O
protection Reason 5 O O
against Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
entire Reason 5 O O
pathogen. Reason 5 O O
Side Reason 5 O O
effects Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
less Reason 5 O O
common Reason 5 O O
because Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
entire Reason 5 O O
pathogen Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
not Reason 5 O O
present. Reason 5 O O
People Reason 5 O O
with Reason 5 O O
weakened Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
systems Reason 5 O O
can Reason 5 O O
receive Reason 5 O O
these Reason 5 O O
vaccines, Reason 5 O O
but Reason 5 O O
boosters Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
commonly Reason 5 O O
needed Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
maintain Reason 5 O O
protection. Reason 5 O O
Recombinant: Reason 5 O O
Contain Reason 5 O O
genetically Reason 5 O O
engineered Reason 5 O O
cells Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
express Reason 5 O O
parts Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
target Reason 5 O O
pathogen Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
trigger Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
system Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
recognize Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
build Reason 5 O O
protection Reason 5 O O
against Reason 5 O O
it. Reason 5 O O
Side Reason 5 O O
effects Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
less Reason 5 O O
common Reason 5 O O
because Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
entire Reason 5 O O
pathogen Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
not Reason 5 O O

People Reason 5 O O
with Reason 5 O O
weakened Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O

to Reason 5 O O
maintain Reason 5 O O
protection. Reason 5 O O
Conjugate: Reason 5 O O
Combine Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
weak Reason 5 O O
pathogen Reason 5 O O
with Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
stronger Reason 5 O O
one Reason 5 O O
so Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
system Reason 5 O O
can Reason 5 O O
recognize Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
weaker Reason 5 O O
one, Reason 5 O O
which Reason 5 O O
wouldn't, Reason 5 O O
on Reason 5 O O
its Reason 5 O O
own, Reason 5 O O
provoke Reason 5 O O
an Reason 5 O O
immune Reason 5 O O
response. Reason 5 O O
Toxoid: Reason 5 O O
Contains Reason 5 O O
weakened Reason 5 O O
bacterial Reason 5 O O
toxins Reason 5 O O
(called Reason 5 O O
toxoids) Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
train Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
body Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
fight Reason 5 O O
off Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
normal Reason 5 O O
toxin Reason 5 O O
without Reason 5 O O
causing Reason 5 O O
illness. Reason 5 O O
There Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
vaccines Reason 5 O O
for Reason 5 O O
over Reason 5 O O
20 Reason 5 O O
different Reason 5 O O
bacteria Reason 5 O O
