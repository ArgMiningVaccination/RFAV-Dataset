to Reason 5 O O
significant Reason 5 O O
media Reason 5 O O
attention, Reason 5 O O
including Reason 5 O O
an Reason 5 O O

(1993). Reason 5 O O
While Reason 5 O O

in Reason 5 O O

has Reason 5 O O
been Reason 5 O O

critical Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O

Although Reason 5 O O

Given Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
popularity Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O

evidence Reason 5 O O
available Reason 5 O O
for Reason 5 O O
its Reason 5 O O

Background Reason 5 O O
Although Reason 5 O O
shark Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
recommended Reason 5 O O
for Reason 5 O O
psoriasis, Reason 5 O O
inflammatory Reason 5 O O
joint Reason 5 O O
diseases, Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
macular Reason 5 O O
degeneration, Reason 5 O O
most Reason 5 O O
interest Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
research Reason 5 O O
has Reason 5 O O
focused Reason 5 O O
on Reason 5 O O
its Reason 5 O O
use Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
treating Reason 5 O O
cancer. Reason 5 O O
Interest Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
treat Reason 5 O O
cancer Reason 5 O O
began Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
1950s, Reason 5 O O
primarily Reason 5 O O
focused Reason 5 O O
on Reason 5 O O
bovine Reason 5 O O
cartilage. Reason 5 O O
Attention Reason 5 O O
was Reason 5 O O
directed Reason 5 O O
toward Reason 5 O O
shark Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
1970s, Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
basic Reason 5 O O
research Reason 5 O O
through Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
1980s Reason 5 O O
produced Reason 5 O O
interesting Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
vitro Reason 5 O O
findings. Reason 5 O O
Then Reason 5 O O
Lane's Reason 5 O O
books Reason 5 O O
brought Reason 5 O O
public Reason 5 O O
attention. Reason 5 O O
His Reason 5 O O
book Reason 5 O O
Sharks Reason 5 O O
Don't Reason 5 O O
Get Reason 5 O O
Cancer Reason 5 O O
claimed Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
some Reason 5 O O
substance Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
sharks' Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
protected Reason 5 O O
them Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
cancer. Reason 5 O O
However, Reason 5 O O
several Reason 5 O O
dozen Reason 5 O O
documented Reason 5 O O
cases Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
benign Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
malignant Reason 5 O O
cancers Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
sharks Reason 5 O O
date Reason 5 O O
back Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
1913.5 Reason 5 O O
Lane's Reason 5 O O
1996 Reason 5 O O
book Reason 5 O O
acknowledged Reason 5 O O
this, Reason 5 O O
but Reason 5 O O
noted Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
incidence Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
cancer Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
sharks Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
very Reason 5 O O
low. Reason 5 O O
However, Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
recent Reason 5 O O
review Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
marine Reason 5 O O
research Reason 5 O O
concluded Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
shark Reason 5 O O
cancer Reason 5 O O
rates Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
unknown Reason 5 O O
because Reason 5 O O
they Reason 5 O O
have Reason 5 O O
never Reason 5 O O
been Reason 5 O O
systematically Reason 5 O O
examined.5 Reason 5 O O
Even Reason 5 O O
if Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
incidence Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
cancer Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
sharks Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
low, Reason 5 O O
this Reason 5 O O
provides Reason 5 O O
no Reason 5 O O
support Reason 5 O O
for Reason 5 O O
using Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
treat Reason 5 O O
cancer. Reason 5 O O
Nonetheless, Reason 5 O O
research Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
demonstrating Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
extracts Reason 5 O O
made Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
shark Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
hold Reason 5 O O
promise Reason 5 O O
as Reason 5 O O
cancer Reason 5 O O
treatments.6 Reason 5 O O

which Reason 5 O O
make Reason 5 O O

6% Reason 5 O O

This Reason 5 O O

Several Reason 5 O O

of Reason 5 O O
shark Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
also Reason 5 O O
under Reason 5 O O
investigation Reason 5 O O
for Reason 5 O O
anticancer Reason 5 O O
activity. Reason 5 O O
U-995 Reason 5 O O
had Reason 5 O O

but Reason 5 O O
not Reason 5 O O
when Reason 5 O O
given Reason 5 O O
orally Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
animals. Reason 5 O O
Another, Reason 5 O O
AE-941 Reason 5 O O
(Neovastat, Reason 5 O O
Aeterna Reason 5 O O
Laboratories, Reason 5 O O
Canada), Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
water-soluble Reason 5 O O

from Reason 5 O O
which Reason 5 O O
95% Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
inert Reason 5 O O

has Reason 5 O O
been Reason 5 O O
removed. Reason 5 O O
It Reason 5 O O
has Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O

activity, Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
orally Reason 5 O O
active, Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O

This Reason 5 O O

also Reason 5 O O
has Reason 5 O O
been Reason 5 O O
shown Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
stimulate Reason 5 O O

thus Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
have Reason 5 O O
potential Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
treating Reason 5 O O
vascular Reason 5 O O
disorders.8 Reason 5 O O
A Reason 5 O O
clear Reason 5 O O
distinction Reason 5 O O
must Reason 5 O O
be Reason 5 O O
made Reason 5 O O
between Reason 5 O O
such Reason 5 O O
purified Reason 5 O O

and Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
crude Reason 5 O O

typically Reason 5 O O
marketed Reason 5 O O
as Reason 5 O O

cartilage. Reason 5 O O
Mechanism Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
Action Reason 5 O O
Although Reason 5 O O
several Reason 5 O O
mechanisms Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
action Reason 5 O O
have Reason 5 O O
been Reason 5 O O
proposed, Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
one Reason 5 O O
with Reason 5 O O
some Reason 5 O O
supportive Reason 5 O O
evidence Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
antiangiogenesis. Reason 5 O O
In Reason 5 O O
1971, Reason 5 O O
Judah Reason 5 O O
Folkman Reason 5 O O
published Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
seminal Reason 5 O O
paper Reason 5 O O
proposing Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
agents Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
block Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
development Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
blood Reason 5 O O
vessels Reason 5 O O
could Reason 5 O O
be Reason 5 O O
used Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
treat Reason 5 O O
cancer. Reason 5 O O
Angiogenesis Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
production Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
new Reason 5 O O
blood Reason 5 O O
vessels Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
occurs Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
humans Reason 5 O O
primarily Reason 5 O O
during Reason 5 O O
fetal Reason 5 O O
development, Reason 5 O O
inflammation, Reason 5 O O
wound Reason 5 O O
healing, Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
malignancy. Reason 5 O O
Tumor Reason 5 O O
growth Reason 5 O O
requires Reason 5 O O
new Reason 5 O O
vascularization Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
permit Reason 5 O O
exchange Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
nutrients Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
waste. Reason 5 O O
Inhibiting Reason 5 O O
this Reason 5 O O
process Reason 5 O O
would Reason 5 O O
prevent Reason 5 O O
tumors Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
growing Reason 5 O O
beyond Reason 5 O O
a Reason 5 O O
couple Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
millimeters Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
diameter. Reason 5 O O
Antiangiogenic Reason 5 O O
factors Reason 5 O O
have Reason 5 O O
been Reason 5 O O
found Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
bovine, Reason 5 O O
human, Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
shark Reason 5 O O
cartilage. Reason 5 O O
Some Reason 5 O O
from Reason 5 O O
other Reason 5 O O
sources Reason 5 O O
are Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
various Reason 5 O O
stages Reason 5 O O
of Reason 5 O O
clinical Reason 5 O O
trials Reason 5 O O
as Reason 5 O O
anticancer Reason 5 O O
agents. Reason 5 O O
Clinical Reason 5 O O
Studies Reason 5 O O
Early Reason 5 O O
animal Reason 5 O O
experiments Reason 5 O O
demonstrated Reason 5 O O
that Reason 5 O O
shark Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
its Reason 5 O O
extracts Reason 5 O O
had Reason 5 O O
antiangiogenic Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
antitumor Reason 5 O O
activity Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
mice, Reason 5 O O
rabbits, Reason 5 O O
and Reason 5 O O
chick Reason 5 O O
embryos. Reason 5 O O
However, Reason 5 O O
shark Reason 5 O O
cartilage Reason 5 O O
was Reason 5 O O
not Reason 5 O O
administered Reason 5 O O
orally Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
these Reason 5 O O
experiments. Reason 5 O O
Oral Reason 5 O O
administration Reason 5 O O
was Reason 5 O O
examined Reason 5 O O
in Reason 5 O O
mice Reason 5 O O
with Reason 5 O O
the Reason 5 O O
SCCVII Reason 5 O O
tumor Reason 5 O O
model, Reason 5 O O
which Reason 5 O O
is Reason 5 O O
known Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
be Reason 5 O O
responsive Reason 5 O O
to Reason 5 O O
conventional Reason 5 O O
anticancer Reason 5 O O
therapies, Reason 5 O O
including Reason 5 O O
antiangiogenic Reason 5 O O
agents. Reason 5 O O
Mortality, Reason 5 O O
tumor Reason 5 O O

and Reason 5 O O
metastatic Reason 5 O O
spread Reason 5 O O
were Reason 5 O O

Human Reason 5 O O

In Reason 5 O O

29 Reason 5 O O

In Reason 5 O O

Conclusion Reason 2 O O
The Reason 2 O O
oral Reason 2 O O
use Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
powdered Reason 2 O O
shark Reason 2 O O
cartilage Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
treat Reason 2 O O
cancer Reason 2 O O
is Reason 2 O O
not Reason 2 O O
supported Reason 2 O O
by Reason 2 O O
clinical Reason 2 O O
studies. Reason 2 O O
[/Reason:end] Reason 2 O O
As Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
recent Reason 2 O O
review Reason 2 O O
concluded, Reason 2 O O
"It Reason 2 O O
is Reason 2 O O
notable Reason 2 O O
that Reason 2 O O
despite Reason 2 O O
more Reason 2 O O
than Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
decade Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
evaluation Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
shark Reason 2 O O
cartilage, Reason 2 O O
not Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
single Reason 2 O O
controlled Reason 2 O O
study Reason 2 O O
has Reason 2 O O
established Reason 2 O O
any Reason 2 O O
efficacy Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
crude Reason 2 O O
cartilage Reason 2 O O
extracts Reason 2 O O
against Reason 2 O O
cancer." Reason 2 O O
However, Reason 2 O O
shark Reason 2 O O
cartilage Reason 2 O O
is Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
source Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
antiangiogenic Reason 2 O O
products, Reason 2 O O
some Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
which Reason 2 O O
are Reason 2 O O
progressing Reason 2 O O
through Reason 2 O O
clinical Reason 2 O O
trials Reason 2 O O
and Reason 2 O O
may Reason 2 O O
lead Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
effective Reason 2 O O
treatments. Reason 2 O O
Such Reason 2 O O
products Reason 2 O O
also Reason 2 O O
hold Reason 2 O O
the Reason 2 O O
potential Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
be Reason 2 O O
synthetically Reason 2 O O
derived, Reason 2 O O
thus Reason 2 O O
sparing Reason 2 O O
the Reason 2 O O
natural Reason 2 O O
shark Reason 2 O O
population Reason 2 O O
which Reason 2 O O
has Reason 2 O O
been Reason 2 O O
measurably Reason 2 O O
depleted Reason 2 O O
over Reason 2 O O
the Reason 2 O O
past Reason 2 O O
15 Reason 2 O O
years Reason 2 O O
(sharks Reason 2 O O
are Reason 2 O O
also Reason 2 O O
fished Reason 2 O O
for Reason 2 O O
their Reason 2 O O
meat Reason 2 O O
and Reason 2 O O
oil, Reason 2 O O
and Reason 2 O O
for Reason 2 O O
sport, Reason 2 O O
as Reason 2 O O
well Reason 2 O O
as Reason 2 O O
for Reason 2 O O
their Reason 2 O O
cartilage). Reason 2 O O
Recommendation Reason 2 O O
Patients Reason 2 O O
with Reason 2 O O
cancer Reason 2 O O
should Reason 2 O O
be Reason 2 O O
encouraged Reason 2 O O
not Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
place Reason 2 O O
hope Reason 2 O O
in Reason 2 O O
powdered Reason 2 O O
shark Reason 2 O O
cartilage Reason 2 O O
products. Reason 2 O O
Although Reason 2 O O
the Reason 2 O O
products Reason 2 O O
are Reason 2 O O
generally Reason 2 O O
well Reason 2 O O
tolerated, Reason 2 O O
they Reason 2 O O
do Reason 2 O O
carry Reason 2 O O
some Reason 2 O O
risk Reason 2 O O
of Reason 2 O O
gastrointestinal Reason 2 O O
discomfort Reason 2 O O
and Reason 2 O O
may Reason 2 O O
interfere Reason 2 O O
with Reason 2 O O
other Reason 2 O O
conditions. Reason 2 O O
In Reason 2 O O
addition, Reason 2 O O
a Reason 2 O O
month's Reason 2 O O
supply Reason 2 O O
can Reason 2 O O
cost Reason 2 O O
$700-1000. Reason 2 O O
Such Reason 2 O O
costs Reason 2 O O
may Reason 2 O O
be Reason 2 O O
acceptable Reason 2 O O
with Reason 2 O O
an Reason 2 O O
effective Reason 2 O O
product, Reason 2 O O
but Reason 2 O O
not Reason 2 O O
with Reason 2 O O
one Reason 2 O O
that Reason 2 O O
has Reason 2 O O
failed Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
produce Reason 2 O O
results Reason 2 O O
that Reason 2 O O
have Reason 2 O O
stood Reason 2 O O
up Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
professional Reason 2 O O
review. Reason 2 O O
Patients Reason 2 O O
should Reason 2 O O
instead Reason 2 O O
be Reason 2 O O
encouraged Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
pursue Reason 2 O O
the Reason 2 O O
treatments Reason 2 O O
that Reason 2 O O
have Reason 2 O O
been Reason 2 O O
shown Reason 2 O O
to Reason 2 O O
be Reason 2 O O
effective Reason 2 O O
