said. Reason 3 O O
In Reason 3 O O
addition, Reason 3 O O
real-world Reason 3 O O

[Dr. Reason 3 O O
William Reason 3 O O
Schaffner](https://www.nfid.org/about-nfid/board-of-directors/william-schaffner-md/#:~:text=William%20Schaffner%2C%20MD%2C%20is%20medical,Control%20and%20Prevention%20(CDC).), Reason 3 O O

director Reason 3 O O
of Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
National Reason 3 O O
Foundation Reason 3 O O
for Reason 3 O O
Infectious Reason 3 O O
Diseases. Reason 3 O O
Schaffner Reason 3 O O
pointed Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
a Reason 3 O O
new Reason 3 O O
Israeli Reason 3 O O
study Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
found Reason 3 O O
an Reason 3 O O
81% Reason 3 O O
reduction Reason 3 O O
in Reason 3 O O
hospitalizations Reason 3 O O
among Reason 3 O O
people Reason 3 O O
65 Reason 3 O O
and Reason 3 O O
older Reason 3 O O
who Reason 3 O O
had Reason 3 O O
received Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
bivalent Reason 3 O O
booster, Reason 3 O O
compared Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
people Reason 3 O O
who'd Reason 3 O O
gotten Reason 3 O O
at Reason 3 O O
least Reason 3 O O
two Reason 3 O O
vaccinations Reason 3 O O
but Reason 3 O O
not Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
new Reason 3 O O
vaccine. Reason 3 O O
"I Reason 3 O O
keep Reason 3 O O
pushing Reason 3 O O
people Reason 3 O O
at Reason 3 O O
high Reason 3 O O
risk Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
be Reason 3 O O
at Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
forefront Reason 3 O O
of Reason 3 O O
folks Reason 3 O O
getting Reason 3 O O
this Reason 3 O O
booster Reason 3 O O
vaccine," Reason 3 O O
Schaffner Reason 3 O O
said. Reason 3 O O
"And Reason 3 O O
it's Reason 3 O O
not Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
I'm Reason 3 O O
going Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
tell Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
other Reason 3 O O
folks Reason 3 O O
they Reason 3 O O
don't Reason 3 O O
have Reason 3 O O
to. Reason 3 O O
I'm Reason 3 O O
just Reason 3 O O
going Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
keep Reason 3 O O
emphasizing Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
this Reason 3 O O
vaccine Reason 3 O O
is Reason 3 O O
most Reason 3 O O
important Reason 3 O O
for Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
people Reason 3 O O
who Reason 3 O O
are Reason 3 O O
at Reason 3 O O
high Reason 3 O O
risk." Reason 3 O O
In Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
meantime, Reason 3 O O
vaccine Reason 3 O O
development Reason 3 O O
efforts Reason 3 O O
need Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
shift Reason 3 O O
toward Reason 3 O O
preventing Reason 3 O O
infection Reason 3 O O
with Reason 3 O O
COVID-19 Reason 3 O O
in Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
first Reason 3 O O
place, Reason 3 O O
Poland Reason 3 O O
argues. Reason 3 O O
For Reason 3 O O
example, Reason 3 O O
a Reason 3 O O
nasal Reason 3 O O
vaccine Reason 3 O O
could Reason 3 O O
be Reason 3 O O
a Reason 3 O O
breakthrough. Reason 3 O O
"You Reason 3 O O
develop Reason 3 O O
an Reason 3 O O
antibody Reason 3 O O
in Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
nose Reason 3 O O
and Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
mouth Reason 3 O O
so Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
portal Reason 3 O O
of Reason 3 O O
entry, Reason 3 O O
how Reason 3 O O
we Reason 3 O O
actually Reason 3 O O
get Reason 3 O O
infected Reason 3 O O
with Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
virus Reason 3 O O
by Reason 3 O O
breathing Reason 3 O O
it Reason 3 O O
in, Reason 3 O O
we've Reason 3 O O
neutralized Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
virus Reason 3 O O
right Reason 3 O O
at Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
portal Reason 3 O O
of Reason 3 O O
entry," Reason 3 O O
Poland Reason 3 O O
said. Reason 3 O O
Better Reason 3 O O
vaccines Reason 3 O O
are Reason 3 O O
crucial Reason 3 O O
because Reason 3 O O
COVID-19 Reason 3 O O
has Reason 3 O O
mutated Reason 3 O O
in Reason 3 O O
ways Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
have Reason 3 O O
made Reason 3 O O
monoclonal Reason 3 O O
antibody Reason 3 O O
treatment Reason 3 O O
ineffective, Reason 3 O O
Poland Reason 3 O O
explained. Reason 3 O O
The Reason 3 O O
only Reason 3 O O
options Reason 3 O O
for Reason 3 O O
treating Reason 3 O O
COVID-19 Reason 3 O O
now Reason 3 O O
are Reason 3 O O
antiviral Reason 3 O O
drugs Reason 3 O O
like Reason 3 O O
Paxlovid, Reason 3 O O
remdesivir Reason 3 O O
and Reason 3 O O
molnupiravir, Reason 3 O O
Poland Reason 3 O O
said. Reason 3 O O
"Many Reason 3 O O
of Reason 3 O O
us Reason 3 O O
are Reason 3 O O
just Reason 3 O O
holding Reason 3 O O
our Reason 3 O O
breath," Reason 3 O O
Poland Reason 3 O O
said. Reason 3 O O
"Are Reason 3 O O
we Reason 3 O O
going Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
see Reason 3 O O
new Reason 3 O O
variants Reason 3 O O
develop Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
are Reason 3 O O
resistant Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
these Reason 3 O O
antivirals? Reason 3 O O
Once Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
happens, Reason 3 O O
we Reason 3 O O
are Reason 3 O O
in Reason 3 O O
a Reason 3 O O
world Reason 3 O O
of Reason 3 O O
hurt." Reason 3 O O
Was Reason 3 O O
data Reason 3 O O
withheld? Reason 3 O O
In Reason 3 O O
June Reason 3 O O
2022, Reason 3 O O
Pfizer Reason 3 O O
and Reason 3 O O
Moderna Reason 3 O O
researchers Reason 3 O O
presented Reason 3 O O

the Reason 3 O O
bivalent Reason 3 O O

to Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
FDA's Reason 3 O O
advisory Reason 3 O O
committee, Reason 3 O O
Offit Reason 3 O O
wrote Reason 3 O O
in Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
NEJM Reason 3 O O
commentary. Reason 3 O O
"The Reason 3 O O
results Reason 3 O O
were Reason 3 O O
underwhelming," Reason 3 O O
Offit Reason 3 O O
wrote, Reason 3 O O
noting Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
bivalent Reason 3 O O
boosters Reason 3 O O
prompted Reason 3 O O
antibody Reason 3 O O
levels Reason 3 O O
against Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
BA.1 Reason 3 O O
variant Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O
were Reason 3 O O
only Reason 3 O O
50% Reason 3 O O

higher Reason 3 O O
than Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O

Despite Reason 3 O O
this, Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
FDA Reason 3 O O
and Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
CDC Reason 3 O O
pursued Reason 3 O O
a Reason 3 O O

in Reason 3 O O

say Reason 3 O O
that Reason 3 O O

when Reason 3 O O
asked Reason 3 O O

evaluate Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O
bivalent Reason 3 O O

in Reason 3 O O
June Reason 3 O O
and Reason 3 O O
September. Reason 3 O O

than Reason 3 O O
the Reason 3 O O

due Reason 3 O O
to Reason 3 O O
limitations Reason 3 O O

However, Reason 3 O O
they Reason 3 O O

it Reason 3 O O
still Reason 3 O O
should Reason 3 O O

been Reason 3 O O
