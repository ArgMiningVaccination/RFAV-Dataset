They are not medical doctors (MD's). Doctors of Traditional Naturopathy (ND's) are trained in subjects such as anatomy, physiology, counseling, dietary evaluations, nutrition, herbology, acupressure, homeopathy, iridology, exercise therapy, hydrotherapy, oxygen therapy, thermal therapy, and more. They personalize the healing modality to the needs of the individual patient. Certainly anybody who is sick does not need any therapy or treatment would harm him or her. As prescription medication has such a potential to make a well man sick, many wonder how it can be expected to make a sick man well. Traditional Naturopathy embraces only therapies or procedures which are designed to enhance healing and produce wellness. The human body is created with the capacity to heal itself and to maintain homeostasis (balance). There is a healing power in nature and this principal is the basis for all of naturopathy. Naturopathy is a system designed to work in harmony with nature, in the restoration and support for the inherent natural healing systems of the body. Allopathic doctors seek to treat the joint pain by reducing the joint pain. This can be done with the use of painkillers, nerve blockers or any number of procedures which suppress the symptoms. Doctors of Traditional Naturopathy are committed to removing the joint pain by finding and removing the cause. The Doctor of Traditional Naturopathy are aware that a person can have a physical or emotional illness. The chosen therapy is determined by what kind of problem the person is experiencing. You cannot be well or healthy if you have a psychological problem even if you appear perfectly fit. Doctors of Traditional Naturopathy use various counseling, stress management and biofeedback techniques for those experiencing emotional or behavioral problems. Doctors of Traditional Naturopathy are teachers and healers, working with clients to acheive a healthy balance to the body. The naturopathic philosophy places the responsibility of healing with the individual. Man maintains good health and the doctor advises him how to. For example, a deficiency, is the result of an imbalance in the body. The client mismanaged the body and it's response is illness. ND's evaluate the condition and advise clients what's needed for balance and heal the client. Doctors of Traditional Naturopathy are preventive medicine specialists. Prevention of disease is accomplished through education and encouraging good life habits that support health and prevent disease. The primary goals of the Doctor of Traditional Naturopathy are to establish and maintain optimum health and to promote wellness. Health is the state of optimal well-being. The Doctors of Traditional Naturopathy strive to elevate the client's state of health and wellness by analyzing each aspect of the controllable factors which determine the state of health, those being diet, exercise, thinking, sleep and posture.
