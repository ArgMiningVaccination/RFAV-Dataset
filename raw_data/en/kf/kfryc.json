A curandero is a specialist in traditional medicine whose practice can either contrast with or supplement that of a practitioner of Western medicine. A curandero is claimed to administer shamanistic and spiritistic remedies for mental, emotional, physical and spiritual illnesses. Some curanderos, such as Don Pedrito, the Healer of Los Olmos, make use of simple herbs, waters, or mud to allegedly effect their cures. Others add Catholic elements, such as holy water and pictures of saints; San Martin de Porres for example is heavily employed within Peruvian curanderismo. The use of Catholic prayers and other borrowings and lendings is often found alongside native religious elements. Many curanderos emphasize their native spirituality in healing while being practicing Catholics. Still others, such as Maria Sabina, employ hallucinogenic media. Most of the concepts related to curanderismo are words in Spanish language, often with Medieval, vernacular definitions.", "sitename": "Wikiwand", "date": "2023-08-31", "cleaned_text": "Latin America and the United States / From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Dear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions: Can you list the top facts and stats about Curandero?
