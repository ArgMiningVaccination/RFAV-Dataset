Is this medicinal plant for you?", "sitename": "SelfDecode Supplements", "date": "2019-11-21", "cleaned_text": "a medicinal herb traditionally used to stimulate the immune system. Research has shown it may boost immune function, reduce inflammation, and even help with chemotherapy. Read on to discover the potential health benefits and adverse effects associated with this herb. What Is Cat's Claw? Cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa) is a medicinal plant that grows in the Amazonian rainforest and other tropical areas in Central and South America. The use of the herb dates back to the Inca civilization. Indigenous cultures of South America used cat's claw for inflammation, cancer, viral infections, ulcers, and to stimulate the immune system [ [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25495394), [2](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/catclaw)]. It gets its name from its thorns, which resemble the claws of cats. Cat's claw can refer to Uncaria tomentosa and Uncaria guianensis. Most commercial preparations such as teas, tablets, and capsules contain U. tomentosa [ [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10075119), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15162359), [2](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/catclaw)]. The two different types of cat's claw contain different active compounds and have different medicinal properties. Uncaria tomentosa contains more pentacyclic oxindole [ [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10075119), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15162359)]. TOAs act on the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), whereas POAs affect the immune system [ [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10328636)]. TOAs cancel out the effects of POAs. Therefore it is important when purchasing and consuming cat's claw extracts to be sure that they have been tested for TOA and POA levels [ [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10328636)]. Differences between the two types are conveyed in the chemical structure. Pentacyclic alkaloids are found in the vine bark while tetracyclic alkaloids are found in the leaves and stem of the plant [ [6](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031942275851284), [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/947783)]. Main Beneficial Compounds of Cat's Claw Cat's claw is rich in three major groups of chemical compounds: alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids [ [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15162359)]. Specific [cat's](https://selfdecode.com/gene/CAT/?utm_source=seo&utm_medium=selfhacked&utm_campaign=id00002) claw include: - Mitraphylline: an alkaloid usually found in older leaves. It has potential anticancer effects, causing cell death in sarcoma and breast cancer cells [ [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15162359), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19724995)]. - Rhynchophylline: an alkaloid isolated from the bark. It may help with convulsions, lightheadedness, numbness, and hypertension [ [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23296316), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20736055)]. - Isopteropodine: an alkaloid isolated from the leaves. It has antimicrobial properties against (Gram-positive) bacteria [ [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23296316), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16042336)]. - Uncarine (C, D, and E): a family of alkaloids found in the leaves. They have potential anti-cancer properties, inducing cell death in leukemia cells [ [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15162359), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16445836)]. - Hirsutine: an alkaloid found in the young leaves. It has antihypertensive properties, relaxing blood vessels and reducing overall blood pressure [ [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15162359), [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409389/)]. - Uncaric acid: a triterpene extracted from the bark. It may be effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv strain) [ [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2213029), [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703769/)]. - Quinovic acid: an acid triterpene compound extracted the bark. It may reduce [heart rate](https://selfhacked.com/blog/resting-heart-rate/)[ [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22296654), [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25920261)]. - Quinic acid has antioxidant properties, enhances DNA repair, and has neuroprotective effects in the brain [ [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15589483), [19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22950425), [20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18844285)]. - Procyanidins: a flavonoid (phenolic compounds found in the leaves, stems, bark, and wood of U. tomentosa). It has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties [ [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23195487), [22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5384175/)]. Mechanisms of [TNF](https://selfhacked.com/blog/supplements-lifestyle-factors-influence-tnf-interleukin-6-il-6/)- and [NF-B](https://selfhacked.com/blog/nuclear-factor-kappa-b/)[ [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19995599), [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12120814)]. - Blocks the release of [iNos](https://selfdecode.com/gene/nos2/?utm_source=seo&utm_medium=selfhacked&utm_campaign=id00002), an enzyme that creates free radicals as part of the immune response [ [26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4877453/)]. - Blocks the release of COX-1 and [COX-2](https://selfhacked.com/blog/cox2-natural-cox2-inhibitors/), enzymes that play crucial roles in inflammation and [pain](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/23-ways-to-combat-pain-naturally-by-increasing-your-opioids/)[ [27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12065162/), [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279801/)]. Health Benefits Possibly Effective for: Arthritis Cat's claw's anti-inflammatory effects have been commonly used to treat both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [ [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4474424/)]. In a clinical trial on 40 rheumatoid arthritis patients, cat's claw combined with conventional treatments (sulfasalazine/hydroxychloroquine) reduced tender and painful joints [ [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11950006)]. In another trial of 45 people with knee osteoarthritis, one week of cat's claw reduced pain associated with activity. In another trial on 95 people, a dietary supplement with 300 mg cat's claw and 1500 mg maca improved joint pain, stiffness, and function as effectively as the more common supplement glucosamine sulfate [ [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11603848/)]. Cat's claw extract increased [IGF-1](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/the-truth-about-igf-1-top-10-benefits-and-potential-drawbacks/) levels in human cartilage cells, which might help to maintain cartilage health and prevent cartilage breakdown. In animal and cell-based studies, cat's claw blocked [IL-1](http://selfhacked.com/blog/interleukin-1/) and other inflammatory molecules that suppress IGF-1 production [ [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1456997/), [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11606449), [34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11352241)]. The different compounds in cat's claw supposedly act together to achieve these effects [ [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4474424/)]. Mitraphylline blocks the release of inflammatory molecules such as IL-1, [IL-4](https://selfdecode.com/gene/il4/?utm_source=seo&utm_medium=selfhacked&utm_campaign=id00002), and [IL-17](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/th17/), and [TNF-alpha](http://selfhacked.com/blog/supplements-lifestyle-factors-influence-tnf-interleukin-6-il-6/) [ [35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22846434)]. Other pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids cause the release of a currently unidentified immune regulating factors that may reduce arthritic joint pain [ [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11804547), [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11950006)]. Quinic acid decreases inflammatory molecules like NF-B [ [18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15589483), [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12120814), [37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3011108/)]. Although limited, the existing evidence suggests that cat's claw may help with the symptoms of both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. You may discuss with your doctor if it could be useful as an adjuvant therapy in your case. Never take cat's claw in place of what your doctor recommends or prescribes for arthritis. Insufficient Evidence for: 1) Viral Infections In a study of 31 volunteers with [cold](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/12-reasons-embrace-cold/) sores (herpes labialis), cat's claw was more effective in reducing symptoms such as swelling, skin reddening, and pain compared to prescription antiviral drug Acyclovir [ [38](http://www.dst.uff.br/revista22-2-2010/1%20-%20Uncaria.pdf)]. In a cell-based study, cat's claw extract prevented the spread of the herpes virus by preventing it from attaching to cells [ [39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=cat%27s+claw%2C+herpes)]. In another trial on 261 people, immunostimulation with a natural product containing cat's claw and other herbal extracts reduced the incidence of anal warts (caused by infections with the human papillomavirus) after a surgical procedure [ [40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19548899)]. Cat's claw also prevented immune cells from being infected with dengue virus and reduced inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha [ [41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279801)]. Although the results are promising, two clinical trials and some animal and cell-based research cannot be considered sufficient evidence to support the use of cat's claw for viral infections. Further clinical research is needed. 2) Add-On to Anticancer Therapy In a study of 40 breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, 300 mg cat's claw extract prevented a decrease in [white blood cells](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/how-to-increase-and-decrease-white-blood-cells/) (neutropenia) and repaired DNA damage. However, the same dose was ineffective in another trial on 43 people with colorectal cancer [ [42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395261/), [43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3159308/)]. In a clinical trial on 51 people with advanced cancer, cat's claw reduced fatigue and improved quality of life [ [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25495394)]. In rats who received chemotherapy, cat's claw increased white blood cell count and helped repair damaged DNA [ [44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10839217/)]. Cat's claw also stimulates the growth of progenitor cells in mice, which can replace damaged cells and reduce the damaging effects of chemotherapy [ [45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771655)]. Again, 3 clinical trials (with mixed results) and some animal research are insufficient to claim that cat's claw may help fight cancer. Larger, more robust clinical trials are needed. 3) Stomach and Gut Inflammation Cat's claw can cleanse the digestive tract and is claimed to help treat inflammatory gut disorders including [ [46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11363206)]: [Crohn's disease](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/ibd-ulcerative-colitis-crohn-genetics-lifestyle-stress-infections/) [Colitis](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/ibd-ulcerative-colitis-crohn-genetics-lifestyle-stress-infections/) - Gastritis - Diverticulitis - Stomach ulcers - \"Leaky gut\" In a clinical trial on 50 people with gum inflammation, a gel with cat's claw was as effective as an antifungal (miconazole) at reducing the counts of infectious yeasts [ [47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24908596)]. Cat's claw protected against stomach inflammation in rats and prevented [TNF-](http://selfhacked.com/blog/supplements-lifestyle-factors-influence-tnf-interleukin-6-il-6/) production and cell death [ [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12120814)]. Bacterial toxins also cause the release of inflammatory molecules like [ NF-B](https://selfhacked.com/blog/nuclear-factor-kappa-b/) and TNF-. Cat's claw blocked the release of these inflammatory molecules in mice [ [48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10878378)]. Inflammation of the gut is also caused by toxic free radicals (peroxynitrite). Cat's claw broke down free radicals and reduced cell death caused by gut bacterial toxins [ [49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9882039)]. While only a small trial investigated cat's claw for gum inflammation, its effects on inflammation of the digestive system have only been tested in animals. Further clinical research is required to confirm these preliminary findings. 4) Boosting the Immune System Cat's claw may enhance the immune system by increasing the levels of key immune cells (T helper and B cells) and the activity of [granulocytes](https://labs.selfdecode.com/blog/granulocytes/) [ [50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26434713), [51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21656603), [52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9933988), [53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17342600)]. In a small trial on 23 healthy volunteers, a cat's claw extract enhanced the immune effects of a vaccine against pneumococcal infections. The extract increased the relative abundance of immune cells (lymphocytes) and prolonged the antibody titer response of the vaccine [ [54](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515716)]. Again, only a small clinical trial and some animal and cell-based research have investigated this potential benefit of cat's claw. More clinical trials on larger populations are warranted. 5) High Blood Pressure Two different traditional Chinese medicines with cat's claw and other herbs (Jiangzhuo Qinggan and Qian Yang He Ji) lowered blood pressure in clinical trials on almost 300 people. However, another remedy combining cat's claw and potato orchid (Gastrodia) was ineffective and used as the negative control in another trial on 79 people [ [55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23336505), [56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23188130), [57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21053621)]. Cat's claw contains a compound called hirsutine that reduces blood pressure. It acts as a [calcium](https://supplements.selfdecode.com/blog/calcium-101/) channel blocker in the heart and blood vessels, which slows down the heart rate and relaxes the blood vessels [ [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15162359), [13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4409389/), [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1798789)]. Because the only clinical trials tested herbal mixes containing cat's claw and other extracts (with mixed results), we cannot establish if the effects observed were due to this specific ingredient, More clinical trials using cat's claw alone are needed to shed some light on this potential use. Animal and Cell Research (Lack of Evidence) No clinical evidence supports the use of cat's claw for any of the conditions listed in this section. Below is a summary of the existing animal and cell-based research, which should guide further investigational efforts. However, the studies should not be interpreted as supportive of any health benefit. Diabetes Cat's claw has been traditionally used to treat diabetes [ [59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15070175)]. Its extract reduced blood sugar levels and inflammation and prevented diabetes in mice whose [insulin](https://selfhacked.com/blog/insulin-101/)-releasing cells (beta-cells) were damaged [ [60](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21718770)]. Protecting Red Blood Cells Cat's claw protected red blood cells (RBCs) from damage due to toxins and reduced [oxidative stress](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/oxidative-stress-101/). It also prevented cell death and [oxidative stress](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/oxidative-stress-101/) RBCs exposed Procyanidins claw scavenged and remove oxidative radicals in cell-based studies [ [64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15649515)]. Cat's claw also blocked the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF- and prevented cell death [ [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12120814)]. Side Effects and Precautions, Limitations & Dosage This list does not cover all possible side effects. Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any other side effects. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. In the US, you may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or at [www.fda.gov/medwatch](http://www.fda.gov/medwatch). In Canada, you may report side effects to Health Canada at 1-866-234-2345. Cat's claw is generally considered safe. The main side effects reported in clinical trials were usually mild and included [ [42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395261/), [65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15942912)]: - Dizziness - Upset stomach - Skin rash - Nausea - Diarrhea Pregnant women should avoid using cat's claw because of the herb's potential to cause abortion [ [2](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/catclaw)]. Because cat's claw seems to enhance the immune response by increasing the activity of immune cells, this supplement may increase the symptoms of autoimmune disorders. People with autoimmune conditions should be especially cautious with cat's claw and never take it without discussing it with their doctors [ [66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15809195)]. Cat's claw decreased molecules that activate clotting ( [IL-1](http://selfhacked.com/blog/interleukin-1/), 1, 4, 17, and [ TNF](https://selfhacked.com/blog/supplements-lifestyle-factors-influence-tnf-interleukin-6-il-6/)-). People with blood clotting disorders or on blood thinners should avoid cat's claw to reduce the risk of bleeding and bruising [ [35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22846434), [41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279801)]. When cat's claw was used in combination with some HIV treatments like protease inhibitors (atazanavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir), it increased their toxicity [ [67](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18712519)]. Limitations Few high-quality clinical trials with cat's claw have been conducted in humans. More studies are needed to confirm its health benefits. Cat's claw was sometimes tested as part of multi-herbal complexes, making its specific contribution to the effects observed difficult to estimate. Dosage Because cat's claw is not approved by the FDA for any conditions, there is no official dose. Users and supplement manufacturers have established unofficial doses based on trial and error. Discuss with your doctor if cat's claw may be useful in your case and which dose you should take. Clinical trials have used between 80 - 350 mg of cat's claw extract. These extracts usually contained a certain amount of pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids, rather than tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids.
