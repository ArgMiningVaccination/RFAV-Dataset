Now? They may have the same healer on speed dial and salt lamps in every room of their recently smudged abode. These types of practices have been considered unconventional, or \"woo-woo,\" in the modern Western era, due to the lack of scientific evidence backing their validity. Yet, over the last decade or so, rituals like reiki and [sound bathing](https://www.shondaland.com/live/body/a29995794/the-healing-power-of-sound-baths/) have traveled from the fringes into the mainstream where they are widely accepted \u2014 even touted \u2014 means to well-being, right up there with annual physicals and weekly spin classes. The overarching reason for this, experts suspect, is that \"people are becoming increasingly disillusioned with institutions like [religion](https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/books/a30628096/astrologer-chani-nicholas-interview/), medicine, and government, and are taking ownership of their physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being apart from these prescribed systems,\" says [ Mary Kearns](http://www.yourstellarself.com), Ph.D., a Virginia-based developmental psychologist and reiki master teacher. Not surprisingly, millennials are a driving force behind this fringe movement becoming the norm. \"They're a large demographic with a desire to change the things that haven't been working,\" says Kearns. Much like how we're constantly learning about new ways to optimize the world, younger generations are using alternative practices, a la astrology and crystals, to learn about and optimize themselves. \"Instead of relying on what others recommend for them, they're feeling empowered to be their own healers and craft a unique plan of action that feels right to them,\" says crystal expert Heather Askinosie, co-founder of [ Energy Muse](http://www.energymuse.com) and author of [ CRYSTAL365](https://www.amazon.com/CRYSTAL365-Crystals-Everyday-Health-Balance/dp/1401958265/). \"With that sense of empowerment comes a comfortability with doing things outside the box, or 'woo-woo.'\" We're also using the woo to fill some pretty cavernous emotional and spiritual voids that are seemingly ignored by the conventional institutions coveted by mainstream culture. We're ditching traditional religion, but still need some kind of spiritual belief to hang onto The number of people who consider themselves \"spiritual but not religious\" is on the rise, with [ 26 percent](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/10/17/in-u-s-decline-of-christianity-continues-at-rapid-pace/) of Americans now unaffiliated with any particular religion (up from 17 percent in 2009). \"There's a desire for the comfort of a greater force than us, but younger generations are huge on inclusivity and don't want to participate in any institution that shuns people for being queer or not fitting into a certain box,\" says Ophira Edut, New York-based astrologer of the [ AstroTwins](http://www.astrostyle.com). In many cases, organized religious institutions behave in ways that are in opposition to the teachings they purportedly represent. Instead, we're leaning on mystical pillars like astrology, numerology, and tarot cards for a sense of identity and stability. \"We don't want to be told who we are, but we do want guidance and a template to follow,\" says Edut. These modalities are a modern form of validation that isn't didactic or deterministic. We're not so much abandoning societal structures, though \u2014 religion, marriage, nine-to-five jobs \u2014 as we are revamping them. Younger generations don't want organized religions, but they want organized events and gatherings. They might be in LGBTQ relationships, but they still want traditional weddings. They might freelance, but they still invest time and energy into their work because they want financial security. \"What it ultimately comes down to is we still want to belong to a community,\" says [ Elisa Robyn](http://www.elisarobyn.com), Ph.D., a Colorado-based psychologist and trained astrologer. Having a strong sense of belonging not only [ boosts happiness](https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/news/news-articles/2016/05/happiness-effect-down-to-sense-of-belonging-study-shows) but [ increases resilience](https://med.stanford.edu/psychiatry/special-initiatives/belonging.html), even in the face of [ stress and adversity](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/is-having-a-sense-of-belonging-important). We're looking for a sense of control amongst the endless chaos Feelings of stress, worry, and anger are [ highest among Americans](https://news.gallup.com/poll/249098/americans-stress-worry-anger-intensified-2018.aspx) between the ages of 15 and 49 \u2014 and no wonder, considering the state of, well, everything. Take climate change, where [ nearly half of US adults](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/02/climate-change) age 18-34 say the [stress they feel](https://www.shondaland.com/live/body/a30470585/recognizing-eco-anxiety-what-it-is-and-ways-you-might-be-affected/) about global warming affects their daily lives. \"People typically gravitate toward alternative practices when the world around them becomes confusing, overwhelming, or frightening,\" says Robyn. \"We all want and need comfort when we're frightened.\" Which is practically all the time, now that social media and algorithmic news feeds give us 24/7 access to every tragedy, outbreak, and dismal prediction for the future. \"Social media is overwhelming, and often in a negative sense, convincing people there's little to trust in the world, and at the same time, that everyone else is happier, richer, and more fulfilled than we are,\" says Robyn. \"So we're simultaneously bathing in fear, guilt, and longing.\" Because of the endless toxicity, we're turning to modalities like reiki and astrology to heal emotional wounds and build resiliency. \"People want comfort, a sense that the present makes sense, the future will be better, and that they're making the right choices,\" says Robyn. \"The same is true for conversations with psychics,\" she adds. \"People need comfort in a climate of fear.\" We're craving a kind of connection that technology can't provide People are realizing that you can \"have it all,\" yet still feel unfulfilled \u2014 no matter how much you accomplish, it's still not enough to satisfy that relentless emotional void you carry around with you like an out-of-fashion clutch. The primary culprit? Our penchant for looking to external validation to satisfy us, quantifying our existence on fleeting premises like accomplishments, status, followers, and likes. \"We're unsatisfied after we've gotten the fancy promotion, eaten at the best restaurant, and hit up the trendy fitness class because it's not about the work, the money, the achieving,\" says [ Kelsey J. Patel](http://www.kelseyjpatel.com), Los Angeles-based reiki master and author of the upcoming book [ Burning Bright](http://www.kelseyjpatel.com/book). \"It's about something deeper.\" The amount of information we're bombarded with on the regular is astronomical, as is the number of tasks we're expected to get done in a day. The constant stress is taking its toll, so much so that, compared to previous generations, [ millennials are seeing their physical and mental health decline faster as they age](https://www.bcbs.com/the-health-of-america/reports/how-millennials-current-and-future-health-could-affect-our-economy). Burnout has even been designated an \"occupational phenomenon\" by the [ World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/). \"Many younger people aren't feeling a sense of vibrancy \u2014 they feel like they're surviving, and that's not okay,\" says Patel. But we're looking for ways beyond just diet and exercise to combat stress \u2014 specifically, that skew toward the more nurturing side of the spectrum, as 59 percent of adults say they could have used more emotional support than they received in the last year, according to the [ American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/images/stress-america-2019_tcm7-264533.pdf). \"At our core, we're searching for healing because we're lacking connection \u2014 to ourselves, to others, to something bigger than us,\" says Askinosie. \"These practices allow us to plug in and connect on a spiritual level so that we can heal and become whole again.\" How to start your own woo-woo wellness journey Since no one alternative practice is right for everyone, Robyn recommends starting with where you hurt \u2014 physically, emotionally, or both \u2014 and go with the treatments or rituals you're most drawn to from that vantage point. If you're feeling lost about who you are, a personality test might help you strengthen your sense of individuality. If the Sunday Scaries are now a daily occurrence, a morning tarot spread might better prepare you for the day ahead. If your ex just moved out, a smudging session might banish any lingering negative vibes from your orbit. \"Adopt the attitude of yourself as a curious observer and beta-tester, questioning everything before reaching a conclusion,\" Edut suggests. No matter where you choose to start, though, make sure it's with a practice or experience that makes you feel excited, then let the journey unfold from there. \"That's when you'll start connecting to what we call 'woo,'\" says Edut. \"Life becomes expansive and open, then the serendipities and coincidences start to speed up and flow. It's that quantum realm where you're aligned with the divine.\" Let the healing begin. Krissy Brady covers women's health and wellness. Get Shondaland "}
