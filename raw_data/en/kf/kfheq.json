In 2015, there were an estimated 438,000 deaths and 214 million clinical illnesses due to malaria infection , of which the majority were in sub-Saharan African children below five years of age. Amongst the five species that are known to infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe disease , mostly in children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite malaria control programs being operational for many years, malaria elimination in most endemic regions is far from being achieved. Vaccination is considered the most cost effective method of preventing infectious diseases. To date, there are no effective vaccines available for parasitic infections, despite the existence of strong evidence of acquired immunity in most parasitic infections studied. It is therefore highly likely that the addition of an effective tool such as a vaccine to the current malaria control strategy would have a strong positive impact on our ability to control this disease . In the first part of this thesis, we aim ed to investigate the vaccine efficacy as well as the cellular and humoral immunity of African paediatric volunteers vaccinated with the most clinically advanced malaria vaccine; the RTS, S/AS01. Meanwhile, novel vaccination and testing approaches are being pursued to improve or replace the recombinant subunit malaria vaccine approach to meet the goals formulated in the Malaria Vaccine Roadmap of WHO (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/malaria/ vaccine _roadmap/en ). These goals strategized that by 2030, licensed vaccines targeting Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax should encompass the following two objectives, for use by the international public health community: i) First, it should have a protective efficacy of at least 75 percent against clinical malaria and be suitable for administration to appropriate at-risk groups in malaria- xiiAcknowledgement endemic areas. ii) Secondly, it should reduce transmission of the parasite and thereby substantially reduce the incidence of human malaria infection; enable elimination in multiple settings and be suitable for administration in mass campaigns. Currently, the most promising candidate seems to be the whole malaria sporozoite approach, which is formed of cryopreserved, purified whole live-attenuated (either by irradiation or genetic attenuation) sporozoites. One of the novel tools used to analyze induced vaccine efficacy in sub-Saharan Africa experimentally vaccinated volunteers is controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Many CHMIs using infectious mosquito bites or purified sporozoites have been successfully conducted in the USA and Europe over many years, but this approach had not been employed in sub-Saharan Africa until 2012. The aim of the second part of this thesis was to describe the potential of using CHMI as a tool to accelerate malaria vaccine development in sub-Saharan Africa and to dissect malaria- specific immunity induced by CHMI based on our trial conducted in 2012 in Bagamoyo. Methods and findings In the first part of this thesis (Chapter 4 ), the aim was to investigate safety, efficacy, cellular and humoral immunity in RTS ,S/AS01 vaccinated Tanzanian paediatric populations . Adverse events were used to determine the safety of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in this age group (paper I), ELISA to measure the vaccine-induced CS-specific antibodies and Luminex to measure vaccine-induced cytokine responses (paper II and III). Furthermore, flow cytomet ry was used to investigate vaccine-induced cellular immune responses ( paper III). We also looked into the implications and practicalities of immunological sampling in the African paediatric population. We did community sensitization and collected blood samples from 400 children for immunological st udy (paper IV). We showed that in 6-12 week old infants, vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria 14 months after first vaccination was xiiiAcknowledgement 30.1% (95% CI, 23.6 to 36.1) in the intention- to-treat (ITT) and 31.3% (97.5% CI, 23.6 to 38.3) in the per-protocol (PP) population. Furthermore, the vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was 26.0% (95% CI, 7.4 to 48.6) and 36.6% (95% CI, 4.6 to 57.7) in the ITT and PP populations, respectively. The safety of the vaccine in terms of serious adverse events showed similar trends in both study groups. We identified two main RTS ,S/AS01 vaccine induced cellular immune mechanisms:- (i) T h1-related responses such as CS-specific IFN- g, GM-CSF and IL-15 are associated with protection and (ii) T h2-related responses mediated by CS-specific IL5 and RANTES are associated with increased odds of malaria. Moreover, antibody avidity alone did not predict protective efficacy in the current study. The induction of RTS, S/AS01 protective Th1 and pro-inflammatory responses was lower in infants compared to children; a scenario that might explain the lower efficacy observed in the infant cohort. Furthermore, w e also showed that immunology studies in the paediatric population can feasibly be conducted in African research institutions. In the second part of this thesis (Chapter 5), we conducted in 2012 the first CHMI using cryo-preserved purified non-attenuated sporozoites in Tanzanian adult volunteers with previous malaria exposure (paper V). In this study, the humoral and cellular immune responses elicited following CHMI were evaluated (paper VI and VII). We used adverse events to determine the safety of the CHMI model in malaria pre-expose d volunteers. We also used blood slide microscopy to define sporozoite infectivity rates Elispot analysis, single cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry and cell sorting followed by in vitro stimulation assays to investigate and define the affected innate and adaptive immune responses following CHMI (paper VIII). Our studies showed that: (i) CHMI is safe, tolerable and infective when used in malaria endemic regions, (ii) a single dose of intradermal sporozoite ( PfSPZ) challenge elicited long- lived merozoite-opsonizing antibodies and long-lasting innate and innate-like lymphocyte populations, (iii) When we compared Dutch (malaria na\u00efve) and Tanzanian xivAcknowledgement (malaria exposed) subjects undergoing the same challenge study, Dutch subjects responded differently to PfSPZ challenge compared to Tanzanian (malaria pre-exposed) subjects. Conclusion Substantial investment in research and development is needed to develop a highly efficacious malaria vaccine. To date, the recombinant subunit vaccines are yet to give the desired levels of protection for malaria elimination but seem to prevent malaria disease in high transmission settings . Large scale manufacturing, storage and distribution of live whole malaria sporozoite-based vaccines for mass administration need further development. So far, data generated from the PfSPZ vaccine trials conducted in the USA, Europe and in African research institutions imply that malaria naive individuals respond better to malaria vaccines than malaria pre-exposed individuals. The question remains to be, \"what exactly constitutes the reason for lack of durable protection against malaria infection in endemic areas?\" The most important factor in accelerating future vaccine development is a better understanding of the biology and nature of acquired immunity, which will lead to improved vaccine design. We have established the foundation for using CHMI to assess efficacy of new interventions against malaria and to study the mechanisms of the lack of protection conferred by different malaria vaccines in endemic settings. This study has open ed new doors in the field of malaria intervention , whereby malaria vaccine and drug efficacy can be easily tested using CHMI in the target population. xvChapter 1: Introduction CHAPTER 1 : Introduction xviChapter 1: Introduction 1.1. Malaria: overview 1.1.1. The parasites Malaria infection is caused by intracellular organisms that belong to the genus Plasmodium in the Phylum Apicomplexa within the Protista kingdom. The Phylum Apicomplexa is estimated to consist of over 5,000 species, many of which are responsible for causing a wide range of serious diseases in humans, livestock, wild animals and invertebrates (Gubbels and Duraisingh, 2012; Levine, 1988). The genus Plasmodium consists of more than 100 species, of which four species have long been recognized to infect humans and an additional species, known to naturally infect macaques, has recently also been reported to infect humans (Knowles and Gupta; White, 2008). Malaria is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female anopheline mosquitoes. Out of over 400 anopheline species that are known to date, only forty are considered to be dominant vector species (Sinka et al., 2012). The prevalence of malaria species of public health importance varies worldwide and is linked to the geographical and environmental preferences of the parasite (Figure 1 ) (Blanford et al., 2013). Figure 1: Global distribution of P. falciparum and P. vivax by countries . (Feachem et al., 2009) Page 1 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction Below we highlight the characteristics of the five malaria species known to infect homo- sapiens. 1.1.1.1. Plasmodium falciparum P. falciparum is found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, and is known to be the principal cause of malaria-related morbidity and mortality. Pregnant women, children and immunocompromized individuals constitute the most vulnerable population, with over half a million deaths in Africa alone estimated to be caused by P. falciparum infection in children under five (WHO, 2015). The severity of P. falciparum infection is mainly due to its ability to multiply in the red blood cells (RBCs) every 48 hours during its asexual blood stage cycle. Destruction of RBCs leads to significant RBC loss and contributes to anaemia, which is often observed in chronically infected persons . P. falciparum infection of the RBC leads to novel, parasite-encoded protein expression on the surface of infected RBCs (iRBCs) . These surface expressed proteins, such as the Var gene encoded proteins, enable P. falciparum to adhere to endothelial cells in small vasculature (sequestration), hence creating chances for physically obstructing small blood vessels in the brain and kidneys. The iRBCs rosetting in the brain may result in cerebral malaria, a complication that may lead to mental retardation or death (Cooke et al., 2000; Idro et al., 2010). 1.1.1.2. P. vivax P. vivax is the most prevalent human malaria parasite outside of Africa, due to its adaptation to relatively cooler climate zones . Although P.vivax contributes to widespread morbidity in endemic areas , P.vivax infection is rarely severe or fatal (Howes et al., 2016; White., 2011a). P. vivax is well known for its ability to develop dormant stages in the liver that can be reactivated . Reactivated P. vivax can cause asexual blood stage infections several months or years after the primary infectious mosquito bite. Currently, only Page 2 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction Primaquine is known to be an effective treatment against P. vivax dormant liver stage forms, with the disadvantage that it requires 14 days of consistent drug adherence with significant side effects in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) patients (Ashley et al., 2014; John et al., 2012; White, 2011b). P. vivax control is challenging due to factors such as its ability to be transmitted by a broad range of anopheline vectors species, the early biting behavior of mosquitoes that transmit the parasite, the emergence of gametocytes stages before onset of illness and the difficulty of diagnosing asexual blood stage infection due to low parasitemia (Bassat et al., 2016). 1.1.1.3. P. ovale P. ovale is a relatively rare species, mostly found in West-Africa and the Pacific islands. P. ovale exhibits Sch\u00fcffner's dots and infected erythrocytes can be normal or slightly enlarged; a characteristic feature that is also shared by P. vivax, making it difficult to distinguish the two specie s microscopically (Collins and Jeffery, 2005a) . Similar to P.vivax , P.ovale can form a latent liver stage called hypnozoite, which makes the parasite capable of causing disease several months or years after primary infection (Collins and Jeffery, 2005b; Markus, 2011). Furthermore, P. ovale tends to present a low parasite burden and mild clinical symptoms, making routine diagnosis challenging. Recently, two P. ovale sub- species, classic ( ( P.ovale wallikeri ) have been characterized (Sutherland et al., 2010) . In Africa, the higher prevalence of P. ovale relative to P. vivax could be explained by the ability of P. ovale to infect populations carrying the null Duffy blood group, which provides natural resistance to P. vivax (Collins and Jeffery, 2005b). 1.1.1.4. P. malariae P. malariae is found in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Indonesia and in the Western Pacific Islands (Collins and Jeffery, 2005a). Compared to the other human malaria parasite Page 3 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction species, P. malariae has a distinct asexual blood stage life cycle that lasts for three days . Although P. malariae does not cause complicated malaria at the beginning, it is known that if untreated, P. malariae patients have higher risk of developing a life-long, chronic infection that may result in serious complications such as nephrotic syndrom e (Badiane et al., 2014). In most cases P. malariae distributions have been found to coincide with that of P. falciparum . In malaria-endemic Africa, mixed infections of P. malariae and P. falciparum are common. However, to reveal the presence of low-parasitemia P. malariae within mixed infections, molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are required (Collins and Jeffery, 2007) . 1.1.1.5. P. knowlesi P. knowlesi has recently been reported to be a significant cause of zoonotic malaria, particularly in Malaysia. P. knowlesi is abundant in Southeast Asia as a natural pathogen of long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques. Despite the fact knowlesi morphologically resembles P.falciparum and P. malariae, P.knowlesi has a short asexual blood stage cycle of approximately 24 hours, unlike P. falciparum and P . malariae which requires 48 h ours to complete their asexual blood stage cycle . Importantly, P.knowlesi infections can progress rapidly from uncomplicated to severe presentations across age groups (Vythilingam et al., 2016 ; Wesolowski et al., 2015). 1.1.2. Epidemiology of P. falciparum malaria P. falciparum is a major cause of malaria that impacts most heavily in children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and South America. By 2015, an estimate of 214 million (range: 149-303 million) cases of malaria have been reported to cause about 438 000 deaths (range: 236 000-635 000), predominantly in African children younger tha n five years old (WHO, 2015). For the past decades, P. falciparum malaria has become one Page 4 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction of the most studied diseases globally. P. falciparum was endemic in Southern Europe and North America until the beginning of the 20th century. Comprehensive surveillance and treatment programs, including the use of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for vector control has since lead to the elimination of malaria in these regions. To date, the importance of malaria remains prominent on a global scale, despite the recent decline in malaria cases (Berberian, 1948; Meshnick and Dobson, 2001). Although malaria mortality rates amongst children have declined by over 50% within the past decade, the WHO 2014 world malaria report indicated that P. falciparum malaria was still responsible for about 10% of Africa's entire disease burden in 2013, with children (WHO, 2014) and in primigravidae (Menendez et al., 2000) being the most affected populations. Some of the ongoing hurdles in malaria control programs are caused by environmental changes such as heavy rains after drought and the associated focal expansion of vectors, socio-economic factors and civil wars in some part of Africa leading to mass population movement (White et al., 2014). Additionally, the availability of efficacious drugs is constantly under threat due to the development of drug resistance by the parasite and insecticide resistance of the vector (Jindal et al., 2014). 1.1.3. Life cycle of P. falciparum The life cycle of P. falciparum alternates between the human host and the transmitting vector , Anopheles mosquito. During its development, the parasite undergo es a number of morphological changes that take place in a variety of tissues in both the mosquito and human vector (Bijker et al., 2013; Pradel and Frevert, 2001) . Sporozoites, the infectious form of P. falciparum , are injected into the human dermis or capillaries during the blood meal of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. It is estimated that some of the Page 5 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction sporozoites may be contained at the site of injection for up to 6 hours before migrating to the liver (Yamauchi et al., 2007) . After invading hepatocytes, it takes approximately 6-7 days for the parasite to multiply within hepatocytes (Pradel and Frevert, 2001). At the time of leaving the liver , several thousand of merozoites are contained within merosomes, which is most likely to avoid host cell defense mechanisms (Vaughan et al., 2012) . Merozoites are finally released from the ruptured merosomes, infecting RBCs to start the asexual blood stage development (Cowman and Kappe, 2006). In the erythrocytic phase, merozoites undergo asexual multiplication, turning from a ring to a trophozoite stage and finally to a schizont stage. When the schizonts reach full maturation, the iRBCs burst; freeing the 16-20 newly developed merozoites to invade fresh, non-infected RBCs. The asexual blood stage developmental cycle lasts for 48 hours and is the cause of the symptoms associated with malaria disease. During this stage, a proportion of merozoites will commit to differentiate into male and female gametocytes (Alano, 2007) . After a female mosquito feeds on human blood containing gametocytes, the gametocytes are released from the iRBCs in the mosquito midgut and develop into gametes. The fertilized female macrogametes develop into zygotes and then into actively moving ookinetes that traverse the midgut epithelium and further develop to oocysts. Fully developed and matured oocysts release sporozoites that migrate through the body cavity to the salivary gland. The cycle of human infection begins again when the infected female mosquito feeds on the next human host (Arama and Troye-Blomberg, 2014; Baer et al., 2007; White et al., 2014) (summarized in Figure 2). Page 6 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction Figure 2: Plasmodium species life cycle in both mosquito vector and human host The malaria parasite life cycle involves two hosts. The female Anopheles mosquito and the human host (1). Sporozoites injected by mosquito migrate and infect liver cells (2) and mature into schizonts (3), which rupture and release merozoites (4). After this initial replication in the liver (exo-erythrocytic schizogony-A), the parasites undergo asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes (erythrocytic schizogony-B). Merozoites infect red blood cells (5). The ring stage trophozoites mature into schizonts, which rupture releasing merozoites (6). Some of the merozoites differentiate into sexual erythrocytic stages (gametocytes) (7). The gametocytes, male and female, are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito during a blood meal (8). The parasites multiplication in the mosquito is known as the sporogonic cycle(C). While in the mosquito's stomach, the microgametes penetrate the macrogametes generating zygotes (9). The zygotes in turn become motile and elongated (ookinetes) (10) which invade the midgut wall of the mosquito where they develop into oocysts (11). The oocysts grow, rupture, and release sporozoites (12), which make their way to the mosquito's salivary glands . Inoculation of the sporozoites into a new human host perpetuates the malaria life cycle (1) (CDC, 2013) . 1.1.4. Pathogenesis of P. falciparum malaria The P. falciparum liver stage in humans is clinically silent and therefore inherently difficult to study. Clearly, the liver stage does not cause obvious signs and symptoms of ongoing malaria infection. In contrast, the pathogenesis of P. falciparum malaria disease during the erythrocytic life cycle stage has been well studied. P. falciparum malaria pathogenesis is initiated when merozoites invade the RBC . The different pathophysiological outcomes of P. Page 7 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction falciparum asexual blood stage infection are summarized in Figure 3. After RBC invasion, a principal ligand known as P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 ( PfEMP1) starts to be expressed on the surface, which is encoded by a highly polymorphic multigene family, also known as the var genes (with around 60 copies per genome) (Newbold et al., 1999) . PfEMP1 has been reported to play a pivotal role in P. falciparum malaria pathogenesis by mediating the cytoadherence of iRBCs to endothelial surface receptors in the capillaries (Cooke et al., 2000). The sequestration of iRBCs is the result of the interaction between parasites-derived proteins present on surface of iRBCs (mainly PfEMP1) and several host molecules expressed on the surface of small blood vessel endothelial cells. Some key receptors for parasite adhesion are known, and include chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and CD36 . These parasite-host protein interactions have been found to be associated with pathology in the placenta (CSA), brain (ICAM-1) and in other organs (CD36) (Cooke et al., 2000) . Recently, the involvement of intravascular fluid depletion during severe malaria and impaired microcirculation leading to cardiac dysfunction has been reported. However, such findings warrant further detailed clinical evaluation (Mishra et al., 2013). A huge increase in parasite density and biomass during erythrocytic cycle leads to the systemic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrotic factors (TNF). It is thought that TNF production levels regulated by the promoter region contribute to pathophysiological processes such as anaemia and cerebral malaria (McGuire et al., 1999). Combining these processes of cytokine release, innate immune system hyperactivation, vascular obstruction, inflammation and damage leads to a multitude of organs to be affected including the kidney, brain, lung, heart and placenta (Figure 3 ) (Gazzinelli et al., 2014). Page 8 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction Figure 3 : A series of pathogenesis that is suggested to occur during different stages of malaria parasite life cycle in human host (a) After a mosquito bite, sporozoites travel to the liver to infect hepatocytes and develop into merozoites that are released in the bloodstream. Repeated cycles of red blood cell (RBC) invasion, replication and merozoite release will result in the exponential growth of the parasite population and lead to disease. IRBCs will circulate containing ring-stage parasites, and a small proportion of merozoites will develop into male and female gametocytes that infect mosquitoes, completing the parasite life cycle. (b) The removal of iRBCs by splenic macrophages or the uptake of free haemozoin results in the activation of innate immune receptors and cytokines which cause paroxysms and induce the expression of adhesion molecules that helps mediate parasite sequestration. The sequestration of iRBCs disrupts blood flow, promotes blood clots, injures endothelial cells ruptures vascular walls, leading to the extravasation of vascular content and local tissue inflammation. These mechanisms contribute to acute respiratory distress, cerebral malaria or placental malaria. The sequestration of infected reticulocytes is less intense. Haemolysis of infected and bystander (uninfected) RBCs, uptake of altered RBCs by splenic macrophages and acidosis, promoting metabolic acidosis, which is aggravated by the altered renal functio n that is observed in patients with malaria.(Adapted from: Nature Reviews Immunology) (Gazzinelli et al., 2014) 1.1.5. Malaria diagnosis Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria can substantially reduce disease-related morbidity and mortality and further contributes to the reduction of malaria transmission. Malaria diagnosis involves identifying malaria parasites or antigens/products in a patient \u00b4s blood (Tangpukdee et al., 2009) . Microscopy has been the gold standard for malaria diagnosis for many years both in research and in the field. This method detects parasites Page 9 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction in the capillary blood of infected individuals via thick and thin blood smears. In many cases, reliable and accurate microscopy results can only be achieved if the test is performed by qualified and well trained microscopists. However, in the real-life situation of many resource constrained settings, lack of reliable electricity supply to operate microscopes , shortage of high quality reagents supply and the low level of training of the microscopists to perform routine blood slide reading constitute serious challenges to the utilization of microscopy for public health purposes (Michael, 2015). Recently, a rapid, sensitive and easy to use malaria diagnostic test has been introduced widely, which relies on the detection of parasite specific antigens such as P. falciparum 2011). These rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) do not require trained personnel or specialized equipment for malaria diagnosis and therefore they have been massively distribut ed into the public health system (T3 program: http://www.who.int/malaria/areas/test_treat_track/en/) . However, RDTs are also associated with disadvantages; for example they are relatively expensive, do not quantify parasites, only have a sensitivity of around 100 parasites/microliter of blood and are sensitive to environmental storage temperature and humidity (WHO, 2011; Wongsrichanalai et al., 2007) . In addition, P. falciparum -specific species identification is possible only with PfHRP2 based kits, with other human malaria species indistinguishable and grouped under non- P.falciparum . RDTs based on pLDH can distinguish between P. falciparum , P. vivax and the other malaria species (pan-malaria), however they lack sensitivity compared to PfHRP2-based RDTs (Wongsrichanalai et al., 2007). Molecular biological techniques based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have shown higher sensitivity compared to RDT and are also able to distinguish not only between Page 10 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction different Plasmodium species but also between different P. falciparum strains (Gunawardena and Karunaweera, 2015; Shaukat et al., 2012) . QPCR based detection of malaria infection is also suitable for accurate quantification of malaria parasites. However , qPCR for malaria diagnosis is not wide-spread since it is expensive, requires well- maintained equipment and higher level technical expertise, currently limiting its use to research purposes (Zimmerman and Howes, 2015). 1.1.6. Current malaria control strategies Malaria control means reduction of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality within a focal area to an acceptable level following proper intervention strategies. Elimination is defined as taking control one step further and aims at reducing incidence in a certain geographical region close to zero. While malaria eradication is defined as permanent global reduction of the incidence of infection to zero, extinction is reduction of a specific infectious agent to a point that it no longer exists in nature or in the laboratory (Andrews and Langmuir, 1963) . The current malaria control strategy encompasses two major domains: (i) prevention; which works against the transmission of the parasite from mosquito vector to humans and (ii) case management; that focuses on the development of illness and severe disease . Global disease control efforts have successfully impacted on (i) control of many infectious diseases including malaria, (ii) elimination of diseases such poliomyelitis in many countries and (iii) eradication of diseases such as smallpox. Internationally, the call towards malaria elimination and eventual eradication has turned out challenging, in regards to translating it into reality in the near future (MMWR, 1999; WHO, 2014) . Currently, 80 countries with ongoing malaria transmission are classified by WHO as being in the malaria elimination phase and 4 countries, namely United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Turkmenistan and Armenia, have been recently certified by WHO to have eliminated the disease (Cibulskis et al., 2016; Newby et al., 2016). Page 11 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction 1.1.6.1. Malaria vector control Vector control is considered an essential tool in malaria control strategies and is mainly based on targeting mosquitoes, the vector for transmission (Giardina et al., 2014). This has been possible through large scale implementation of indoor residual spraying of insecticides and insecticide treated bed nets as well as by draining bodies of stagnant water, which is the habitat of the larvae stage. The se approaches successfully led to malaria elimination in Europe and the USA. In Africa, there have been undeniable advances in the fight against malaria in recent years, whereby we could see a trend of malaria incidence dropping by around 37% in most malaria endemic areas since 2000 (Cotter et al., 2013; Mharakurwa et al., 2013; Roucher et al., 2014) . It is most likely that the use of insecticide treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying and rapid treatment of malaria cases have played an important role in getting closer to the malaria-specific target of the Millennium Development Goals (target C), which aims to reduce the incidence of malaria by 75% (WHO, 2015). However, some studies caution this optimism and have reported lack of evidence for significant ly decreasing malaria incidence based on these interventions, questioning the universal trend across settings and transmission intensities (Okiro et al., 2011, 2013). 1.1.6.2. Malaria treatment Malaria is curable and preventable if treated adequately and promptly. However, P. falciparum parasites have developed resistance against the cheapest and most widely used antimalarial including chloroquine and Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) (Schneider and Kim, 20 13). WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Amongst ACTs, Artemisinin- lumefantrine (ALU) is used as first line therapy for uncomplicated malaria according to Page 12 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction Tanzanian National Guidelines for Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment (Adjuik et al., 2004; WHO, 2016). The ongoing emergence of antimalarial drug resistant parasite strains in South-East-Asia and appearance of pyrethroid resistant vector strains throughout sub-Saharan Africa are a considerable threat to the current global malaria control programmes (Menard and Dondorp, 2017; Mulamba et al., 2014) . Drug development of a single compound takes up to an average of 15 years through different stages of clinical development. In recent years, thousands of chemical structures have gone through pre-clinical testing and some even reached early clinical testing (Gamo et al., 2010) . With no new drug class expected to reach the market for at least the next five years, there is a need to strengthening current malaria surveillance programs to ensure proper use of available antimalarial drugs and early resistance detection (Roses, 2008). Learning from the regions that have successfully eliminated malaria in the past, it is obvious that malaria could be controlled and focally eliminated with a combination of complementary strategies put in place. As we embark on eliminating malaria in Africa, a combination of the current control strategies as well as novel approaches, which include simple, robust and sensitive diagnostic tools, better drugs as well as an effective vaccine will be required (WHO, 2015). 1.1.6.3. Malaria vaccines To date, vaccination is the most cost effective method of preventing infectious diseases (Karunamoorthi, 2014; Loucq, 2013) . The potential of vaccination programmes to control viral and bacterial diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, diphtheria, tetanus, rabies and the eradication of smallpox in humans have been remarkable success stories of vaccines (Loucq, 2013) . Development of an effective malaria vaccine has been a major goal of Page 13 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction malaria researchers for many decades. The revised malaria vaccine technology roadmap is targeting to have a vaccine that will achieve malaria elimination in multiple settings and at the same time being highly efficacious against clinical malaria by 2030 (WHO, 2013).The complexity of the Plasmodium life cycle, lack of clear understanding of important biological process es that lead to potent, long-lasting host immune responses and the high parasite diversity have severely hampered efforts to develop an effective malaria vaccine (Crompton et al., 2010) . For many decades, scientists have explored several vaccine design approaches that target different stages of the parasite life cycle. These include pre-erythrocytic, blood-stage and transmission blocking vaccine approaches (Hill, 2011; Wang et al., 2009) . So far RTS,S/AS01E is the only vaccine to show a partial protective effect against clinical malaria among young children in a phase 3 clinical trial and WHO has planned for an implementation programme (MVIP) in three countries beginning from 2018 (WER-WHO, 2016). 1.2. Immune responses against malaria 1.2.1. Humoral immunity against malaria Antibodies have long been known to play a critical role in natural immunity against malaria. The most direct evidence that antibodies are important mediators of immunity to malaria comes from passive transfer studies, in which antibodies from malaria-immune adults were successfully used to treat patients with severe malaria. Studies in mice deficient in Fc- receptors further support ed an important role for antibodies in protection (Cohen et al., 2010; Sabchareon et al., 1991) . Antibodies may protect an individual against malaria by a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of sporozoites or merozoite invasion of h o s t cells. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that antibodies in the plasma of malaria immune volunteers (Hill et al., 2013) and RTS,S/AS01E vaccine immunized volunteers Page 14 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction (Schwenk et al., 2003) were able to opsonize free merozoites and sporozoites, respectively, and mediate in-vitro phagocytosis by monocytes. Although natural malaria infections fail to induce sterile protection - even after several years of repeated exposure to the parasite- a partially protective, short-lived antibody response could be observed (Kinyanjui et al., 2007). Studies have shown that children from malaria endemic regions build up partial immunity that protects against severe disease as they grow older - however a complete sterile immunity has very rarely been reported (Portugal et al., 2013). Moreover, the partially induced natural immunity has shown to wane as person moves away from malaria endemic regions into a region without malaria exposure. During the Plasmodium life cycle, the parasite expresses a wide range of highly polymorphic proteins (Doolan et al., 2009). The complex interplay of polymorphic parasite proteins with the host immune system is most likely the reason for partial protection observed under natural exposure. Therefore, naturally developing immunity against malaria is not a good guideline for developing an effective vaccine against the disease (Waters, 2006). 1.2.2. Cellular immunity against malaria Studies have associated cellular immune responses, particularly CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-g, with pre-erythrocytic immunity (Epstein et al., 2011; Malik et al., 1991). Some evidence suggests that cellular immune responses induced by malaria infection may protect against both pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic parasite stages (Schneider and Kim, 2013) . The pre-erythrocytic stage parasite develops within the hepatocytes, thereby makin g infected hepatocytes targets for cytotox ic, major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) restricted CD8 T cells (Epstein et al., 2011; Guebre-Xabier et al., 1999) . It is Page 15 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction commonly thought that this kind of immunity is dependent on the expression of parasite antigens on the hepatocyte surface in conjunction with MHC class I (Villarino and Schmidt, 2013a). The MHC molecules are key players in regulating adaptive immune responses following invasion of foreign pathogens. Two major classes of MHC molecules, namely MHC class I and MHC class II, have been identified (Erickson, 1987; de Groot et al., 2016) . MHC class I molecules are found on most cell types, and function by binding and presenting endogenously, intracellularly derived peptides to CD8 T cells. MHC class II molecules reside on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells and function by binding exogenously derived proteins that will be processed intracellularly to be present ed to CD4 T cells. The importance of MHC molecules on influencing the outcome of a protective vaccine response has been demonstrated (O et al., 2014) . Good peptide binding to the MHC groove is essential, but not the sole determinant of antigen presentation (Wieczorek et al., 2017). The development of a peptide-based malaria vaccine should also consider the influence of MHC genotypes in the immune responses of target population (Comber and Philip, 2014; Wieczorek et al., 2017). T cell mediated mechanisms that result in destruction of malaria infected hepatocytes in humans are not well elucidated. They may include cell death induced by contact between the lymphocyte effector and target cells, killing through release of cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN-g) that induce hepatocytes to produce nitric oxide or destruction via antibody-dependent cellular (Seguin et 2013b) . IRBCs do not express MHC class I or class II molecules. This renders erythrocytes not a direct target for T- cell recognition and effector mechanisms. However, the iRBCs are liable to binding of antibodies that target surface-exposed foreign antigens. This binding could result in opsonization, thereby making the parasitized erythrocytes more susceptible to clearance by phagocytic cells in the spleen and destruction by complement fixation (Doll and Harty, 2014; Urban et al., 1999). Page 16 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction 1.3. Malaria pre-existing responses and the magnitude of vaccine induced immunity Recent studies have revealed that pre-existing immunity may modulate the magnitude and specificity of immune responses induced by subsequent immunizations (Bergmann-Leitner et al., 2012; Kannanganat et al., 2010) . Pre-existing immunity was demonstrated to impede the ability of human adenoviruses to induce strong innate and adaptive immune responses when used as a vaccine delivery system (Croyle et al., 2008; Kannanganat et al., 2010) . Whether the observed slow development of protective immunity in populations living in malaria endemic areas reflects the down regulation of T cell specific immunity following natural parasite infection remains to be revealed. Malaria specific memory B cells (MBCs) can be maintained for many years , even after absence of repeated exposure (Migot et al., 1995; Ndungu et al., 2013) . However, there is also evidence demonstrating that protective immunity gradually declines if a person moves away from a malaria endemic area for a longer time period (F\u00e4rnert et al., 2015). The role of pre-existing immunity on the development of vaccine induced immunity needs further investigation. A better defined role of pre- existing immunity on vaccine-induced immunity in the endemic population would aid our understanding of how individuals previously exposed to malaria will respond to different immunization regimens. 1.4. Malaria vaccines development Vaccines are tailored to induce protective immune responses against infectious diseases when applied prior to the contact with the pathogen itself (Riedel, 2005). For many years, malaria vaccine development has faced a number of challenges. Amongst those is the ability of the parasite to evade host immune responses by camouflaging itself through expression of various antigenic forms in both the mosquito vector (Ramphul et al., 2015) Page 17 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction and human host (Stanisic et al., 2013; Wykes et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2014). Immunological assays and system biology approaches have been used to predict t he antigen targets that may serve as better candidates for today's vaccine development programs (Hagan et al., 2015) . For nearly half a century, different vaccine development approaches have been employed. However, knowledge gaps of protective immune mechanisms that devel op under natural conditions severely hamper these programs. Likewise, the lack of vaccine-induced protection observed thus far for most malaria vaccine candidates as they progress into human clinical trials makes malaria vaccine development highly empirical (Bouharoun-Tayoun et al., 1990; Nakaya and Pulendran, 2015; Plotkin, 2008; Weiss and Jiang, 2012). To date, many of the current malaria vaccine development strategies have focused on utilizing (i) multiple components that will be effective against more than one parasite life cycle stage, (ii) multiple epitopes to overcome genetic and antigenic variation and (iii) multiple components that will induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. The ideal vaccine does not only prevent clinical disease but also infection and blocks transmission (Doolan and Hoffman, 1997; Kumar et al., 2002; Lozano and Patarroyo, 2007; Shi et al., 1999). Three stages of the parasite life cycle have been pursued as targets by different vaccines, namely the pre-erythrocytic stage vaccines, the asexual blood stage vaccines and a vaccine targeting the parasite within the vector thus preventing transmission. An overview of the vaccine approaches targeting the different life cycle stages are given below (Figure 4): Page 18 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction Figure 4 : Stages in P. falciparum life cycle that are deemed potential target for vaccine development An infected female anopheles mosquito bite injects sporozoites into capillaries (1). The sporozoites pass quickly into the human liver (2). The sporozoites multiply asexually in the liver cells over the next 7 to 10 days, causing no symptoms (3). In an animal model, the parasites, in the form of merozoites, are released from the liver cells in vesicles, journey through the heart, and arrive in the lungs, where they settle within lung capillaries. The vesicles eventually disintegrate, freeing the merozoites to enter the blood phase of their development (4). In the bloodstream, the merozoites invade red blood cells (erythrocytes) and multiply again until the cells burst. Then they invade more erythrocytes. This cycle is repeated, causing fever each time parasites break free and invade blood cells (5). Some of the infected blood cells leave the cycle of asexual multiplication. Instead of replicating, the merozoites in these cells develop into sexual forms of the parasite, called gametocytes that circulate in the blood stream (6). When a mosquito bites an infected human, it ingests the gametocytes, which develop further into mature sex cells called gametes (7). The fertilized female gametes develop into actively moving ookinetes that burrow through the mosquito's midgut wall and form oocysts on the exterior surface (8). Inside the oocyst, thousands of active sporozoites develop. The oocyst eventually bursts, releasing sporozoites into the body cavity that travel to the mosquito's salivary glands (9). The cycle of human infection begins again when the mosquito bites another person (10) (PATH- MVI, 2014). 1.4.1. Pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine approaches The pre-erythrocytic (PE) stage malaria vaccine development approach has recently attracted the attention of many scientists in the field, since it has shown the most promising outcomes when compar ed with vaccines aimed at targeting other malaria developmental stages. The PE vaccine approach aims at targeting the infective stage of P. falciparum , the sporozoite and the liver stage. Sporozoites can be targeted by Page 19 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction neutralizing antibodies that remove infective sporozoites from the circulation and prevent them from reaching the liver (Behet et al., 2014; Nahrendorf et al., 2014). If sporozoites escape from these antibodies and other innate immune mechanisms they will find their final destination - the liver hepatocytes. It is thought that liver stage parasites are recognized by CD8+ T cells that target and selectively kill these infected liver cells. In summary, these immune effector arms prevent merozoites being released to iRBC thereby preventing the development of clinical symptoms (Chakravarty et al., 2007; Reyes-Sandoval et al., 2011; Weiss and Jiang, 2012). 1.4.1.1. Recombinant PE vaccine approaches The most researched PE vaccine stage protein is the P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein. This protein is expressed in abundance during sporogony, the sporozoite stage and the early hepatic stages of P. falciparum infection (Coppi et al., 2011). This protein is known to be an important mediator of sporozoite gliding motility and cell traversal in the midgut of the mosquito and within hepatocytes of the mammalian host (Coppi et al., 2011) . Antibodies directed against CS protein have been shown to reduce the ability of the parasite to glide and traverse into the hepatocytes and hence are indirectly associated with reduced risk of clinical malaria (John et al., 2008). The critical roles of CSP as an immunodominant antigen that induce protection against PE stage of P. falciparum have been well characterized in pre-clinical studies in animals (Kumar et al., 2006). The NANP repeat domain is known to be a B-cell epitope and the C-terminal region is known to be a T-cell epitope (Cohen et al., 2011). Moreover, studies conducted in rodent models and humans have shown that antibodies directed to NANP CSP repeat region have consistently demonstrated the ability to neutralize sporozoites infectivity (Mehlhorn, 2011) . Under natural conditions, sporozoites are known to travel rapidly to the liver after mosquito bite delivery hence creating limited time for the humoral immunity to act on them. The C- Page 20 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction terminal non-repetitive region of CSP can be processed by professional antigen presenting cells or infected hepatocytes and presented on the surface to initiate CD4 and CD8 T cell responses (Gordon et al., 1995; Singh et al., 2007) . The discovery that a genetically engineered hepatitis B viral envelope can be used as a carrier matrix for different peptides lead to the use of th is technology to design a CSP-based malaria vaccine that utilizes the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in this manner (Rutgers et al., 1988). The RTS, S malaria vaccine - developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals - is the most advanced malaria subunit vaccine. It consists of a hybrid molecule of CSP and HBsAg and free HBsAg recombinantly expressed by S. cerevisiae . This hybrid molecule encompasses a part of the central repeat and the C-terminal region which are fused to the N-terminal region of HBsAg. The vaccine assembles itself into particles that also include unfused HBsAg (Kester et al., 2007). Furthermore, RTS, S is powered by a complex adjuvant (AS) system (Cohen et al., 2010), either AS02 ( Quillaja saponiria liposomes) al., 1997) (Figure 5). Page 21 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction Figure 5 : Schematic representation of RTS,S vaccine particle assembly A central tandem repeat (B-cell epitope) and C-terminal region of the P.falciparum circumsporozoite protein (T-cell epitope) are fused to N-terminal of the S antigen of Hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) (B) and co-expressed together with unfused HBsAg S in C.cereviciae yeast to form a vaccine particle (Cohen et al., 2011) . In its first clinical development phase conducted in malaria na\u00efve volunteers, the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine has shown to be safe and immunogenic. In malaria semi-immune individuals, RTS,S/AS01 has been clearly shown to induce protective antibodies in infants in Mozambique (Aponte et al., 2007). When co-administered within the expanded program on immunization (EPI) scheme in Tanzanian infants (Abdulla et al., 2008) protection against clinical malaria was observed. In the phase 3 trial , three primary doses of vaccine was reported to reduce cases of clinical malaria by 28% and 18% in 5-17 months (children) and 6-12 weeks (infants) respectively (RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership, 2015). Furthermore, analysis of pooled data from several phase 2 studies revealed that efficacy against clinical malaria was inversely related to transmission intensity (Bejon et al., 2013). In general, RTS,S/AS01 vaccine efficacy was shown to be about 36% in the first year; waning off to an efficacy of 2.5% in the fourth year, followed Page 22 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction by a partial rebound in clinical malaria cases during the fifth year in a high malaria exposed cohort (Olotu et al., 2016). The efficacy of 4.4% that was obtained during a 7 year follow-up compromised the benefits of the efficacy shown during the short term follow-up. In a phase III clinical trial conducted in 7 African countries in 11 trial centers with a wide range of malaria endemicity, RTS, S/AS01 was generally reported to have higher vaccine efficacy in children (5-17 months) than in infants (6-12 weeks) providing protection against clinical and severe malaria for up to 1.5 years following third vaccination (RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership, 2014). These outcomes of the phase III RTS,S/AS01 vaccine trial ha ve been somewhat disappointing (RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership, 2014; RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership et al., 2012)) but provided the proof that large phase III vaccine trials can be conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although RTS,S/AS01 was approved by the European Medicines Agency for active immunization of children aged 6 weeks to 17 months against malaria, the WHO did not recommend the inclusion of RTS ,S/AS01 in the Expanded Programme of Immunizations. T he RTS,S/AS01 vaccine will be tested in a pilot study for larger scale implementation under real-life settings in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi starting in 2018 (http://www.path.org/news/press-room/809/ ). 1.4.1.2. Viral vectored PE vaccine approaches Poxvirus vectors have been the most studied live viral system for delivering antigens in human and animal models, since their use in smallpox eradication in the 1970's (Limbach and Paoletti, 1996; Moss, 2011). This virus has been demonstrated to be a useful vector for vaccination purposes, due to its ability to generate recombinant viruses that express a variety of foreign antigens, and which confer protection to immunized animals (Jacobs et al., 2009; S\u00e1nchez-Sampedro et al., 2015) . An example of a PE subunit malaria vaccine with a multi-epitope was developed in the United Kingdom by a group from Oxford Page 23 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction University (Prieur et al., 2004) . Since then, the Oxford group has been conducting a cascade of clinical trials with a prime boost approach aiming at provoking T-cell immune responses against liver stage parasites. In early 2002, a vaccine construct consisting of attenuated fowl pox virus strain 9 (FP9) with multi epitope fused to thrombospondin related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP) entered clinical trials in British and Gambian volunteers (Moorthy et al., 2004). TRAP is a PE protein that plays a major role in parasite gliding motility and infectivity of liver cells (Sultan et al., 1997) . However, no protection was demonstrated when tested against febrile disease in children living in malaria endemic areas (Bejon et al., 2006) . Adenovirus vectors are amongst the few other viruses that attracted the attention of the vaccine research and development field. The replication-deficient adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector can be produced by having part of its genome removed and replaced by insertion of a foreign, non-viral target DNA (Bangari and Mittal, 2006). In the malaria vaccine field, the use of the Ad5 vectors remains challenging, as pre-existing neutralizing antibodies against the adenovirus vector were found to be associated with failure to induce appropriate immune responses in vaccinated individuals, both in the USA and Africa (Fausther-Bovendo and Kobinger, 2014; Nwanegbo et adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vector expressing circumsporozoite protein (CSP) given either alone or together with apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) expressing Ad5 virus was demonstrated to have increased IFN- J\u0003specific CD8 T cell responses, albeit low antibodies responses. Additionally, the CHMI conducted with volunteers immunized using Ad5 with CSP and AMA-1 did not show protective efficacy (Sedegah et al., 2011). Page 24 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction 1.4.2. DNA vaccine approaches In the early 1990's, advance in molecular biology technology lead to the finding that DNA or RNA inoculated directly into mice resulted in induction of cellular immune responses (Wolff et al., 1990). A vaccine trial conducted in the mouse model revealed that the injection of an influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein-encoding plasmid via the skin or muscular route could induce protective immunity against a challenge with a lethal influenza virus (Fynan et al., 1993). The success of the DNA vaccine approach w as also demonstrated in early stages of clinical trials (phase I) for different diseases (Khan et al., 2013) . However, currently there is no single DNA based malaria vaccine that has moved to phase II clinical trials. This calls for a better design of DNA vaccine constructs and incorporating better promoters driving the gene expression in vivo , as well as novel delivery technologies that can enhance immune responses in humans (Ferraro et al., 2011) . 1.4.3. The live attenuated whole parasite based vaccine approaches The failure in clinical advancement for many subunit malaria vaccine approaches re- stimulated the concept of using whole sporozoites as a PE malaria vaccine. In the early 70's, research revealed that immunization of mice and humans with radiation-attenuated sporozoites delivered by mosquitos could confer sterile protection against experimental malaria challenge (Clyde et al., 1973). Since then, the sporozoite-based approach has been considered as a gold standard for evaluation of malaria vaccine and drug efficacy in humans. CHMI studies that involve infecting healthy volunteers with live malaria sporozoites through infected mosquito bites was limited so far to few sites in Europe (Oxford and Nijmegen) and the USA (University of Maryland and NIH). In sub -Saharan Africa, the lack of phase I clinical trial facilities, trained medical and laboratory teams, together with the absence of high security mosquito rearing facilities has so far prohibited Page 25 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction testing in this important target population (Shekalaghe et al., 2014). The recent technological advancements driven by the biotechnology company Sanaria (http://www.sanaria.com) to manufacture large quantities P. falciparum sporozoites ( PfSPZ) that meet stringent regulatory standards and which can be administered intravenously to volunteers using needles has opened up the possibility for testing PE vaccines at an early developmental stage in s ub-Saharan countries (Hoffman et al., 2010). The whole sporozoite approach, either in the form of radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) (Clyde et al., 1973; Nussenzweig et al., 1969) , genetically attenuated parasites (GAPs) (Mueller et al., 2005) type prophylaxis et al., 2009) , have been proven to confer protection against experimental sporozoite challenge in malaria na\u00efve volunteers (Doolan and Hoffman, 2000; Epstein et al., 2011) . Amongst these possible whole parasite vaccine approaches, RAS and GAP are seen by many scientists as the most promising candidates for vaccination of humans against malaria (Mac-Daniel et al., 2014). The recent study conducted in the USA has demonstrated that the irradiated sporozoites (irrSPZ)-based vaccines can provide 100% short-term protection against homologous CHMI, making it one of the major leaders in the malaria vaccine field (Seder et al., 2013). 1.4.4. Blood stage malaria vaccines approaches Asexual blood stage malaria vaccine approaches aim at reducing the growth rate of blood stage infections which will in turn prevent or curb clinical disease severity. It has been suggested that people who have survived several encounters of malaria exposure develop natural immunity over time (Doolan et al., 2009). The goal of this type of a vaccine Page 26 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction approach would therefore be to accelerate development of blood stage immunity without suffering the consequences of infection. Several products that fall under this category have been developed or are under initial stages of development. Few candidates have entered phase 1b and 2b clinical trials (WHO, 2015) . P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) has undergone extensive testing in clinical trials. This 48 kDa protein contains both conserved and divergent regions in a wide range of P. falciparum isolates. In the early eighties, Khusmith S et al. reported that a combination of serum from immune West African adults and monocytes from malaria non-exposed individuals was able to suppress in vitro the proliferation of P. falciparum parasites (Khusmith and Druilhe, 1983). Many research groups were engaged in identifying which component within these West African sera could be responsible for mediating this parasite growth inhibitory effect. Oeuvray et al., demonstrated that antibodies against MSP3 function in cooperation with blood monocytes to promote asexual blood stage killing in an antibody-dependent cellular inhibition assay (Oeuvray et al., 1994). Long term clinical protection from malaria disease was associated with the IgG3 isotype of antibodies binding to MSP3 (Roussilhon et al., 2007). To date, several clinical trials have been conducted to test a multivalent MSP3 subunit malaria vaccine produced in Escherichia coli . This MSP3 subunit vaccine was proven to be safe and immunogenic in pre-clinical studies (Bang et al., 2011), phase 1a clinical trials in European volunteers (Audran et al., 2005) and several phase 1b clinical trials involving volunteers from malaria endemic countries (Lusingu et al., 2009; Nebie et al., 2009; Sirima et al., 2009) . The improvement of the vaccine with a view to inducing highly protective immune responses is on-going. A phase 2b proof- of-concept clinical trial to assess the protective effect of the MSP3 long synthetic peptide vaccine against all clinical malaria episodes in children aged 12-48 months is on-going in West Africa (Clinical trial.gov, 2015) . Page 27 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction The most advanced subunit blood stage vaccines is GMZ2, which has successfully reached phase 2 testing. The GMZ2 vaccine is composed of a fusion of the P. falciparum glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) and merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3). This vaccine was demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic in a phase 1a study conducted in malaria na\u00efve European volunteers (Esen et al., 2009) as well as when given intramuscularly in a phase 1b trial conducted in semi-immune African volunteers (B\u00e9lard et al., 2011). A recent study has shown that GMZ2 elicits high levels of antibodies in both non-exposed and malaria- exposed volunteers with broadly neutralizing activity in vitro against a variety of P. falciparum strains (Jepsen et al., 2013). However, a phase 2b randomized, controlled trial of the efficacy of three doses of GMZ2 performed in Burkina be, Gabonese, Ghanaian and Ugandan children resulted in an efficacy of just 14% [95% CI: 3.6%, 23%] by ATP analysis, when the cohort was adjusted for age and site. Despite the low efficacy, t he GMZ2 was shown to be well tolerated, immunogenic and protect ed children from developing clinical disease and reduced the incidence of malaria (B\u00e9lard et al., 2011; Sirima et al., 2016). From such findings, it's obvious that improvement of the efficacy of GMZ2 vaccine is a critical requirement. Other asexual blood stage antigens that have undergone extensive testing as blood stage candidates are MSP 1 (Lin et al., 2014)() and AMA1 (Harvey et al., 2014) (). Both of these antigens have provided limited protection against clinical disease, most likely due to the enormous sequence polymorphisms of these vaccine candidates that exist in field populations (Sheehy et al., 2012; Thera et al., 2011) A whole iRBC approach has also been proposed, resembling the whole sporozoite approach in the sense that the complete organism is used as vaccine. The development of this approach faces challenges in terms of manner of attenuation, scaling up of production and GMP compliant production (Stanisic and Good, 2015) . Page 28 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction 1.4.5. Malaria transmission blocking vaccines The growing interest in intervening with the parasite life cycle by generating antibodies that block transmission from the human host to the mosquito has led to advancements in developing transmission blocking vaccines (TBV). TBV are expected to complement other malaria vaccines and intervention strategies such as bed nets and to reduce the spread of drug resistant malaria parasite strains. The concept of developing TBVs has been around for many years, but few scientists choose t o implement research in this area. Until recently, relatively few TBV candidates are in the early developmental phases. In a study performed in the mouse model, it was demonstrated that immunizing mice with Pfs25-CP VLPs (a Pfs25 recombinant protein fused to the Alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein) using either a two-dose or a single-dose vaccination regimen induced functional antibodies that exhibited parasite transmission activity through a six month study period (Jones et al., 2013). A phase 1a trial conducted at the John Hopkins Centre for Immunization Research, USA showed that significant antibody responses were detectable in volunteers who completed the lowest scheduled doses of Pfs25/ISA 51 vaccine but showed high reactogenicity(Wu et al., 2008). In addition to P. falciparum TBVs, the recent published data also showed that a DNA plasmid containing the P. vivax gametocyte genes Pvs48/45 and Pvs47 could induce antibodies that significantly reduced the proliferation of P. vivax oocysts in the mosquito mid gut (Tachibana et al., 2015). Recombinant protein from P. vivax ookinetes surface protein (Pv s25) was expressed in S. cerevisiae , purified and formulated in Alhydrogel. In a phase I study, this vaccine formulation induced transmission blocking immunity against P. vivax (Malkin et al., 2005) . 1.5. Controlled human malaria infection in malaria endemic countries CHMI are a critical component of research and development in malaria vaccine and drug Page 29 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction development. The availability of a standardized CHMI model to predict outcomes in clinical evaluation in the field will help evade the current problem of a lack of predictive assays or good correlates of protection (Moorthy et al., 2009). CHMI through infected mosquitoes is the most commonly practiced method but only few centers globally have the capacity to infect mosquitoes with a laboratory strain of malaria that is easily treatable by Chloroquine. In recent years, Sanaria Inc., USA has produced at GMP standard fully infectious, aseptic, purified P. falciparum sporozoites ( PfSPZ challenge), which opened the possibility of conducting CHMI using a syringe and needle all over the world. A similar technique has led to the manufacturing of irradiation attenuated sporozoites, which could be used as a malaria vaccine candidate (Hoffman et al., 2010). The safety of CHMIs h as b e e n extensively demonstrated already over 80 years ago, when it was used as treatment of neuro-syphilis (O'LEARY PA, 1927). In 1986, the first CHMI study using infected mosquitoes that had been fed on cultured P. falciparum gametocytes was reported (Chulay et al., 1986). The potency and viability of PfSPZ challenge was further demonstrated in a clinical evaluation study conducted in Europe and in the US whereby to date, over 1000 volunteers have participated in CHMI studies (Chulay et al., 1986; Sauerwein et al., 2011; Spring et al., 2014) . Results from these studies report reproducible and high infection rates in study subjects in combination with a good safety profile. CHMI have not been routinely performed in people living in malaria endemic Africa. Although it is possible to find volunteers with minimal malaria exposure in Africa, it is not clear whether the CHMI studies will have the same success rate and resulting immune responses when compared to malaria na\u00efve adults from Europe and USA. These knowledge gaps, together with availability of sites in an endemic area with the infrastructure required for assessing participant safety and qualified medical staff creates the possibility of conducting CHMI studies in Tanzania. These studies will allow early evaluation of vaccine induced protection and novel drugs in one of the main target populations. It is hoped that performing CHMI Page 30 of 222Chapter 1: Introduction studies in malaria endemic countries will contribute to the acceleration of malaria vaccine and drug development by increasing the number of trials that can be conducted simultaneously (Chilengi, 2009).

Rationale and research questions addressed in this thesis Development of a malaria vaccine that targets the pre-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum has recently attracted the attention of many research groups. One of the most advanced malaria vaccine candidates to date is the recombinant subunit vaccine, the RTS,S/AS01 . RTS,S/AS01 has been under extensive research since the 1980's, and has demonstrated the ability to reduce the rate of acquisition of new blood stage infections and the multiplicity of infections in vaccinees. The broad evidence from challenge studies conducted in the USA and in African adult or paediatric field trials with varying transmission intensities, suggests a critical role for CSP-specific antibodies and/or CD4+ T cells in protection against infection. However, until lately, there has been no consensus on the immunological mechanisms that led to such findings and no clear correlate of protection for RTS,S/AS01 vaccine has been described. The first section of this thesis aims to address following research questions (Aim 1): 1. Is the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine safe, tolerable with improved or similar efficacy during large multicenter phase III trial when compared to outcome of phase II studies? 2. What will be the acceptability and feasibility of collecti ng PBMC samples from children aged 5 to 17 months at first bleeding for ancillary cellular immunology studies in Bagamoyo? 3. What are the markers of RTS,S/AS01 induced immune responses and do they correlate to vaccine induced protection in different age groups conducted in African children? Page 48 of 222Chapter 2: Rationale and research question Most recombinant subunit malaria vaccines have failed to induce high level and long lasting protection. Novel approaches are being tested to improve vaccine induced protection. The most promising approach is the whole sporozoite based vaccine, which uses the whole organism either irradiation inactivated or in its live non-attenuated form under drug coverage . CHMI has been successfully conducted in more than 1,500 volunteers in the US and Europe, but until 2012 it had not been employed in volunteers living in sub-Saharan Africa. The mechanisms of protective immunity after natural malaria infection or CHMI of malaria pre-exposed individuals remain subject of further investigation. We have conducted CHMI using cryo-preserved purified non- attenuated sporozoites in adult male Tanzanian volunteers with previous malaria exposure in order to address following research questions (Aim 2): 1. Is intradermal injection of PfSPZ challenge to malaria pre-exposed subjects safe and infective in comparison to malaria-na\u00efve subjects? 2. How does the immune response of malaria pre-exposed compare to malaria- na\u00efve subjects after exposure to similar doses of PfSPZ challenge? 3. What are the changes in humoral and cellular immune responses following PfSPZ challenge?

Aim 1: To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficiency of t h e RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in Tanzanian infants and children during a phase III multicenter clinical trial. To address Aim 1, we monitored adverse events to determine safety of RTS,S/AS01; we used ELISA to measure vaccine induced CSP-specific antibodies; Luminex to measure ex-vivo vaccine induced cytokine production as well as polychromatic flow cytomet ry to investigate quality and quantity o f vaccine induced cellular immune responses. 3.2. Aim 2 : To evaluate safety, infectivity, humoral and cellular immune responses following intradermal CHMI in malaria pre-exposed Tanzanian adults. To address aim 2, we determine d the safety of CHMI in malaria pre- exposed volunteers by monitoring adverse events; we used blood slide microscopy to define MBC; single cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, cell sorting and stimulation assays to investigate innate immune responses following CHMI.

ABSTRACT Background The candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 reduced episodes of both clinical and severe malaria in children 5 to 17 months of age by approximately 50% in an ongoing phase 3 trial. We studied infants 6 to 12 weeks of age recruited for the same trial. Methods We administered RTS,S/AS01 or a comparator vaccine to 6537 infants who were 6 to 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination in conjunction with Ex-panded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines in a three-dose monthly schedule. Vaccine efficacy against the first or only episode of clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination, a coprimary end point, was analyzed with the use of Cox regression. Vaccine efficacy against all malaria episodes, vaccine efficacy against severe malaria, safety, and immunogenicity were also assessed. Results The incidence of the first or only episode of clinical malaria in the intention-to-treat population during the 14 months after the first dose of vaccine was 0.31 per person-year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 0.40 per person-year in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 30.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.6 to 36.1). Vaccine effi-cacy in the per-protocol population was 31.3% (97.5% CI, 23.6 to 38.3). Vaccine ef-ficacy against severe malaria was 26.0% (95% CI, 7.4 to 48.6) in the intention-to- treat population and 36.6% (95% CI, 4.6 to 57.7) in the per-protocol population. Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in the two study groups. One month after administration of the third dose of RTS,S/AS01, 99.7% of children were positive for anti-circumsporozoite antibodies, with a geometric mean titer of 209 EU per milliliter (95% CI, 197 to 222). Conclusions The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine coadministered with EPI vaccines provided modest pro-tection against both clinical and severe malaria in young infants.

Page 54 of 222RTS,S/AS01 Malaria in African Infants n engl j med 367;24 nejm.org december 13, 2012 2285Considerable gains have been achieved in malaria control during the past decade. 1,2 Nonetheless, malaria remains a major public health concern. In 2010, an estimat-ed 216 million cases of malaria and 655,000 malaria-related deaths occurred, with the vast majority of deaths occurring in African children. 1 The RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine tar- gets the pre-erythrocytic stage of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. It was developed to reduce clinical and severe malaria in African children. Ideally, it would be administered through the well-established Expanded Program on Immuni-zation (EPI). In 2011, we reported the results for the first coprimary end point from an ongoing phase 3 trial, which showed that during 12 months of follow-up, RTS,S/AS01 had an efficacy against clinical and severe malaria of 55.8% (97.5% con-fidence interval [CI], 50.6 to 60.4) and 47.3% (95% CI, 22.4 to 64.2), respectively, among children 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment (per-protocol analysis). 3 Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria among children 6 to 12 weeks of age and those 5 to 17 months of age combined was 34.8% (95% CI, 16.2 to 49.2) during an average of 11 months of follow-up (range, 0 to 22). We now report on the second coprimary end point from the same trial: efficacy against clinical malaria during 12 months of follow-up among infants 6 to 12 weeks of age at enrollment, when RTS,S/AS01 was coadministered with EPI vaccines. Methods STUDY DESIGN Details of the study methods have been described previously 3-7 and are provided in the Supplemen- tary Appendix and the study protocol, both of which are available with the full text of this ar-ticle at NEJM.org. This phase 3, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial is being conducted at 11 centers in 7 African countries with a range of malaria-transmission intensity (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The trial is designed to evaluate vaccine efficacy, safety, and immuno-genicity for 32 months after the first dose of study vaccine in children 6 to 12 weeks of age or 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment. The trial includes three study groups in each age category: infants who received three doses of RTS,S/AS01 administered at 1-month intervals and a booster dose 18 months after the third dose, infants who received three doses of RTS,S/AS01 at 1-month in-tervals without a booster dose, and a control group of infants who received a non-malaria compara-tor vaccine. The analysis described in this report combines the first two groups (referred to as the RTS,S/AS01 group) and compares this group with the control group 6 14 months after the first dose of vaccine administered in children 6 to 12 weeks of age (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The trial protocol was approved by all relevant ethics review boards and national regulatory au-thorities (Tables S1A and S1B in the Supplemen-tary Appendix). Written informed consent was obtained from the children's parents or guard-ians. The study was undertaken in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 8 STUDY OVERSIGHT The trial was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline Bio-logicals (GSK), the vaccine developer and manu-facturer, and funded by both GSK and the Pro-gram for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) Malaria Vaccine Initiative, which received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All study centers received study grants from the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, which also provided funding for authors' travel and accommodations related to this trial. All the authors reviewed all manuscript drafts, approved the final version of the manuscript, and made the decision to submit it for publication. No GSK authors were involved in the collection or analysis of the data; the analysis was performed by an independent statistician. The authors had full access to the results. The authors remain unaware of study-group assignments in this ongoing trial and do not have access to the raw data at this point. Details of the contributions of all the authors to the study are available in the Supplementary Appendix. The Clinical Trials Part-nership Committee and Writing Group vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data pre-sented and for the fidelity of this report to the study protocol. RANDOMIZATION AND VACCINATION From December 2009 through January 2011, a to-tal of 6537 infants 6 to 12 weeks of age were ran-domly assigned to one of the three study groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Three doses of the RTS,S/AS01 or Page 55 of 222The new england journal of medicine n engl j med 367;24 nejm.org december 13, 2012 2286the conjugate vaccine (Menjugate, Novartis), were coadministered with EPI vaccines according to the World Health Organization EPI schedule. 9 EPI vaccines comprised a diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis-hepatitis B- Hemo phil us fl pentavalent (Tritanrix HepB nd an oral poliovirus vaccine taining serotypes 1, 2, and 3 (Polio Sabin, GSK). The study and pentavalent vaccines were admin-istered intramuscularly at different protocol-speci-fied injection sites. SURVEILLANCE FOR CLINICAL AND SEVERE MALARIA Passive surveillance for malaria began at the time of the first vaccination. Parents or guardians of the study participants were encouraged to seek care at a health facility if the child had any signs of illness, and transportation was facilitated. All participants who presented to a study facility with reported or documented fever during the previous 24 hours were evaluated for malaria. The primary efficacy end point for this analy- sis was the incidence of clinical malaria, defined as an illness in a child who was brought to a study facility with an axillary temperature of 37.5\u00b0C or higher and P. f alc ip ar um asexual para sitemia at a density of more than 5000 parasites per cubic millimeter or a case of malaria meeting the pri- mary case definition of severe malaria (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Different para-site thresholds were used for secondary case definitions (Table 1). Participants who were hos-pitalized were evaluated for severe malaria on the basis of a protocol-defined algorithm (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). 4,10 SAFETY SURVEILLANCE Data regarding serious adverse events were re-corded by means of passive surveillance begin-ning after the first dose of vaccine. Verbal autop-sies were conducted for deaths that occurred outside study facilities. 11 Information was col- lected on all unsolicited reports of adverse events that occurred within 30 days after vaccination and on reactogenicity (pain, swelling, redness at the injection site, drowsiness, fever, irritability or fussiness, or loss of appetite) within 7 days after vaccination among the first 200 participants en-rolled at each center. Symptom intensity was as-sessed with the use of standardized methods (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Infor-mation on related adverse events within 30 days after vaccination was collected for all partici-pants. Study clinicians used clinical judgment to decide whether an adverse event was likely to be related to the vaccine. In an analysis of previous RTS,S studies, rash was observed more frequently in children vaccinated with RTS,S than in con-trols. 12 Rashes and mucocutaneous diseases oc- curring within 30 days after vaccination and sei-zures occurring within 7 days after vaccination were reported according to Brighton Collabora-tion guidelines 13,14 (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). IMMUNOGENICITY Anti-circumsporozoite antibodies were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 15 in the first 200 infants enrolled at each study center at screening and 1 month after dose-3. An antibody titer of 0.5 EU per millimeter or greater was considered to be positive. LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC PROCEDURES Laboratory and radiologic procedures have been reported previously 5 and are described in the Supplementary Appendix. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The statistical methods have been described in detail previously. 3,7 We used Cox regression mod- els (1 minus hazard ratio) to evaluate vaccine ef-ficacy against the first or only episode of clinical malaria, using the study center as a stratification factor that allowed for differential baseline haz-ards. For the coprimary end point, vaccine effi-cacy against clinical malaria during 12 months of follow-up in the two age categories, 97.5% confidence intervals were used, ensuring an overall two-sided alpha level of 5%. The propor-tionality of hazards was evaluated by means of Schoenfeld residuals and models, including time-varying covariates. Secondary analyses, which included evaluations based on other case defini-tions and an analysis including multiple episodes of clinical malaria, were performed with the use of negative binomial regression. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio and is presented with 95% confi-dence intervals and Fisher's exact P values. Primary analyses of vaccine efficacy were based on the per-protocol population, which in-cluded all participants who received three doses Page 56 of 222RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine in African Infants n engl j med 367;24 nejm.org december 13, 2012 2287Table 1.

All end points are presented with 95% confidence intervals except for the coprimary end point, which is presented with 97.5% confidence intervals. The coprimary end point was de- fined as vaccine efficacy against a first or only episode of clinical malaria, according to the primary case definition. The primary case definition of clinical malaria was an illness in a child brought to a study facility with a temperature of 37.5\u00b0C and Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasitemia at a density of >5000 parasites per cubic millimeter or a case of malaria meeting the primary case definition of severe malaria. \u00a7 The primary case definition of severe malaria was P. falciparum asexual parasitemia at a density of >5000 parasites per cubic millimeter with one or more markers of disease severity and without diagnosis of a coexisting illness. The secondary case definition of severe malaria was P. falciparum asexual parasitemia at a density of >5000 parasites per cubic millimeter with one or more markers of disease severity, including cases in which a coexisting illness was present or could not be ruled out. Markers of severe disease were prostration, respirato-ry distress, a Blantyre coma score of 2 (on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher level of consciousness), two or more observed or reported seizures, hypoglycemia, acidosis, elevated lactate level, or hemoglobin level of <5 g per deciliter. Coexisting illnesses were defined as radiographically proven pneumonia, meningitis on analysis of cerebrospi-nal fluid, bacteremia, or gastroenteritis with severe dehydration.

The modified intention-to-treat population included all participants who received at least one dose of a study vaccine. In the ad-justed analyses, vaccine efficacy was adjusted for study center and distance to the nearest out-patient facility ( 5 km vs. >5 km). Data were censored 14 months after the f irst dose of vac- cine, or at the date of emigration, withdrawal of consent, or death. Serious adverse events were coded from clini- cian-assigned diagnoses according to the pre-ferred terms of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 16 and were based on available clinical and laboratory evidence. The primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the per-protocol population. Anti-cir-cumsporozoite antibody titers were plotted and evaluated after the third dose of a study vaccine on the basis of seropositivity levels and geomet-ric mean titers. Results STUDY POPULATION In total, 6537 infants 6 to 12 weeks of age were enrolled; 6003 (91.8%) were included in the per-protocol analysis (Fig. 1, and Fig. S3 in the Sup-plementary Appendix). Baseline demographic characteristics were similar in the two study groups (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appen-dix). The numbers of participants and malaria episodes according to study center are shown in Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix. As ex-pected, the majority of malaria episodes were reported by centers in areas with the highest transmission; 43.5% of all clinical malaria epi-sodes were reported by two high-transmission sites in western Kenya. These two sites, combined with the site in Nanoro, Burkina Faso (where transmission is high but seasonal), accounted for 72.6% of clinical malaria episodes in this analy-sis. The rate of use of insecticide-treated nets was 85.8% overall and was similar in the two study groups. Indoor residual spraying was conducted as a public health intervention at four study cen-ters; at those centers, spraying coverage was low (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).VACCINE EFFICACY AGAINST CLINICAL AND SEVERE MALARIA In the per-protocol population, the incidence of a first or only episode of clinical malaria meeting the primary case definition during 12 months of follow-up was 0.37 per person-year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 0.48 per person-year in the con-trol group, for a vaccine efficacy of 31.3% (97.5% CI, 23.6 to 38.3). Kaplan-Meier curves are shown in Figures 2A and 2B. Vaccine efficacy was not constant over time (P<0.001 by Schoenfeld re-siduals), with efficacy higher at the beginning than at the end of the follow-up period (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). Vaccine effica-cy against all clinical malaria episodes was 32.9% (95% CI, 26.3 to 38.8). Estimates of efficacy against clinical malaria were consistent across all case definitions and in both adjusted and intention-to-treat analyses (Table 1). At least one episode of severe malaria occurred in 58 of 3995 infants (1.5%) in the RTS,S/AS01 group and in 46 of 2008 infants (2.3%) in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 36.6% (95% CI, 4.6 to 57.7) in the per-protocol popula-tion. In the intention-to-treat population, at least one episode of severe malaria occurred in 77 of 4358 infants (1.8%) in the RTS,S/AS01 group and in 52 of 2179 infants (2.4%) in the control group, for a vaccine efficacy of 26.0% (95% CI, 7.4 to 48.6) (Table 1, and Tables S15 and S16 in the Supplementary Appendix). SAFETY Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events were reported in 17.9% (95% CI, 16.8 to 19.1) of recipients of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine and in 19.2% (95% CI, 17.6 to 20.9) of recipients of the meningococcal vaccine ( Table 2 , and Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 94 infants died: 66 of 4358 infants (1.5%; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.9) in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 28 of 2179 infants (1.3%; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.9) in the control group. Causes of death were similar in the two groups; none of the deaths were thought to be related to vaccination (Table S10 in the Sup-plementary Appendix). Serious adverse events that were considered to be related to a study vaccine occurred in 7 infants: 4 of the 4358 infants in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 3 of the 2179 infants in the control group; 4 events (2 in each group) Page 58 of 222RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine in African Infants n engl j med 367;24 nejm.org december 13, 2012 22896537 Underwent randomization and received study vaccine545 Were not eligible 364 Did not meet criteria 2 Died 84 Withdrew consent 65 Moved or were lost to follow-up30 Had other reasons 4358 Received dose 1 of RTS,S/AS01 (ITT population)2179 Received dose 1 of control vaccine (ITT population) 213 Did not complete vaccination 27 Died or withdrew for medicalreasons 47 Had consent with- drawn or parent orguardian declined to participate 84 Moved or were lost to follow-up 55 Had other reasons 503 Did not completevisit 16 37 Died16 Had consent withdrawn 450 Moved or were lost tofollow-up260 Did not completevisit 16 21 Died 4 Had consent withdrawn 235 Moved or were lost tofollow-up150 Were not included in the per-protocolanalysis7 Did not meet inclusion criteria 113 Were out of interval for doseregimen 16 Were lost to follow-up afterdose 3 14 Had other reasons82 Were not included in the per-protocolanalysis 5 Did not meet inclusion criteria 64 Were out of interval for doseregimen 3 Were lost to follow-up afterdose 3 10 Had other reasons89 Did not complete vaccination 9 Died or withdrew for medicalreasons 20 Had consent with- drawn or parent orguardian declined to participate 38 Moved or were lost to follow-up 22 Had other reasons4235 Received dose 2 2134 Received dose 2 4145 Received dose 3 2090 Received dose 3 3642 Attended visit 16 (12 mo after dose 3)1830 Attended visit 16 (12 mo after dose 3) 3995 Were included in the per-protocol population2008 Were included in the per-protocol population7082 Infants were assessed for eligibility Figure 1.

One infant (in the con-trol group) had anaphylaxis, one infant (in the RTS,S/AS01 group) had a suspected injection-site infection related to the pentavalent vaccine, and one infant (in the RTS,S/AS01 group) had repeat-ed febrile seizures associated with a respiratory infection. The frequency of seizures within 7 days after vaccination, reported previously, was simi-lar in the two study groups. 3Meningitis of any cause was reported as a serious adverse event in 11 infants: 9 of the 4358 infants in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 2 of the 2179 infants in the control group (relative risk in the RTS,S/AS01 group, 2.3; 95% CI, 0.5 to 10.4). A pathogen was identified for 7 of the events (salmonella in 3 episodes of meningitis and pneumococcus in 4 episodes). The 4 remaining events, with no pathogen identified, were re-ported by a single study center (3 episodes of meningitis in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 1 epi-sode in the control group). Of the 11 episodes of meningitis, 2 were new (1 due to pneumococcus and 1 due to salmonella); the 9 other episodes have been reported previously. 3 Investigator-driven medical review of previously reported meningitis episodes led to reclassification of 1 episode as an episode of pneumonia and reclassification of 4 episodes without cause as 2 episodes of pneu-mococcal meningitis and 2 of salmonella men-ingitis. Four of the episodes of meningitis oc-curred within 30 days after vaccination. Adverse Events Unsolicited reports of adverse events within 30 days after vaccination were recorded with similar fre-quency in the RTS,S/AS01 group (79.4%; 95% CI, 77.2 to and in the control group (81.3%; 95% CI, 78.3 to 84.1). No clinically important imbalances were observed (Table S11A in the Supplementary Appendix). Information on unso-licited reports of adverse events related to the vaccine or leading to withdrawal within 30 days after vaccination is shown in Table S11B in the Supplementary Appendix. The frequency of solic-ited reports of local symptoms was similar among infants who received the RTS,S/AS01 vac-cine and among those who received the menin-gococcal vaccine and was lower than that ob-served with the pentavalent vaccine (Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix). Systemic reacto-genicity was higher in the RTS,S/AS01 group than in the control group (Fig. 3, and Table S12 in the Supplementary Appendix). Postvaccination fever was reported after 30.6% of doses (95% CI, 29.2 to 32.0) in the RTS,S/AS01 group and after 21.1% of doses (95% CI, 19.4 to 22.8) in the con-trol group. A temperature higher than 39\u00b0C was reported after less than 1% of doses. The inci-dence of mucocutaneous disease was similar in the two study groups (Table S14 in the Supplemen-tary Appendix).Cumulative Incidence (%)100 8090 70 60 40 30 1050 20 0 0 3 6 9 12 Months since 14 Days after Dose 3 BIntention-to-Treat PopulationAPer-Protocol Population P<0.001 by log-rank 40 30 1050 20 0 0 3 6 9 15 12 Months since Dose 1P<0.001 by log-rank test 15101152 5352884 1325RTS,S/AS01Control vaccine Figure 2.

Page 60 of 222RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine in African Infants n engl j med 367;24 nejm.org december 13, 2012 2291IMMUNOGENICITY Before vaccination, 34.3% and 35.2% of infants in the RTS,S/AS01 and control groups, respectively, were positive for anti-circumsporozoite antibodies but at low titers (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). One month after the third dose of the study vaccine, 99.7% of infants in the RTS,S/AS01 group were positive for anti-circumsporozoite an-tibodies, with a geometric mean titer of 209 EU per milliliter (95% CI, 197 to 222).Discussion This phase 3 trial showed that in young infants, the RTS,S/AS01 candidate vaccine provided mod-est protection against malaria when coadminis-tered with EPI vaccines. The efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 reported here is lower than that observed in a phase 2 trial involving infants at three of the phase 3 trial sites, in which RTS,S/AS01 was co-administered with EPI vaccines.

Page 61 of 222The new england journal of medicine n engl j med 367;24 nejm.org december 13, 2012 2292metric mean titers of anti-circumsporozoite anti- bodies after vaccination were similar to those measured here, but vaccine efficacy against clini-cal malaria was 61.6% (95% CI, 35.6 to 77.1). 17 Although we wish to avoid overinterpretation of the results of this previously reported small phase 2 trial with wide confidence intervals, it is notable that this higher estimate of efficacy comes from a study conducted at sites in areas with low-to-moderate malaria transmission. It is possible that the pooled estimate across the 11 centers in the phase 3 trial obscures differences in vaccine efficacy according to transmission in-tensity and that these two sets of results are com-patible with each other. The efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine re- ported here is also lower than that reported previ-ously among older children recruited for this trial at the same study centers. 3 A likely explanation for the lower vaccine efficacy among infants is an age-dependent differential immune response to the vaccine. This concept is supported by the lower anti-circumsporozoite antibody titers observed in infants (geometric mean titer, 209 EU per millili-ter; 95% CI, 197 to 222) as compared with titers in older children (621 EU per milliliter; 95% CI, 592 to 652), reported previously. 3 Although the titer of anti-circumsporozoite antibodies is not an established correlate of the level of protection, an association with efficacy has been observed in several trials. 17-21 Infants may have mounted a lower immune response than older children ow-ing to coadministration of RTS,S/AS01 with rou-tine EPI vaccines, an inhibitory effect of mater-nally derived anti-circumsporozoite antibodies, an absence of priming with hepatitis B vaccine or with P. f alc ip ar um infection, or the infant's imma- ture immune system. Coadministration of RTS,S/AS01 with the pen- tavalent vaccine and the oral poliovirus vaccine might have resulted in immune interference and contributed to the lower anti-circumsporozoite antibody titers in the younger infants. Two phase 2 studies have explored the immunologic response to the related RTS,S/AS02 vaccine, either when co administered with a diphtheria-tetanus-pertus- sis-hepatitis B vaccine or when given 2 weeks afterward. The geometric mean titer of anti-circumsporozoite antibodies was lower when vac-cines were coadministered than when they were staggered (70 EU per milliliter [95% CI, 54 to 90] vs. 200 EU per milliliter [95% CI, 151 to 265]). 20,21 However, vaccine efficacy against infection was similar in the two trials (65.2% [95% CI, 20.7 to 84.7] during 6 months after vaccination and 65.9% [95% CI, 42.6 to 79.8] during 3 months after vac-cination, respectively). An absence of priming with hepatitis B vac- cine or with P. f alc ip ar um infection may also have contributed to the lower anti-circumsporozoite antibody titers. In this trial, infants simultaneously received a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-containing combination vaccine and the RTS,S vaccine, which contains HBsAg fused as a carrier protein to the circumsporozoite protein. Immune interference on concurrent administration of sim-ilar protein components has been described. 22 In contrast, in older children vaccinated against hepatitis B, memory T-cell reactivation may have enhanced the anti-circumsporozoite antibody re-sponse to RTS,S/AS01. 22 One study showed a tendency toward higher anti-circumsporozoite antibody responses in children who had been vaccinated against hepatitis B than in children who had not previously received hepatitis B vac-cine. 23 Maternally derived antibodies can inter- fere with the immune response in young infants; such interference is common with live vaccines, such as the measles vaccine, but can also occur with some protein vaccines. 24,25 S imilarly , pas -Percentage of Doses after Which Symptom Was Reported100 8090 70 60 40 30 1050 20 0 DrowsinessIrritabilityFever Loss of AppetiteRTS,S/AS01 (N=4252 doses)Meningococcal vaccine(N=2169 doses) Figure 3.

Page 62 of 222RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine in African Infants n engl j med 367;24 nejm.org december 13, 2012 2293sively acquired antibodies to either HBsAg or the circumsporozoite components of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine might have suppressed immune respons-es. Finally, although most protein vaccines and polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines are immunogenic in young infants, improved immu-nogenicity and efficacy have often been achieved when vaccination has extended beyond the first few months of life. 22,26,27 As previously reported in older children,3 sta- tistical models indicated nonproportionality of hazards over time. This could be due to waning vaccine efficacy, differential acquisition of natu-ral immunity, or other factors that may influ-ence the model, 28 such as heterogeneity of expo- sure, the vaccine effect at the individual level, or both. 29,30 If vaccine efficacy does wane, this might contribute to the lower observed efficacy among infants than among older children, espe-cially because young infants may be less sus-ceptible to malaria in the immediate postvacci-nation period owing to maternally acquired immunity, fetal hemoglobin, lower exposure, and other factors. 31 The 11 sites of the phase 3 trial cover a wide range of malaria-transmission intensity. The in-clusion of sites in high-transmission or seasonal-transmission areas and the large proportion of cases of severe and clinical malaria from these sites might have contributed to the lower vaccine efficacy among infants in this trial than in ear-lier trials involving infants. The implications of the large representation of malaria episodes from high-transmission areas may become ap-parent when site-specific data are analyzed at a later date, as specified by the protocol. Esti-mates of site-specific vaccine efficacy and the corresponding estimates of clinical or severe malaria episodes averted will help to determine what role this vaccine might have in malaria control. Exploration of factors that might affect vaccine efficacy, including the effect of maternal antibodies, the role of immune interference by EPI vaccines, the effect of the RTS,S/AS01 boost-er, and status with respect to previous exposure to P. f alc ip ar um parasites, will provide crucial in- formation for the further development of this vaccine and for other malaria vaccines under development. 32 Overall, fatal, or vaccine-related serious ad-verse events were balanced between the study groups. In the previous analysis, which included infants and older children, the incidence of men-ingitis was imbalanced between the RTS,S/AS01 and control groups. 3 The imbalance remains, but we now have clarified that the majority of cases had a bacterial cause. We will continue to mon-itor the incidence of meningitis throughout the trial. The imbalance in the incidence of rash, observed in previous RTS,S studies, 12,33 was not confirmed in this larger trial. This phase 3 trial shows efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine. Data from the remainder of this trial and additional studies in progress will contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay among the intensity of exposure to ma-laria, the immune response, and vaccine efficacy.

So far, only the quantity of anti-CSP IgG has been measured and used to predict vaccination success, although quality (measured as avidity) of the antigen-antibody interaction shall be important since only a few sporozoites circulate for a short time after an infectious mosquito bite, likely requiring fast and strong binding. Methods: Quantity and avidity of anti-CSP IgG in African infants who received RTS,S/AS01 Ein a 0-1-2-month or a 0-1-7-month schedule in a phase 2 clinical trial were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody avidity was defined as the proportion of IgG able to bind in the presence of a chaotropic agent (avidity index). Theeffect of CSP-specific IgG concentration and avid ity on protective efficacy was modelled using Cox proportional hazards. Results: After the third dose, quantity and avidity were similar between the two vaccination schedules. IgG avidity after the last vaccine injection was not associated with protecti on, whereas the change in avidity following second and third RTS,S/AS01 Einjection was associated with a 54% risk reduction ofg e t t i n gm a l a r i a( h a z a r dr a t i o :0 . 4 6 ;9 5 %c o n f i d e n c e interval (CI): 0.22-0.99) in those participants with a c hange in avidity above the me dian.

After morethan 100 years of research on malaria vaccines, RTS,S was the first pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidate that en- tered phase III clinical development [1-3]. RTS,S con-tains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) together with a fusion protein of HBsAg and a carboxy-terminal frag- ment of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite pro- tein (CSP), co-expressed in yeast and formulated with a proprietary adjuvant (AS01). The exact mechanism of RTS,S-mediated protection is not known, although Im-munoglobulin G antibodies (IgG) against the CSP repeat region are likely to play an important role since the con- centration of anti-CSP IgG partly explains protection inmost studies that assessed efficacy of RTS,S in African children [4-6]. In addition, passive transfer of anti-CSP IgG can protect animals from subsequent challenge[7,8]. Besides concentration, many other properties de- termine antibody function. Among them are availability of effector molecules, post-translational modification,isotype, subclass, affinity and avidity of antibodies. It is difficult to measure all these characteristics in one sam- ple, particularly in the small sample volumes obtainedduring clinical trials in infants. Affinity, defined as the strength of interaction between an epitope and an anti- body binding site, would be a particularly interestingvariable to measure in the context of anti-CSP IgG- mediated immunity, since the time of interaction with the parasite is short (less than 30 minutes [9]), sporozo-ites are strongly diluted and few. In fact, only one suc- cessful hepatocyte infection is sufficient to initiate and maintain blood stage infection. Studies in mice haveshown that high antibody affinity against a synthetic CSP immunogen is positively associated with protection [8,10] and most studies in humans indicate that anti-CSP IgG concentration explains only parts of the vaccine-mediated protection. Increase in antibody affin- ity after repeated antigen exposure is the result of affin-ity maturation due to somatic hypermutation. The rate and extent of maturation may be influenced by several factors, including nature, route and dose of the antigen, adjuvants and carriers as well as the immunization schedule. In the present study antibody avidity was mea-sured. It is a representation of the strength of interaction between antibodies and antigens in a complex and be- sides antibody affinity, valences of antibodies and anti-gens as well as structural features of the complex are important determinants of avidity. For CSP, it has been shown that the use of some adjuvants can increase theavidity of anti-CSP IgG after vaccination vol- unteers [11]. In this study IgG avidity against the repeat region of CSP was measured after the second and thirdinjection of RTS,S/AS01 Ein infants that received thevaccine as part of a phase IIb clinical trial to assess safety and efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 Ein the age-group targeted by the expanded programme on immunization (EPI) [5,12]. Methods Clinical trial The objective of the study was to explore the effect ofanti-CSP IgG avidity on RTS,S vaccine efficacy in naturally exposed infants. Details of the clinical trial have been pub-lished previously [5,12]. Briefly, safety and efficacy of RTS, S/AS01 Ewhen given through the EPI was assessed in 511 children from Gabon, Ghana and Tanzania. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention arms: 1) RTS,S/AS01 Eas three injections, one month apart (0, 1, 2 months schedule [012]; n = 170), 2) RTS,S/AS01 Eex- tended schedule (0, 1, 7 months schedule [017]; n = 170)or 3) control (EPI vaccines alone; n = 171). Malaria was defined as parasitaemia >500 parasites per l and an axil- lary temperature >37\u00b0C. The efficacy of RTS,S against first malaria episodes, detected by passive case detection, was equivalent in the two schedules one year after the thirdinjection. The study followed Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki (4 threvision) and received approval from the appropriate local and national ethics committees of each site. In addition, ethical re- view by the ethics committees of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Ethic Committee, theSwiss Tropical Institute Committee and the Western Institutional Review Board was sought. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00436007). Antibody measurements Antibodies against CSP were measured by evaluatingIgG responses against the CSP-repeat region, using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with R32LR as the coating antigen [13]. An anti-CSPIgG titre of 0.5 ELISA units per millilitre (EU/mL) or greater was considered to be positive. For measurements of avidity of IgG against the repeat region of CSP,samples were evaluated as described [13], but in two dif- ferent plates; one treated with a chaotropic agent and one untreated plate. As chaotropic agent a 1 M solutionof ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4SCN) was added in the treatment plate while 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS was addedin the untreated plate and both CSP ELISA plates werefurther washed and developed as described [13]. The avidity index (AI) was calculated as the ratio of the con- centration of anti-CSP IgG (EU/ml) that remainedbound to the coated antigen after treatment with NH 4SCN, divided by the concentration of IgG (EU/ml) that remained bound to the coated antigen in the un- treated plate. Anti-CSP IgG quantification and avidity were measured at the Center for Vaccinology, Ghent University Hospital, Belgium.Ajua et al. Malaria Journal \u0001 \u0013\u0011\u0012\u0016 \u0001\u0012\u0015\u001b\u0018\u0013\u0001 Page 2 of 6 Page 68 of 222For statistical modelling the logarithm of anti-CSP IgG concentration was used since previous data showed that log-transformation results in a better fit to the normaldistribution. AI was analysed in the two RTS,S-vacci- nated arms and after the second and third vaccination. Since the majority of infants before vaccination andthose receiving control vaccine do not have measurable anti-CSP IgG, AI cannot be calculated. Delta AI (dAI) was defined as the difference in AI between the secondand third vaccination. Similarly, delta CSP (dCSP) was defined as the difference in anti-CSP IgG concentration between the second and third vaccination. Statistics Analysis of the effect of IgG avidity on protective effi-cacy was exploratory and not detailed in the statistical analysis plan of the original study. IgG responses be- tween the groups were analysed by descriptive statisticsand represented as boxplots together with the individual measurements. The effect of anti-CSP IgG concentration and AI on risk of malaria was calculated using theaccording-to-protocol (ATP) dataset with a Cox propor- tional hazards model in R v2.15.2. For statistical model- ling antibody concentrations were log-transformed. Tocalculate the effect of dAI and dCSP on the occurrence of malaria episodes with a Cox proportional hazards model, values were dichotomized on the median dAI ordCSP and labelled as 'high 'and 'low ', respectively. All models included the covariates schedule and site. If ap-propriate, other covariates were added as reported in theresults section. A p-value below 0.05 was considered sig- nificant and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are given where appropriate. Results After screening 605 participants, 170 received RTS,S inthe standard (012) and 170 in the extended (017) schedule, as depicted on the CONSORT flowchart of the primary study (Figure 1). Samples from 315 (300ATP) participants were available for immunological analysis (012: n = 154 [148]; 017: n = 161 [152]). Paired immunological samples to calculate dAI were availablefrom 187 (179 ATP) participants (012: n = 103 [100]; 017: n = 84 [79]). As reported earlier [5], high anti-CSP IgG titres after three vaccine injections were associated with a reduc-tion in subsequent incidence of clinical malaria: the hazard ratio of a ten-fold increase in anti-CSP was0.52 (95% CI: 0.34-0.81), which corresponds to a Absolute AI after two (012: 35.9, 017: p = 0.22) RTS,S injec-tions were similar between the two vaccination schedules (Figure 2). As expected, an increase in AI between thesecond and third vaccination was present (Figure 3). In- crease in delta AI (dAI) was sligh tly, albeit not statistically significant, higher in the 017 (7.1) group compared to the 012 (4.2) group (delta: 3.0; 95% CI: 0.3-6.1; t-test p = 0.08). To explore the effect of AI, dAI and dCSP on malaria risk, three Cox proportional hazard models were defined and tested. AI after the third injection, corrected for site, schedule and anti-CSP IgG concentration, did not ex- plain a significant reduction in risk of clinical malaria(Model 1; hazard ratio: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.97-1.02). Partici- pants were then divided in dCSP and dAI 'high 'and 'low 'responders and included as categorical variable in the model. Classification as 'high-dCSP 'was associated with a significant risk reduction (77%) com-pared to the 'low dCSP 'group in a model corrected for site and schedule (Model 2; hazard ratio: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.11-0.51). When dAI, corrected for site, schedule and dCSP was analysed, the hazard ratio between high andlow responders separated by the median, was 0.46 (Model 3; 95% CI: 0.22-0.99; Wald test p = 0.049), hence classification as 'high dAI 'group member is associated with a 54% risk reduction (Figure 4). Discussion The complex interplay of vaccine-primed immune medi- ators that define a successful response upon pathogen encounter is not well understood. Cellular and humoralcomponents have important roles, although in various compositions, depending on the pathogen and the host. Antibodies are the prototypic vaccine-induced immunemediators and play an important role in anti-malarial immunity during the pre-erythrocytic [8,10] as well as the erythrocytic stage [14] of the disease, as shown bypassive transfer experiments in mice and man. The sheer concentration of antigen-specific antibodies is normally used to measure immunization success and serves as asurrogate to estimate protective efficacy. The clinical de- velopment of RTS,S is a unique opportunity to investi- gate the effect of further variables such as antibodyavidity, isotype or subclass on vaccine efficacy, since clinical (true) efficacy is known [5], being 57% (95% CI: 33-73) with the 012 32% -45) following the 017 schedule. Here, anti-CSP IgG avidity was measured to assess if it predicts vaccine efficacy in a phase II clinical trial ofRTS,S independent of anti-CSP IgG concentration [5,12]. Regardless of the vaccination scheme and site, avidity did not improve prediction over anti-CSP IgGconcentration alone. This may mean that: i) the assay is not sensitive enough to reflect avidity; ii) collinearity be- tween antibody concentration and avidity blurs the effectof avidity; or, iii) that avidity is not an important deter- minant of vaccine efficacy. In this study IgG concentra- tion and avidity was measured after the second and thirdAjua et al. Malaria Journal \u0001 \u0013\u0011\u0012\u0016 \u0001\u0012\u0015\u001b\u0018\u0013\u0001 Page 3 of 6 Page 69 of 222vaccine injection. This approach is valid to assess if the immune system reacted to vaccination successfully.Since kinetics of IgG vary over time and the study was performed under natural exposure to malaria parasites, the time of encounter with the parasite becomes an im-portant variable. This is in contrast to controlled humanmalaria infection (CHMI) studies, where the time of in-fection is defined. Hypothetically, the difference in IgGconcentration (and avidity) between second and third vaccination could be a better predictor of effective antibody-mediated protection than concentration afterthe third vaccine injection, because it better reflects the Figure 1 CONSORT study flow chart.Ajua et al. Malaria Journal \u0001 \u0013\u0011\u0012\u0016 \u0001\u0012\u0015\u001b\u0018\u0013\u0001 Page 4 of 6 Page 70 of 222further evolution of antibody responses until next para- site encounter. The present data argue for the use of this approach since it was shown that a high dCSP predicts protective efficacy and dAI explains part of the protec-tion in the RTS,S vaccinated children (Model 3). How AI evolves over time and if it is a useful predictor ofvaccine efficacy remains to be validated with further, in-dependent and confirmatory studies. Nevertheless, this observation adds a new component to the search of correlates of protection and the under-standing of the immune responses elicited by pre- erythrocytic malaria vaccine candidates such as RTS,S.Since adjuvants also have a profound effect on the speed of avidity maturation [11], the effect of avidity on vac- cine efficacy could even be analysed with interventionalstudies that assess the effect of timing between immuni- zations (as in this study) and different adjuvants on pro- tective efficacy while direct measures of maturation ofthe immune system such as single-cell based sequencing of IgG genes of anti-CSP memory B-cells [15,16] are performed. This may be particularly interesting for anti-gens such as CSP that are not highly immunogenic per se, because highly immunogenic antigens often induce antibodies with strong avidity over a short period of timeand a threshold antibody concentration is appropriate to predict their efficacy [17]. Other studies in the develop- ment of RTS,S (e.g., challenge experiments [18] and the recently completed phase III trial [1-3]) will certainly provide additional information and may establish themeasurement of avidity as one biomarker for vaccine effi- cacy. Additionally, such knowledge may guide the design of next generation vaccines and administration schemes. Conclusions So far, the most robust correlate of protection for the mal-aria vaccine candidate RTS,S is anti-circumsporozoite(CSP) IgG concentration following immunization. Pre- clinical data and theoretical considerations suggest that avidity may have an additional impact on protective0 100 200 300 400 500 6000.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Time in daysProportion without malaria high low Figure 4 Kaplan Meier plot of malaria episodes over time in participants classified as having high (black) or low (grey) dAI.

It is shown that an increase in anti-CSP IgG con- centration and avidity between second and third vaccine injection is associated with a strong risk-reduction formalaria after immunization. This finding shall influence the way of analysis of immunological correlates of protec- tion since using change in antibody concentration andavidity rather than single measurements enables improved modelling of immune-effector function at the time of pathogen encounter and hence more powerful predictionof vaccine efficacy.

H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts Background. The RTS,S/AS01E malaria vaccine has moderate efficacy, lower in infants than children. Current eff orts to enhance RTS,S/AS01E efficacy would benefi t from learning about the vaccine-induced immunity and identifying correlates of malaria pro- tection, which could, for instance, inform the choice of adjuvants. Here, we sought cellular immunity-based correlates of malaria protection and risk associated with RTS,S/AS01E vaccination. Methods. We performed a matched case-control study nested within the multicenter African RTS,S/AS01E phase 3 trial. Children and infant samples from 57 clinical malaria cases (32 RTS,S/25 comparator vaccinees) and 152 controls without malaria (106 RTS,S/46 comparator vaccinees) were analyzed. We measured 30 markers by Luminex following RTS,S/AS01E antigen stimula-tion of cells 1 month postimmunization. Crude concentrations and ratios of antigen to background control were analyzed. Results. Interleukin (IL) 2 and IL-5 ratios were associated with RTS,S/AS01E vaccination (adjusted P .01). IL-5 circumsporo- zoite protein (CSP) ratios, a helper T cell type 2 cytokine, correlated with higher odds of malaria in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees (odds ratio, 1.17 per 10% increases of CSP ratios; P value adjusted for multiple testing = .03). In multimarker analysis, the helper T cell type 1 (T H1)-related markers interferon-, IL-15, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor protected from subsequent malaria, in contrast to IL-5 and RANTES, which increased the odds of malaria. Conclusions. RTS,S/AS01E-induced IL-5 may be a surrogate of lack of protection, whereas TH1-related responses may be involved in protective mechanisms. Eff orts to develop second-generation vaccine candidates may concentrate on adjuvants that modulate the immune system to support enhanced TH1 responses and decreased IL-5 responses. Keywords. malaria; vaccine; immunity; cellular immune responses; cytokines. RTS,S/AS01E is the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate in development, having completed a phase 3 trial in Africa, in which the 1-year vaccine e fficacy (VE) against clinical malaria was 56% in children aged 5-17 months and 31% in infants aged 6-12 weeks [1-3]. The mechanisms of RTS,S/AS01E-induced protection and the reasons for the moderate e fficacy and the lower protection in infants than children remain unclear. Identifying immune correlates of protection can shed light on these questions, help improve RTS,S/AS01E, and rationally design the next generation of malaria vaccines to control and eliminate this disease. RTS,S is a subunit vaccine targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of Plasmodium falciparum infection and is based on the circum - sporozoite protein (CSP). The vaccine consists of a recombinant protein containing part of the CSP fused to and coexpressed with the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). RTS,S in the phase 3 trial was formulated with the AS01 adjuvant that consists of 3-O-desacyl-4 -monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), QS21, and lipos- of anti-CSP immunoglobulin G (IgG) [4-10], which recently were shown to correlate with the magnitude and duration of VE in children and infants [11, 12]. Unlike antibodies, cellular responses in endemic areas are low to moderate and mainly based on helper T cell type 1 MAJOR ARTICLE \u00a9 The Author 2017.

No investigated cellular response has predicted RTS,S-induced protection consistently in pediatric phase 2 trials [ 7, 8]. RTS,S/AS01E-induced cellular immunity is probably com- plex and involves diff erent cell types and immune mediators. Most studies performed to date measured a limited number of parameters, restricted by the reduced amounts of blood obtained in children. Multiplex bead arrays and the Luminex platform allow multiparameterization of numerous markers in small volumes. Use of this technology in 2 studies includ-ing a limited number of markers suggested that RTS,S vacci-nation cytokines Herein, we used a immunoassay to measure cellular responses following ex vivo stimulations with vaccine antigens in cells freshly isolated at pre- and postimmunization in chil-dren and infants from 3 African sites of the phase 3 trial. METHODS Study Design Written informed consent was obtained from children's par - ents/guardians before recruitment. The study protocol was approved by all relevant ethics review boards and national regulatory authorities (Supplementary Methods). We per - formed a matched case-control study nested within the RTS,S/AS01E phase 3 trial, described elsewhere [ 3]. In brief, the trial enrolled infants (6-12 weeks) and children (5-17 months) who were vaccinated with either RTS,S/AS01E or a compara - tor vaccine\u2014that is, rabies vaccine (children) or meningo - coccal C conjugate vaccine (infants), administered at study months zero, 1, and 2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and stimulated ex vivo at month 0 before vaccination and 30 days after the third dose of vaccine (M3) from 368 children in 3 trial sites: Bagamoyo (Tanzania), Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 (Gabon), and Manhi\u00e7a (Mozambique); and from 219 infants in Manhi\u00e7a and Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 (only M3). This study included all malaria cases detected 1-12 months postvacci-nation from the according-to-protocol immunology cohort whose samples were available ( Figure 1 , Supplementary Table 1). Malaria cases were defined as subjects who sought care at a health facility and had any P. f a l c i p a r u m asexual parasitemia by blood smear. Controls were matched to cases based on site, age group, and time of vaccination and follow-up. Up to 1:4 case:controls (average 1:3) were selected were selected among com-parator vaccinees. Investigators conducted assays blinded to vaccination and protection status. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Stimulations and Multiplex Bead Array Assay PBMCs were stimulated fresh with peptide pools covering the 2 vaccine antigens: CSP (31 peptides) and HBsAg (53 peptides) [7]. Dimethyl sulfoxide, the solvent for peptide pools, was used alone as a background control (henceforth \"background\" or \"mock stimulation\"). Thirty cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were quantitated in cell supernatants using the Cytokine Human Magnetic Panel from Life Technologies (Supplementary Methods). Selection of Markers and Metrics for Primary Analysis in a Pilot Study Four cytokines (IL-2, IL-5, IL-17, and IFN-) were selected as primary markers for primary and secondary analyses in a pilot study that included 153 children who were not in the main matched case-control study. Markers were selected based on immunogenicity (Supplementary Table 2), precision, reliability, accuracy, uniqueness, and biological relevance. The primary outcome for antigen-specific responses was defined in the pilot study as the ratio between the crude concentration after anti-gen stimulations (CSP or HBsAg) and after mock stimulations (Supplementary Methods). Statistical Analysis Primary analysis of immunogenicity and correlates of protec-tion was based on ratios of primary markers at M3 and focused on RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees and CSP responses. To distinguish correlates of RTS,S/AS01E-induced immunity from correlates of naturally acquired immunity, results of RTS,S/AS01E and comparator vaccinees were contrasted through interaction tests with vaccination group. Marker responses between RTS,S/AS01E and comparator vaccinees were contrasted through linear models and t tests. Impact of baseline ratios on postvaccination ratios was assessed through linear regression models, with baseline ratios as predic-tors. Analyses of correlates of protection were based on compar-isons of cases and controls for CSP ratios in logistic regression models with a random intercept to account for matching strata. Odds ratios (ORs) were scaled to represent a 10% increase in ratios or in concentrations. Additionally, for interpretability, rel-evant ORs were scaled based on standard deviations. To identify groups of markers associated with malaria, marker ratios were analyzed in combination and selected through regression with elastic net and through partial least squares discriminant anal-ysis (PLS-DA). All tests were 2-sided and considered statistically significant to a .05 -level. Analyses were adjusted for multiple testing through permutation (maximum T). P values for the 4 primary markers were adjusted (P-adj) separately from the 24 second-ary markers. P values for CSP and HBsAg stimulations were adjusted separately. Adjustments for multiple testing when assessing interactions with vaccination status, age group, or sex were done through Holm (primary markers) and Benjamini-Hochberg (secondary markers) approaches. When age interac-tions were statistically significant, the age-specific association was reported.

Study prole. *Based on the study protocol, only a subset of vaccinees were enrolled for the cellular component of the immunology study MAL067 (M067), ancillary to the RTS,S/AS01E phase 3 trial MAL055 (M055). Per study protocol, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were supposed to be freshly stimulated and have supernatant collected whenever >6.6 million cells were harvested. The priority was to cryopreserve 5 million PBMCs. Stimulations were performed when additional PBMCs were available for at least circumsporozoite protein and mock stimulations (0.8 million each). In the Manhi\u00e7a site, after we collected samples from 292 subjects in each age cohort, all subsequent samples were assigned to a different study involving B cells and no fresh stimulations were performed. Four subjects (1 RTS,S/AS01E- and 3 comparator-vaccinated children) who were not originally in the according-to-protocol cohort were inadvertently included in the analysis. The subjects had the blood sample collected more than the 30 days after the primary vaccination dened in the protocol. \u00a7Up to 1:4 case:controls selected among and 1:2 case:controls were selected among comparator vaccinees.

RESULTS Study Population and Markers at Preimmunization Samples from 209 subjects were analyzed (Figure 1). Among RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees, 15 cases and 51 controls were from Bagamoyo, 1 case and 2 controls from Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, and 16 cases and 53 controls from Manhi\u00e7a. Vaccinees in Bagamoyo and Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 were all children, and in Manhi\u00e7a nearly all were infants (95%). Preimmunization CSP ratios in RTS,S/AS01E- and comparator-vaccinated children (baseline samples were not collected in infants) were comparable, except for IFN-, which was statistically significantly higher in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees (Supplementary Table 3). Immunogenicity Markers When comparing CSP ratios between RTS,S/AS01E and com-parator vaccinees at M3, only IL-2 was significantly higher in RTS,S/AS01E than in comparator vaccinees (Figure 2A, Supplementary Figure 1A). For HBsAg ratios, IL-2 and the helper T cell type 2 (T H2) cytokine IL-5 were significantly higher in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees (Figure 2B , Supplementary Figure 1B). The effect of vaccination on ratios was comparable in children and infants and in both sexes (P-adj > .10 for inter-action with age and with sex). Concentrations of primary markers IL-2 and IL-5 a fter CSP in RTS,S/ AS01E than in comparator vaccinees (Supplementary Figure 2). Unlike analysis with ratios, concentrations a fter CSP , HBsAg, and mock stimulations were di fferent between age groups for several markers ( P-adj for interaction with age <.05; Supplementary Table 4). In children, CSP and background responses of most of these markers were higher in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees than in comparator 1; Supplementary Table 4). In contrast, no dif- ferences in marker concentrations between vaccination groups were detected in infants. No di fferences in immunogenicity by sex were found ( P-adj > .10 for interaction with sex). Impact of Preimmunization Markers on RTS,S/AS01E Immunogenicity Baseline responses to CSP due to previous immunity or to HBsAg due to hepatitis B vaccination (included in the expanded program of immunization) could affect immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS01E in children. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of prevaccination ratios of primary markers on the postvacci-nation ratio of the same or any other marker (Supplementary Table 5). For CSP ratios in RTS,S/AS01E-vaccinated children, baseline IFN- was consistently and positively correlated with postvaccination ratios of some markers, including the immu-nogenicity marker IL-2, T H1-related cytokine IL-15, (Supplementary For HBsAg ratios, baseline IFN- was negatively correlated with some postvaccination CSP ratios, including B P < .001 P-Adj < .001 P < .001 P-Adj < .001 Figure 2.

P values were computed through t tests of the log10-transformed ratios and were adjusted for multiple test- ing (P-Adj) through a permutation approach. Only statistically signicant P values are shown. There were 137 RTS,S/AS01E and 70 comparator vaccinees for CSP (A) and 133 RTS,S/AS01E and 63 comparator for HBsAg (B). CID 2017:65 (1 September) Moncunill et alHBsAg ratios correlated with higher levels of some postvacci- nation CSP ratios (eg, IFN-). Few baseline HBsAg ratios were associated with postvaccination HBsAg ratios in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees (Supplementary Table 5), and most associations were weak and different from associations with CSP ratios. In contrast, no clear associations were detected in comparator vaccinees.Correlates of Clinical Malaria: Single-Marker Analysis Figure 3 shows the ORs for 10% increases in postvaccination CSP ratios of primary and secondary markers and malaria in RTS,S/AS01E ( Figure 3A) and comparator vaccinees (Figure 3B).

The ORs of IL-5 and RANTES, scaled by changes in standard deviation units of the ratio, were 2.29 and 1.61, respectively. Furthermore, the association of IL-5 with malaria was specific to RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees (P-adj = .049 for vaccination interaction; Supplementary Table 6). No marker was associated with malaria in comparator vaccinees. Based on these results, we explored the association of IFN- /IL-5 ratio with malaria, and a higher ratio was found to be protective against malaria ( P = .004; Supplementary Figure 4).

In children, increases in CSP ratios of several markers significantly increased the odds of malaria. On the contrary, increases in CSP ratios of TH1 and proin- (G-CSF) in infants protected from malaria. Sex of vaccinees did not confound associations between ratios and malaria\u2014that is, neither impacted ORs nor P values (data not shown). In secondary analyses (data not shown), we found that marker concentrations were not correlated with malaria. Correlates of Clinical Malaria: Multiple-Marker Analysis When analyzing combinations of marker ratios in models selected by elastic net, IFN- (OR, 0.90), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 0.93), IL-5 (OR, 1.38), and RANTES (OR, 1.15) were predictive of malaria in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees (Supplementary Figure 5). Two components identified by PLS-DA were independently protective against malaria in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees (Figure 5). In line with previous results, the markers that contributed more (loadings > <0.3 or >0.3) to 1 component were GM-CSF, IFN-, IL-5, and RANTES and to the other component were IL-15, IL-5, and RANTES. DISCUSSION We found that IL-5 CSP ratios at postvaccination increased the odds of malaria in RTS,S/AS01E-vaccinated children and infants, a result that could explain the lack of protection in numerous vaccinees through a different mechanism than the previously reported strain-specific VE in children [14]. In multimarker analysis, IL-5 and RANTES increased the odds of malaria in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees, whereas the T H1-related markers IL-15 were also asso-ciated with protection in single-marker analysis in infants, as well as TNF and G-CSF. Although associations of marker ratios with vaccination were comparable between age groups, associa-tions with concentrations were significantly different for several markers. Proinflammatory and the above-reported protective markers were significantly higher in RTS,S/AS01E-vaccinated than in comparator-vaccinated children, but these differences were not observed in infants. These results suggest that RTS,S/AS01E is less immunogenic in infants, and may explain the lower VE in this age group [12]. Of note, RTS,S/AS01 responses were higher for HBsAg than CSP . This may be due to a higher immunogenicity of HBsAg than CSP , to the higher proportion of HBsAg in the RTS,S vaccine, or to hepatitis B vaccination. IL-5 is mainly produced by activated T H2 cells and restricted to eff ector memory T cells that are diff erentiated a fter recurrent antigenic exposure [15, 16]. IL-5 has never been examined in trials, although IL-4, another TH2 cytokine, was previ- ously found to be elevated in RTS,S-vaccinated infants [4]. In a preclinical study, the AS01B and AS02A adjuvants induced IL-5 in addition to IFN- responses [17]. To our knowledge, there is no epidemiological evidence of IL-5 association with occurrence of clinical malaria. Functional polarity between T H1 and TH2 responses could partially explain the association of IL-5 with malaria in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees. IL-5+ TH2 cells probably constrain protective TH1 responses and inhibit several macrophage functions [18]. Exploratory analyses of IFN-/IL-5 ratios indicate that a skewed response to T H2 increases the odds of malaria. Additionally, the eff ect of IL-5 in promoting eosin- ophil responses [18] could contribute to the increased odds of malaria. Eosinophils have important regulatory functions and may restrict infl ammation and increase plasma cell responses [19]. RANTES, the other marker that increased the odds of malaria, is produced by memory T cells and macrophages in PBMCs [18, 20] and is involved in chemoattraction of T cells and, together with IL-5, of eosinophils [18]. We speculate that IL-5 and RANTES in RTS,S/AS01E vaccinees could be acting together on eosinophils to regulate antibody responses through plasma cells, jeopardizing protective responses. IFN-, mainly produced by T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, seems to be involved in the protection mediated by pre-erythrocytic vaccines [21]. CSP-specific IFN- T-cell and NK cell responses were elicited by RTS,S vaccination in adult challenge studies [22-24] and in clinical trials from endemic areas [4, 6, 7, 9], but their eff ect on protection remains unclear. T H1 responses are involved in protection against intracellular pathogens through cell-mediated immunity, and IFN- is cru-cial for through induction of oxide [18, 21]. IL-15, dendritic cells and mono-cytes in PBMCs, is important for activation of NK and T cells, including NK T cells and CD8 + T cells, which may be involved in RTS,S/AS01E-induced cellular responses to liver-stage par-asites. GM-CSF, produced by T H1 and TH17, NK, and B cells and macrophages, ector functions in granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and IFN- secretion [25]. Therefore, IL-15 and GM-CSF could contribute to induction or enhancement of T H1-mediated protective responses. Detected age diff erences in immunogenicity are in line with immune ontogeny. Newborns have a biased cellular response toward a T H2 pro file, due to diminished TH1 and proinfl am- matory responses that persist during the first months of life and increase around 12 months of age [26, 27]. Therefore, the age diff erences in RTS,S immunogenicity may be explained by diminished responsiveness in infants that may impact any vac-cine [26, 27] depending on the adjuvant and antigen immuno- genicity. Curiously, we detected similar marker diff erences in the mock stimulations, reflecting nonspecific responses upon RTS,S/AS01E vaccination. A nonspecific eff ect of RTS,S has not Page 80 of 222RTS,S Malaria Vaccine Immune Correlates CID 2017:65 (1 September) 753been observed, but the nonspecific eff ect of other vaccines in early life has been described [28-30]. Surprisingly, despite low immunogenicity in infants, more markers were correlated with protection in infants than in children, including the TH1-related cytokines IFN-, IL-15, and TNF. On the contrary, in children, some markers including TNF were associated with increased Component 2 Component 3 VEGFTNFRANTESMIP1 MIP1 MIGMCP1IP10IL7IL5IL4IL2RIL2IL1RAIL1IL17IL15IL13IL12IL10IFNIFNHGFGMCSFGCSFFGFEotaxinEGF 0.00 .3 0.3 0.6 0.6 0.0 0.3 0.3 0.6 0.6 Loadings Component 2 Component 3 Univariate models OR (95% CI) 0.36 (0.2 0.714 0.46 (0.25 - 0.86) AUC 0.749 Figure 5.

Despite this apparent paradox, diff erent levels of cytokines may have diff erent eff For instance, moder- ate levels of cytokines like TNF have been described to control P. falciparum infection [31], but exacerbated levels are biomark- ers of proinfl ammatory responses involved in pathogenesis of malaria [32]. Also, diff erences may be given by diverse cell origin as monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, and also eff ector memory and central memory T cells may produce it. Several baseline marker ratios had an impact on postim- munization ratios in children. Responses a ffected included the immunogenicity marker IL-2, the IL-15, and IL-7, IFN-, and VEGF, which were associated with higher odds of malaria in children. This suggests that immune status and previous responses to malaria and hepati-tis B vaccine may infl uence RTS,S/AS01E immunogenicity. If malaria baseline immunity alters vaccine responses, it could further explain the lower VE in infants. Indeed, IgG data against CSP suggest that baseline levels have an impact on immuno-genicity [12]. Also, baseline cell composition and infl am- mation have previously been associated with RTS,S efficacy [33] and postvaccination responses in other vaccine studies [34-36]. Future work assessing cell phenotypes and activation, cytokine-expressing CD4 + T cells, and antibody responses to CSP and HBsAg at baseline may help confirm this hypothesis. Imbalances in age distribution across sites and the nonavail- ability of baseline samples in infants may limit the strength of some of our conclusions. Most children were from Bagamoyo and infants from Manhi\u00e7a, but because malaria transmission was similar in both sites, it is unlikely that age diff erences were confounded by study site. Finally, our study did not include samples from areas of high endemicity, nor had information about other factors, for example, coinfections that could impact vaccine responses. In summary, we identified 2 possible diff erent and antagon- istic cellular immune mechanisms induced by RTS,S/AS01E vaccination: IL-5 (and RANTES) T H2 responses associated with increased odds of malaria; and IFN- and other TH1- related responses (GM-CSF, IL-15) associated with protection. Moreover, we detected lower induction of protective T H1 and proinfl ammatory responses by RTS,S/AS01E in infants than children, whereas TH2 responses were similar, which could contribute to the decreased VE in infants. Further analysis of cytokine-expressing cells together with isotypes and specifici-ties of antibody responses to RTS,S/AS01E will clarify the role of these identified correlates in protection or lack thereof. Our findings may transcend antigen specificity and underscore the need to understand the impact of baseline immune status and factors that may modulate any pediatric vaccine responses in Africa. Our results reveal undesirable vaccine responses that may abrogate the protection of RTS,S/AS01E and other vac-cines, but that might be overcome by improved formulations. Adjuvants that modulate the immune system to support a potent T H1 response during the first months of life and avoid counteracting responses may be required.

Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland 3. University of Basel, Basel Switzerland Page 85 of 222 Introduction Malaria remained a major public health concern for many decades. Highly efficacious malaria vaccines are considered to be the cornerstone for successful malaria eradication (1). The RTS, S malaria vaccine; a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals design, is a mixture of RTS, the chimeric recombinant protein containing polypeptide region of circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), and S, the recombinant protein containing HBsAg alone (2) . RTS, S adjuvated with AS01 has been shown to be safe and to induce significant protection against Plasmodium falciparum (P.falciparum) infection and or clinical malaria in na\u00efve adult (3), semi- immune adults (4) semi- immu ne children (5,6) and infants (7,8). In previous studies, the RTS, S vaccination have proved to induce high anti-CSP IgG titre and modest cellular immune responses (9,10). However the role of cell-mediated-immunity in RTS, S-induced protection is as yet unresolved. There remained inconclusive results to the induction of cytotoxic T cells by TRS, S, although significant Th1 cytokines-mediated responses have been demonstrated (11 -19). In na\u00efve adults there are indication that cellular immunity to CSP may be important. IL-2 and IFN- g responses assessed by ex-vivo ELISpot were higher in protected than infected individual (12). In addition, analysis of IL2, IFN-g TNF and CD40L by intracellular cytometry suggested that higher CD4+ Th1 cell responses might be associated with protection. A recent study showed that frequencies of TNF and IL2 producing T effector and T effector memory cells restimulated with CSP peptide were higher in protected non-immune vaccinees (20). In African children IL2, IFN-g, and TNF cytokine responses are produced among vaccinated individuals after stimulation of fresh whole blood with CSP and HBs peptide; albeit in low magnitude with heterogeneity in the intensity of responses. In Gabonese children, IL2 CD4+ T cell responses could be detected upon CSP antigen re-stimulation after RTS, S/AS0 vaccination (17). In Tanzania, CD69 expressing T cells were present in the higher numbers in vaccinated than unvaccinated children after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with CSP and HBs peptide (21). In Mozambican infants, increased levels of secreted IFN- g, IL2, and IL4 to both Page 86 of 222 vaccine antigen components were observed in supernatants as well as IFN- and ILs by ICS up to ten weeks post dose 3 (16). Secreted IL-2 was the strongest and most frequent CSP-specific responses and was detected in more than 25% of the RTS, S/AS01 immunized infants at ten weeks post dose 3. The induction of CD8+ T cells remained inconclusive and has been detected in only this trial in Mozambique (16). However, the key question regarding the mode of action of RTS, S and the duration of protection elicited by the vaccine remain open. There is only few studies that tried to identify markers associated with RTS,S induced protection against malaria using gene expression microarrays (22,23). A study carried out in na\u00efve USA adult volunteers vaccinated with RTS, S/AS01 or RTS, S/AS02 and experimental challenged with P.falciparum showed different gene expression in four components of immunoproteasome. Those genes are responsible for processing of peptide for MHC presentation distinguished protected and no-protected individuals before the parasites challenge (24). It remains to be established whether similar patterns would apply to children from malaria endemic area naturally exposed to P.falciparum and other infections. Here we report an analysis of cellular immune responses of children enrolled, between the 5-17 months of age, in a Phase IIIb trial of RTS, S/AS01 in Bagamoyo Tanzania. Materials and methods Ethical consideration The protocol was approved by institutional review boards (IRBs) of the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI/IRB/No.A59) and National Institute for Medical Research Tanzania (NIMR/ HQ/R.8a/Vol. IX/792), and the Ethikkommission beider Basel (EKBB), Basel, (EKBB 319/11). The protocol was also approved by TFDA (Ref. No. CE.57/180/04/41), and the trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00866619). The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Before enrolment into the study, the parents or guardians of a child participants were given an inform consent form to read and upon understanding it, they were allowed to give the Page 87 of 222 will for their child to participate in trial. No child was recruited in the study without having informed consent process completed . Study site and design This ancillary immunology arm of the phase 3, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial was conducted at 11 centers in 7 African countries with a range of malaria-transmission intensity. The Ifakara health institute, Bagamoyo branch, Tanzania was part of 11 sites in seven African countries that participated in the whole study. The main trial was designed to evaluate vaccine efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity during an average period of 49 months (range: 41 -55 months) after the first dose of study vaccine in children and an average period of 41 months (range: 32 -48 months) after the first dose of study vaccine in young infants. Children with a moderate or severe illness, a major congenital defect, malnutrition requiring hospitalization, a haemoglobin concentration 5.0 g/dl, or ,8 g/dl with clinical signs of decompensation, a history of atypical febrile seizures, a neurological disorder, or WHO stage III or stage IV HIV disease at the time of recruitment were considered not eligible for participating in trial. Insecticides treated nets were provided or made available to any child who presented for screening. Blood sample collection and processing A total of 400 children aged between 5 -17 months were recruited out of 800 children enrolled for the main study. 3.8 mL of whole blood were collected into cell preparation tubes (CPT Vacutainer BD), from each child at baseline, 3, 21 and 32 months after first vaccination. Additionally, at months 20, approximately 0.2 mL blood was collected into a filter paper blood spots for the parasite genotyping. Blood were transported at room temperature to the laboratory for processing within 1 hour after collection, as this was critical for the quality and sensitivity of cell mediated immune assays. In the lab, blood were centrifuged and processed according to manufacture instructions. Plasma was separated and aliquoted into 2 mL cryovials and frozen at -80\u00baC. PBMCs were collected from the Page 88 of 222 tubes, washed, counted using Countess automated cell counter from Invitrogen and stored at -80\u00baC for 18-24 hrs before transferred into liquid nitrogen (LN2) for longer storage. At least 5 million PBMCs per volunteer per bleeding time point were frozen down in LN2 and the left over PBMC were used for fresh stimulations onsite with Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), CSP, Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and Hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg). The erythrocyte pellets form the CPT tubes were carefully collected and stored for retrospective determination of P. falciparum infections. Recovery and viability of PBMCs from Bagamoyo after thawing the cryopreserved cells To assess whether the stored PBMC are viable and the vials have the sufficient number of cells for the purpose of our analysis, subjects with more than one vials stored (N=115) were selected for participating in this pilot study. Only the baseline and month 3 PBMCs were included in this experiment. Briefly PBMC sample were thawed from the liquid nitrogen, washed, re-suspended into culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS) and then counted using GUAVA technologies (Germany). The numbers counted and the viabilities obtained from this count were recorded as day 1. The cells were then left incubated overnight with culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS) and then washed, re-suspended into culture medium and counted to obtain the recovery count. The number counted and viabilities obtained were recorded as day 2. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) To test the functionality of cryopreserved PBMCs, the rate of IFN-g/IL-2 secretion was determined using PBMCs from 115 children. The PBMC were stimulated by the CSP and HBsAg antigen which are the components of the RTS, S vaccine. Intracellular cytokine staining assays were performed and IL-2 and quantified by flow cytometry. The IL-2 and IFN-g were selected as marker of functionality based of the previous studied outcomes that showed IFN-g/IL-2 responses following vaccination with RTS, S (25). ICS was performed according to the published method by Moncunill et al (26). Briefly, PBMC samples from 115 RTS, S vaccinated children were stimulated with CSP, and HBsAg, and stained with commercial available reagents (26). The Page 89 of 222 primary measurement in this study was the cytokine response for CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets producing IFN- and/or IL -2 to CSP and HBsAg. Data was acquire by flow cytometry directly from the plates using the high throughput sampler (HTS) until reaching dead volume of at least 50 L. Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics are used to describe part icipant's recruitment patterns with relative to the villages of their origin. The Fisher's exact Test were used to calculate the IL -2/IFN-g responses rates and the difference between day 1 and day 2 viability and recovery were tested by using Mann Whitney test by using a GraphPad Prism 6 (USA). The p<0.05 were considered significant. Results Recruitment outcome and study sampling adherence Recruitment for this study took place between mid-September 2009 and February 2010. A total of 400 children were recruited at the baseline. However, only 356 met according to protocol (ATP) criteria and their data were used in this analysis. The number of recruitment for each month varied substantially with the lowest number observed at the beginning of the study recruitment, September 2009. However, the recruitment was improved on October and November, before falling again in December to February, albeit remained above the original number (Figure 1).

Time points Total PBMC collected (%) Freshly stimulated (%) Not stimulated Baseline 356 (100%) 316 (88.8%) 40 (11.2%) Month 3 353 (99.2%) Month 21 322 (90.5%) Month 32 318 (89.3%) 288 (90.6%) 30 (9.4%) Community awareness influences the number of participant recruited across the study area To investigate the influence of community responses amongst villages, we stratified the subjects groups according to their village of origin. A total of 21 villages were included in the study area. This demonstrated that, Magomeni and Kiwangwa had the highest frequency of subject participation compared to the other villages (Figure 2). Several clinical trials studies have been previously conducted in Kiwangwa and Magomeni, this could explanation the higher frequency seen in the two villages as community is aware of the clinical trials therefore it was not questionable to agree to participate.

Additionally, the overall percentage viability for the isolated PBMC at different time points was (86.1% \u00b1 0.57 million of blood) at baseline, (81.3 \u00b1 0.79 million cells/ml of blood) at month 23, (99.7 \u00b1 0.14 million cells/ml of blood) at month 32. Viability data for the month 3 samples was not obtained (Figure 4).

The data suggest an evidence of significant difference in number of PBMC recovery between thawing and resting time points, (p = 0.0072) ( Figure 5). However, our data do not show any evidence of differences in PBMCs viabilities between the day of thawing (day1) and after over-night resting in culture (day2) (p = 0.2666) ( Figure 6) Total PBMC recovered after thawing and over-night rest in culture media Figure 5 : Total viable PBMC counted upon day of thawing (day1-yield) and after over-night rest in culture media (day2- recovery).

Our data shows that the stored PBMC remained functional after 5 years of storage in LN2. Albeit in low magnitude, the CD4-T cells and not CD8 T cell were found to secret IL-2 and IFN-g cytokines ( Table 3 ). The flow cytometer gating strategies is shown in figure 7 Day Percentage Page 96 of 222 Table 3: T cell responses analysed base on their IFN-g and IL-2 secretion rate following stimulation with CSP and HBsAg of cryopreserved PBMCs from Tanzania children.

All gates for non-functional markers were defined using fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls whereas gates for functional markers were defined using the unstimulated samples. A: Gating hierarchy to identify NK cells, NKT-like cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and TFH-like cells. Initial gating is done on FSC-H and FSC-A to discriminate singlets, followed by the exclusion of events collected during a period of time early in collection when fluctuations may occur. In this example, there were no problems of fluctuations and the time gate was minimized to avoid Page 97 of 222 exclusion of any events. Dead cells and monocytes are excluded by an amine reactive dye and the CD14 marker in the same dump channel. Lymphocytes are gated using FSC-A and SSC-A. Subsequent gating (CD56dimCD3- and CD56hiCD3-) NKT-like cells (CD56+CD3+). Within the gate of lymphocytes, CD3+ cells are identified, followed by identification of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Of note, NKT-like cells are not excluded from classical T cells and therefore are overlapping populations. Finally, TFH-like cells are identified as CXCR5+ CD45RA- CD4+ T cells that have a low expression of CCR7 and arePD- 1+. B: Functional markers for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. A gate is applied for each cytokine, not taking into account the coexpression of other markers. Boolean gates are then created based on these gates to identify cells expressing different combinations of markers. C: The expression level of CCR7 and CD45RA is examined within CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets to later provide insight into the memory phenotype of the antigen specific cells. Discussion We found that the CD4 T cells but not CD8 T cells in PBMCs collected from Tanzanian children secretes IFN-g and IL-2 after stimulation with HBsAg and CSP antigen invitro. In line with our finding, the IFN-g and IL-2 secreting CD4 T cell were demonstrated in several RTS, S studies previously conducted in rhesus primate (25), naive adult individuals (20),and in children and infants living in malaria endemic regions (18). This finding implies that the quality of PBMC collected in Bagamoyo site during the course of RTS, S study was well maintained even after five years of storage in LN2. The result of this pilot study highlights the need for further analysis to evaluate in lager sample size the cellular and humoral immune responses induced by RTS, S malaria vaccine in paediatric population in natural transmission settings. Efficient recovery, higher percentage of viability and functionality of PBMCs are essential for reliable investigation of the ways in which the immune system responds to a certain interventions. However, blood sampling in paediatric population for the purpose of assessment of their immune responses has been very challenging amongst the parents, researchers and ethics committees (27). This is because the children become restless during blood draw and the mother gets nervous witnessed blood is taken from her child. In the current study we managed to collect 3.8 ml of blood from each child and isolate PBMC. From this we showed that, an average of 4.5 million lymphocytes per millilitre of blood could be Page 98 of 222 recovered from children aged between 5 and 17 months old. To date, data indicative of how many PBMCs can be obtained in a millilitre of blood collected from African children population are scarce. This study took advantage of samples collected during the RTS, S/AS01 clinical trial conducted in Bagamoyo Tanzania to establish the average number of PBMCs, their viability and functionality. This information may be helpful in planning future sample repositories or as a comparison for other immunological studies involving African paediatric population. At the beginning of the study we thought to recruit more that 90% of children within 3 months of recruitment period. However this was not achieved and instead the recruitment rate of approximately 5- 35% was attained. The possible explanation for this was that, parents needed time to digest information given during sensitization meetings and decide whether they need their child to be included in the study of not. We could show that the recruitment rate went up on the October 2009, implying that parents were content with the study information hence became willing to let their children participate. On the other hand, it could be that sensitization meetings were not sufficient enough to convince parent to participate, hence parents needed time to see what happened to those who were convinced at the first place. However, despite slow rate of recruitment, adherence was well maintained. Approximately 99% of all children recruited at baseline attended the month 3 visit and blood was drawn from them for different laboratory tests. On the subsequent visit, adherence slightly went down up to 89% by the end of the study on month 32 of follow up. Such adherence after three years of follow up suggests that the follow up system was well set and village health care workers were performing the duty of trucking the participants efficiently. The elevated frequencies of participation observed in Kiwangwa and Magomeni area remains to be revealed as the two area represent different geographical backgrounds (rural and urban respectively). Furthermore, this finding suggests that the parents were satisfied with the services they received in the context of RTS, S clinical trial benefits, the reason why they opt to continue participating for such long time. Our data also shows that an average of 93% (range 88.8% to 97.5%) of all samples collected in respective time point, the PBMCs were stimulated onsite. The ability to obtain enough number of cells for onsite stimulation reflects the availability of sufficient amount of blood from the collection clinic. Page 99 of 222 We further demonstrated that the average recovery of freshly isolated PBMCs from all the bleeding time points were 5.25 million cells/ml of blood (range 4.39 to 6.47 million cells/ml of blood). Additionally, the overall percentage viability for the isolated PBMC at different time points was 89.0% (range from 81.3% to 99.7%). The quality (viability) of PBMC stored in LN2 and quantity (numbers) is critical for generation of credible immune response data. Our data suggest an evidence of significant difference in number of PBMC recovery between thawing and resting time points. However, we could not see any evidence of differences in PBMCs viabilities between the day of thawing (day1) and after over-night resting of PBMCs in culture (day2). The difference in numbers observed between time of thawing and after resting in culture is not uncommon, as some PBMCs are lost during the washing steps of thawing procedures while the remaining PBMC showed similar viability. The major limitation for this was CPT tube that resulted in occurrence of some red blood cell contamination in the isolated PBMC hence creating difficulties in counting. The volume of blood collected from children was also variable as it was difficult to obtain the exactly stipulated blood volume form these children. Overall, we found that sufficient PBMC could be obtained from 3.8 mls of blood in African paediatric population and hence more studies in how immune responses in children responds to various interventions could possibly be conducted in African settings. Conclusion The study of cellular immune responses amongst African paediatric population remained to be challenging due to difficulties in obtaining enough blood samples. However, children are most vulnerable population for many infectious diseases. Securing adequate information on how their immune functions responds against different infections is critical for development of interventions such as drugs and vaccine for children population. Vaccine studies including malaria vaccines are conducted in paediatric population residing in malaria endemic areas, and it is hoped that results Page 100 of 222 from these studies will highlight the possibilities of involving children as the target population on validating the information obtained in previous clinical trial phases conducted in adults regarding Ag-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells responses.

Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by mosquito bite has been used to assess anti-malaria inter- ventions in >1,500 volunteers since development of methods for infecting mosquitoes by feeding on Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) gametocyte cultures. Such CHMIs have never Africa. Aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Pf sporozoites, PfSPZ Challenge, were used to infect Dutch volunteers by intradermal injection. We conducted a double- blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess safety and infectivity of PfSPZ Challenge in adult male Tanzanians. Volunteerswere N=6). PfSPZ Challenge was well tolerated and safe. Eleven of 12 and 10 of 11 subjects, who received 10,000 and 25,000 PfSPZ respectively,developed parasitemia. In 10,000 versus 25,000 PfSPZ groups geometric mean days from injection to Pf positivity by thickblood film was 15.4 versus 13.5 heterozygosity had no apparent effect on infectivity. PfSPZ Challenge was safe, well tolerated, and infectious. INTRODUCTION Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI), intentional infection of subjects with malaria parasites, has been used for treating patients with syphilis 1,2and in research for nearly ac e n t u r y .3Since the development in the 1980s of methods for infecting mosquitoes by feeding on Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) gametocyte cultures,4-6CHMI has been used repeatedly and successfully in more than 1,500 volunteers in the United States and Europe.6-10Africa suffers the most morbidity and mortality from malaria, and thus could benefit significantly by using CHMI to facilitate devel opment of new vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics for malaria, and for understanding innate andacquired resistance to the parasites that cause malaria. How-ever, until now such CHMIs had never been used in Africa. There are a number of reasons why CHMI has not been established in Africa. One is that the phase 1 clinical trialfacilities and teams necessary to safely and professionallycarry out such trials have not been available until recently for such studies. A second reason is that from 1985 to 2010, all CHMI studies in which volunteers were infected withPf sporozoites were conducted by exposure to the bites of Pf-infected Anopheles mosquitoes not native to Africa, and produced in high security facilities difficult to establish, run, and maintain in Africa. To address the first limitation, we established a phase 1 clinical trial center at the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI), Bagamoyo, Tanzania. At the sametime it became possible to manufacture purified,cryopreserved Pf sporozoites that product called PfSPZ Challenge. 11-13When young adult Dutch volunteers were injected intradermally (ID) withdoses of 2,500, 10,000, or 25,000 PfSPZ (divided into two 50 mL injections), five of six volunteers developed parasitemia in all three groups, and the time from injec-tion of PfSPZ Challenge to detection of parasites by thickblood smear was ~13 days in all three groups. Thus, there was infection, but no dose response, presumably because increasing the dose did not increase the numbers of spo-rozoites that exited the skin, entered the circulation, and invaded hepatocytes. 12 To begin the process of understanding how to use PfSPZ Challenge in Africans, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and infectivity of ID- administered PfSPZ Challenge in 30 male, highly educated,Tanzanian residents of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who hadhad minimal exposure to Pf malaria during the previous 5 years. As a bridge to the Dutch study, one group received the regimen used in one of the Dutch groups; 5,000 PfSPZ in50mL were injected ID into the deltoid area of both upper arms for a total of 10,000 PfSPZ. 12In a second group we increased the dose to 25,000 PfSPZ, and based on findings inmurine model systems, which suggested ways to improve the efficiency of ID injections, 14we divided the total dosage into four injections of 6,250 PfSPZ, each in 10 mL. As in Dutch12and British13subjects, PfSPZ Challenge was safe, well tolerated, and infectious in young adult Tanzanian males. In the bridging group the infection rate, but not thepre-patent period, was comparable to that observed for thesame dose in young adult Dutch subjects. These findings pro- vide the foundation for using CHMI with PfSPZ Challenge to assess the protective efficacy of antimalarial vaccines anddrugs in Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design and population. This single center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in Bagamoyo, *Address correspondence to Stephen L.

Thirty healthy male volunteers 20 to 35 years of age were recruited fromhigher learning institutions in Dar es Salaam. Screening for eligibility took place at the newly established Bagamoyo Clinical Trial Unit (BCTU) of the Ifakara Health Institute(IHI). Volunteers were screened using predetermined inclu-sion and exclusion criteria based on clinical examinations and laboratory tests. These included medical history and physical examinations, and standard hematology, biochemis-try, malaria, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C, and sickle cell tests. In addition subjects were screened fora-thalassemia. In the initial screening a-thalassemia trait was an exclusion criterion because of a theoretical concern that these individuals might be less susceptible to Pf infec- tion. As screening progressed it became clear that a sub-stantial proportion of the local population was heterozygousfora-thalassemia and it would be important to include this population in the volunteer pool to understand if the hetero-zygous condition was more resistant to malaria infection byexperimental challenge and pose an obstacle that would need to be addressed in future vaccine studies. Volunteers who indicated that they had not had an episode of docu-mented malaria in the past 5 years were included. They also had malaria thick smears, and any subject who was positive was excluded. Screening for a+ and a 0a-thalassemia caused by deletions. One milliliter (1 mL) of venous blood was collected inEDTA tubes and stored at 80\u00b0C. The DNA was extracted from 100 mL of whole blood with ZR Genomic DNA-Tissue MiniPrep (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA) according to manu- facturer's recommendations. We used primers to amplify the alpha 2 globin gene as a control and the 3.7 kb, 4.2 kb, and20.5 kb deletion junction fragments of the a-thalassemia variants that could be easily identified by size as described. 15 The multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primersused were a 2/3.7del F, R, a2 F, 4.2del The reaction 1 +Q-solution 2.5 U HotStarTaq poly- reaction buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)and 100 ng of genomic DNA. Reactions were carried out on a thermal cycler (Gene Amp 2700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), with an initial 15-minute denaturation at96\u00b0C, 30 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 45 seconds, 60 \u00b0C for 90 seconds, 72\u00b0C for 135 seconds, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. Following amplification, 10 mLo ft h ep r o d u c tw e r e electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel with 0.6 mg/mL ethidium bromide in 1 +TBE buffer first at 7 volts/cm for 1 hour followed by 3 volts/cm for an additional 2 hours. Thegel was visualized on an UV transilluminator. The wild-type aa/aa loci yielded a PCR product of 1,800 base pair (bp), whereas the 3.7 kb deletion, 4.2 kb deletion and 20.5 kbdeletion resulted in PCR products of 2,029 bp, 1,628 bp,and 1,007 bp, respectively. Screening for a+ and a 0a-thalassemia caused by non- deletion mutations. The three exons of each alpha 2 and alpha 1 gene were amplified and sequenced to determine all non-deletional mutations that cause a+and a0a-thalassemia. Each 25 uL reaction contained 0.5 mMo fe a c hp r i m e rh e m alpha F, hem alpha 1 R, hem alpha 2 R, and also 1 +Q-solution 2.5 U HotStarTaq DNA polymerase in supplied reaction buffer (Qiagen) and 100 ng of genomic DNA. Reactionswere carried out on a thermal cycler (Gene Amp 2700,Applied Biosystems), with an initial 15-minute denaturationat 95 \u00b0C, 38 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 20 seconds, 60 \u00b0C for 20 sec- onds, 72 \u00b0C for 90 seconds, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. Following amplification, 5 mL of product was electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel with 0.6 mg/mL ethidium bromide in 1 +TBE buffer at 7 volts/cm for 1 hour. The gel was visualized on an UV transilluminator. Resulting PCR products were purified a QIAquick PCR Purifica- tion Kit (Qiagen) and with theBig Dye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kit on an ABI 3130XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The Sequence reads were aligned against reference genes for hemoglobin alpha 1and 2 (NCBI Gene ID: 3039 and 3040, GRCh37.p10) and polymorphisms were identified according to human dbSNP (Build 137). Sequence analysis was done by the Geneious 6.1.5software package. All volunteers gave written informed consent before screening and being enrolled in the study. The trial wasperformed in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, anInvestigational New Drug (IND) application filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) (IND 14267), and an Investigational Medical Product Dossier (IMPD) filedwith the Tanzanian Food and Drug Administration (TFDA). The protocol was approved by institutional review boards (IRBs) of the Ifakara Health Institute ((IHI/IRB/No25) andNational Institute for Medical Research Tanzania (NIMR/ HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/1217) ,a n dt h eE t h i k k o m m i s s i o nb e i d e rB a s e l (EKBB), Basel, Switzerland (EKBB 319/11). The protocol was also approved by TFDA (Ref. No. CE.57/180/04A/50), and the trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01540903). Intervention and randomization. the production, ervation quality potency, and CHMI have been described.11-13,18,19The lot of PfSPZ Challenge used in this study had been manufactured and then cryopreserved inliquid nitrogen vapor phase (LNVP) 12 months beforeadministration. It was a different lot than the lot used inthe Netherlands 12; however, it was the same lot that was used in Oxford in which 5 of 6 volunteers who received2,500 PfSPZ ID and 6 of 6 volunteers who received25,000 PfSPZ IM developed malaria. 13The results of the integrity (viability) and 6-day hepa-tocyte potency assay (potency) were similar to those forthe previous trials (Supplemental Table 1). 12,13 Thirty eligible volunteers were randomly allocated to the experimental (PfSPZ Challenge) or control (normalsaline) groups. Twenty-four volunteers received Saline Flush Syringe, Columbus, volunteers and clinicians were blinded as to whether thevolunteers received PfSPZ Challenge or normal saline. CHMI. Administration of PfSPZ Challenge and immedi- ate follow-up. PfSPZ Challenge was administered ID in two different dose groups. Twelve volunteers were inocu- lated with 10,000 PfSPZ ID in two injection sites, one 50mLi n j e c t i o ni ne a c hd e l t o i d ,e a c hi n j e c t i o nc o n t a i n i n g 5,000 PfSPZ. Twelve volunteers were inoculated with 25,000 PfSPZ ID in four injection sites, two 10 mLi n j e c t i o n s in each deltoid, each injection containing 6,250 PfSPZ. Three control volunteers were assigned to each of the two dose472 SHEKALAGHE AND OTHERS Page 107 of 222groups and were inoculated with normal saline in the same way as those in that experimental group. Immediately before use, a vial of PfSPZ Challenge was thawed and diluted with phosphate buffered saline con-taining human serum albumin in an aseptic environment. Itwas then injected by a blinded nurse within 30 minutesof thawing. After injection, volunteers were observed in the injection room for at least 5 minutes and thereafter were escorted by a nurse to the ward. Diagnosis of malaria. Thick blood smears were obtained every 12 hours on Days 5 through 14 after injection withsaline or PfSPZ Challenge and daily on Days 15 through21 until positive or until Day 21. After initiation of treat- ment of a positive thick smear, thick smears were assessed until three consecutive daily smears were negative after treat-ment. Thick smears were also assessed on Day 28 after CHMI. Slide preparation and reading was performed following a standard procedure. In brief, 10 mL of blood was placed uniformly on a 10 mm +20 mm area of the slide, air dried, and stained with Giemsa, pH 7.2. Microscopes were cali- brated and the number of passes/fields required to read 0.5mL blood was determined. This amount of blood was assessed for the primary reads to determine if the slide was negative. If the volunteer was symptomatic, double this amount of blood was read. A blood smear was declaredpositive when one reader saw two parasites in 0.5 mL of blood and the presence of parasites was independentlyconfirmed by a second reader. The pre-patent period wasdefined as the period between inoculation of PfSPZ Chal-lenge and appearance of the first positive blood smear. Retrospectively, parasitemias were also determined by quan- titative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) performed on allsamples collected after CHMI, as previously described. 20 Treatment of malaria. Those who became smear positive were treated with a standard 3-day regimen of artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem), and were discharged after three con- secutive negative smear results. Those who did not become positive during the first 21 days after CHMI were dischargedand returned on Day 28. On this day, the study was unblindedand those who had received PfSPZ Challenge and had not developed infection were treated with artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem) irrespective of the blood smear results. All volun-teers were seen on Days 56 and 168. Assessment of adverse events. The volunteers were observed in the ward for 24 hours after administration of PfSPZ Chal-lenge and discharged to home. They were given diaries and thermometers for recording of adverse events and tempera- tures. Volunteers returned on Day 5 after administration ofPfSPZ Challenge for admission to the ward for assessment of safety and diagnosis and treatment of malaria. During the period of follow-up all symptoms and signs (solicited and unsolicited) were recorded and graded by the attending physician as follows: mild (easily tolerated), moderate (interferes with normal activity), or severe (pre- vents normal activity). Axillary temperature was recorded asgrade 1 ( >37.5-38.0 Hematological and biochemical parameters were assessed minimally on Days 5, 9, 12, 28, 56, and 168after inoculation of PfSPZ Challenge, and on the day of parasite positivity (day of initiating treatment). For those individuals who did not become positive by thick blood smear,these assays were also conduct ed on Days 15, 18, and 21 afterinoculation of PfSPZ Challenge. Results were graded accord-ing to a predetermined table (Supplemental Table 2 adaptedfrom FDA guidelines, http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Biologics BloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ Guidances/Vaccines/ucm091977.pdf). Adverse events weredivided into those that occurred during the 5 days after inocu-lation of PfSPZ Challenge, and were attributed to the admin- istration of the study product, and those that occurred from Day 6 onward, and were attributed to Pf infection (malaria). The possibility of cardiac damage was assessed, because a cardiac-related serious adverse event (SAE) had beenreported in 2007 in the Netherlands in a volunteer who wasimmunized with an experimental Pf subunit vaccine, under- went CHMI by exposure to the bites of five Pf-infected mosquitoes, developed malaria, and was treated with an anti-malarial. 21In case symptoms or signs that could be related to a cardiac event developed during the study, blood was collected at baseline to be able to determine if there was any difference in the results of assays used to assess cardiac damage (e.g.,troponins) before the trial began and at the time of such an event. We note that after our clinical trial in Tanzania, another cardiac event occurred in a volunteer in a PfSPZ-CVac vaccine trial in the Netherlands after CHMI by mos- quito bite, diagnosis of malaria, and initiation of treatment. 22 Genotyping of parasites. At the time of diagnosis and before treatment 4 mL of blood were collected for geno-typing by microsatellite analysis to determine if the para- sites were derived from PfSPZ Challenge (Pf NF54) or froma naturally acquired infection. The DNA was isolated fromblood specimens using the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen). markers Poly alpha, amplified and (ATCC-MR4, ManassasVA) were included to determine characteristic peak mor-phology for each microsatellite locus and control for slightvariations among runs. Microsatellite peaks above the threshold of 100 relative fluorescent units exhibiting charac- teristic morphology were scored. Peak sizes were deter-mined by manual inspection of each electropherogram and then normalized against the Pf 3D7 control. Normalized peak sizes were compared with those observed in Pf NF54. Statistical analysis. Data analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).Descriptive statistics were assessed, specifically the geometricmean, for the parasitemia results. Thick blood smear and qPCR results were compared between the 10,000 and 25,000 PfSPZ groups using a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon rank-sum effects of a-thalassemia hetero- zygosity on parasitemia were compared within each group by non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, two-tailed). Proportions were compared using c 2test (two-tailed). RESULTS Volunteers. In total 323 volunteers were recruited from higher learning institutions during the first informationmeeting. Out of these, 30 met eligibility criteria and wereenrolled and randomized to the 10,000 PfSPZ dose ( N=12),INJECTION OF TANZANIANS P. dose ( N=12), or control ( N=6) groups (Figure 1 and Table 1). In groups 1, 2, and the control group, 7, 1, and 2 volunteers were heterozygous for thea-thalassemia trait, respectively. Parasitemia. Thick blood smear. Eleven volunteers who received 10,000 PfSPZ (Table 2A) and 10 volunteers whoreceived 25,000 PfSPZ (Table 2B) developed parasitemia detected by thick blood smear and confirmed by qPCR. One of the other two subjects in the 25,000 PfSPZ groupwas treated for a false positive thick blood smear on Day 11 (qPCR was negative), and was eliminated from the analysis. The second other volunteer in the 25,000 PfSPZgroup was treated for a false positive thick blood smear onDay 19; qPCR was negative throughout for this volunteer, and this volunteer was considered to have not developedparasitemia as no subject in the study developed parasitemiaby qPCR after Day 16, and this volunteer was followed by qPCR through Day 19. Thus, 11 of 12 volunteers in the10,000 PfSPZ group and 10 of 11 evaluable volunteers in the 25,000 PfSPZ group developed Pf parasitemia after ID injec- tion of PfSPZ Challenge. Volunteers in the 10,000 PfSPZgroup had a significantly different pre-patent period than in the 25,000 PfSPZ group (geometric mean [GM] of 15.4 and 13.5 days, Wilcoxon, P=0.023). The GM parasite densities were 8.9 and 7.0 parasites/ mLb l o o d ,r e s p e c t i v e l y ,a tt h et i m e of first thick smear positivity. qPCR. Parasitemia was determined by collected after CHMI. The qPCR was performed retro-spectively, after volunteers had been diagnosed and treated. The sensitivity of qPCR was considered to be 20 parasites/mL of blood. The qPCRs were first positive 9.0 to 16.0 days afterinoculation of PfSPZ Challenge (Table 2). Consistent with thick blood smear results, the volunteers in the 10,000 PfSPZ group had a longer time to positive qPCR than those in the25,000 PfSPZ group (GM of 12.6 and 11.1 days, respectively), however the difference did not reach the level of statistical significance (Wilcoxon, P=0.076). The GM parasite densities were 0.11 and 0.16 parasites/ mL blood (110 and 160 parasites/ mL blood), respectively, at the time of first qPCR positivity.The GM parasite densities by qPCR at the time of thick smeardiagnosis in the two groups were 4.1 and 1.6 parasites/ mL, respectively. qPCR was negative throughout the 21-day follow- up for the slide-negative volunteer who received 10,000 PfSPZ, and through Day 19 for the subje ct who received 25,000 PfSPZ and was treated on Day 19. It was also negative in all normal saline controls, except for one specimen on Day 19, which was determined to be caused by mislabeling of a specimenfrom a PfSPZ Challenge subject. Parasite growth was cyclical and similar in both dose groups (Figure 2). Using a pre- viously described method, 25the parasite multiplication rate in the bloodstream could not be determined with confidencebecause of the high variability of the amplification dynamics among individual subjects. However, there did not appear to Figure 1. Flow chart of recruitment and study design.

Parasites from the positive volunteers were genotyped at six polymorphic microsatellite loci to con-firm from PfSPZ Challenge (Pf NF54) and notacquired by natural exposure to infected mosquitoes in theBagamoyo area. Parasites from all 21 volunteers had identi- cal microsatellite signatures to Pf NF54 (Table 3), indicat- ing that they were infected with the challenge strain andnot locally transmitted Pf parasites. Later, on Days 67 and 89 after CHMI, two volunteers developed Pf malaria. These infections were also genotyped and both carried non-PfNF54 alleles at all six microsatellite loci (Table 3), indicat- ing that they were infected with naturally acquired, locally transmitted Pf parasites. Effect of a-thalassemia heterozygosity on parasitemia. The GM parasite density for volunteers who were heterozygousfora-thalassemia and those who were non- a-thalassemic in the 10,000 PfSPZ were not significantly different at thetime of detection of parasites by microscopy, 11.1 versus 6.9 Pf/ mLb l o o d ,r e s p e c t i v e l y( W i l c o x o n , P=0.5498) (Table 4). The GM time to blood smear positivity (pre-patent period) was also not significantly different heterozygous and non- a-thalassemia volunteers, 15.4 and 15.4 days, respectively, in the 10,000 PfSPZ group (Wilcoxon,P=0.7922). In the 25,000 PfSPZ group, the parasite den-sities at the time of detection of parasites by microscopywas 4.0 parasites/ mL blood in the one a-thalassemia hetero- zygous volunteer and 7.4 parasites/ mL blood (GM) in non- a- thalassemia volunteers. The time to blood slide positivity in thesingle a-thalassemia heterozygous subject was no different from GM time to blood slide positivity in the non- a-thalassemia subjects, 12.7 versus 13.6 days (Table 4). Adverse events (AEs). Clinical adverse events. A summary of the number of volunteers in each group with AEs duringthe 28 days after injection of normal saline or PfSPZ Chal- lenge is shown in Table 5. The occurrence of AEs was similar in all groups. Most AEs recorded after administra-tion of PfSPZ were consistent with symptoms and/or signs associated with clinical malaria. Table 6 provides the total number of AEs that occurred during Days 0- 28 broken down by Grade (1-3); 75% were Grade 1. Table 7 delineates the specific solicited and unsolicited AEs that occurred during Days 0- 28 after injection of normal saline or PfSPZ Challenge. There were 63 AEs in groups 2 (10,000 PfSPZ)and 3 (25,000 PfSPZ) and only nine of the 63 AEs (14%) occurred during the first 5 days after injection of PfSPZ Challenge. There were no acute systemic allergic reactionsafter the injection. The most common study-related events were headache, malaise, fatigue, and arthralgia, all symp- toms consistent with malaria. Surprisingly, saline controlsubjects who did not have malaria had these symptomsTable 2 A.

Review of this thick blood smear indicated that it was negative, and all qPCR results on this volunteer were negative. Thus, this volunteer was considered as negative for Plasmodium falciparum infection for subsequent analyses, because no volunteers first became qPCR positive on Day 19 or later. This volunteer was treated on Day 11 as a result of reporting of a positive thick blood smear. Review of this thick blood smear indicated it was negative, and all qPCR results on this volunteer were negative. Thus, it is not known if this volunteer would have developed Plasmodium falciparum infection, and this volunteer has been excluded from the analysis. Thus, 11 volunteers were considered to be in this group, and 10 were documented to have developed P. falciparum parasitemia.INJECTION OF TANZANIANS WITH P.

There were two subjects who had unrelated SAEs in thisstudy. The first SAE was in a 26-year-old volunteer whowas diagnosed as having gastroenteritis/dysentery of grade 3 severity at the time of hospitalization, which was 33 days post administration of PfSPZ Challenge. The second SAEoccurred in a 22-year-old volunteer who was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with severe malaria (axillary temperature >40\u00b0C, altered mental status, and smear posi- tive) on day 89 after administration of PfSPZ Challenge (thevolunteer was previously treated and successfully cleared ofparasites on Day 14 post inoculation of PfSPZ Challenge).Parasites taken from this volunteer at the time of diagno- sis of severe malaria were genotyped using microsatellite markers, and these parasites were shown not to be the PfNF54 parasites in PfSPZ Challenge (see above, and Table 3). Both volunteers with SAEs recovered uneventfully. Laboratory white blood cell count, platelet count)were assessed beginning on Day 5 after inoculation of normal Figure 2.

When assessed on Day 5 after inoculation of normal saline and PfSPZ Challenge, labora-tory abnormalities were infrequent and self-limited and simi- lar in incidence rate among all three groups (Supplemental Table 3). From Day 6 to Day 28 post inoculation the inci-dence rate of abnormalities was slightly increased, but theincidence rate of abnormalities was similar in normal salinecontrols and those who received PfSPZ Challenge (Supple- mental Table 3). DISCUSSION In this study, we showed for the first time that inoculation of healthy, young adult, African males with aseptic, purified, cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites, a product called PfSPZ Challenge, was safe, well tolerated, and infective. Infact, the infection rates in the Tanzanians were as good, ifnot better than the infection rates in young adult Dutch with no previous exposure to malaria. 12 Eleven of 12 subjects who received 10,000 PfSPZ ID in two divided 50 mL doses and 10 of 11 who received 25,000 PfSPZ ID in four divided 10 mL doses became parasitemic. In the Netherlands, 5 of 6 who received 10,000 and 5 of 6 who received 25,000 PfSPZ ID in two divided 50 mL doses became parasitemic. However, the GM pre-patent period for the Tanzanians who received the 10,000 PfSPZ dosage regimen was15.4 days, and the GM pre-patent period for the Dutch was 12.6 days ( P=0.0192, Wilcoxon 2-tailed). There are multiple possible explanations for the prolonged pre-patent period in the Tanzanians. One is that naturally acquired immunity reduced the number of parasites that invaded or fully developed in the liver, thereby reducing the numbers ofparasites that were released from the liver and prolongingthe pre-patent period. Another possibility is that the repli- cation rate in the blood was reduced as a result of natu- rally acquired immunity or innate resistance, and that thisreduced replication prolonged the pre-patent period. Unfor- tunately, the variability in the qPCR results did not allow for definitively determining if this was the case, but it appearedTable 3 Microsatellite genotypes of Pf infections in volunteers after PfSPZ Challenge Strain or sample Loci * PfPK2 TA40 ARA2 TA87 controls HB3 131 178 190 205 61 103 3D7 122 148 166 220 64 94 NF54 122 148 166 220 64 94 Post-CHMI infections 7059065 122 148 166 220 64 94 8059066 122 148 166 220 64 949059067 122 148 166 220 64 942058376 122 148 166 220 64 943059070 122 148 166 220 64 944059071 122 148 166 220 64 94 5059072 122 148 166 220 64 - 6059073 122 148 166 220 64 94 7059074 122 148 166 220 64 948059075 122 148 166 220 64 949059076 122 148 166 220 64 941059077 122 148 166 220 64 942059078 122 148 166 220 64 94 3059079 122 148 166 220 64 94 4059080 122 148 166 220 64 945059081 122 148 166 220 64 943059088 122 148 166 220 64 947059083 122 148 166 220 64 948059084 122 148 166 220 64 94 9059085 122 148 166 220 64 94 6059082 122 148 166 220 64 94 Subsequent infections 4155794 118 155 157 228 59 1037060514 118 155 163 217 87 88 Gray shading indicates microsatellite alleles shared with NF54. *Numbers represent microsatellite in nucleotide base pairs, as determined by capillary electrophoresis.

FALCIPARUM SPOROZOITES 477 Page 112 of 222that the replication rate was similar to the 11.5-fold replica- tion rate every 48 hours seen in the Dutch volunteers.12 Thus, we do not know why the pre-patent period was longer in the Tanzanians. However, because the replica-tion rates seemed to be similar in the Dutch and Tanzanian subjects, we think that there may have been fewer mero- zoites released from the livers of the Tanzanians. Interestingly, the GM pre-patent period in the group that received 25,000 PfSPZ was significantly different (13.5 days)than was the pre-patent period in the group that received10,000 PfSPZ (15.4 days) (P =0.023). This 2-day difference can only partially be accounted for by increasing the numbersof PfSPZ by 2.5-fold. It is likely that more efficient adminis-tration of the PfSPZ contributed to the delay by increasing the number of sites of administration from two to four and decreasing the volume of the injections from 50 to 10 mL, as we have seen in mice. 14 Hemoglobinopathies, disorders of hemoglobin structure, and production, are one of the most common monogenicdisorders in humans. a-thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy resulting from deletion of one ( a) or both ( -)agenes from chromosome 16. Its wide distribution in populations livingin places like Tanzania, where malaria has been or still ispresent, has been hypothesized to result from protection against severe or lethal malaria. 26This study was not designed (i.e. powered) to be able to assess the differences in infection rates, pre-patent periods, and parasite densitiesbetween individuals with and without a-thalassemia trait. Nonetheless, there was no indication of any differencesbetween those carrying this trait and those who did nothave it. This finding is consistent with a number of fieldstudies that showed that individuals who were heterozygous or homozygous for a-thalassemia had similar rates of asymp- tomatic parasitemia and similar manifestations of uncompli- cated malaria as non-thalassemic individuals. 27 Administration of PfSPZ Challenge was extremely well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events. In fact, the incidence rate of AEs was the same in the control groupthat received normal saline as it was in the groups thatreceived PfSPZ Challenge (Tables 5 -7). Very few of the AEs occurred during the first 5 days after inoculation ofPfSPZ Challenge, and thus very few were attributed to the injection of PfSPZ Challenge (Table 7). Most occurred during the period when the volunteers were being diag-nosed with Pf parasitemia and being treated. However, evenduring this period the incidence rate was similar in thecontrol and experimental groups. One of the striking find- ings was how few symptoms and signs attributable to Pf parasitemia were experienced by the subjects who developedmalaria. In the Dutch study 9 of 18 volunteers reported fever,whereas only 2 of 24 ( P=0.004, Fisher's exact test, 2-tailed) reported fever in this study. In the Netherlands 5 of 18 had chills, whereas in this study only 1 of 24 had chills (P=0.068). 12We assume this low level of symptoms and signs was attributable to naturally acquired or innate immu-nity, which ameliorated clinical manifestations. A panel of six polymorphic microsatellite loci was success- fully used to identify challenge strain (Pf NF54) infections and differentiate them from naturally acquired P. falciparum parasites circulating in Bagamoyo. This technique has been previously shown to be highly effective at differentiating genetic variants of P. falciparum within countries and acrossTable 5 Number of volunteers with clinical adverse events, Days 0 -28 post injection * Saline control (N=6)Group 1 (10,000 PfSPZ) (N=12)Group 2 (25,000 PfSPZ) (N=12) Adverse events (no. of volunteers, %)n( % ) n( % ) n( % ) Any adverse event 6 (100) 9 (75) 9 (75) Serious adverse event 0 0 0 Solicited adverse event 6 (100) 9 (75) 9 (75) Unsolicited adverse event 2 (33) 6 (50) 2 (17) *Av o l u n t e e rw a sc o u n t e da tm o s to n c ew i t h i ne a c he v e n tt y p e .

Although microsatellites are useful in identifying the infecting strain, they do not provide infor-mation on genetic regions of vaccine-induced selection orescape following heterologous challenge. Future studies will include genome-wide characterization of breakthrough infec- tions in PfSPZ Vaccine andidentify loci under vaccine-induced immune selection. Thisapproach may help to pinpoint the genetic regions encod-ing the key antigens responsible for driving strain-specific immune responses and inform the development of next- generation multivalent whole organism vaccines in the eventthat efficacy is found to be strain-specific. In conclusion, we have established the foundation for using CHMI with PfSPZ Challenge in Africans to establish the efficacy of new interventi ons against malaria and to study the mechanisms of protection conferred by hemoglobinopathies, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies, and innateand acquired immunity to malaria in settings where malaria is endemic. Improvements in administration, such as direct venous inoculation (DVI) (Mordmueller B, submitted), willsoon be used in Bagamoyo in CHMI studies to assess theprotective efficacy of the PfSPZ Vaccine 19in Tanzanians.

Controlled human malaria infections (CHMIs) using cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozo- ites provide a unique opportunity to study differences in acquisition or recall of antimalaria immune responses in individualsfrom different transmission settings and genetic backgrounds. In this study, we compared antiparasite humoral and cellular im-mune responses in two cohorts of malaria-naive Dutch volunteers and Tanzanians from an area of low malarial endemicity, whowere subjected to the identical CHMI protocol by intradermal injection of P. falciparum sporozoites. Samples from both trials were analyzed in parallel in a single center to ensure direct comparability of immunological outcomes. Within the Tanzaniancohort, we distinguished one group with moderate levels of preexisting antibodies to asexual P. falciparum lysate and another that, based on P. falciparum serology, resembled the malaria-naive Dutch cohort. Positive P. falciparum serology at baseline was associated with a lower parasite density at rst detection by quantitative PCR (qPCR) after CHMI than that for Tanzanianvolunteers with negative serology. Post-CHMI, both Tanzanian groups showed a stronger increase in anti- P. falciparum anti- body titers than Dutch volunteers, indicating similar levels of B-cell memory independent of serology. In contrast to the Dutch,Tanzanians failed to increase P. falciparum-specic in vitro recall gamma interferon (IFN- /H9253) production after CHMI, and in- nate IFN-/H9253 responses were lower in P. falciparum lysate-seropositive individuals than in seronegative individuals. In conclu- sion, positive P. falciparum lysate serology can be used to identify individuals with better parasite control but weaker IFN- /H9253re- sponses in circulating lymphocytes, which may help to stratify volunteers in future CHMI trials in areas where malaria is endemic. In 2012, Plasmodium falciparum malaria caused an estimated 207 million cases and 627,000 deaths, of which 90% occurred in children under 5 years of age and in pregnant women in sub- Saharan Africa ( 1). Major control efforts have been implemented with some success ( 2,3), but malaria eradication will likely require a safe and highly protective vaccine. Subunit vaccines have thus farshown moderate efcacy at best. RTS,S is the only vaccine candi-date in phase 3 trials but, despite averting substantial numbers ofmalaria cases (4), shows only 30 to 50% reduction in clinical dis-easeafter 12 months depending on both age and malaria endemic- ity and even less after 18 months ( 5-7). These results stress the need for more effective second-generation vaccines. Key require-ments are not only the identication of novel immunogens butalso a better understanding of protection-related immune re-sponses. This includes the effect of previous malaria exposure onimmune responses upon reexposure or vaccination ( 8,9). During the past 3 decades, controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) trials have become an indispensable tool not only in as-sessing the efcacy of candidate vaccines ( 10,11) but also in eval- uating immune responses induced by exposure to the malaria par- asite (12-15). CHMI trials have so far been performed in countrieswere malaria is not endemic in previously unexposed individuals (11,16-19). A logical next step is to study the potential differences in the acquisition, maintenance, or recall of immune responses in individuals from different transmission settings and genetic back- grounds (20, 21). The availability of aseptic, puried, cryopre- served, live P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZs; PfSPZ Challenge) (22) opens up opportunities to carry out CHMI trials in countrieswhere malaria is endemic, since it bypasses the need for infecting local Anopheles mosquitoes with P. falciparum or importing P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes to the trial site. The rst PfSPZ Challenge trial in malaria-naive Dutch volunteers demonstratedan infectivity rate of 83% after intradermal injections, indepen-dent of the dose given ( 23). Recently, PfSPZ Challenge was used forthe rst time during a CHMI trial in healthy adult male Tan- Received 10 December 2014 Returned for modication 26 January 2015 Accepted 9 March 2015 Accepted manuscript posted online 16 March 2015 Citation Obiero JM, Shekalaghe SL, Abdulla S, Sauerwein RW, Scholzen A. 2015.

As a follow-up, we here present results of the malaria-specic humoral and cellular immune responses in Tanzanians and Dutch volun- teers who were inoculated same number oflive PfSPZs during these CHMI studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Human ethics statement. The Dutch trial (23) was approved by the Cen- tral Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects of The Nether- lands (NL31858.091.10) and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, identier NCT 01086917. The Tanzanian trial (24) was approved by institutional review boards of the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI/IRB/No25), the Na- tional Institute for Medical Research Tanzania (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/1217), the Ethikkommission beider Basel (EKBB), Basel, Switzerland(EKBB 319/11), and the Tanzanian Food and Drug Administration (ref-erence no. CE.57/180/04A/50) and registered at Clinicaltrials.gov, identi- erNCT 01540903. All study teams complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice, including monitoring of data, and allvolunteers gave written informed consent. Clinical trial design. Samples for immunological analysis were ob- tained from two CHMI trials ( at Radboud University Medical Center, Ni- jmegen, The Netherlands, was composed of 18 healthy Dutch subjectsbetween the ages of 19 and 30 years with no history of malaria. Any vol-unteer who was positive for P. falciparum serology or had resided in an area where malaria is endemic within the previous 6 months was excludedfrom the trial. Three groups (n /H110056 per group) were infected by intrader- mal injections of 2,500, 10,000, or 25,000 cryopreserved PfSPZs (NF54strain). By day 21, 15/18 volunteers had developed parasites detectable bypositive blood thick smear (TS), 5/6 in each group (23). There were nodifferences in parasite densities at diagnosis between the three dose groups (23). For immunological analysis, nine P.falciparum-positive volunteers of the 10,000 (n /H110054) and 25,000 (n /H110055) PfSPZ dose groups were selected based on availability of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs). The second trial was carried out in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, with volun- teers residing in Dar es Salaam (an area where malaria is hypoendemic).Twenty-four males between 20 to 35 years of age were enrolled and con-rmed to be free of parasites by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Sub-jects with a self-reported history of clinical malaria in the previous 5 yearswere excluded. The volunteers were divided into two groups with 12 vol-unteers per group and infected by intradermal injections of either 10,000or 25,000 PfSPZs (NF54 strain). A total of 21/24 became both qPCR andblood smear positive by day 21 after infection ( 24). The three P.falci- parum-negative volunteers were excluded from analysis in the presentstudy. PBMCs, citrate anticoagulated plasma samples from Dutch volun- teers, and serum samples from Tanzanian volunteers were collected andcryopreserved 1 day before challenge (pre-CHMI) and after treatment(post-CHMI; day 35 and day 28 after infection). DNA extraction and qPCR analysis. A total of 5 /H9262l Zap-Oglobin II lytic reagent (Beckman Coulter) was added to 500 /H9262l of EDTA blood, after which the samples were mixed and stored at /H1100280\u00b0C. DNA extraction and quantication of parasitemia by qPCR in the Dutch CHMI trial were performed in Nijmegen as described previously(25), with slight modications. Briefly, after thawing, samples were spikedwith murine white blood cells as an extraction control, and DNA was extracted with a MagnaPure LC isolation station. For detection of theextraction control and P. falciparum, primers for the murine albumin gene and P. falciparum 18R rRNA were (FAM) was used. DNA extraction and qPCR in the Tanzanian trial were carried out at the Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands, as de-scribed previously ( 26). Phocine herpesvirus 1 (PhHV-1) was added to theisolation lysis buffer to serve as an internal control. For quantication of PhHV, the primers GGGCGAATCACAGATTGAATC and GCGGTTCC probe Cy5-TTTTTATGTGTCCGCCACCATCTGGATC were used. P. falciparum (NF54 strain) standard curves for both qPCR assays were prepared in Nijmegen by titration of ring-stage-infected red blood cells(RBC) in uninfected human blood. The two qPCR assays in both siteswere conrmed to yield the same results when quantifying the P. falcipa- rumcontent in sequential samples from four CHMI volunteers. Parasite material for immunological analysis. The P. falciparum NF54 strain used in both CHMI trials is the parental strain of the 3D7clone (27). P.falciparum (NF54 strain) semiautomated culture system and reg-ularly screened for mycoplasma contamination. For in vitro stimulation assays, asynchronous parasites harvested at a parasitemia of approxi-mately 10 to 20% were puried by a 63% Percoll densitygradient obtain mature asexual stages. This resulted in concentrationsof parasitemia levels of about 80 to 90%, consisting of more than 95%schizonts/mature trophozoites. P. falciparum-infected RBC (PfRBC) were washed twice in RPMI, cryopreserved in glycerol-containing freeze me- dium, and in stimulation assays. Mock-cultured unin-fected erythrocytes (uRBC) were obtained similarly and control. P. falciparum lysate for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protease inhibitor for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Recombinant and synthetic proteins. Recombinant proteins of cir- cumsporozoite protein (CSP) and liver-stage antigen 1 (LSA-1) were usedto probe humoral responses toward preerythrocytic stages, while crude P. falciparum lysates were used to assess antibody reactivity toward blood stages. Apical membrane protein 1 (AMA-1) and exported protein 1(EXP-1) are expressed in both preerythrocytic and asexual stages. Full-length P. falciparum NF54 CSP with repeats was produced in Escherichia coli by Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Ltd., Pune, India. A re- combinant LSA-1 construct, LSA-NRC, was expressed in E. coli, incorpo- rating the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein and two of the cen-trally placed 17-amino-acid repeats for the 3D7 LSA-1 sequence(PlasmoDB-PF3D7_1036400) (28). Both the N- and C-terminal regionsaswell as the repeats are highly conserved between NF54 and 3D7. The major difference is the greater number of repeats, which are the primarytarget of anti-LSA-1 antibodies (29), in the NF54 sequence than in the 3D7sequence (30). Amino acids 25 to 545 of codon-optimized AMA-1 of theP. falciparum FVO strain were expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (31,32). A peptide covering the C-terminal amino acids 73 to162 of the integral parasitophorous vacuolar membrane protein EXP-1 (Swiss-Prot Database primary chemically synthesized using solid-phase 9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry and differs from the 3D7 sequence only by a single amino acid in position 160 (33).

Thereactivity for each antigen in undiluted HIT serum was dened as 100arbitrary units (AUs). Optical density (OD) values were converted intoAUs by using the four-parameter logistic curve t using the AuditableData Analysis and Management System for ELISA (ADAMSEL-v1.1; http: //www.malariaresearch.eu/content/software ). Foreach antigen, all time points of an individual volunteer were as- sayed on the same plate. To determine whether Tanzanians had a positiveP. falciparum serology (by recognition of P. falciparum lysate), the mean (/H110012 standard deviations [SD]) baseline antibody titer against P. falcipa- rumlysate of the Dutch volunteers was used as the cutoff for positivity. In vitro PBMC stimulation assay to assess cellular responses. Ve- nous whole blood was collected into citrated Vacutainer CPT cell by density gradi-ent centrifugation, washed three times in cold PBS, counted, frozen at 10 7 cells/ml in fetal calf serum (FCS) with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and storedin vapor-phase nitrogen. After being thawed, PBMCs were counted andcultured at a concentration of 500,000 cells/well in a 96-well round-bot-tom plate and stimulated in duplicate at a ratio of 1:2 with 10 6P. falcipa- rum NF54-infected RBC or uRBC for either 24 h or 6 days in a total volume of 200 /H9262l. Flow cytometry. Cells were stained and analyzed by flow cytometry either directly ex vivo or after 24 h or 6 days of in vitro stimulation. Cells were stained rst for viability with LIVE/DEAD xable Aqua dead cellstain (Invitrogen) or xable 780 (eBioscience) andlater with three different eBioscience); for the ex vivo stain, the only changes from the previous stain were V500 (clone SP342; (MAbs) depending on the staining panels. After 30 min of incu-bation at RT, cells were washed and permeabilized with Foxp3 x/permbuffer (eBioscience) for 30 min on flow cytometer (Dako/Beckman Coulter) and analyzed usingFlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.) version 9.6. All assays were conductedwith the same batches of PfRBC and uRBC, with all time points of onevolunteer assayed in one experiment to prevent interassay variations. Nat-ural killer T cells (NKT) and gamma delta T cells ( /H9253/H9254T) were analyzed in the same gate and henceforth are referred to as NKT-/H9253/H9254T cells. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 5. Differences within the cohorts and between time points wereanalyzed per volunteer by a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test andthose between groups were analyzed by a Mann-Whitney U test. Therelationship between baseline antibody titers and the increase in antibodytiters was analyzed by Spearman correlation, and Pvalues of /H110210.05 were considered statistically signicant. Cellular responses were corrected forthe background by subtracting responses to uRBC from responses toPfRBC for each sample; resulting negative values were set to zero. RESULTS Tanzanian volunteers have higher baseline antibody titers than Dutch subjects. Pre-CHMI antibody titers were signicantly higher in Tanzanian than in the malaria-naive Dutch volunteersfor crude P. falciparum lysate (P /H110210.03), /H110012 SD) titers of Dutch vol- unteers. This was also true for pre-CHMI antibodies to the indi-vidual parasite antigens and CSP (P /H11021 0.04; 15/21), and the same trend was found for (P /H110210.06; 8/21) (Fig. 1A). Elevated LSA-1 antibody titers were found in 5/21Tanzanians, but there was no signicant difference between Dutch and Tanzanians at the group level (P /H110210.16). Within the Tanzania cohort, there was a wide range of pre-CHMI antibody responses, with some volunteers showing only low responses, comparable to those ofthe Dutch cohort. To address whether there was a general division into high and low responders to malaria antigens, we stratied Tan-zanian individuals based on their reactivity to P. falciparum a large number higher). The same trend was found for the sporozoite antigen CSP (P/H110050.09; 2.4-fold whether preexisting humoral responses might be associatedwith the control of parasites in Tanzanian volunteers. In line with stronger humoral responses in the Tanzanian cohort than in theDutch cohort at baseline, Tanzanian volunteers became qPCR positive signicantly later than the Dutch volunteers ( Fig. 2A), with a median prepatent period of 11.0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 11.0 to 13.5) in Tanzanians and 10.0 days (9.5 to 11.0) inDutch volunteers (P /H110050.009). Similarly, prepatency by TS was also longer in Tanzanians (median [IQR], 13.7 days [12.75 to16.7]) than in the Dutch (12.6 days [12.3 to 14]) (P /H110050.035). The time between detection by qPCR and by TS was comparable forboth cohorts (median [IQR] for Tanzanians, 2.6 [2.2 to 3.15];Dutch, 3.0 days [2.0 to 3.15]; P/H110050.88), but Dutch volunteers had a signicantly higher peak parasite density (median number 190,000]; P/H110050.02), possibly due to slight differences in the thick smear protocol between thetwo sites. Within the Tanzanian cohort, there was no signicantdifference in time to qPCR-detectable parasitemia between volun-teers P. serone- gative at baseline (P /H110050.16) (Fig. 2B), nor was there a difference in prepatency by TS (P /H110050.41) or time between detection by qPCR and TS (P /H110050.15). However, seropositive Tanzanian volunteers had a signicantly lower parasite load at the time of rst qPCR-detectable parasitemia than their seronegative counterparts (P /H11005 0.033) (Fig. 2C). This difference remained evident, but becamesmaller, by the time the rst peak in parasite load was reached ( P/H11005 0.05; Fig. 2D). Across all Tanzanian body titers for (Pearson (seeFig. S1 in material). P. falciparum-specic antibody responses are more ef- ciently increased in Tanzanians than in Dutch volunteers afterCHMI. Post-CHMI, antibody responses increased signicantly in the Tanzanian volunteers for P. falciparum lysate (P /H110210.001; 15/21 CSPImmune Responses after Controlled Malaria Infection May 2015 Volume 83 Number 5 iai.asm.org 2187 Page 120 of 222(P/H110210.001; 11/21) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the Dutch volunteers increased titers against EXP-1 3/9), while responses to LSA-1 and AMA-1 remained low and unaltered (Fig. 3B). Compared to the Dutch, Tanzanians showeda trend for stronger induction or boosting of responses based on the overall fold increase in titers to P. falciparum lysate, AMA-1, and LSA-1 (Fig. signicantly higher absolute increases intiters for these antigens (Fig. 3D). Volunteers in both cohorts were subjected to CHMI with either 10,000 or 25,000 PfSPZs. However,the only signicant difference in antibody responses between thetwo dose groups was a slightly higher response in the 25,000 thanin the 10,000 dose group for P. falciparum lysate in Dutch volun- teers (P /H110050.04) and a similar trend for the Tanzanians for CSP (P/H110050.07) (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Post-CHMI, P. falciparum lysate-seronegative Tanzanians had a signicantly AMA-1 ( P/H110050.02) and EXP-1 (P /H110050.04) than individuals, a similar trend for P. falciparum lysate (P /H110050.082) and CSP (P /H110050.095), but no difference in LSA-1 responses (P /H110050.80) (Fig. 3E). For the entire cohort, the fold increase of P. falciparum lysate (P /H110050.01) correlated nega- tively with the baseline response. The absolute increase in titers,however, was not different for any of the antigens between the two FIG 1 Baseline malaria-specic antibody titers indicate previous exposure in Tanzanian volunteers. Antibody reactivity against EXP-1, LSA-1, and CSP was tested prior to malaria infection. A pool of sera from 100 hyperimmune Tanzanians (HIT) was used as a reference. Reactivity for each antigen in undiluted HIT serum was set at 100 arbitrary units (AUs).

Notably, P. falciparum lysate-seronegative Tan- zanians thereby also showed a greater absolute increase in anti- body titers than malaria-naive Dutch volunteers. Dutch but not Tanzanian volunteers show cellular recall re- sponses induced by CHMI. To analyze the acquisition of cellularresponses after CHMI, we investigated in vitro IFN-/H9253 responses upon incubation with PfRBC for 24 h ( Fig. 4A andB). At baseline, P. falciparum-specic IFN-/H9253 responses were comparable between Dutch and Tanzanians for all cell subsets except for NKT- /H9253/H9254T cells, which showed slightly higher responses in the Dutch ( P/H11005 FIG 3 Increased humoral responses in Dutch and Tanzanians after CHMI.

Post-CHMI, previously malaria-naive Dutch volunteers showed signicant in zanian volunteers showed little or time points, CD56bright NK cells showed signicantlyhigher CD8/H11001,P/H110050.008) and central (CD4/H11001,P/H11005 0.004; CD8/H11001,P/H110050.012) T-cell compartments in the Dutch cohort, while the Tanzanians showed no such increase (seeFig. S3 in the supplemental material). As a result, post-CHMIIFN-/H9253 responses in the Dutch were signicantly higher for all cell subsets than in the Tanzanian cohort ( Fig. 4D). Within the Tan- zanian cohort, there was an overall trend for higher P. falciparum- specic pre-CHMI IFN-/H9253 responses in those volunteers that had particularly short prepatency by qPCR (see Fig. S1 in the supple-mental material). CD8 /H11001T cells from Dutch (P /H110050.04) but not Tanzanian (P /H110050.47) volunteers showed increased proliferative responses post-CHMI (see Fig. S4A in the supplemental material).The proliferation of CD4 /H11001T cells in response to PfRBC was not signicantly altered post-CHMI in either cohort (P /H110050.25 in Dutch and P/H110050.11 in Tanzanians) (see Fig. S4B). Analyzing the lymphocyte subset compositions in both co- horts, we found that they were largely stable between pre- andpost-CHMI time points, with the exception of a prominent andsignicant post-CHMI increase of the NKT- /H9253/H9254T proportion in the Dutch volunteers and a clear decrease of CD56dim NK pro-portions in both cohorts. There was further no signicant differ-ence in the proportions of CD4 /H11001CD45RO/H11001Foxp3/H11001T cells be- tween the two cohorts, which could have explained differences inresponsiveness (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Forthe Tanzanian cohort, we observed a signicant reduction ofFoxp3 /H11001T cells post-CHMI (P /H110050.008), while for the Dutch vol- unteers there was no change (P /H110050.44). Stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin mitogensshowed that lymphocytes of both Dutch and Tanzanian volun-teers were fully functional and able to produce IFN- /H9253at compa- rable levels both pre- and post-CHMI (see Fig. S4C). Reduced innate IFN-/H9253 responses in Tanzanian volunteers are associated with preexisting humoral immunity and thus po-tential preexposure. Finally, we analyzed whether the degree of preexposure reflected by differences in malaria-specic humoralimmunity might affect cellular recall responses to PfRBC. Cellsfrom P. falciparum lysate-seronegative Tanzanian volunteers and were of a magnitude comparable to those observed in the Dutch volunteers(Fig. 5). CD4 /H11001and CD8/H11001T cells showed a similar pattern, al- though the difference between seropositive and seronegative Tan-zanians did 5A andB). Post- CHMI, these differences remained, and there was no increase in these responses in either of the two groups. DISCUSSION In the present study, we performed a side-by-side comparison ofantimalarial immune responses initiated or recalled by CHMI intwo cohorts of young adults, from The Netherlands and Tanzania,with different malaria exposure histories and genetic back-grounds. Recruitment of Tanzanian volunteers took place in Dares Salaam, an urban area where malaria is hypoendemic. Inclusioncriteria into this CHMI trial were tailored to ensure minimal re-cent exposure to P. falciparum: Tanzanian volunteers had not ex- perienced a clinical episode of malaria for 5 years, as self-reported,and were conrmed free of parasites by qPCR before CHMI tookplace. Nevertheless, more than 50% of the 21 Tanzanian volun-teers had a positive P. falciparum lysate serology before CHMI post-CHMI responses within each CD4/H11001T cells (E), CD8/H11001T cells (F), CD56dim NK cells (G), CD56bright NK cells (H), and NKT-/H9253/H9254T cells (I). For each volunteer, all time points were measured in a single experiment. Data are shown as whisker plots with boxes indicating the median with IQR and whiskers the minimum/maximum values (C and D) or individual data points with lines connecting the two time points for each volunteer (E to I). All responses werecorrected for the background by subtracting responses to uRBC. Responses pre-CHMI and post-CHMI were compared using a Wilcoxon matched-pairssigned-rank test. FIG 5 P. falciparum-specic in vitro IFN-/H9253 production by innate lymphocytes from Tanzanian volunteers is dependent on baseline serological status. PBMCs collected from Tanzanian volunteers who either had a positive P. falciparum (Sero/H11001; n/H1100512; black squares) or negative P. falciparum (Sero/H11002; n/H110059; white squares) serology prior to challenge (baseline) were stimulated with PfRBC for 24 h and stained for intracellular IFN-/H9253. Panels show IFN-/H9253 NK cells. Data are shown as median /H11006IQR of responses corrected for the background by subtracting responses to uRBC. Differences in responses between the seropositive and seronegative groups wereanalyzed by a Mann-Whitney U falciparum-specic pre-CHMI PBMCs from malaria-naive Dutch volunteers n/H110059; gray circles), who had negative P. falciparum serology, are shown as a comparator.Immune Responses after Controlled Malaria Infection May 2015 Volume 83 Number 5 iai.asm.org 2191 Page 124 of 222based on P. falciparum lysate ELISA, which is a standard exclusion criterion in Dutch CHMI trials. In line with this, increased base- line antibody titers for the P. falciparum antigens CSP, LSA-1, EXP-1, and AMA-1 were found in the Tanzania cohort and par-ticularly in those with positive serology for P. falciparum lysate. This clearly indicates previous exposure to the malaria parasite inthis cohort. Asymptomatic infections, which can often occur inpeople living in areas with low malarial endemicity (34), in the 5years of no self-reported clinical malaria preceding CHMI might have led to a maintenance of higher antibody responses. As might be expected, preexisting antibodies to P. falciparum antigens appeared to have an effect on the outcome of CHMI.Tanzanians had a signicantly longer prepatency based on previously malaria-naive Dutch. Furthermore,P. falciparum lysate-seropositive Tanzanians had a lower parasite load at the time of rst detection by qPCR and at the time of therst peak of parasite load than seronegative Tanzanians. The rstpeak of blood-stage parasitemia can be used as a proxy for parasiteliver load ( 16,35). Our results might therefore indicate the emer- gence of fewer parasites from the liver and hence better control of either initiation or progression of liver-stage infection in preex-posed individuals within the Tanzanian cohort and in Tanzaniansthan in the Dutch cohort. In line with such an effect of preexistingantisporozoite immunity would be the observation that thoseTanzanian volunteers with a longer prepatancy by qPCR also hadhigher baseline antibody titers against the sporozoite antigen CSP.However, the rst detection by qPCR in both the Dutch and Tan-zanians after intradermal PfSPZ injection was uncharacteristicallylate compared to that for infection by mosquito bite routinelyconducted in The Netherlands and elsewhere ( 11,16,18,19,23, 24,35). This is likely due to less efcient liver-stage infection by thisroute and hence a low initial blood-stage load that reaches the qPCR detection limit only later. A lower rst detectable para-sitemia in seropositive Tanzanians than in seronegative Tanzani-ans might therefore additionally be attributed to the control ofblood-stage replication prior to qPCR detection. Antibodies di-rected against AMA-1, for instance, are known to interfere withblood-stage multiplication (36) but can also confer protectionagainst liver-stage infection (37). Since recognition of both cross- stage and liver-stage antigens was stronger in the Tanzanian co-hort than in the Dutch, and particularly in the seropositive indi-viduals, both possibilities remain open. Our data, however,support antibody control of blood-stage replication only duringthe initial phase of sub-qPCR-detectable parasitemia: while para-site multiplication based on PCR data could not be directly com-pared due to the high variability of the amplication dynamics(24), there was no difference between prepatency by TS and qPCRinthe two Tanzanian groups. Upon CHMI, Dutch volunteers showed a slight but signicant induction of humoral responses against CSP, P. falciparum lysate, EXP-1, while Tanzanians boosted responses to all to the CSP sporozoite antigen is expectedafter PfSPZ inoculation and consistent with previous ndings ( 38, 39). Increased antibody responses against P.falciparum likely reflect cross-stage while to developing (LSA-1) in naive volunteers appears insufcient to induce adetectable antibody response. Similarly, limited exposure toblood-stage-expressed AMA-1, due to early curative treatment,appears to prevent induction of detectable titers in naive volun-teers, which is consistent with results even after multiple CHMIs(39). Consistent with preexposure, Tanzanians showed on thegroup level a greater increase in titers for P. falciparum lysate, AMA-1, and LSA-1 than Tanzanian cohort, P. falciparum lysate-seronegative Tanzanians showed a similar absolute and accordingly muchgreater fold increase in antibody titers than their seropositivecounterparts. At baseline, these volunteers had signicantly lowerresponses to most parasite antigens than their seropositive coun-terparts and largely resembled the malaria-naive Dutch cohort.The fact that this group showed a greater increase in antibodytiters than the Dutch strongly suggests that despite largely negativeP. falciparum serology, these individuals have a stable P. falci- parum-specic memory B-cell repertoire ( 40,41). Given the same in absolute antibody titers, their memory B-cell reper- toire appears to be of a magnitude similar to that of the P. falcip- arum lysate-seropositive Tanzanians, despite lower circulating plasma antibody levels. Of note, humoral responses were assessed using a number of recombinant or synthetic proteins, which are not fully identical tothe sequences of these proteins expressed by the NF54 strain usedin both CHMI trials. While most antigens used in this study wereof the 3D7 sequence and thus closely resemble the NF54 sequence,AMA-1 responses were assessed using the FVO strain sequence.AMA-1 is known for its extensive antigenic polymorphism and tocause strain-specic immunity (42, 43). Nevertheless, there is a signicant antigenic overlap between AMA-1 alleles allowing for cross-reactivity across different strains, both in terms of func-tional activity and recognition, which affects mainly the magni-tude of the response (42, 44-46). Based on these data, we consider it unlikely that assessment of AMA-1 responses using the NF54 or3D7 sequence would have yielded different qualitative results.However, absolute titers would likely have been higher when us-ing the AMA-1 sequence homologous to the CHMI strain. Another potential confounder is the fact that the P. falciparum strains that Tanzanian volunteers were naturally exposed to priorto CHMI with P. falciparum NF54 are unknown. As any study examining preexposed individuals, analysis of antigen-specic re-sponses against polymorphic antigens has therefore the additionallimitation that it is difcult to match this unknown exposure his-tory. This has to especially be taken into account when investigat-ing CHMI-induced boosting of potential preexisting responses inthis cohort, which might be masked by using antigens of differentstrain origins. However, despite the fact that Tanzanians likelyexperienced exposure to a variety of P. falciparum strains prior to CHMI, there was (i) a clear division into seropositive and serone-gative individuals not just by total P. falciparum NF54 lysate but also by all individual antigens analyzed and (ii) a clearly stron-ger increase in antibody titers in Tanzanians than in malaria-naive Dutch volunteers to several antigens, including AMA-1.We cannot exclude, however, that this might have even beenmore pronounced when using antigens of different strain ori-gins for analysis. Although the Tanzanian volunteers in the present study showed evidence of humoral immune memory, parasite-specicIFN-/H9253 production by adaptive T-cell subsets was not higher than in malaria-naive Dutch volunteers at baseline and remained un-changed after CHMI. In contrast, previously naive Dutch volun-teers showed a signicant increase in IFN-/H9253 production by CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets after a primary infection, consistent with Obiero et al. 2192 iai.asm.org May 2015 Volume 83 Number 5 Page 125 of 222what has been shown previously ( 47,48). The lack of increased proliferative and Th1 responses 1 month after CHMI in Tanza- nian volunteers could be partially due to immunosuppression fol-lowing exposure to blood-stage parasites during CHMI. Such T-cell immunosuppression is well described for malaria ( 49-58) and, although usually resolved within 2 weeks ( 52,53), can persist for more than 4 weeks (50). That Dutch volunteers are not equallyaffected by this might be due to the fact that such immunosup-pressive effects appear to be more pronounced in immune than innonimmune donors, as shown elsewhere (59). T regulatory cells(Tregs) are one potential mediator of suppressed IFN- /H9253produc- tion by adaptive cells. Increased Treg numbers during or aftermalaria are a well-reported phenomenon ( 60), and malaria para- sites can enhance the suppressive activity of Tregs ( 61). While Dutch and Tanzanian volunteers had similar Treg proportions, we cannot exclude that Tregs in Tanzanian volunteers might befunctionally more active, potentially due to past priming in ma-laria infections. That this apparent lack of a Th1 immune responsein the Tanzanian cohort is malaria specic is supported by the factDutch and Tanzanian volunteers showed similar Th1 responses tomitogen stimulation both pre- and post-CHMI. Nevertheless, anadditional influence of genetic background, which may explaindifferential P. falciparum-specic responses described in settings where malaria is endemic, cannot be excluded ( 62,63). NKcells are rapidly activated by malaria parasites, contribute to the early IFN-/H9253 response during blood-stage infection ( 64), and can eliminate infected erythrocytes in vivo in a contact-dependent manner (65). Importantly, there is a functional dichotomy: therarer CD56bright cells are more prominent in lymphatic tissuesand are superior cytokine producers, while the stronger cytotoxic potential ( 66-68). However, NK cells have usually been examined as one population, and the exact con- tributions of CD56dim and CD56bright NK cell subsets to malariaimmunity thus remain to be established. An in vitro study on PBMCs from malaria-naive donors found greater IFN-/H9253 produc- tion by than by CD56dim NK cells in response tocytokines but not upon PfRBC stimulation ( 69). However, con- sistent with their generally reported greater cytotoxic potential, only CD56dim cells showed degranulation upon PfRBC stimula-tion Our ndings greaterIFN-/H9253 response than CD56dim NK cells to PfRBC both before and after a primary malaria infection, as well as a memory-like effect ofthis response, are in line with ndings from a previous CHMI trial(70). Tanzanian volunteers showed the same functional differencebetween the two NK cell subsets but no memory effect in either subset after CHMI. It was previously shown that depletion of /H9251/H9252T cells abrogates memory-like IFN-/H9253 responses observed ( 47,70). Therefore, PfRBC-specic /H9251/H9252T-cell responses post-CHMI in Tan- zania volunteers might be one reason why P. falciparum-specic IFN-/H9253 production by NK cells and other innate lymphocytes (NKT and /H9253/H9254T cells) was also not increased post-CHMI. The fact that P. falciparum lysate-seronegative Tanzanians had higher in- nate IFN-/H9253 responses than did seropositive Tanzanians already at baseline is a further indication that reduced Th1 responses arelikely linked to the degree of previous malaria exposure. Of note,the proportion of CD56bright cells remained unaltered afterCHMI, while the CD56dim subset had a smaller contribution tothe PBMC compartment post-CHMI in both cohorts. It remainsto be established whether this means that, in contrast to memory-like IFN-/H9253 production, other NK cell functions, such as migration out of the circulation and engagement in antimalaria immuneresponses at other sites, such as the spleen, are unaffected and fullyfunctional in preexposed individuals. Within the Tanzanian cohort, there was no association of pre- existing P. falciparum-specic IFN-/H9253 responses by T-cell subsets or innate lymphocytes with the parasitological outcome of CHMI,i.e., prepatency or parasite load at rst detection by qPCR. If at all,those with higher IFN-/H9253 responses to blood-stage PfRBC had a shorter prepatency. This does not, however, exclude that cellularresponses play a role in the prolonged prepatency of Tanzanianvolunteers and specically those with positive P. falciparum serol- ogy. One possible reason for the lack of such an association is thatPfRBC were chosen as a stimulus for P. falciparum-specic re- sponses. This was done due to the relatively large antigenic overlapbetween blood-stage and (late) liver-stage to sporozoite and early-liver-stage antigens, which may be more relevant when assessing responses responsible forreducing the parasite load by targeting the earlier stages of infec-tion, are likely to be missed using PfRBC as a stimulus. Moreover,our analysis was restricted to P. falciparum-specic IFN-/H9253 produc- tion, and it is likely that other responses, for instance, degranula-tion as a proxy for cytotoxicity, may be more relevant readouts(71). Finally, the only accessible compartment for analysis of cel-lular responses in these human trials was peripheral blood. P. fal- ciparum-specic responses, and particularly those responsible forreducing liver infection, might, however, be enriched or primarilylocated in other sites, for instance, in tissue-resident memory cellsin the liver (73, 74). This might be even more pronounced in preexposed individuals, where such a tissue-resident memory population might have already been established. Noteworthy, the differential immune responses described herein may explain why Tanzanian volunteers reported fewerclinical symptoms, such as fever, than their Dutch counterpartsduring CHMI after PfSPZ injection (24). On the one hand, pre-existing antibody responses may reduce the initial parasite load and mediate antidisease immunity. Additionally, the relativelylower P. falciparum-specic cellular Th1 responses observed in the Tanzanian cohort than in the Dutch cohort might also be bene-cial. Dutch volunteers preexposed to infected mosquito bites un-der chloroquine prophylaxis exhibited stronger IFN- /H9253produc- tion symptoms when reexposed to blood-stageparasites than malaria-naive volunteers during their rst infection(15). Thus, a shift away from Th1 responses in preexposed volun-teers may make them less vulnerable to fever and other inflamma- tion-induced symptoms. In conclusion, our data show that previous malaria exposure is associated with some degree of parasite control during liver-stageor early-blood-stage infection after CHMI, humoral compartment. Positive P. falciparum lysate serol- ogy can be used to identify individuals with better parasite controlbut weaker peripheral blood Th1 responses, which may help tostratify volunteers in future CHMI trials in areas where malaria isendemic. However, assessment of memory B-cell responses mightbe explored as a potentially better tool than serology to denepreexposure per se. Important questions to be addressed in future studies include (i) which readouts other than Th1 responsesshould be used to determine immunization-induced cellular im-munity and (ii) how differences in preexisting malaria-specicImmune Responses after Controlled Malaria Infection May 2015 Volume 83 Number 5 iai.asm.org 2193 Page 126 of 222immune responses affect the outcome of whole parasite immuni- zation and vaccination approaches in areas where malaria is en-demic.

Daubenberger (Claudia.Daubenberger@unibas.ch) Page 132 of 222Abstract Background : Controlled human malaria infections (CHMI) provide a unique platform for malaria research. Data describing CHMI -induced immune responses have been largely confined to malaria naive populations . Here, we assess ed changes in malaria -specific humoral immune response in malaria pre-exposed healthy Tanzanian volunteers after a single intradermal application of purified, metabolically active P. falciparum sporozoites ( PfSPZ challenge). Methods : We compared side by side changes in serum antibody levels using malaria antigen specific multiplex bead arrays, antibody secreting memory B cell (MBC) responses and functional merozoite opsonization activity in each volunteer . We analyzed the results from pairs of visits using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Results : When compared to baseline, peak antibody titers binding to recombinant MSP -1 (alleles 3D7 and FVO), AMA-1, CSP and LSA-1 were observed on day 28 after PfSPZ challenge. Antibodies binding to CelTOS, EBA -175 and SSP2did not alter. secreting cells ( ASCs ) measured in peripheral blood where highest on day 28 after PfSPZ challenge, but rapidly declined to near baseline levels on day 168. Merozoit e opsonizing ant ibody responses increased following PfSPZ challenge in some but not all individuals . When volunteers were stratified according to baseline opsonizing activity , low baseline responders showed significantly increase of merozoite opsonizing activity on days 28, 56 and 168 after PfSPZ challenge , while no change occurred in the group with high opsonization at baseline . Outcomes of opsonization each volunteer followed simila r trends after PfSPZ Page 133 of 222challenge, suggesting that boosting of pre-erythrocytic and asexual blood stage humoral immune responses can be assessed reliably by three assessment methods . Conclusion : PfSPZ challenge induces a significant albeit short lived boost in pre-erythrocytic and stage transcending specific antibody levels and ASC s. The changes in m erozoite opsonizing antibodies were strongly influenced by pre-existing immunity, as only volunteers with a low level of opsonizing antibodies at baseline showed a consistent increase 6 months following the CHMI.CHMI s tudies in malaria pre-exposure volunteers paves the way towards a gr eater understanding of the immunological conditions that favor the development of lasting protective humoral malaria immunity in vaccine target population. Clinical trials Gov.identifier: NCT01540903 Keywords Plasmodium falciparum , controlled human malaria infection, bead array, antibody secreting cells, merozoite opsonization, malaria semi-immune individuals Page 134 of 222Background Malaria is a preventable and treatable vector borne disease caused by parasite of the genus Plasmodium , with P. falciparum responsible for the majority of malaria morbidity and mortality in Sub -Saharan Africa [1].T he P. falciparum life cycle alternates between the female mosq uito and the human host . In humans , after sporozoite inoculation, P. falciparum undergoes pre-erythrocytic liver stage development followed by the asexual blood stages , with parasites replicating in the red blood cells [1]. Asexual blood stage parasite mia is then followed by sexual stage development in the human host. After feeding on parasite-carrying humans, sexual replication occurs within the mosquito and is followed by sporozoite development in the salivary gland, and thus completes the cycle. The critical role of antibodies in protection against severe and clinical malaria in humans has been unequivocally established in passive transfer experiments[2][3] . Naturally acquired humoral immune responses in malaria have been described in many immuno-epidemiological studies [4][5].Repeated malaria infections may result in clinical immunity that is hardly ever completely protective against infection. This phenomenon is multifactorial, due to both extensive P. falciparum antigen diversity and a failure to mount appropriately long-lived humoral responses[6,7] . Memory B cells (MBC), together with bone marrow resident long lived plasma cells , are thought to be the foundation of humoral immune memory after pathogen or vaccine exposure [8] . The se B cells are responsible for the rapid, high titer, high affinity secondary antibody responses elicited upon re-exposure to the same infection or vaccine[9,10]. In malaria, several studies have demonstrated that MBC are present at low frequency following natural exposure, and that 'atypical' MBC that have been linked to impaired humoral immunity in HIV can be detected as well in malaria exposed volunteers [11,12] . Page 135 of 222CHMI has become the cornerstone of early clinical testing of potential malaria vaccine candidates , including the current most advanced malaria vaccine , RTS, S[13] . Until recently, CHMI studies were limited to few research institutions in the USA and Europe due to the requirement for rearing P. falciparum infected mosquitoes in the laboratory[14]. CHMI studies present an ideal setting to analyze cellular and humoral immunity to P. falciparum antigens since the infection occurs under highly defined conditions with well -known dosages and genotypes [14] sporozoites has enabled the first CHMI studies to occur in malaria endemic countries [15] . To date , CHMI has been wide ly deployed to study immune responses against the pre-erythrocytic stage in both na\u00efve and semi-immune population[16-21]. However, there remains no consensus on how immune responses against P. falciparum vary between diverse ethnic populations, and the impact of transient, low-density blood stage infections on malaria immunity has not been thoroughly investigated [22,23] . Questions like the impact of previous malaria exposure o n infection dynamics , consequences of haemoglobinopathies on asexual blood stage development , infection dosing and application route s can now be addressed in malaria endemic settings through CHMI studies [22] . Here we describe the dynamics of humoral immune responses targeting pre- erythrocytic, stage transcending (MSP-1 and AMA- 1) and asexual blood stage parasites using three complementary approaches after a single intradermal inoculation of purified, metabolically active P. falciparum sporozoites [21] .

Study participants This study took place between February and August 2012 at the Ifakara Health Institute, Bagamoyo Research and Training Centre, located about 70 miles north from Dar -es-Salaam, Tanzania. Thirty participants, aged between 20 and 35 years old, were recruited from Dar- es- Salaam Institute of Technology (DIT), College of Business Education (CBE) and Institute of Finance management (IFM). The se colleges enroll students from all over Tanzania. Participant inclusion and exclusion criteria and dose assignment for the groups have been explained elsewhere [21] . Volunteers who indicated to have no documented evidence of malaria episodes in the past 5 years were included. At enrollment, volunteers were tested for malar ia infection using thick blood smear and only microscopy blood smear negative volunteers were enrolled in the trial [21]. Page 137 of 222Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell collection Blood samples were drawn by venipuncture into sodium citrate-containing cell preparation tubes (BD, Vacutainer CPT) on days 0, 28, 56 and 168 after sporozoite inoculation . PBMC were isolated according to the manufacturer's frozen in fetal bovine containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma - Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and stored in liquid nitrogen (-191\u00baC). PBMC samples collected at the different time points from one distinct subject were always thawed and assayed in paral lel. Serum and plasma sample collection Serum was collected from 4 mL of whole blood in blood collection tubes with clot activators (Becton Dickinson, 369032) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour to facilitate clot formation. Blood collection tubes were then centrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 minutes at 22 \u00baC, and aliquots of serum stored at -80\u00b0C. Plasma was obtaine d from BD Vacutainer CPT immediately prior to collection of PBMCs, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C. Antibody L uminex analysis Nine recombinant proteins were coupled to Magplex magnetic microspheres (Luminex Corp., Austin , Texas) whose fluorescent signature was detected in ten different Region 33: ); Region -1 42 FVO strain (MSP -142FVO)\u00b8 Region 43: fragment II of region II of the 175 kDa erythrocyte binding protein (EBA-175, or PfF2); Page 138 (CSP); AMA-1 3D7 strain and EBA-175 were produced at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, India (ICGEB). MSP-1 42 3D7 and FVO strains were produced at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, (WRAIR) Silver Spring, MD, USA. The pre-erythrocytic antigens CelTOS, LSA-1, SSP2 and CSP were produced at Protein Potential, LLC in Rockville, Maryland, USA. The multiplex suspension array technology (SAT) panel was prepared as previously reported [23,24], with the following alteration: super-paramagnetic polystyrene 6.5 \u00b5m COOH - microspheres were coupled to corresponding antigens. Briefly, microspheres were washed and activated with Bead Activation Buffer (100mM monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 6.2) and simultaneous NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) and EDC (1-Ethyl-3- [3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide mg/ml in a total volume of 100\u00b5 L for 20 min. Microspheres were coupled overnight at 4\u00baC with optimized concentrations of corresponding protein in 500 \u00b5L PBS or MES reactions, then blocked with 500 \u00b5L PBS -BN (PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% sodium stored aliquots at 1,000 microspheres/ (or single at 2,000 microspheres/ \u00b5L) in PBS -BN, protected from light at 4\u00baC. An 11-point standard curve was used in each 96-well flat bottom mylar plate (Greiner One). A 2- fold serial dilution starting at 150 ng/mL ChromPure purified human IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) was mixed with region 33 (anti-Human IgG ) microspheres in single plex at 2,000 microspheres per well and placed for 1 h at room temperature at the same time that serum samples for the study were incubated with the multiplex microsphere mix at 1,000 microspheres per region per well. Study samples, positive and negative controls were tested Page 139 of 222in duplicates at dilutions 1:500 and 1:20000. The plate was washed three times with 200 \u00b5L/well of PBS with 0.05% Tween20 (PBST) on Tres Cantos, 1:1000 in was added at 100 \u00b5L per well and incubated at room temperature with agitation and protection from light for 45 min. Plates were washed as before, and streptavidin -R-phycoerythrin diluted 1:1000 in PBS- BN was added at 100 \u00b5L per well and incubated for 25 min as before. Plates were washed as before and microspheres were resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of PBS -BN per well and read using a Luminex 200 instrument with xPONENT version 3.1 (Luminex Corp, Texas). At least 50 beads per analyte were acquired per sample. Crude median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and background fluorescence from blank wells were exported. A 5-parameter logistic regression with inverse variance weighting (1/MFI 2) was selected for the standard curve fitting due to superior fit with antibody data: = + (1 + 50 ) Where Amin is the lower asymptote, Amax is the upper asymptote, is the slope at the inflection point of the sigmoidal curve, EC50 is the concentration at the inflection point, and is a factor of asymmetry. The parameters of the standard curve in each plate were used to estimate the unit concentration (units relative to ng/mL IgG) for each analyte. The standard curve for each Luminex assay plate was used to normalize the estimated concentration of antibodies to each antigen, reported as antibody units (AU, or Units) per mL, through interpolation. Measurements above and below the limits of quantification were given arbitrary high and low Unit values beyond the dynamic range, respectiv ely. Page 140 of 222Memory B cell ELISpot analysis P. falciparum antigen-specific ASC s were quantified by a modified version of the recently developed method [25]. Briefly, PBMCs were thawed and cultured with stimulation media consisting of 10%FBS in RPMI 1640, plus a cocktail of MWG/Operon, Huntsville, AL), 20ng/ml Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC) (Sigma - Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50ng/ml pokeweed mitogen (Sigma-Aldrich), and 50 at 37 \u00baC in 5% CO 2 atmosphere for six days. Afterwards, c ells were collected, washed and distributed in 96-well ELISpot plates (Millipore Multiscreen HTS IP Sterile high-protein binding). To detect ASCs, ELISpot plates (Millipore) were prepared by coating with either a 10 \u00b5g/ml solution of polyclonal goat antibodies specific for human IgG (Caltag H17000) to detect all IgG - solution of albumin as a non-specific control , solution of MSP1 (1:1 mixture of FVO and 3D7 ) or 5 \u00b5g/ml solution of AMA-1 (3D7 strain only) . Source s of these recombinant antigens are described in the Luminex section above. All Plates were then blocked using 1 % bovine serum albumin. Stimulated PBMCs were washed and tested in duplicate over five serial dilutions starting at 5x10 5 cells/well and six serial dilutions starting at 4 x 104 cells/well for the detection of antigen-specific ASCs and total IgG ASCs , respectively. After a six- hour incubation, plates washed in PBS and 0.05% PBS-Tween20 (PBST), and incubated alkaline goat antibodies specific for human IgG [(gamma)-Invitrogen] in PBST. Plates were washed, developed with BCIP/NBT, thoroughly washed again with ddH2O and dried in the dark. ELISpot plates were quantified using an AID Elispot reader (Start V-spot reader spectrum) and reported as frequencies of ASC s per 10 6 PBMCs. The limit of detection of the ASCs ELISpot assay for this analysis was five Page 141 of 222ASCs per 106 PBMC based on the mean of ASCs in the 1% BSA control. Assay failure was defined as fewer than 1000 IgG+ ASCs per 106 PBMCs after Phagocytosis Assay assays were performed as described , with minor alterations. Brief ly, magnetically -purified schizonts were treated with E64 for 8 hours [28] , and then passed through a 1.2- m filter to release merozoites. Haemozoin was removed by magnetic separation, and purified merozoites were then stained with Ethidium Bromide (EtBr). Merozoites with the study participant's 1:4000 dilutions and then combined with the THP -1 cells at a ratio 6:1. THP -1 mediated phagocytosis was arrested after The percentage of EtBr fluorescent THP by flow cytometry (FacsC alibur, BD Sciences). Plasma pools from Australian and malaria hyper- immune adults collected in Papua New Guinea were used as non-exposed and hyper- immune controls, respectively . Statistical methods We d isplayed the log-transformed response variables using dot plots and scatter plots. We summarized the skewed outcomes using the median and 90% central range, and compared the results from pairs of visits using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. We defined high and low responders using the median value as a cut- off. The analyses were carried out in R version 3.1.0.[29] Page 142 of 222Results Participant s and study details Thirty healthy male volunteers were recruited into this CHMI study. Two groups of 12 volunteers received 1x104and 2x104of live, purified, non-attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ challenge) intra-dermally, respectively . As a third group, six volunteers served as double-blinded placebo controls and were treated essentially the same except that they received saline instead of PfSPZ challenge . The participants demographic information such as age, weight, height and BMI have been described[21] . Three participants that received PfSPZ were excluded fro m the analysis presented here because they did not develop asexual blood stage parasitemia[21]. Remaining 27 participants were followed up for all scheduled visits at days 0, 9, 28, 56and 168 except for another three participants for which o ne volunteer missed day 168visit and two volunteers were excluded due to suspected clinical malaria episodes between study days 56 and 168. Serum antibody levels binding to pre-erythrocytic and asexual blood stage antigens during CHMI We assessed IgG a ntibody levels binding to known malaria antigens in s erum samples collected at days 0, 9, 28, 56 and 168 using multiplex bead arrays. Antigens tested included liver stage antigen 1 (LSA-1), circumsporozoite (CSP), Cell-traversal protein for the apical membrane antigen 1 ( AMA -1).At baseline, all participants had detectable antibodies against the CSP, MSP -1 and AMA-1. Four (14.8%) volunteers lacked detectable antibody responses against LSA-1 and CelTOS and three volunteers (11.1%)were negative for SSP2 (Figure 1).

Although the inoculated sporozoites expressed the 3D7 FVO) LSA-1 specific antibody levels from each individual's baseline results are given in Table 1.Significant increases in relation to baseline were observed on days 28 and 56. On day 168, antibody levels targeting MSP-1 and CSP only remained significantly higher when compared to baseline, which was more pronounced for the 3D7 allelic form of MSP-1.

MSP 1 and AMA1 specific memory B cell responses are boosted after intradermal PfSPZ challenge Next we used the B cell EliSpot analysis to follow frequencies of ASC s in peripheral blood [30]. At baseline, 10 out of 27 (37 %) and 12 out of 27(44%) participants had ASC against MSP -1 (both alleles were in combination respectively (range and AMA-1 specific ASCs cells was determined relative to the total number of IgG- producing cells measured in the same experiment (baseline range of total IgG-producing cells 1,250-25,988) as described in [30] . -1 and AMA-1 specific ASCs increased following CHMI and reached a n observed peak at day 28, with a rapid decline on days 56 and 168 (Figures 2 A and 2C). The number of MSP -1 and AMA-1specific ASC s in the saline inoculated group remained largely unchanged over t he time course followed (Figure 2B and 2D ). Importantly, the total number of IgG-producing cells remained unchange d during the CHMI (Supplementary Figure 2) .

The p-values are obtained from the Wilcoxon matched-pairs antibodies increase following PfSPZ challenge Merozoite opsonizing antibodies have been demonstrated to be a robust correlate of natural acquired immunity to malaria[31]. Therefore, we assessed whether the increase of IgG antibodies binding to MSP -1 and AMA-1 following CHMI (measured by multiplex bead array and B cell EliSpot analysis) corresponded to an increase in functional merozoite opsonizing antibodies. Using a validated in vitro phagocytosis assay [26,27] (Supplementary Figure 3), merozoite opsonizing antibodies were observed in all individuals prior to CHMI - strongly suggesting prior malaria exposure (Figure 3). In the PfSPZ challenged group, an increase in opsonizing antibodies were observed (Figure 3A) while the saline controls did not change over time (Figure 3B) .

Baseline levels of merozoite opsonizing antibodies were diverse in our volunteers. W e investigated whether the baseline activity of opsonizing antibodies influenced subsequent response s to CHMI . Participants were grouped into high and low responders using the me dian value of the baseline as cut-off value . Participants with low er levels of opsonization activity at baseline showed strong induction of opsoniz ation at 28, 56and 168 days following sporozoite inoculation (Figure 3C ). In contrast, individuals displaying high baseline opsonization activity showed no increase following CHMI (Figure 3D). To directly test whether the volunteers with low and high responses at baseline had different responses after CHMI , we used an interaction test. The increase in merozoite opsonization after CHMI was significantly greater for the ba seline low versus high responders at day 28 (p=0.04) and day 56 (p=0.01) . We found no correlation between baseline opsonization activity and parasite pre- patent period.

AMA-1 specific responses were comparable to the MSP-1specific humoral immune responses (Supplementary Figure 4A). Humoral immune responses in the control group showed little variation throughout the follow up period confirming that the alterations in antibody measures were induced by the PfSPZ challenge (Supplementary Figure4B).

Volunteers participating in the CHMI were recruited from higher education institutions living in Dar es Salaam for reduced likelihood of heavy malaria pre-exposure . At enrollment, s tudy participants with lowest CSP and EXP-1 specific serum antibodies antibody levels were selected from a larger pool of eligible volunteers . However, since anti-malarial antibodies were detected in baseline samples across the three monitoring techniques used here , these volunteers are unlikely to be malaria-naive . Those volunteers who became blood smear positive after CHMI were treated with a 3-day regimen of Artemether /lumefantrine (Coartem), and were discharged from the research hospital after three consecutive negative blood smear results. Retrospective analyses of blood samples collected during CHMI by the more sensitive quantitative PCR showed that subclinical, asexual blood-stage parasitemia was present for 2-3 days prior drug treatment [21]. Therefore, the low -density asexual blood- stage infection experienced by CHMI participants likely explain s the boost in stage- transcending and asexual blood stage immunity . Here , we tested for antibodies to recombinant CSP and LSA-1 by multiplex bead array. Both antigens are exclusively expressed by sporozo ites and liver-stage parasites . IgG antibodies to rapidly following CHMI , suggesting that inoculated sporozoite s and developing liver stage parasites resulted in recall of pre-existing immunity. The increase in CSP and LSA-1 specific antibodies after CHMI are in line with results published by Obiero et al.[32], however, we included in our study a longer follow up period after PfSPZ challenge Page 154 of 222PAPER VIII Controlled human malaria infection leads to long-lasting changes in innate and innate-like lymphocyte populations The article has been published in the Journal of Immunology ( 2017) . Doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1208394 Page 155 of 222The of Immunology Controlled Human Malaria Infection Leads to Long-Lasting Changes in Innate and Innate-like Lymphocyte Populations McElrath,,{Kenneth Stephen De Abdulla,** A. Daubenberger,*, and Martin Prlic,{ Animal model studies highlight the role of innate-like lymphocyte populations in the early inflammatory response and subsequent parasite control following Plasmodium infection. IFN- gproduction by these lymphocytes likely plays a key role in the early control of the parasite and disease severity. Analyzing human innate-like T cell and NK cell responses following infection with Plasmodium has been challenging because the early stages of infection are clinically silent. To overcome this limitation, we examined blood samples from a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study in a Tanzanian cohort, in which volunteers underwent CHMIwith a low or high dose of Plasmodium cell populations in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in an altered composition of this innate-like lymphocyte compartment. Although these innate-like responses are typically thought of as short-lived, we found that changespersisted for months after the infection was cleared, leading to signicantly increased frequencies of mucosal-associated invariantT cells 6 mo postinfection. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and TCR ab-chain usage analysis to dene potential mechanisms for this expansion. These single-cell data suggest that this increase was mediated by homeostatic expansion-like mechanisms.Together, these data demonstrate that CHMI leads to previously unappreciated long-lasting alterations in the human innate- like lymphocyte compartment. We discuss the consequences of these changes for recurrent parasite infection and infection- associated pathologies and highlight the importance of considering host immunity and infection history for vaccine design.The Journal of Immunology , 2017, apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falci- parum causes malaria and resulted in an estimated 214 million clinical cases of disease and 438,000 deaths globally in 2015 (1). Children are particularly vulnerable until the age of 5 y, when they become more resistant to severe forms of malaria.P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZs) are transmitted to the human host during feeding of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. These sporozoites travel through blood vessels to the liver wherethey develop into the symptomatically silent pre-erythrocytic life cycle stage. Immunization with high numbers of attenuated PfSPZs can induce protection against malaria infection (2-7).Importantly, resistance to disease is rather short-lived due to thedevelopment of short-lived immunological memory (8). Over time, repeated exposure eventually leads to decreased disease symptoms;however, resistance against subsequent infections is limited. Pre- erythrocytic stage-specic p rotective immunity requires a combination of liver-resident adaptive cellular immune mech- anisms, including cytotoxic C D8 T cells and CD4 T cells that secrete IFN-g and provide help to sporozoite-neutralizing Ab- producing B cells (8, 9), but other immune processes may be ofimportance as well. Innate-like lymphocyte responses precede adaptive immune responses, and animal model data suggest thatthese early immune re sponses are critical for the outcome of subsequent adaptive immune responses (8). Innate-like lymphocytes have been studied in a variety of in- fections because of their ability to rapidly secrete IFN-g and TNF- a and other effector molecules that control early inflammatory re- sponses and pathogen load (10, 11).

NK cell function is controlled by a balance of inhibitory (recognizing MHC class I) and acti-vating signals, such as stress-induced ligands from the ULBP family (13). MAIT cells (CD3 +CD161hiVa7.2+) make up 1-8% of T cells in blood and mucosal tissues and 20-45% of T cells in the liver (14, 15). The MAIT cell TCR consists of an invariant TCRa-chain (V a7.2) and a limited range of possible b-chains (16, 17), but MAIT cells have recently been shown to have greater TCR heterogeneity than initially expected (18-20). The MAITTCR recognizes Ag in the context of the MHC-related protein 1, which includes bacterial metabolites of the riboflavin synthesis pathway (21). We demonstrated that inflammatory and TCR sig-nals synergize to induce MAIT cell effector function (22), al- though inflammatory signals can be sufcient to activate MAIT cells (23, 24). iNKT cell (CD3 +Va24Ja 18+) abundance is substantially lower in humans compared with the mouse model system. iNKT cells typically account for 0.02% of T cells in blood and 0.5% of T cells in the liver (25). The iNKT cell TCR consists of an invariant TCR achain (V a24Ja 18) and a limited range of possible b-chains (typically V b11), and it recognizes lipids presented by the MHC class I-like protein CD1d (26). A shared feature of these cell populations is their ability to quickly respond to inflammatory signals, such as IL-12, IL-15, andIL-18 (26, 27). A consequence of this inflammation-mediated activation is the acquisition of effector function, including ex-pression of IFN- gand granzyme B (grzB) (23). IFN- gis of par- ticular interest because it seems critical in mediating immunityagainst the parasite (28-35). Importantly, although inflammationappears limited during the liver stage of malaria, the proin- flammatory response is pronounced during the asexual blood stage, with an increase in IL-12 and IL-18 serum concentrations(36-39). Thus, the initial inflammatory environment elicited bythe infection may be sufcient to activate these cell populations, leading to secretion of effector molecules, such as IFN- gand TNF-a. Importantly, animal model data suggest that the early inflammatory environment, and particularly IFN- g, seems to play an important role in the ensuing parasite control, as well as disease progression, including the development of cerebral malaria (10,40, 41). It is unknown how accurately the mouse model mimics these innate-like lymphocyte responses in human infection be- cause, to our knowledge, the function and fate of NK and innate-like T cells following Plasmodium infection of humans have not been elucidated in detail. To address this question, we specically examined changes in the NK cell, NKT cell, and MAIT cell populations using samples froma controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study in a Tanzanian cohort of young adult males (age 20-35 y) exposed to aseptic PfSPZs (PfSPZ challenge) (42). We found that CHMI signicantlyaffected the NK and MAIT cell population frequencies and that changes in the MAIT cell population persisted for $168 d postinfection. To further interrogate these changes in MAIT cell frequency, we used a novel method to reconstruct TCR ab-chain usage from single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) data. Analysis of these data suggests that the MAIT cell population rebound after the blood-stage parasitemia is driven by homeostaticexpansion mechanisms. Together, these data demonstrate that CHMI induces long-lasting changes in the composition of the innate-like lymphocyte compartment, with the most pronouncedchanges occurring in the MAIT cell population. We discuss the implications of these data in the context of recurrent infection, pathology, and vaccine development.Materials and Methods Ethics statement PBMCs analyzed in this study were collected during the CHMI trial conducted in Tanzania and described in Shekalaghe et al.

This CHMIwas conducted as a single-center, randomized, double-blind controlled trialenrolling volunteers following predened inclusion and exclusion criteria.All volunteers gave written informed consent before screening and beingenrolled in the study, and the trial was performed in accordance with GoodClinical Practices, an investigational new drug application led with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (14267), and an Investigational Medical Product Dossier led with the Tanzanian Food and Drug Administration.The protocol was approved by institutional review boards (IRBs) of theIfakara Health Institute (IHI/IRB/No25), the National Institute for MedicalResearch, Tanzania Ethikkom-mission Beider Basel (Basel, Switzerland; EKBB 319/11). The protocol was also approved by the Tanzanian Food and Drug Administration (Reference Number CE.57/180/04A/50), and the trial was registered athttps://clinicaltrials.gov/ (NCT01540903). Samples analyzed Cryopreserved samples including only the participant identier (ID; nopersonal or identiable information) from this study were sent from theIfakara Health Institute to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center foranalysis with approval by the IRB (number 7349). In the 2.5 310 4(25K) PfSPZ group, one volunteer had to be excluded from the analysis as aresult of premature malaria treatment, and only volunteers who developed asexual blood-stage parasites after administration of Sanaria PfSPZ chal- lenge were included in the analysis. Venous blood was drawn prior to theintradermal injection of PfSPZ challenge (day 0) and at subsequent timepoints (days 9, 28, 56, and 168) (42). Volunteers were monitored for onsetof the asexual blood-stage parasitemia by examination of thick bloodsmears by microscopy and were treated with a curative dose of Coartem following national guidelines. A very limited number of samples were also available from blood drawn at the time of microscopy-based diagnosis ofasexual blood-stage parasitemia. Importantly, although these volunteerswere not malaria naive, they had not had a documented malaria episode inthe past 5 y. PBMC samples were stored in liquid nitrogen and thenshipped to the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred HutchinsonCancer Research Center for analysis by flow cytometry or RNAseq or were used for ex vivo-stimulation assays. Lymphocyte counts of volunteers participating in this CHMI were collected using a Sysmex XS-800i ma-chine. Flow populations, bulk PBMCsor sorted MAIT cells were stained with Aqua Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen). Our gating strategy and representative FACS plots are shown in Supplemental Fig. 2, and our four FACS analysis panels areshown in Supplemental Fig. 3. Cell sorting PBMCs were stained with the described sort panel and sorted on a FAC-SAria (BD) into complete RP10. Populations sorted were CD8+MAIT (CD3+CD8+CD161hiVa7.2+) cells. All sorts were performed on a FAC- SAria II. Single-cell RNAseq processing, sequencing, and alignment After flow sorting, single cells were captured on the Fluidigm C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep System (C1), lysed and subjected to reversetranscription and cDNA amplication using the SMARTer Ultra Low InputRNA Kit for the Fluidigm C1 System (Clontech, Mountain View, CA).Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), according to C1 protocols (Fluidigm). Barcoded libraries were pooled and quantied using a Qubit Fluorometer(Thermo Scientic, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Single-readsequencing of the pooled libraries was carried out on a HiScanSQ or aHiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina) and SBS kits (Illumina) with a target depth .2.5 M reads. Se- quences were aligned to the UCSC Human Genome Assembly version 38, and gene expression levels were quantied using RSEM and TPM values loaded into R for analyses. We used the MAST analysis platform (23) forsubsequent single-cell analysis steps. Quality-control parameters for thesingle-cell RNAseq data included expression of $500 genes, alignment rate.80%, library size .10,000, and exon rate .30% (all four criteria have to be met to for a single cell to be included). MAIT cells were2 INNATE-LIKE IMMUNITY TO CONTROLLED HUMAN MALARIA INFECTION Page 157 of 222analyzed directly after sorting and were not stimulated prior to single-cell RNAseq processing. MAIT cell-stimulation assay A total of 2000-20,000 CD8+MAIT cells was untreated or were IL-15 (eBioscience), and IL-18 anti-CD3/CD28-coupled beads (Invitrogen). At 20 h, a1:1000 nal dilution. For intracellular cells were xed with Cytox/Cytoperm and permeabilized with Perm/Wash (both from BD), per the manufacturer's instructions, and stained for intracellular cytokines.Samples were run on an LSR II (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software(TreeStar). Statistical analysis Statistical signicance comparing control and treated subjects was assessedusing a Type II ANOVA for a linear mixed-effect model with patient-levelrandom intercepts, with alevel of 5%. R functions lmer and Anova in lme4 and car packages were used for the calculations. Comparison of time points with each other was done using a paired ttest with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Results Innate-like lymphocyte frequencies change in a PfSPZ infection dose-dependent manner To study the innate-like lymphocyte response to PfSPZ infection, we analyzed samples from a trial conducted in African volunteerspre-exposed to malaria with intradermal application of 1 nonattenuated PfSPZs ( twelve volunteers in the 10K PfSPZgroup and 10 of 11 (42). Blood was drawn prior to the intradermal challenge (day 0) and at subsequent time points (days 9, 28, 56,and 168) (42). Volunteers were monitored for the onset of the blood parasitemia stage by blood smear and were treated with Coartem following a positive blood smear to clear the infection. Avery limited number of samples were also available from blood drawn at the time of blood parasitemia diagnosis. Importantly, although these volunteers were not malaria naive, they had not hada documented malaria episode in the past 5 y. Thus, the design ofthis study allowed us to determine how NK, iNKT, and MAIT cell function and frequencies change early (day 9) following CHMI and to longitudinally examine the duration of these changes in acohort that is highly relevant for malaria vaccine efforts. We initially determined whether an infection with 10K or 25K PfSPZs affects the composition of the innate-like lymphocytecompartment in the venous blood by flow cytometry. and 18+) on days 0 and 9 postinfection and then after the Coartem treatment on days 28, 56, and 168. The gating strategies used and representative flow cytometry plots are shown in Supplemental Fig. 2.

Signicant changes in the frequency of MAIT cells within the CD8+T cell population following infection with the 10K dose were not observed (Fig. 1A, left versus right panels), indicating that MAIT cells respond in an infection dose-dependent manner. This was recapitulated whencalculating the absolute number of CD8 +MAIT cells in the blood (Supplemental Fig. 1). Importantly, the absolute number of CD3+ T cells (cells per microliter blood) did not change signicantly overtime, indicating that this population serves as a suitable reference point to display T cell subset frequencies (Supplemental Fig. 1). We next examined the frequencies of NK cells and iNKT cells (Fig. 1B,1C). NK cell frequencies in the lymphocyte were re-duced signicantly on day 28 ( p=0 . 0 0 0 5 )a n do nd a y5 6 (p=0 . 0 0 8 3 )p o s t i n f e c t i o n ,p a r t i c ularly in the high challenge group (Fig. 1B). NK cell frequencies are shown as the percentage of theCD3 2lymphocyte population, but the same result is seen whenanalyzing NK cell numbers per microliter of blood (SupplementalFig. 1C). contrast to NK and MAIT cells, iNKT cell frequenciesdid not change signicantly following the infection, regardless of the PfSPZ dose (Fig. 1C). Given the changes in the MAIT cell pop- ulation following CHMI in the 25K challenge group and consideringtheir functional potential (IFN- gproduction) and abundance in the liver (up to 40% of all T cells), we primarily focused on the moreabundant CD8 +MAIT cell subset for the rest of the study to de- termine the consequences of CHMI on the MAIT cell population. MAIT cell frequencies change following PfSPZ infection We examined the frequency of MAIT cells (CD3+Va7.2+CD161hi; CD8+and CD82subsets) on days 0 and 9 postinfection, during the blood parasitemia stage and then after the Coartem treatment on days 28, 56, and 168. To better dissect the changes in theMAIT cell population, we looked at the frequency of all (CD8 + FIGURE 2. MAIT cell frequency is altered following intradermal injection with PfSPZs.

We found that the fre- quency of MAIT cells within the CD3+population decreased signicantly during the blood parasitemia stage ( p= 0.0302) and rebounded thereafter, with MAIT cell frequencies on day 168 exceeding the initial day-0 baseline level ( p= 0.0072, Fig. 2A). This pattern was also observed when the MAIT population was divided into CD82and CD8+cell subsets samples to this MAIT cell analysis experiment; thus, these samplescould not be included in any subsequent experiments. MAIT cell activation occurs in a limited manner during the course of the infection Exposure to proinflammatory cytokines is sufcient to induce MAIT cell activation (23, 24). Release of parasites from the liver into the bloodstream is associated with a proinflammatory immune response, which could activate MAIT cells. Thus, we rstaddressed whether there are signs of MAIT cell activation on day 9 postinfection. CD69 is an early marker of T cell activation and although an increase in CD69 surface expression is often used asan indicator of TCR signaling, inflammatory signals are also sufcient to induce expression (43). We examined surface ex- pression levels of CD69 and found no signicant changes on day9o rl a t e r( F i g .3 A ) .S i m i l a r l y ,t h ef r e q u e n c yo fC D 2 5 +-a n dCD40L+-expressing MAIT cells did not increase signicantly on days 9 and 28 following challenge with PfSPZs (Fig. 3B, 3C).CD25 +MAIT cells were signicantly 56 (p= 0.0011) (Fig. 3B). Finally, NKG2D expression did not change signicantly postinfection (Fig. 3D). Together, these flow cytom-etry data suggest that ex vivo MAIT cell activation is minimal at the interrogated time points. MAIT cell effector function is limited on day 9 postinfection To determine whether there is early (day 9) acquisition of effector function, we examined the ex vivo expression of IL-17, cytokine staining and flow cytometry (Fig. 4). We found no evidence of signicant ex vivoMAIT cell effector function on days 9, 28, 56, and 168 postin- fection. We considered two possibilities for the lack of ex vivoeffector function: a lack of activating inflammatory signals andparasite-induced impairment of function. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we next tested how MAIT cells isolated before and after blood-stage parasitemia respond to TCR andcytokine stimulation ex vivo. MAIT cells remain functional following infection with PfSPZs We isolated MAIT cells from ve donors by FACS and examined whether their ability to respond to ex vivo stimulation was changed on days 9 and 28 postinfection compared with day 0. We measuredthe ability of MAIT cells to express IFN-g , grzB, and IL-17A/F FIGURE 3. Limited MAIT cell postinfection. Expression of CD69 cells in the high-dose (25K PfSPZ) group. Signicant changes compared with day 0 are indicated with an asterisk (*). Statistical signicance comparing control and treated subjects was done using a Type II ANOVA for a linear mixed-effect model.

Volunteer IDs are listed, with each volunteer depicted in a distinct color.The Journal of Immunology 5 Page 160 of 222following stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12/15/ 18) or a combination of TCR signals delivered by anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads and IL-12/15/18. Regardless of the time point postinfection, MAIT cells responded to both stimulation condi- tions and almost uniformly expressed grzB (Fig. 5A) and IFN- g (Fig. 5B). A much smaller fraction expressed IL-17A or IL-17F atall three time points (Fig. 5C, 5D). Together, these data suggest that MAIT cells remain responsive to TCR and cytokine-mediated stimulation on day 9 or 28 postinfection. To determine whether wecan identify MAIT cell activation early postinfection, we next examined MAIT cells from one donor using single-cell RNAseq. Single-cell RNAseq analysis of MAIT cells We isolated MAIT cells by FACS from donor 20064 and used the C1 Fluidigm system to interrogate changes in gene-expression signatures on a single-cell level by comparing data from days 0,9, and 28 after CHMI. Using an analysis method that we developed previously (23), we found that some, but not all, MAIT cells ex- press grzB or IFN- gtranscripts on day 9 postinfection, but not on days 0 and 28 (Fig. 6A), suggesting that some MAIT cells are indeed partially activated on day 9 postinfection. To acquire a more global understanding of the MAIT cell changes, we used the single-cell data to compare the tran-scriptome of these single cells at days 0, 9, and 28 postinfection. We found that the MAIT cell population displayed a distinct RNA-expression prole on each day (Fig. 6B), suggesting that theydo respond to the PfSPZ challenge by day 9 and do not return tobaseline transcriptional status by day 28. To better understand thenature of these changes, we next reconstructed the TCR aand TCRbsequences from the transcriptome and analyzed the CDR3 region to identify clonal diversity (Fig. 6C, Supplemental Fig. 4).We did not observe signicant changes in the relative distributionof MAIT cell clones by day 28, suggesting that the expansion ofMAIT cells is not dominated by a distinct TCR-bearing clonal population. We found an increase in the coexpression of IL-7R a and the c g-chain (needed for signal transduction and shared with other cytokine receptors) on days 9 and 28 (Fig. 6D). AlthoughIL-7 is typically associated with prom oting homeostatic proliferation (44), recent studies suggest that IL-7 can induce MAIT cell cy- totoxic function (45, 46). The increase in mRNA encoding for the cg-chain on MAIT cells was conrmed at the protein level by flow cytometry staining (Fig. 6E). Given this potential change in re- sponsiveness to cytokine signals, we next wanted to determine whether the expanded MAIT cell population is distinct, in terms of trafcking properties, from the preinfection MAIT cell population. Trafcking properties in MAIT cells To determine whether the tissu e-trafcking properties of MAIT cells change postinfection, we used FACS to examine chemokine receptor expression following CHMI. To specically determine the liver- and tissue-homing potential of MAIT cells during CHMI, we analyzed the expression of CCR6, CXCR6,and CXCR3. Briefly, CCR6 is a key receptor to enable trafcking toinflamed tissues, and CXCR6 plays an essential role for trafcking FIGURE 4.

Volunteer IDs are listed, with each volunteer depicted in a distinct color.6 INNATE-LIKE IMMUNITY TO CONTROLLED HUMAN MALARIA INFECTION Page 161 of 222to the liver (47-49). The majority of MAIT cells expressed CCR6 and CXCR6 on their surface prior to CHMI. Overall, we found that expression of CCR6 and CXCR6 was fairly stable over time(Fig. 7A, 7B). Only a small fraction of MAIT cells expressed CXCR3, which has recently been shown to orchestrate migration of Ag-specic T cells (50). We observed an initial signicantdecrease (day 0 versus day 28, p= 0.0078) in the frequency of CXCR3 +CD8+MAIT cells that was followed by an increase over time that approached the initial expression frequency (Fig. 7C). Discussion CHMI is a powerful approach to study immune responses following dened exposure to P. falciparum in different human populations (51). We report that a single intradermal infection with aseptic, puried, cryopreserved PfSPZs has profound long-lasting effects on the innate-like lymphocyte compartment in the peripheral blood of adult Tanzanian volunteers pre-exposed to malaria. Toour knowledge, MAIT cells in malaria-naive volunteers under-going similar CHMI approaches have not been studied (51). Weobserved a signicant decrease in the frequency of blood- circulating MAIT cells following intradermal infection with 25KPfSPZs during early blood-stage parasitemia (days 11-18 post-infection). This was followed by a rebound in the frequency of MAIT cells that exceeded the initial baseline frequency and was sustained for months after the infection (Figs. 1, 2, SupplementalFig. 1). The long-lasting (168-d) increase in MAIT cell frequency that we observed is remarkable, because an acute infection or vaccine application typically changes the innate immune systemonly temporarily before it returns to baseline. In contrast, long- lasting changes are seen in the adaptive immune system due to Ag-specic adaptive memory immune responses. This was ele-gantly demonstrated by Tsang and colleagues (52) on a systems biology level in the context of the influenza vaccine. Our data suggest that an acute infection with PfSPZ did not just result in atemporary immune perturbation but instead had a long-lasting impact on MAIT cells. Importantly, these changes occurred in an infection dose-dependent manner in volunteers infected with25K, but not 10K, PfSPZs (Fig. 1). These two doses resulted in FIGURE 5. MAIT cells remain functional and responsive to stimulation ex vivo. FACS-puried CD8+CD161hiVa7.2+cells were stimulated with cy- tokines (IL-12/15/18) or a combination of a TCR signal plus cytokines (TCR+IL-12/15/18), or were left unstimulated (No stim), for of IL-17F ( C), and IL-17A ( D) was measured in ve randomly chosen donors on days 0, 9, and 28. MAIT cells responded to each stimulation condition, but we did not detect signicant changes when comparing MAIT cell responses to cytokine IL-12/15/18 (green bars) or TCR+IL-12/15/18 (blue bars) stimulation between the different time points (days 0, 9, and 28).The Journal of Immunology 7 Page 162 of 222P. fal ciparum infections with differen t geometric mean stage parasitemia prepatent periods microscopy ( 0.023) and 12.2 by quantitative PCR ( p= 0.076) (42). This kinetic difference is presumably due to the release of higher numbers ofmerozoites from the liver in the 25K PfSPZ group that resulted ina shorter prepatent period in comparison with the 10K PfSPZgroup. Malaria treatment decision was based on the detection of asexual blood-stage parasites in the blood by microscopy. Given the difference in detection sensitivity between quantitative PCRand microscopy, the immune system had likely been exposed to asexual blood-stage parasites for 2.5-3 d in both groups before initiation of Coartem treatment. Based on this similarity in the duration of the blood-stage phase of infection in the two dosage groups, the infection dose-dependent differences that we observed (Fig. 1) are likely due to an increased inflammatory response inthe liver following infection with 25K PfSPZ as opposed to a prolonged infection during the blood stage. Interestingly, early after 25K PfSPZ infection, the NK cell frequency decreas ed signicantly, similarly to MAIT cells (Fig. 1B), but then slowly (by day 168) returned to baseline lev-els. This decrease contrasts with data from an animal modeldemonstrating that NK cells in the blood expand robustly and early postinfection (40). Support for the notion that NK cellscontribute to the antiparasite immune response comes from a re- cent study showing that human NK cells bind to and eliminate infected RBCs using cell contact-dependent mechanisms (53).Additional human studies will be required to determine whichaspects of the mouse model system can be used to mimic human NK cell responses. Finally, iNKT cell frequencies were stable, regardless of the challenge dose (Fig. 1C). We argue that this isunexpected given the many similarities between iNKT and MAIT cells in terms of proinflammatory cytokine responsiveness (26). Future studies will need to address why MAIT cells, but notiNKT cells, are affected by CHMI. To examine whether MAIT cell function is altered in addition to frequency, we next examined MAIT cells for expression of markersthat indicate recent activation (CD69, CD25), as well as ex TNF- a, IFN- g, grzB). MAIT cells did not show a strong increase in expression of biomarkers that indicate activation at early or later time points (Fig. 3) or thatdisplayed ex vivo effector function on day 9 or later postinfection FIGURE 6.

Importantly, MAIT cells remained fully responsive to activating signals ex vivo (Fig. 5). These data demonstrate that MAIT cell function is not lost and argue against the existence ofinhibitory signals that impair MAIT cell function following PfSPZ infection. This is in contrast to reports that suggest parasite- specic adaptive immune responses are impaired by the pres-ence of asexual blood-stage parasites (11). Determining that MAIT cells remain functional is highly relevant, because mech- anisms that activate MAIT cells in the liver could be of interest asa potential therapeutic strategy against the liver-stage disease.Because of their high abundance in the liver (up to 45% of T cells), MAIT cells may be involved in maintaining liver ho- meostasis during malaria parasite infections and might provideearly antiparasite effector mediators (e.g., IFN- gproduction) be- fore the adaptive immune response is recruited and fully devel-oped. The size of the MAIT cell population in the liver likelyexceeds the size of the adaptive Ag-specic T cell population that could be induced by vaccination. In this context, it is also im- portant to consider that MAIT cells have high expression levels ofCCR6 and CXCR6, allowing them to trafc to the liver. Impor- tantly, we found evidence of partial activation by single-cell RNAseq (Fig. 6A), suggesting that there are some activating,but yet unknown, stimuli early postinfection. It is noteworthy that,despite minimal initial activation, the MAIT cell transcriptome didnot return to baseline in the time frame tested, because we still found transcriptional differe nces on day 28 postinfection (Fig. 6B). Future studies will need to examine the MAIT cell transcriptome at later time points postinfection to determine how long this functional alteration lasts. Next, we used these single-cell RNAseq MAIT cell tran- scriptome data to reconstruct TCR a- and b-chain usage in the MAIT cell population on days 0, 9, and 28 from the same donor. Although MAIT cells express an invariant a-chain, there are differences in the CDR3 junctions that allowed us to track distinctMAIT cell clones (Fig. 6C). Given that we observed an increase in MAIT cell frequency starting by day 28 in an infection dose- dependent manner, we asked how the TCR abdistribution changed at these three time points. We wanted to distinguish whether the increase on day 28 is due to a relocation of the same MAIT cell population back into circulation after its sharp declineon the day of parasitemia or whether it is indicative of replen- ishment of the MAIT cell population via homeostatic mechanisms or de novo generation from the thymus. Our single-cell RNAseqdata did not reveal signicant changes in the TCR repertoire among days 0, 9, and 28, indicative of an overall MAIT cell ex- pansion rather than a clonotype-driven response (Fig. 6C). Inter-estingly, a previous study reported a sustained expansion of gd T cells following a primary CHMI in naive volunteers, but it is FIGURE 7.

Additional comparison of time points with each other was done using a paired ttest with FDR. Signicant changes are indicated with an asterisk (*), and pvalues were determined using a ttest. The yellow line in each graph represents the median.The Journal of Immunology 9 Page 164 of 222still unclear whether this expansion is polyclonal or clonally driven (51, 54). Importantly, in the context of the increased IL-7Raand cgcoexpression on day 28, we argue that the increase in the MAIT cell population is triggered by homeostatic expansion.Homeostatic expansion occurs in response to available growthfactors and is typically driven by cytokines (e.g., IL-7 and IL-15) whose receptor uses the common g-chain (55, 56). Increased re- sponsiveness to IL-7 through enhanced IL-7R aexpression could be of specic interest because it also positively affects MAIT celleffector function (45, 46). Given the temporary decrease in MAIT cell frequency in the blood of the 25K PfSPZ group, we considered that MAIT cells could migrate to other tissues or, alternatively, undergo apopto- sis. A decrease in blood MAIT cell frequencies following infection is not unusual and has been reported in several other instances,including active tuberculosis (57) and HIV (58-60), although the fate of the MAIT cells in these situations has not been fully re- solved. In an effort to determine whether migration may play arole in these MAIT cell changes, we examined the expression patterns of three highly relevant chemokine receptors for homing to the liver and other tissues: CCR6, CXCR6, and CXCR3(Fig. 7). We did not nd any signicant differences in the ex-pression pattern of CCR6 and CXCR6, with only a temporary decrease in CXCR3 expression early postinfection. This shows that MAIT cells remain responsive to chemotactic signals but doesnot provide insight into the relationship between blood and tissue MAIT cells. Ultimately, it would be necessary to examine human liver tissue to understand the dynamics of the MAIT cell response.MAIT cells are rare in mice; however, a recently developed mouse model with MAIT cell frequencies that approximate those in humans opens new possibilities for studying MAIT cells in ananimal model (61). How biologically relevant are these changes in the MAIT cell and NK cell populations? NK cells play an important and non-redundant role in host defense against viruses, particularly her-pesviruses. Although the frequency of NK cells eventually normalized again, it raises the question whether the PfSPZ-induced NK cell decrease may have a temporary general negative impact onhost immunity, given the critical role of NK cells for protection against herpesvirus infections (62). This is particularly interesting in the context of EBV infections, because coinfection is a majorrisk factor for developing Burkitt lymphoma, and exposure to malaria can affect immune responses against EBV (63-65). Fi- nally, MAIT cells have been suggested to play a role in antibac-terial immunity through sensing of MHC-related protein 1-boundmicrobial products, but they appear quite sensitive to inflamma- tory cues in the absence of Ag. Thus, MAIT cells may act as an amplier of early proinflammatory signals, and an increase inMAIT cells may lead to a more profound subsequent proin- flammatory response. In the context of malaria, these changes in the early immune response to the parasite may be benecial andcontribute to clearance, and they may also exacerbate pathologies that have been associated with excessive inflammatory responses. It is important to keep in mind that we studied the immune re-sponse following a dened single malaria infection event initiated by puried, cryopreserved sporozoites of a dened genotype, NF54, and treatment occurred upon detection of the blood stage ofinfection. Under natural conditions, humans are exposed to mul-tiple infectious mosquito bites carrying a range of parasite geno- types, and treatment is typically not immediate. Thus, the well-dened CHMI approach allows us to study the immune re-sponse in the context of the liver stage and the early blood stage of infection, which will help to interpret data from more complex natural infection studies.Changes in the initial immune response affect the ensuing adaptive immune response, which is of relevance in the context ofvaccine efcacy. Our data demonstrate changes in the NK and MAIT cell compartment months after CHMI. Additional studies are now required to address how these changes alter the outcome ofrepeated malaria infections (delivered by CHMI or natural infec- tions) that could be benecial or detrimental for malaria-induced pathology, viral or bacterial coinfections, and vaccine take andresponsiveness in individuals with recent history of malaria ex- posure, particularly infants and children (66).

General discussion This chapter discusses the outcomes of malaria vaccine and challenge studies performed in the context of my PhD thesis. We evaluated the most advanced pre- erythrocytic malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01 in Bagamoyo, Tanzania - a setting where malaria is endemic and where the target population for this vaccine lives. We provide novel insights on the immunological evaluation of RTS,S/AS01 induced immunity and its relation to measured vaccine efficacy against P. falciparum malaria in African children and infants (Chapter 4). In addition we discuss the potential of using CHMI in malaria endemic countries as a tool for accelerating malaria vaccine and drug development in the relevant target population (Chapter 5 ). We further give recommendations for possible improvement of the current vaccine development approaches and outline the contribution of the current PhD work in the field of malaria vaccine development. 6\u00111\u00111 \u0011 Investigation of safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS01\u0011 vaccine in Tanzania paediatric population Volunteer safety while receiving a novel, non-registered investigational product is top priority in clinical trials, particularly when targeting healthy populations in vaccine development. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine candidate, tested in a large phase III trial, is the most advanced vaccine so far in the malaria vaccine development pipeline. Despite the large-scale testing of RTS,S/AS01 in eleven African centers and the long follow up period of 32 months, important knowledge gaps remain. Mode of action, immune correlates of protection and factors driving the reduced vaccine efficacy in different malaria endemicities remain unclear. The Page 173 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion question of why the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine shows lower efficacy in infants when compared to children of 5-17 months and how the different outcomes of the vaccine trials are affected by pre-existing malaria endemicity is far from clear. Moreover, the modest increase of IgG antibody titers to the NANP repeat region post-booster dose at month 20 compared to the peak response post-dose three is remarkable (JOINT TECHNICAL EXPERT GROUP., 2015). In addition, the question of whether children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01 are prone to a malaria rebound when living in higher malaria transmission regions is of serious concern (Olotu et al., 2016). Surprisingly, little is known about relevant antibody subclasses and the avidity and functionality of protective antibodies required for conferring protection. Similarly, the quality, kinetics and quantity of vaccine-specific cellular immune response and their relation to long term protection remain obscure. In Bagamoyo, safety and efficacy was assessed during this phase 3 randomized, controlled, double- blinded trial, in infants aged 6-12 weeks at time of enrolment (chapter 4; paper I). In this trial, infants were randomly assigned to receive three doses of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine or a comparator vaccine, administered intramuscularly at 1-month intervals, with or without a fourth dose given 20 months after the first dose and participants were followed up through passive surveillance. In this study, we showed that the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine generally demonstrated an excellent safety profile. A comparable safety profile was also reported in early phases of RTS,S/AS01 when trials were conducted in malaria na\u00efve population in the US and Europe (Schwartz et al., 2012). Page 174 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion However, several safety signals have become apparent during recent data analysis such as the mortality increase in girls (Klein et al., 2016) . The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) reported a 2-fold increase mortality in girls than in boys vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01; when a combined additional safety signal analysis was performed by gender and study arm (WER-WHO, 2016). While girls are more at risk of being neglected by the ir families in certain cultures, there is also clear evidence that sex-based differences in susceptibility to infectious diseases and immunity against vaccines exist (Klein et al., 2015, 2015; Ruggieri et al., 2016). So far, unexplained serious adverse events such as cerebral malaria, meningitis and death are slightly higher in the RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees when compared to the control group. Such observations could be incidental findings, as some of the cases were realized later without any obvious timely relationship to vaccination. These safety signals make further investigation of the safety of RTS,S/AS01 when deployed under \"real life conditions\" a must before approval for routine use is granted. We further evaluated the efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in a phase 3 study that included 6,537 infants expecting that the outcome would be similar or even better when compared to what has been observed earlier in phase I and phase II studies. However, the efficacy achieved in this phase III trial was lower when compared to the efficacy demonstrated in the early studies conducted in a comparable environment and age group (Asante et al., 2011). In striking contrast to a moderate efficacy observed in the current RTS,S/AS01 vaccine trial in infants; the previous trials of RTS,S/AS01 demonstrated superior efficacy when tested in malaria na\u00efve subjects (Kester et al., 2007, 2009; Leroux-Roels et al., 2014) , semi- Page 175 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion immune African adults volunteers (Polhemus et al., 2009) and fairly encouraging efficacy in older children (5-17 months) (Agnandji et al., 2011). In order to address the question as to why the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine appears to be more efficacious in naive and semi-immune children than in infants living in Africa, we have started to analyze the blood samples collected from the children cohort during our trial in Bagamoyo and the anaylsis is on ongoing. At the moment, we could hypothesize that the level of efficacy observed in the current study is a clear-cut finding, making the effort for designing a second generation vaccine crucial. However, age-dependent immune response could be another possible explanation. It is well established that resistance to severe malaria increases with increase in age and exposure (Doolan et al., 2009; Griffin et al., 2015; Olotu et al., 2011). Infant immune systems are not well developed and have limited exposure to antigens in utero . Therefore protection against infections in this population is thought to be heavily dependent on their provision of protective maternal antibodies and well-functioning innate immune systems (PrabhuDas et al., 2011). This is also supported by higher anti-CSP antibodies detected in older children compared to infants, albeit antibodies have not been well established as marker of protective vaccine induced immunity (Kester et al., 2009; Olotu et al., 2011) . An alternative explanation could be that the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine protects individuals from developing blood stage infection, leading to a slower acquisition of immunity to blood-stage parasites. Such scenario will result in a rebound of clinical malaria cases at a later life stage, as recently demonstrated by Olotu and Page 176 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion colleagues (Olotu et al., 2016). It could also be true that other factors such as heterogeneity of natural exposure and individual based vaccine intake and responses played a role in the observed lower efficacy in the infant group. Co-administration of RTS,S/AS01 with other EPI vaccines could be another cause of inferior efficacy shown in the current trial. Cellular immune interference has been shown to have an impact when two vaccines containing similar protein components are administered in parallel (Dagan et al., 1998) . The hepatitis B vaccine that was co-administered with RTS,S/AS01 has a fusion protein that also incorporates the HBsAg. This could also be a reason for the disappointing vaccine efficacy observed in the infant cohort. However, th is tendency warrants further detailed analysis of the impact of co-administering the vaccine with EPI vaccines. Presence of maternal antibodies, fetal haemoglobin and low exposure in infants has been shown to play critical roles in efficacy of other vaccines in infants (Billig et al., 2012; Edwards, 2015). However, despite that in this particular study these parameters were not tested, a slightly higher efficacy that was reported in children cohort suggests pre-existing hemoglobinopathies might not underline lower efficacy in the infant cohort. Cellular and humoral immune responses are both important in protection against malaria infection (Good and Doolan, 1999; Schofield and Mueller, 2006) and are likely to be affected by the level of malaria exposure. African field trials of malaria vaccines have mostly generated evidences of humoral immune responses, while data regarding cellular immunity remains under explored (White et al., 2015). The most challenging hurdles in conducting the cellular immune assays in infants and Page 177 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion children are a limited blood volume that can be obtain ed from this population, getting an acceptable frequency of repeat sample collection and gaining ethical and parental approval for the enrolment of usually healthy children in research studies (MOORMANN, 2009). The quality and quantity of the PBMC isolation in any cellular immune response assays is also critical. In the current study we managed to collect PBMCs and plasma samples at different time points and cryo- preserved them in liquid nitrogen vapor phase and - 80qC, respectively for future investigation of vaccine-induced cellular and humoral immune responses. We showed that the collected PBMCs were still good quality in terms of viability and quantity even after 5 years of storage (chapter 4; paper IV). In this thesis work, we also demonstrated that Th1 responses could be the best immunological markers for RTS,S/AS01 vaccine induced immunity while Th2 responses, in particular IL5 and RANTES, might represent markers for lack of protective immune responses. We detected a lower induction of protective Th1 (IFN-g, IL15 and GM-CSF) responses by RTS,S/AS01 in infants compared to children while Th2 (IL4 and IL13) and the pro- inflammatory markers (TNF and IL- 1) responses remained similar in both cohorts (chapter 4; paper III). These findings provide further supporting evidence as to why infants in the RTS,S/AS01 phase III study had lower vaccine efficacy compared to the children cohort. Previous studies of RTS,S/AS01 also reported similar trends of increas ed responses in children rather than in infants when they compared anti-CSP antibodies amongst children and infant cohorts (White et al., 2015) . The accumulating evidence from multiple previous clinical challenge trials the USA, Page 178 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion adult or paediatric field trials in different age groups and across the distinct transmission settings of The Gambia, Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania suggest that the protective mechanism of the RTS,S/AS01 is strongly supported by antibodies against the CSP repeat region (Moorthy and Ballou, 2009). Since maternal antibodies have been reported to interfere with antibody generation during vaccination (Edwards, 2015; Niewiesk, 2014); we hypothesize that the poor efficacy observed in the RTS,S/AS01 infant cohort could also be due to effect of maternal antibodies. We argue that vaccine efficacy in young children was much better since maternal antibodies persist for a short period in early life and during the age of 5-17 months most of the maternal antibodies have disappeared. We further evaluated the quality of RTS,S/AS01 induced anti-CSP antibodies in a phase 2 study aiming to investigate the effect of RTS,S/AS01 vaccination schedule on protective efficacy and avidity of anti-CSP antibodies in 6-12 weeks African infants (chapter 4; paper II). We showed that the magnitude of increase of anti- CSP IgG concentration and avidity between second and third vaccine injection an d not the anti-CSP IgG concentration and avidity alone is associated with a strong risk reduction for malaria after immunization. This is in line with the findings of recent studies showing that, despite malaria exposed children having a higher antibody avidity compared to children with less malaria exposure; the observed avidity alone did not predict protection (Olotu et al., 2014). Several explanations for lack of correlation between efficacy and avidity of RTS,S/AS01 induced antibodies in children could be: First, the co-linearity between antibody concentration and avidity might have blurred the effect of avidity in this study. Page 179 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion On the other hand, the finding may also suggest that avidity might not be an important determinant of vaccine efficacy or that our assay was not sufficient to reflect the avidity. Second, our assay was designed to detect antibodies against the CSP-repeat region, which was shown to be an immunodominant epitope. Neglecting to measure antibodies against the C-terminal flanking region might potentially exclude some relevant antibody responses that could explain the effectiveness of the vaccine (Watt et al., 2013). The use of new techniques such as Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) could be an alternative and more sensitive method in future to investigate antibody avidity induced by vaccination compared to the thiocyanate elusion method (Reddy et al., 2012). In Conclusion, acquired immunity to malaria develops with increasing age and repeated infections. Understanding immune correlates underlying protection against malaria in early life will facilitate vaccine development. Our results highlight the need for revisiting and designing a vaccination schedule and formulation that will modulate the immune system towards a potent Th1 response during the first months of life and avoid counteracting responses such as IL- 5 and maternal antibodies. A complete understanding of the mechanism underlying the acquisition of protective immunity in malaria exposed individuals is crucial for outlining the strategies for a better malaria vaccine development. Page 180 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion 6\u00111\u00112\u0011 Controlled human malaria infections as a cornerstone to accelerate malaria vaccine development in Africa Controlled human malaria infections (CHMI) have provided a landscape for malaria researchers to test malaria vaccine efficacy in well-controlled setting. The call for urgency in the development of an efficacious malaria vaccine has led to increased demand for conducting early stage CHMI-based efficacy studies in malaria endemic regions (Laurens et al., 2012). The experimental P.falciparum challenge model in human using a syringe and needle was first introduced into African settings in 2012. CHMI has demonstrated the greatest ability to predict efficacy of malaria vaccines in malaria-naive adults (Spring et al., 2014), and here for the first time in the history of malaria vaccine development, we evaluated whether CHMI can reproduce such results in pre-exposed population. In this study (chapter 5; paper V), we show for the first time that inoculation of healthy, young adult, Tanzanian males with aseptic, purified, cryopreserved P. falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ challenge), was safe, well tolerated and was as infective as in malaria na\u00efve volunteers. We used samples collected during this CHMI study to explore adaptive cellular immune activation following different doses of PfSPZ challenge (chapter 5; paper VI), examined the memory B cells, antibodies and their opsonising activities before and after CHMI (chapter 5; paper VII), and the impact on innate-like lymphocytes such as MAIT cell, iNK T cell and NK cells (chapter 5; paper VIII ). To understand the effect of malaria pre-exposure on anti-parasite immunity during CHMI, we compared the role of pre-existing antibodies in a CHMI study conducted Page 181 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion in malaria na\u00efve Dutch adults and malaria semi-immune Tanzanian adults who received essentially the same dose of PfSPZ challenge delivered intradermally (chapter 5; paper VI). Here we show that pre-existing antibodies to P. falciparum antigens had a significant effect on the outcome of the CHMI as demonstrated by the longer prepatency period and lower parasite load at the time of first detection as assessed by qPCR in the Tanzanian versus the Dutch cohort. Antibody responses in na\u00efve Dutch subjects versus malaria semi-immune Tanzanian subjects who received same dose of PfSPZ challenge were also compared. The higher fold increase in anti-malaria antibodi es observed in Tanzania subjects but not in Dutch subjects after CHMI suggests the presence and boosting of pre- existing humoral immunity (chapter 5; paper VI). However, it remains to be answered in the future studies whether and which proportion of these boosted humoral responses resulted from naturally acquired immunity; or have been elicited by the longer and transient asexual blood stage parasitaemia exposed to the immune system before malaria treatment initiation. Our results indicate that the immune response against malaria in pre-exposed individuals might differ from that of malaria-na\u00efve individuals during CHMI. In chapter 5, paper VII; we present findings from a merozoite opsonization assay that was used as a measure of functionality of antibodies detected before, during and after CHMI. We showed that the antibodies produced had a peak level of opsonization function one month after CHMI, and these responses remained significantly higher after 6 months compared to baseline. Of note, the boosting of opsonising antibody responses was evident in volunteers who - at the time of intradermal sporozoite injection - showed lower functional antibody levels but not in Page 182 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion volunteers with higher levels. These differences in boosting the level of opsonizing antibodies observed in lower and higher responders could be explained by the differences in malaria pre-exposure status amongst the two groups of na\u00efve and pre-exposed adults. Whether, the observed increase in percentage phagocytosis reflects the maximum threshold that people in malaria endemic regions could achieve remains to be tested in future sporozoite vaccine trials. However, our study was not designed to evaluate the impact of increased opsonization activity on protective efficacy. In summary, these findings highlight the need for detailed investigation to identify and validate the best antibody functional assays that will predict and correlate with malaria or vaccine induced humoral immune responses in malaria pre-exposed volunteers. Our findings also show that malaria specific cellular responses, as measured by IFN-g secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells subsets, were more pronounced in malaria na\u00efve volunteers than in semi-immune volunteers, despite the two cohorts having similar baseline responses before CHMI (chapter 5; paper VI). We hypothesize that malaria na\u00efve volunteers mount immune responses that are more biased towards T cell mediated immune responses, which are likely to be directed toward the liver stage parasites (anti-infection), while malaria pre-exposed volunteers mount immune response that are more biased towards B cell immune responses directed towards blood stage (anti-disease). However, this hypothesis remains to be further investigated and validated in PfSPZ vaccine trials comparing malaria na\u00efve and pre-exposed volunteers. Page 183 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion We further showed that a single dose of PfSPZ challenge boosted MBC against MSP-1 and AMA-1 with the maximum peak observed one month after challenge, which returned to baseline after 6 months (chapter 5; paper VII). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that in malaria semi-immune volunteers the MBC responses following CHMI resulted from a secondary response but had short-lived plasma cell expansion as we observed peak responses around 2 weeks after asexual blood stage detection. The observed decline of MBC after CHMI could also be explained by antigen-specific plasma cells that migrate to the bone marrow, the predominant site of antibody production (Crotty et al., 2003; Slifka et al., 1995), resulting in fewer MBCs recirculating in the peripheral blood. We further showed that the quantity of antibodies and opsonising functions after PfSPZ challenge followed a similar trend to that observed for MBCs in each individual . We are lef t with an open question as to whether the slow development of natural acquired immunity observed in people living in malaria endemic areas is a result of immune dysregulation and how should this be overcome during malaria vaccine development. The question as to how the human innate-like lymphocyte compartment is involved in malaria infections is not well characterized. In the current study, we showed for the first time that CHMI affects innate-like lymphocytes - in particular the MAIT cell populations - in a PfSPZ challenge dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, while these innate-like responses are perceived to be short-lived, we found that changes in the MAIT cell population persisted even 6 months after the infection was cleared. It is yet to be investigated if these changes in innate-like lymphocyte composition are beneficial or detrimental for immune responses - particularly in populations that Page 184 of 222Chapter 6: General discussion live in malaria endemic regions. As the MAIT cells likely play essential roles in the timely initiation of adaptive immune responses during infection, the mechanisms that activate MAIT cells in the liver could be of interest as a potential therapeutic strategy against liver-stage malaria infection. The single-cell RNA-seq analysis data also suggests that CHMI leads to a clonally driven increase of innate-like lymphocytes that may be mediated by homeostatic expansion-like mechanisms through enhanced expression of IL-7 receptors. Together, our data demonstrates that CHMI studies using PfSPZ challenge can be safely performed in malaria endemic African countries where individuals with varying degree of pre-exposure reside. These studies will generate essential information required for future malaria vaccine design. Page 185 of 222Chapter 4: Conclusion 6\u00112\u0011 Conclusion Substantial investment in research and development is needed to develop an effective malaria vaccine. The information gained from the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine development approach highlights the possible ways to overcome malaria vaccine development obstacles. It is obvious that, although recombinant subunit vaccines do not yet give the desired levels of protection, these types of vaccine approaches can be easily manufactured and feasibly delivered in disease endemic setting. Manufacturing of live sporozoite vaccines for mass administration and the requirements for the storage remain to be clearly resolved. Studies conducted in the US, European and African individuals when testing the whole sporozoite approach have shown that malaria-na\u00efve individuals respond better than malaria- exposed individuals (Jongo et al., 2018; in press). The question remained, \" what e[actly constitutes the reason for lack of durable protection against malaria infection in endemic areas ?\" The most probable way of accelerating future vaccine development is a better understanding of the host-pathogen interaction and the nature of acquired immunity that will eventually be translated into better vaccine design. Conduct of CHMIs in malaria exposed volunteers has open ed new doors in the malaria vaccinology field. It is now likely that malaria vaccines and drugs could be easily tested for their efficacy in the target population. We have established the foundation for using CHMI to assess the efficacy of new interventions against malaria and to study the mechanisms of protection conferred by different malaria vaccines in endemic settings. Improvements such as direct venous inoculation (DVI) of irradiation attenuated sporozoites or live sporozoites under chloroquine prophylaxis will provide more information on the protective efficacy of the PfSPZ vaccines approach in endemic populations. Page 186 of 222Chapter 6 : Recommendations 6\u00113\u0011 Recommendations Several recommendations to improve the current vaccine approaches could be delineated from our work . These include the use of prime-boost strategies whereby a combination of different antigen delivery systems encoding the same epitopes or antigen, delivered at an interval of a few weeks apart is applied. Furthermore, efficient protection against malaria is likely the result of the combined effect of multiple, additive and low levels of a variety of immune responses targeting a broad range of antigens resulting in individual protective signatures. Therefore, an addition of more PE and/ or asexual blood stage antigens to the current RTS,S formulation that covers a wide range of parasites could be one option for improvement. This should also include antigens directed against sexual stages or ookinetes as they will add the essential transmission blocking component. An alternative strategy would be to start from scratch with the vaccine development efforts, by identifying novel critical antigens amongst the thousands of antigens expressed by the parasite and select those which are strongly provoking the immune system and provide solid protection. To circumvent the hurdles of generating successful recombinant subunit vaccines, whole parasites that are attenuated either by irradiation, drugs or genetic modifications could be the better option for achieving higher efficacy. However, much work has to be done in this model as we would need to identify the right dose and immunization schedule that will induce long-lasting immunity in malaria pre-exposed populations. To date, it is unclear which assay is the best for studying relevant immune functions in malaria immunity. Therefore, identifying and validating the best Page 187 of 222Chapter 6 : Recommendations functional assays for characterization of both cellular and humoral immune responses will help to identify relevant antigens. Analyses of the host and parasite transcriptome, proteome, expression cloning and new imaging technology could make our goal for developing a second generation malaria vaccine that protects more than 80% against clinical malaria possible. The achievement of RTS, S vaccine clinical development has been accelerated by collaboration from many international and local organizations working together to support a series of clinical trials in Africa. Strengthening this cooperation will further build or enable sharing of high technology laboratory capacities that are available today to Scientists from economically stronger countries. Human resources and expertise for designing better clinical trials in Sub-Saharan Africa is a must. By doing so, we will all together to support and thrive, in order to achieve detailed investigations on how malaria immunity works in natural ly exposed individuals and use this platform for designing a better and effective second generation malaria vaccine. Additionally, a longer-term follow-up is needed for full assessment of the vaccine risks and benefits. A thorough evaluation of the risk-benefit, feasibility and cost-effectiveness to determine the overall impact of RTS,S/AS01 in the community is highly needed , for the goal of implementation of RTS,S across the continent to be unequivocally recommended. Page 188 of 222Chapter 6 : Recommendations 6\u00114\u0011 Contribution of the current thesis This PhD thesis has made several contributions to the field of malaria vaccines trials. We have reported for the first time through this work that vaccine trials involving paediatric populations can feasibly be incorporated in to EPI programmes and conducted in large populations in the African setting. This information can be adapted for testing of other drug and vaccine products in similar settings. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that individuals living in different disease endemicity might respond different ly to the vaccine candidate. This work also showed that PfSPZ challenge response from the malaria na\u00efve population was more biased toward cellular immunity while malaria pre-exposed population respond ed toward humoral immunity. Such novel knowledge will contribute to the better design of a second generation malaria vaccine that will be more potent in the malaria endemic population . Through this PhD work we have also for the first time contributed to knowledge that CHMI could safely be conducted in pre-exposed malaria population with a similar infectivity outcome. This information led to a series of malaria vaccine clinical trials that involved CHMI in large number of African research institutes. Page 189 of 222References References Mordm\u00fcller, B., et al.

The first study ( published in Lancet infectious disease ) aimed to assess the performance of the novel T-cell activation marker-tuberculosis (TAM-TB) assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis in children with symptoms that suggest tuberculosis. The second study ( published in Clinical and vaccine immunology) aimed to analyze mRNA expression levels before and shortly after H1/IC31-Tuberculosis vaccination and correlate these with vaccine-specific central (TCM) and effector memory CD4 T cell (TEM) responses. The third study ( published in PLOs One ), aimed to investigat e the expression of Mip- 1 and the T cell maturation marker CD27 within CMVpp65 - specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in relation to age, HIV and active Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection in a cohort of Tanzanian volunteers. Despite that these studies are not directly linked to the topic of my thesis, my contribution in laboratory analysis of the samples and the review of manuscripts worth it recognitions.

We assessed the accuracy of a novel immunodiagnostic T-cell activation marker -tuberculosis (TAM-TB) assay in a proof- of-concept study to identify children with active tuberculosis. Methods Children with symptoms that suggested tuberculosis were prospectively recruited at the NIMR-Mbeya Medical Research Center in Mbeya, and the Ifakara Health Institute in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, between May 10, 2011, and Sept 4, 2012. Sputum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained for Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and performance assessment of the TAM- TB assay. The children were assigned to standardised clinical case classications based on microbiological and clinical ndings. Findings Among 2ft0 children screened, we selected a subgroup of 130 to ensure testing of at least 20 with culture- conrmed tuberculosis. 17 of 130 children were excluded because of inconclusive TAM -TB assay results. The TAM -TB assay enabled detection of 15 of 18 cases that were classied as not tuberculosis (n=63), with little eect from latent tuberculosis infection. The TAM- TB assay identied ve additional patients with highly probable or probable tuberculosis, in whom M tuberculosis was not isolated. The median time to diagnosis was 1ft\u00b75 days (IQR 14-45) for culture. Interpretation The sputum-independent TAM-TB assay is a rapid and accurate blood test that has the potential t o improve the diagnosis of active tuberculosis in children.

Recent estimates of the tuberculosis disease burden in children, based on the results of a systemati c literature review and mathematical modelling, suggest that about 1 million children developed tuberculosis worldwide in 2010, including 280 000 incident cases in the African region.1 Surveillance data for children remain imprecise because paediatric tuberculosis is often either underdiagnosed or overdiagnosed in high-burden countries.2-4 The lack of accurate and rapid diagnostic methods contributes to tuberculosis morbidity and mortality in children and hampers the assessment of new drugs and vaccines in paediatric populations. 4 Diagnosis of active tuberculosis in children poses a major challenge. Clinical symptoms of tuberculosis in children are often non- specic and resemble those of common paediatric illnesses, including pneumonia and malnutrition. Adequate respiratory specimens are dicult to obtain for bacterial conrmation, particularly in very young children who are unable to expectorate and in whom diagnostic yields are poor because of the paucibacillary nature of the disease.2,5 Hence, the diagnosis is routinely made on the basis of a combination of clinical features, contact history, chest radiography, and tuberculin skin test, and often with scoring charts that have poor diagnostic accuracy.6,7 The Xpert MTB/RIF assay enables timely, sensitive, and specic molecular detection of pulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults, 8 but its value in young children is greatly reduced. In a recent meta-analysis, the calculated pooled sensitivity was 66% for Xpert MTB/RIF against culture in expectorated or induced sputa, or gastric lavage specimens from children with suspected tuberculosis.9 WHO strongly recom- mends Xpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test in children suspected of having multidrug-resistant or HIV- associated tuberculosis, and only conditionally in all children suspected of having tuberculosis. 9 Immunodiagnostic tests, such as the tuberculin skin test and interferon- release assays\u2014ie, QuantiFERON- TB Gold and T-SPOT.TB \u2014do not depend on the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in collected samples.

Results of previous studies in adults showed that flow- cytometric analysis of the CD27 on circulating M tuberculosis -specic T cells can discriminate active tuberculosis from latent tuberculosis infection. 11-15 Loss of CD27 expression on M tuberculosis -specic CD4 T cells is a marker of active tuberculosis due to persistent antigenic stimulation16 and probably relates to increased cellular homing to the site of disease.17,18 In a proof- of- concept study, we assessed the performance of the new T-cell activation marker -tuberculosis (TAM-TB) assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis in children with symptoms that suggest tuberculosis. Methods Study population This prospecti ve diagnostic assessment was done at two Tanzanian research sites \u2014the NIMR-Mbeya Medical Research Center, Mbeya, and the Ifakara Health Institute, Bagamoyo. Children older than 6 months and younger than 16 years with signs or symptoms that suggested tuberculosis were enrolled from May 10, 2011, until Sept 4, 2012, and followed up for a minimum of 5 months. At least one of the following eligibility criteria had to be met: persistent, non-remitting cough for more than 14 days that did not respond to antibiotics; repeated episodes of fever within the past 14 days that did not respond to antibiotics, after malaria had been excluded; weight loss or failure to thrive during the previous 3 months; and signs and symptoms that suggested extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Children who received tuberculosis treatment in the past 12 months were excluded. The children were referred from peripheral health facilities and local hospitals. Because of cost restrictions, a subgroup of 130 children was selected from a larger cohort of 290 children to ensure testing of at least 20 children with culture- conrmed tuberculosis after prevalence estimation at the two sites. All other clinical information was masked from the investigators doing the sel ection with a list of patient identication numbers with corresponding disease classications. The Institutional Review Board of the Ifakara Health Institute, the Mbeya Medical Research and Ethics Committee, and the Medical Research Coordinating Committee of Tanzania approved the study protocol. We obtained written informed consent from a literate parent or legal guardian. In cases of illiteracy, informed oral consent was attested by an independent witness. Children older than 7 years provided assent for participation. Classication and reference standard Classication of children was based on the results of the clinical and microbiological assessment as culture- conrmed tuberculosis (culture-positive for M tuberculosis ), highly probable tuberculosis (chest radiograph consistent with tuberculosis conrmed by two independent reviewers, histology or cytology typical for tuberculosis, or fluorescent or acid-fast bacilli on microscopy), probable tuberculosis (clinically suspected tuberculosis without objective ndings as above), not tuberculosis (alternative diagnosis established and clinical resolution without antituberculosis treatment), or indeterminate (any other combination; appendix). Culture- conrmed tuberculosis was used as the reference standard for sensitivity analysis and not tuberculosis as the reference standard for specicity assessment. Clinical and laboratory procedures Clinical procedures at enrolment comprised medical history, physical examination, HIV testing, CD4 T-cell count, interferon- release assay (QuantiFERON -TB Australia), and chest radiography. Chest radiographs were classied a s strongly indicating, uncertain, or not tuberculosis by two independent experts from whom all clinical and diagnostic information was masked. Malnutrition was assessed on the basis of weight-for-age Z score in children aged up to 10 years (less than -2) and body- mass index in those older than 10 years (<2 SD below normal). If feasible, at least three induced or two expectorated respiratory specimens were obtained on consecutive days. Induced sputum was obtained in accordance with a standard protocol. 19 Fine-needle aspiration biopsies of enlarged lymph nodes were done when clinically indicated, as per standard protocol. 20 After N-acetyl L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide decontam- ination, each sputum marker -tuberculosis. *Frequency of interferon- -positive CD4 T cells in the negative control greater than the median frequency plus 3 SD of the tested sample.

Positive cultures were conrmed by use of microscopy, and subsequent MPT64 antigen or molecular tests (Genotype MTBC for resistance testing. Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was done in at least one sputum sample acco rding to the manufacturer's instructions. All tests, including TAM-TB assay, were done by trained laboratory technical sta masked to clinical information and radiological results. Results from established diagnostic procedures were made available to support clinical management in accordance with national and international guidelines. Results of the experimental TAM-TB assay were not released. TAM-TB assay Details of the underlying biological principle of the TAM- TB assay, denition of cuto values in an optimisation cohort of adults (n=87), and additional background information are provided in the appendix. Briefly, the TAM-TB assay is used to measure the CD27 phenotype of CD4 T cells producing interferon in response to M tuberculosis antigens according to a standard intracellular cytokine staining procedure.14 M tuberculosis -specic CD4 T-cell positive when at least ve CD4 T-cell interferon- - producing events were detected, and the proportion of interferon- producing CD4 T c ells after antigen stimulation was greater than 0\u00b705% and was at least twice the frequency of that in the negative controls. Well characterised samples from adults (appendix) were used to identify the CD27 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratio with optimum discriminatory power between latent tuberculosis infection and active tuberculosis. Cryopreserved peripheral blood mono- nuclear cells obtained at the baseline visit were stimulated for 12-16 h with a set of overlapping ESAT-6/ CFP -10 peptides21 (Elephants and Peptides, Potsdam, Germany) and protein derivative Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) before staining interferon- -positive to the CD27 MFI value for all CD4 T cells to dene CD27 MFI ratio for a sample (appendix). CD27 MFI ratio results were Page 198 of 222934 www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 14 October 2014 Articles consistent in 17 independent quality control assessments of two batches of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (appendix). Adult patients with tuberculosis had signicantly higher CD27 MFI ratios than did control patients after ESAT-6/ CFP-10 or puried protein derivative stimulation; area - under-operating-characteristic 0\u00b7931% 0\u00b7881%, respectively (appendix). We set CD27 MFI ratio thresholds at greater than 5 for ESAT-6/CFP- 10 and greater than 13 for puried protein derivative responses to achieve a balanced TAM-TB assay sensitivity of Once these cuto values were ascertained, samples from paediatric tuberculosis suspects Figure 2: Venn diagram of positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture, Xpert MTB/RIF, and TB-assay (validation cohort). TAM- TB assays were done at two independent laboratories according to identical standard operating procedures. Statistical analysis Calculation of medians, IQR, test accuracy measures (sensitivity and specicity), Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA post- test correction (Dunn's), and Mann and Fisher's exact tests were done with GraphPad Prism software (version 4.03). Role of the funding source The study was funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, which had no role in study design, data gathering, analysis, and inter- pretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data and nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. Results After assay optimisation in adults (optimisation cohort; appendix), the diagnostic performance of the TAM-TB assay was assessed in 130 children suspected to have tuberculosis (validation cohort); samples from 113 (87%) children were eligible for analysis. Figure 1 shows the study prole;22 17 (13%) children were excluded from the study because of inconclusive results. 18 (16%) of 113 eligible children had culture- conrmed tuberculosis, eight (7%) highly probable tuberculosis, 12 (11%) probable tuberculosis, 63 (56%) not tuberculosis, and 12 (11%) indeterminate cases (gure 1). A ne -needle aspiration biopsy of enlarged lymph nodes was done in ve children; the nal classications were culture conrmed tuberculosis (n=3), probable tuberculosis (n=1), and not tuberculosis (n=1). All culture- conrmed tuberculosis cases were positive on assessment of a respiratory specimen, including one with additional cytomorphology that suggested tuberculous lymph- adenitis. Nine (50%) of 18 children with culture- conrmed tuberculosis were sputum smear-positive. Six of eight patients with highly probable tuberculosis had chest radiographs that strongly suggested tuberculosis, one had chronic granulomatous lymphadenitis, and one was sputum smear-positive. Patients with probable tuberculosis had symptoms that suggested infection, which resolved completely on tuberculosis treatment, but radiographic signs and laboratory investigations were non-conclusive. Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical charac- teristics of the children. The median age of the 113 children included in the analysis was 6\u00b71 years (table 1). 33 of 113 children had HIV infection (table 1).

No drug resistance was detected in the culture-c onrmed cases. Respiratory specimens could be collected from each child; 103 (91%) of 113 children provided at least three induced or two expectorated sputum samples. Figure 2 shows the overlap between children with a positive M tuberculosis culture, Xpert MTB/RIF, or TAM- TB assay, and table 2 shows the TAM-TB assay results. 15 of 18 children with culture- conrmed tuberculosis h a d a positive TAM-TB assay result (sensitivity 83\u00b73%, 95% CI 58\u00b76 -96\u00b74; table 3). Of the 63 cases classied as not tuberculosis, 61 had a negative TAM- TB assay (specicity 96\u00b78%, 89\u00b70 -99\u00b76; table 3). Findings similar at the two independent sites Bagamoyo and Mbeya (table 3). The sensitivity of the TAM-TB was 69\u00b72% (48\u00b72 - 85\u00b76) when both culture- conrmed and h ighly probable tuberculosis cases were included in the reference standard. Table 4 summarises the clinical characteristics, tuberculin skin test and QuantiFERON-TB Gold results, diagnosis at enrolment, response to antibiotic treatment, and clinical follow-up of all children with discrepant TAM-TB assay and M tuberculosis culture results. Of the eight children who were TAM-TB assay positive but culture-negative (gure 2), three cases were classied as highly probable tuberculosis, two as probable tuberculosis, two as not tuberculosis, and one as indeterminate; six were HIV infected (table 4). Of the three children with highly probable tuberculosis, one was sputum smear-positive at enrolment, one was culture- conrmed during follow up, and one had cytological signs (chronic granulomatous lymphadenitis) that suggested tuberculosis. In the two probable tuberculosis cases, broad-spectrum antibiotics had no eect, but symptoms resolved on tuberculosis treatment (table 4). The TAM-TB assay was positive in two HIV- infected patients who were classied as not tuberculosis (table 4). Mycobacterium interjectum was identied in one case with an induration of 10 mm on the tuberculin skin test and an indeterminate QuantiFERON- TB Gold result. The other patient was QuantiFERON-TB Gold-positive. One HIV- infected child who was classied as indeterminate, had a complex clinical picture with various disease episodes that never fully resolved. Of the three children who were M tuberculosis culture-positive, but TAM-TB assay negative, two were malnourished (table 4). The third child had a nephrotic syndrome and died before culture results were available (table 4). Of the 63 children classied as not tuberculosis, 15 (24%) had a positive tuberculin skin test or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test at enrolment, suggesting probable latent tuberculosis infection. TAM-TB assay was positive in two (13%) of these 15 children. Xpert MTB/RIF enabled detection of 12 (67%) of 18 culture- conrmed tuberculosis cases, giving a sensitivi ty of 66\u00b77% (95% CI 41\u00b71 -85\u00b76) when two or more sputum samples obtained on consecutive days were analysed. The sensitivity was 55\u00b76% (31\u00b73 -77\u00b76) when only the sputum of Xpert MTB/RIF was were missing for one person). Xpert MTB/RIF was positive in two of three children with culture- conrmed tuberculosis who were TAM-TB assay negative (gure 2). The sensitivity achieved with the TAM-TB assay and Xpert MTB/RIF was 94\u00b74% (72\u00b76 -99\u00b71). The median time to detection by use of culture, dened as the period between enrolment and rst M tuberculosis conrmation, was 19\u00b75 days (IQR 14\u00b70 -45\u00b70), whereas TAM-TB assay results were obtained within 24 h after recovery of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Discussion The TAM- TB assay showed good sensitivity and excellent specicity with M tuberculosis culture as a reference standard. Specic detection of active tuberculosis in children was based on cuto values set from the optimisation study in adults. Retrospectively lowering CD27 ratio thresholds to 2 for ESAT-6/CFP- 10 and 7 for puried protein deriv ative stimulation, would further improve (95% CI 88\u00b70 -99\u00b74%) aecting specicity additional detection of highly probable (n=1), probable tuberculosis (n=1), and indeterminate (n=1) cases. Hence, cuto values specically optimised for children might further improve TAM-TB Contrary to molecular-based assays tests, the TAM- TB assay can be done on a readily available peripheral blood sample and is not limited by the paucibacillary nature of active tuberculosis in children. Consistent test performance at both study sites suggests the assay is robust and repeatable. Of greatest clinical relevance is that the TAM- TB assay provides an answer within a day of blood collection, which is important because early treatment initiation can be crucial in young children at high risk of disseminated tuberculosis disease. 2,24 Of the children with discrepant results, ve of eight children who were M tuberculosis culture-negative and TAM-TB assay positive had highly probable or probable tuberculosis. The clinical classication used might have included some overdiagnosis.4 International consensus denitions of intrathoracic tuberculosis were not available when the study was designed. 25 However, detailed case assessment suggested that these children probably did have active tuberculosis, suggesting that the TAM-TB assay is probably at least as sensitive as M tuberculosis culture. Despite access to state- of-the-art tuberculosis diagnostics, most children enrolled in our study were Page 201 of 222www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 14 October 2014 937 Articles treated for tuberculosis based on a combination of epidemiological and clinical ndings. This shows the poor diagnostic usefulness of M tuberculosis culture in clinical practice, related to dicult specimen collection, suboptimum sensitivity in children with paucibacillary disease, and long turnaround times. Suboptimum sensitivity undermines the suitability of the test as a reference standard and complicates optimal assessment of diagnostic accuracy. Consistent with previous paediatric studies, Xpert MTB/RIF enabled the detection of culture- conrmed paediatric cases from expectorated or induced sputa with a sensitivity of 66\u00b77% and a specicity of 100%.26-28 Compared with M tuberculosis culture, the combination of Xpert MTB/RIF and TAM- TB, two assays with a turnaround time of less than 24 h, had a sensitivity of 94%, missing one case. This child had severe nephrotic syndrome and culture- conrmation was only achieved after the child had passed away. The combination of TAM-TB assay and Xpert MTB/RIF enabled the detection of more tuberculosis cases than did culture when both culture- conrmed and highly probable tuberculosis cases were included in the reference standard. The TAM-TB assay was highly accurate in identifying children without tuberculosis, including 13 children with a positive interferon- release assay or the result of the tuberculin skin test. Hence, the assay has a high specicity for tuberculosis disease in children despite immunological evidence of previous M tuberculosis exposure, consistent with data from the adult optimisation cohort and a previous study in adults.15 Only two not tuberculosis cases were incorrectly assigned. Both children were infected with HIV, one had simultaneous infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria and both had latent tuberculosis infection. These false-positive TAM-TB results were caused by a predominance of mycobacteria- specic eector memory T-cell responses in peripheral blood. In view of a positive CFP-10/ESAT- 6 response in the child without non-tuberculous myco- bacteria infection, the positive TAM-TB assay result might suggest recent M tuberculosis infection that did not progress to active disease during the period of observation. In the other case, the non- tuberculous mycobacteria (M interjectum ) identied elicited the positive TAM- TB assay result. Implementation of additional, highly immunogenic M tuberculosis -specic antigens in the next generation TAM-TB assay could further improve specicity and sensitivity. The current version of the TAM-TB assay has several limitations, mainly related to cost and technical complexity. It needs advanced blood processing procedures, antigenic stimulations, flow cytometry equipment, a nd well trained sta. Renement and simplication are in progress to optimise diagnostic performance and make it compatible with cytometers that are in widespread use for measurement of CD4 T-cell counts in HIV/AIDS- aected countries. The TAM- TB assay did not generate valid test results in 13% of the samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but this might be attributed to reduced T-cell viability and decreased cytokine production after cryo- preservation. 29 Ideally, the TAM- TB assay should be done on fresh whole blood samples \u2014eg, in antigen-precoated tubes similar to the commercial QuantiFERON In-Tube system (Cellestis).30 Low CD4 T-cell counts due to severe HIV infection might remain a problem even when fresh blood samples are used. The small sample size of this proof- of-concept study resulted in very wide condence intervals and did not allow systematic assessment of test performance in very young, malnourished, or HIV- infected children who have recently been started on antiretroviral therapy. These factors might negatively aect the accuracy of the TAM-TB assay. 15,31 Additional studies need to be done to specically address test performance in these patient groups. The assessment of the TAM-TB assay in a study population enriched for culture- conrmed tuberculosis cases might have been a source of bias, particularly for the analysis including the under- represented classication groups. Although the TAM-TB assay cannot provide information about drug susceptibility, use of concomitant Xpert MTB/RIF testing can address this limitation. Panel: Research in context Systematic review We searched PubMed up to June 10, 2014, using the terms \"CD27\", \"diagnosis\", \"human\", and \"tuberculosis\". Of the 33 results returned, seven were clinical studies from ve independent laboratories and their results showed the potential of monitoring CD27 expression on Mycobacterium tuberculosis- specic CD4 T cells to diagnose active tuberculosis disease in adults. We did not nd a report of the assessment of the use of M tuberculosis -specic T -cell phenotype for the diagnosis of active childhood tuberculosis. Interpretation Our report is the rst to assess the accuracy of using CD27-expression analysis for the diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis. Immunological data were generated and analysed by investigators from whom clinical information was masked. The T-cell activation marker -tuberculosis assay showed excellent sensitivity (83\u00b73%) and specicity (96\u00b78%) when M tuberculosis culture positivity was used as a reference standard, and enabled the detection of additional cases in culture-negative children who were clinically suspected of having tuberculosis. Despite a fairly small sample size and potential bias originating from cohort enrichment in culture- conrmed tuberculosis cases, the results of this proof- of-concept study show that immunodiagnostic tests that incorporate phenotypic characteristics of M tuberculosis -specic T cells have the potential to improve rapid detection of active tuberculosis in children. Page 202 of 222938 www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 14 October 2014 Articles To our knowledge, this study is the rst to assess the diagnostic performance of the novel TAM-TB assay in children (panel). Importantly, it was done in a region with a high tuberculosis incidence and recruited children with symptoms that suggested tuberculos is who represent the real-life diagnostic challenge in t h e s e settings. Despite a need for further renement and testing in other regions with high burden of tuberculosis, our results suggest that the sputum-independent TAM- TB assay is a major advance for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis in children.

A TB vaccine should be safe and immunogenic as well as efficacious in all affected populations, including HIV- in- fected individuals. We investigated the induction and maintenance of vaccine-induced memory CD4+ T cells following tion with the subunit vaccine H1/IC31. H1/IC31 was inoculated twice on study days 0 and 56 among HIV-infected adults with CD4+ lymphocyte counts of >350 cells/mm3. Whole venous blood stimulation was conducted with the H1 pr ot e i n, a n d m e m or y CD4+ T cells were analyzed using intracellular cytokine staining and polychromatic flow cytometry. We identified high respond- ers, intermediate responders, and nonresponders based on detection of interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- a), and gamma interferon (IFN- \u00e7) expressing central (TCM) and effector memory CD4+ T cells (TEM) 182 days after the first im- munization. Amplicon-based transcript quantification using next-generation sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes that correlated with vaccine-induced immune responses. Genes implicated in resolution of inflam- mation discriminated the responders from the nonresponders 3 days after the first inoculation. The volunteers with higher ex- pression levels of g e ne s i nv ol v e d in antiviral innate immunity at baseline showed impaired H1-specific T CM and T EM mainte- nance 6 months after vaccination. Our study showed that in HIV-infected volunteers, expression levels of g e n e s i n v o l v e d in t h e antiviral innate immune response affected long-term maintenance of H1/IC31 vaccine-induced cellular immunity. (The clinical trial was registered in the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry [PACTR] with the identifier PACTR201105000289276.) accination represents one of the most successful health inter- ventions for disease containment, elimination, and eventual eradication ( 1). Despite more than 50 years of widespread vacci- nation with Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), world's most serious infec- tious diseases. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that there were 9 million new clinical TB cases and 1 million people died from TB (2). Infection with HIV impairs host resistance, leading to a faster and higher rate of progression from latent to clinical TB (3). Consequently, there is an urgent need for development of improved TB vaccines that are more efficacious, safer, and more immunogenic than BCG in all populations, in- cluding HIV-infected individuals. H1/IC31 is a protein subunit vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis , consisting of a fusion protein of the mycobacterial antigen 85B (Ag85B) and early secre- tory antigenic (ESAT-6) called hybrid 1 (H1) in combina- tion with the adjuvant IC31. IC31 is cationic polyamino acid KLK a single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide of H1 and ODN1a in antigen-presenting cells and provides a platform for hyperefficient Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9) ligand recognition of ODN1a. Upon triggering of TLR-9, conventional dendritic cells and monocytes activate the MyD88-NF -nB dependent signaling cascade ( 5). This leads to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and finally induction of adaptive immune responses. In to the MyD88- NF- nB-dependent pathway, plasmacytoid den- dritic cells (pDC) have the unique ability to signal in a MyD88- interferon regulatory factor (IRF7)-dependent way.

In HIV-infected individuals, vaccine take and durability of the immunity are negatively affected upon manifestation of pro- gressed HIV disease ( 8). The HIV is detected by the innate im- mune system, primarily by recognition of viral nucleic acids. En- dosomal TLR-7 and -8 and cytosolic RIG-1-like receptors sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which leads secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs ( 9). Use of a TLR-9 agonist as an adjuvant needs to be tested and analyzed carefully in HIV-infected individuals, since the downstream signaling cas- cades of TLR- 7, TLR- 8, and TLR-9 are shared ( 6, 7). We conducted a phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of H1/ IC31 in BCG-vaccinated, count of >350 cells/mm3 (10). The principal finding was that the vaccine was safe and immunogenic. CD4+ lymphocyte counts and viral loads remained stable during the entire study period. The aim of this study was to analyze mRNA expression levels before and shortly after H1/IC31 vaccination and correlate these with vaccine-specific central (T CM) and effector memory CD4+ T cell (T ) responses. A whole venous blood stimulation EM assay ( 10) was used to monitor the vaccine-induced cellular im- mune response over a follow-up period of 182 days. With use of AmpliSeq and next-generation sequencing the expression changes of 1,388 genes in peripheral blood were determined ( 11). We de- scribe for the first time that higher expression levels of genes in- volved in antiviral innate immunity at baseline reduce long-term maintenance of vaccine responses in HIV-infected volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics statemen t. This study was conducted according to good clinical practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Detailed descriptions of the ethical ap- provals can be obtained from Reither et al. ( 10). The clinical trial was registered in the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR) with the identifier PACTR201105000289276. Participant enrollment and blood collection. A total of 24 HIV- pos- itive, BCG-vaccinated volunteers with >350 cells/ mm3 from Bagamoyo, United Republic of Tanzania, were enrolled. Par- ticipants were randomly allocated in a ratio of 5:1 to receive placebo or H1/IC31 vaccine. One H1/IC31 vaccine recipient dropped out before the booster vaccination due to pregnancy. Injections of 0.5 ml containing 50 \u00b5g Ag85B-ESAT-6 and 500 nmol KLK plus 20 nmol ODN1a (adjuvant) or 0.4 ml Tris buffer (placebo) were administered intramuscularly on study days 0 and 56. For transcriptomics analysis, 2.5-ml samples of peripheral blood were collected via sterile venipuncture in RNA PaxGene Vacutainer tubes (PreAnalytiX) on days 0, 3, and 59. Samples of 9 ml of peripheral blood were collected in sodium heparin tubes and directly processed in whole-blood stimulation assays on days 0, 14, 56, 70, and 182. An ex- tended description of the study design can be obtained from Reither et al. (10). ICS and analysis by flow cytometry. The intercellular cytokine stain- ing (ICS) and flow cytometry analyses were described in Reither et al. (10). The present project focused on the analysis of cytokine-producing mem- ory CD4+ T cell subsets. For whole-blood stimulation and ICS, the pro- Aldrich). Subsequently, the whole-blood samples were transferred to a water bath at 37\u00b0C and incubated for an a dditional 5 h. Afterward, the water bath was switched off, and the water and contents were allowed to slowly reach room temperature. At 10 h after the water bath was switched off, the samples were harvested, EDTA (1.8 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and red blood cells lysed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) lysing solution (BD Biosciences). The remaining white blood cells were preserved in cryo solution containing 50% RPMI Aldrich). For from each phlebotomy date of one particular partic- ipant were thawed simultaneously in a water bath at 37\u00b0C.

The flow cytometry staining in the MyFlowCyt Reporting Stan- dard in the supplemental material). For each fluorochrome, a single- stained mouse n CompBead (BD Biosciences) control was included. The samples were acquired on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose CA) equipped with green (532 nm), red (640 nm), violet (405 nm), and blue lasers (488 nm) (see Table 3.1 in the MyFlowCyt Reporting Standard in the supplemental material). On average, 900,000 events per sample were recorded. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo soft- ware version 10.0.7 (Tree Star). The following gating strategy was used (Fig. 1 ): CD3-positive cells were gated by plotting CD3-BV421 versus side scatter area (SSC-A). The singlets were selected by plotting forward scatter area (FSC- A) versus forward scatter height (FSC-H), and the lymphocytes were gated with FSC-A versus SSC-A. Time versus IL-2-FITC was gated to exclude bubbles and various fluidics pressures. The IFN- -Alexa 700 ver- sus CD8-PerCp-Cy5.5 plot was used to gate the CD8-negative cells. The CD4-positive cells were selected by plotting IFN- -Alexa 700 versus CD4- QDot 605. The memory subsets were defined using the CD45RA-BV570 versus CCR7- PE plot. To identify cytokine-positive cells from all 4 mem- ory subsets, each cytokine was plotted against CD4-QDot 605. FlowJo version 10.0.7 was used for the analysis. This project focused on the de- tection of the cytokines IL-2, IFN- The production of IL-17 by CD4+ T cells was not significantly different after booster vaccination (10).

Total RNA was directly extracted from Pax- Gene blood RNA tubes using the PaxGene blood RNA kit (PreAnalytiX; Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's pro tocol. The concentration of total RNA and the RNA integrity number were determined by an Agilent RNA 6000 nano kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). RNA samples were stored at \u201480\u00b0C. AmpliSeq panels. We used two custom-made AmpliSeq primer pan- els to quantify gene expression. The Pathway Reporter Panel covered 917 genes, providing a general snapshot of the whole human transcriptome. tocol of Hanekom et al. was followed (12v).ivBoriefly, ex whole blood was The rationale and design of this panel are described elsewhere ( 35).

Amplicon-based transcript quantification by semiconductor se- quencing. The amplicon-based transcript quantification was performed using an ion proton semiconductor sequencer. This methodology was previously described by Zhang et al. ( 11) and strictly followed. Briefly, AmpliSeq libraries were prepared using 30 ng total RNA according to the protocol supplied with the ion AmpliSeq RNA library kit (catalog no. 4472335; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The amplified and pu- rified libraries were stored at \u201420\u00b0C. Library size distribution and con - centration were measured using an Agilent high-sensitivity DNA kit (Agi- lent Technologies) according to the manufacturer 's recommendation. Following library preparation, barcoded samples were pooled and pro- cessed together. The multiplexed library (total 8 pM) was linked to ion sphere particles and clonally amplified by emulsion PCR using the Ion PI template OT2 200 kit v3 with the Ion OneTouch 2 instrument according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). Sequencing was per- formed using the Ion PI sequencing 200 kit v3 and the Ion Proton chip I, following the manufacturer's instructions, on the Ion Proton sequ encer (Life Technologies). The generated reads were aligned to the Homo sapi- ens RNA canonical transcript reference hg19 and mapped to the genes of the corresponding AmpliSeq panel using the Torrent Mapping Alignment Program. Simultaneously, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the amplicons were identified during this process using the Ion Torrent Variant Caller. Statistical analysis. (i) Analysis of memory CD4+ T cells. A two- sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to test for the significance of the polyfunctional memory CD4 + T cell subset between study days. The participants' responses to the vaccine were calculated using the Mi- mosa package within R software ( 14, 15). After correction for the T cell response obtained from unstimulated controls, absolute counts of cyto- kine (IFN- and/or IL-2 and/or TNF- a)-expressing T CM or T EM and counts of T CM or T EM negative for cytokine expression were compared between day 0 and each follow- up (day 14, day 56, day 70, and day 182) (see Table 2 ). Final responders were defined based on a comparison of day 0 to day 182 and with a false discovery rate (FDR) of >0.0001 for a non- responder, an FDR of >1015 for an intermediate responder, and an FDR of <1015 for a high responder. (ii) AmpliSeq data analysis. AmpliSeq data were analyzed based on negative binomial distribution using the Bioconductor edgeR package (16). For each vaccine responder group, we performed differential expres- sion analysis through the time course, comparing the two postvaccination time points to the prevaccination time point. Furthermore, gene expres- sion was compared between the vaccine responder groups in order to identify values that differed from baseline. Standard settings were used, and only those genes with expression higher than 5 counts per million reads in at least 3 samples and an FDR of <0.1 were considered differen- tially expressed. Annotation of differentially expressed genes was per- formed using the previously published blood transcription modules (BTMs) ( 17). Statistical analysis was performed and plots were made us - ing R version 3.1.0 ( 15). RESULTS H1/IC31 phase II clinical trial design.

All volunteers were BCG vaccinated prior to the study and were antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive with CD4 counts of >350 cells/mm3 (Table 1 ). Generally, the H1/ IC31 vaccine was safe and well tolerated with no significant impact on the CD4+ lymphocyte count and HIV load after vaccination. Cytokine-producing memory CD4+ T cell subsets.

In Fig. 2B and C, TCM and T EM are displayed separately. In a comparison of day 0 to day 182, statistically significant increases of bifunctional T CM expressing IL-2 with TNF- a (P < 0.05) were observed. This was also observed in bifunctional T CM expressing IL-2 with IFN- , although at extremely low percentages. Trifunctional and bifunctional (IL- 2 and TNF- a) T EM were most significantly elevated in the comparison of da y 182 to day 0 (P < 0.01), followed by monofunctional (IL-2 or TNF- a) TEM (P < 0.05). Definition of vaccine responder groups. To investigate poten- tial innate immune mechanisms that yield differential vaccine im- munogenicity in our study participants, we divided the volunteers according to their cytokine responses (IFN- , IL-2, and/or TNF- a), comparing H1-specific T CM and T EM. An overview of potential responder groupings comparing each study day to the baseline at day 0 is given in Table 2 . In a compar- ison of day 70 to day 182, several volunteers shifted from respond- ers to nonresponders, indicating discriminative memory mainte- nance. No significant difference in relation to the viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts between these groups was observed (Table 3 ). Grouping the volunteers based on a comparison of day 0 to day 182 allowed us to identify the innate immune mechanisms that potentially lead to improved T CM and T EM maintenance. Gene expression data. On average, 4,686,802 reads (95% con- fidence interval [CI], \u00b1712,607 reads) per sample were generated and mapped to either the 826 genes of the AmpliSeq Immune Response Panel or the 917 genes of the Pathway Reporter Panel. A dynamic range of 5 orders of magnitude was observed, ranging from genes with no detectable expression like IFN- n to genes ex- pressing more than 160,000 reads like lysozyme and CD74. Both AmpliSeq panels shared 355 genes, whose transcript abundance measurements closely correlated ( R2 = 0.9829). The expression levels of nine endogenous control genes did not differ significantly between the 24 volunteers included here across all time points, supporting the robustness of the AmpliSeq-based targeted transcriptome measurement approach ( Fig. 3A). Vaccine-induced differential gene expression. Next we ad- dressed if early changes in the whole-blood gene expression levels of the targeted 1,388 genes might distinguish the three responder groups of each memory subset. The results are shown in Fig. 3B, and more detailed information is provided in Table S1 in the sup- plemental material. T CM and T EM intermediate and high respond- ers showed upregulated gene expression levels 3 days postvaccina- tion. For T CM responders, 5 genes, namely, COL1A1, ELN, CTGF, SERPINE1, and POSTN, were identified as upregulated. T EM re- sponders had an additional 5 genes, including COL3A1, COL1A2, FN1, ID1, and DCN, with increased expression levels. Most of the 10 differentially expressed genes are either anno- tated in BTMs involved in integrin CTGF, POSTN) of extracellular matrix remodeling (ELN or SERPINE1). ID1 is involved in leukocyte differentiation. HSPA1A is the only gene which was upregulated in a T EM nonresponder. This gene encodes a heat shock protein and is involved in the stress response. No differential gene expres- sion was observed in the placebo controls. Differential immune activation at baseline. Next we ad- dressed if gene expression levels at baseline before the first vacci- nation could distinguish the responder groups. Table 4 shows an overview of all genes that differed significantly at baseline between the vaccine responder groups based either on T CM or T EM. Com- pared to levels in nonresponders, higher gene expression levels were observed for ITGB4, CLEC1C, and CXCL6 for T CM high responders and for PRKDC, CD19, DNAJB5, MARCO, and IRS2 for T EM high responders. TGM2, OAS1 , and IFI27 showed the lowest expression levels among T CM high whereas ex- pressed at lower levels in T EM high responders. Tissue transglu- taminase (TGM) has a role in HIV pathogenesis and enhanced levels of its degradation product, H(-glutamyl)lysine, are found in the blood of patients with progressed HIV disease (19).

We are aware that this study was not de- signed (e.g., powered) to assess the association of polymorphic TABLE 4 Genes which are differentially expressed between the different vaccine responder groups for T CM and T EM Genes with expression levels:a genes with vaccine-induced immune responses. One single nucle- otide polymorphism (SNP) in TLR-8 (rs3764880) was previously reported to result in slower disease progression in HIV-infected individuals and reduced activation of the NF- nB pathway ( 21). The functional variant of TLR-8 A1G (rs3764880) that (1,038 amino acids [aa]) exhibits a shorter signal peptide. Seven volunteers expressed the TLR-8 A1G; of these, three volunteers harbored the homozygous TLR-8 A1G. Interestingly, none of the volunteers with the TLR- 8 A1G belonged to the T EM nonresponder group, and all three sub- jects expressing the homozygous TLR-8 A1G were T EM re- sponders. Importantly, subjects with the homozygous TLR-8 A1G have a reduced expression of antiviral gene signatures at baseline (Fig. 5A). Independent of the responder grouping, at day 182 vol- unteers with the homozygous TLR-8 A1G have on average percentages of trifunctional and bifunctional (IL-2 and TNF-a) TCM and T EM (Fig. 5B and C). DISCUSSION The study presented here provides the first insights into the pos- sible link between chronic immune activation in HIV infection and lack of maintenance of vaccine-induced T CM and T EM re- T cell type Higher than those in nonresponders Lower than those in nonrespondersb sponses.

Determinants of induction and long-term maintenance of memory CD4+ T cell responses generally in humans are only par- tially known (24).

In the current study, we observed an expansion of H1-specific TCM and T EM in all volunteers at study day 70, which is 2 weeks after the booster vaccination. However, when followed up until day 182, a retraction of H1-specific T CM and T EM was observed. Interestingly, this retraction differed greatly between volunteers, which allowed us to group them based on the comparison of H1/ IC31-induced T CM and T EM responses on day 182 in relation to those on day 0. Compared with microarray analyses, the AmpliSeq approach has a higher sensitivity and dynamic range, and its results compare precisely with RNA sequencing-derived whole-transcriptome data ( 11). Results obtained with both gene panels strongly sup- ported the idea that the AmpliSeq-based transcriptome monitor- ing approach is very robust and results in highly reproducible data sets suitable for high-throughput analysis of clinical samples. Here, to our knowledge, we have employed this targeted tran- scriptome monitoring tool in an experimental vaccine trial for the first time. Higher expression levels of genes involved in the extracellular matrix and integrin interactions and cell adhesion were observed in volunteers who maintained H1-specific T CM and T EM responses until day 182. Searching the literature, we found that cells involved in wound healing like alternatively activated macrophages ( 26), 6-T cells (27), ( 29) have all been de- scribed to express these particular genes. Muyanja et al. showed that the cellular and humoral immune responses to the highly efficacious live yellow fever vaccine YF- 17D in East African individuals were substantially lower than those of European volunteers treated identically ( 30). Prior to vaccination, the East African volunteers presented an increased activated immune microenvironment with higher frequencies of exhausted and activated natural killer cells, differentiated B and T cells, and proinflammatory monocytes ( 30). We therefore com- pared the gene expression profiles measured at baseline between our responder groups. Significantly higher expression levels of genes involved in innate antiviral immune responses like type I IFN signaling and viral sensing through cytosolic RIG-1-like re- ceptors were observed in the nonresponders. A close correlation between HIV loads and expression levels of this group of genes indicates that the chronic HIV infection is driving the higher ex- pression levels of these antiviral responses. In line with these re- Page 210 of 222July 2015 Volume 22 Number 7 cvi.asm.org 695 Antiviral Immune Activation and Vaccination Outcome A 15 9 6 IFI27 IFIT3 IFIT1 CXCL10 IL8 IRF7 DDX58 and thus supports our findings ( 33). The HIV was found to specifically infect activated memory CD4+ T cells with potential consequences for the maintenance of vaccine-spe- cific memory responses ( 34). In conclusion, higher activation of the components of the innate immunity due to HIV stimulation at baseline results in impaired H1-specific T CM and T EM mainte- nance. In addition to access to the expression level, the AmpliSeq ap- proach also provides access to the nucleotide sequence of the re- spective amplified gene fragment. This enabled us to identify vol- unteers carrying the previously known TLR-8 A1G single nucleotide sequence variant. Volunteers expressing this TLR- 8 A1G gene on both chromosomes had lower gene expression levels of the innate antiviral immune response genes. This was linked to longer maintenance of vaccine-specific T EM responses until day 182 compared to that for the wild-type TLR-8 carriers. 0.125 0.100 0.075 chronic innate antiviral im- mune activation by HIV and sustained H1/IC31-induced vaccine- specific cellular immune responses has high relevance for future vaccine development and monitoring programs. Patients receiv- ing ART potentially present with lower activation of innate anti- viral immunity, and thus the effect of treating patients with ART prior to vaccination has to be evaluated. The presence of the TLR-8 A1G variant in HIV-infected individuals might provide an immune genetic background, supporting a more desired vaccina- tion outcome. This observation warrants future studies using larger numbers of HIV-infected and -noninfected volunteers un- dergoing experimental or routine vaccination.

We studied here the expression of Mip-1 and the T cell maturation marker CD27 within CMVpp65-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in relation to age, HIV and active Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection in a cohort of Tanzanian vol- unteers ( \u00c716 years of age, n = 108 and \u00c718 years, n = 79). Independent of HIV co-infection, IFN+ CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cell frequencies increased with age. In adults, HIV co- in- fection further increased the frequencies of these cells. A high capacity for Mip- 1 produc- tion together with a CD27low phenotype was characteristic for these cells in children and adults. Interestingly, in addition to HIV co-infection active TB disease was linked to further down regulation of CD27 and increased capacity of Mip- 1 production in CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cells. These phenotypic and functional changes of CMVpp65-specific CD4 T cells observed during HIV infection and active TB could be associated with increased CMV reactivation rates. Introduction Primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection occurs often at birth or during adolescence with prolonged viral shedding into the urine and saliva that can persist for years. In adults, primary CMV infection is typically controlled within 6 months [ 1]. Thereafter, CMV persists lifelong in Page 213 of 2227.1.3PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0126716 May 14, 2015 2 / 10 Geldmacher`s salary is funded by the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF).

Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Impact of Age, HIV and MTB Infections on CMV-Specific T Cell Responses a state of clinical latency [ 2,3]. The CMV-specific adaptive immune response efficiently sup- presses overt viral replicati on and prevents viral shedding for decades. Aging is notably associ- ated with accumulation of high frequencies of oligoclonal CMV-specific CD8+ T cells [ 4]. In late-stage AIDS patients (CD4 counts <50/ l), CMV infection can ized end-organ disease [ 5]. CMV-specific CD4+ T cell responses appear to be crucial for CMV control in murine models and in humans [ 6],[4]. In adults, these CMV-specific CD4+ T cells are characterized by: (i) highly differentiated CD27-/CCR7- effector memory phenotype; (ii) propensity to secrete the CCR5 ligand Mip-1 and (iii) high cytolytic activity against CMV in- fected cells and these characteristics differ from Vaccinia virus-specific CD4+ T cells [7]. CMV-specific CD4+ T cells are relatively resistant to HIV infection and HIV mediated de- pletion [ 8], [9], [10], and this has been linked to their propensity to secrete Mip-1 . Mip-1 has also been connected to the expression of the immune senescence marker CD57 [ 11]. However, the underlying immunological mechanisms that \"imprint \" this particular phenotype and high capacity for Mip-1 production are unclear. Recent or on-going antigen exposure causes differ- entiation of pathogen-specific CD4+ T into CD27- effector phenotype and can in- flict functional changes [ 7,10,12-14]. One factor contributing to an increased capacity to produce Mip-1 could be recurrent or transient, subclinical reactivation of CMV throughout life. To address this hypothesis, we studied cell frequencies, Mip-1 production and CD27 ex- pression of CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in children, adolescence and adults in rela- tion to age, HIV and active tuberculosis infection in individuals from Tanzania, where CMV infection prevalence reaches up to 100% in adults [ 15]. Results and Discussion Detection of CMV-specific T cell responses using polychromatic flow cytometry after in vitro stimulation is a reliable marker for determining the CMV infection status in children [ 16]. CMVpp65-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were characterized in a Tanzanian cohort (n = 187) encompassing children ( <10 years of age, n = 79), adolescents (10 -16 years of age, n = 29) and adults ( >18 years of age, n = 79). This Tanzanian cohort is described in greater de- tail [17]. The gating strategy and representative flow cytometry plots are shown in Fig 1 . Study subjects were stratified according to age and their HIV and TB co-infection status. In the ab- sence of a reliable test for definite childhood TB classification, HIV- paediatric TB suspects in- cluded culture-confirmed TB (n = uncertain TB classification (n = 16). HIV+ paediatric TB suspects (n = 31) included culture confirmed TB (n = 4), and 13 subjects with uncertain TB classification (n = 13). In 46 HIV- and 13 HIV+ children an alternative diagnosis could be established after 5 months of clinical follow- up excluding active TB [17]. As expected, the prevalence of CMVpp65-specific T cell responses increased with age ( Fig 2A). In the HIV- group, CMVpp65-specific T cell responses were detectable in 48.5% (16 of 33) of children <5 years of age, in 77.3% (17 of 22, Fig 2B) of children between 5 and 10 years, in 81% (17 of 21) of adolescents (10 -16 years) and 96% (48 of 50) of adults ( Fig 2A , P<0.0001). In the HIV+/AIDS group, CMVpp65-specific T cell responses were detectable in 70% (7 of 10) of children <5 years of age, in 92.8% (13 of 14) of children (5-10 years), in 87.5% (7 of 8) of adolescents (10 -16 years) and 89.7% (26 of 29) of adults. Interestingly, in children <10 years of age, HIV infection was associated with an increased prevalence of CMVpp65-spe- cific T cell responses (p = 0.067). These data suggest that within the studied Tanzanian popula- tion, CMV infections are mostly acquired within the first 10 years of life with HIV infection being a potential risk factor for early acquisition of CMV infection. When compared to West- African populations, CMV infection seems to be acquired at an older age where by the age of Page 214 of 222PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0126716 May 14, 2015 3 / 10 Impact of Age, HIV and MTB Infections on CMV-Specific T Cell Responses Fig 1.

The number of subjects in each group is indicated within brackets. CMVpp65-specific T cell responses were considered positive if the frequency of IFN+ T cells was 2-fold above the negative control and at least 0.05% of the parent population. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test for trend (A) and chi-square test (B). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0126716.g002 12 months close to 100% of children showed serological evidence of CMV infection or had re- leased CMV DNA in urine [ 18,19]. CD4 T cell responses targeting purified protein derivatives (PPD) followed a similar trend (data not shown), indicating that detection of Mycobacteria-specific T cells in adolescents and adults are not a consequence of BCG vaccination during early infancy (BCG vaccination cover- age for patients <18 years was 97.7% (43 of 44, unknown status n = 1). These findings are con- sistent with the disappearance of circulating Mycobacteria-specific CD4 T cell responses upon BCG vaccination within one year following vaccination [ 20]. Next, we compared the contribution of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells to the CMV-specific T cell re- sponses in children ( <10 years) and adults ( >18 years). A high of children (36.4% for HIV- and 45% for HIV+) mounted CMV responses exclusively within the CD8+ T cell subset irrespective of their HIV status. In HIV+ individuals, the difference between children and adults reached statistical significance with more individuals having both CD4+ and CD8+ CMV-specific T cell responses in the adult HIV+ group ( Fig 2B , P = 0.037). Adults showed increased frequencies of CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cells compared to chil- dren <10 years regardless of their HIV infection status ( Fig 3A, HIV-: median 0.15% vs. 0.06%, P HIV+: median 0.26 vs. 0.07%, P = 0.002). A higher frequency of CMVpp65-specific CD8+ T cell responses in adults was also observed, particularly within the context of HIV Page 216 of 222PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0126716 May 14, 2015 5 / 10 Impact of Age, HIV and MTB Infections on CMV-Specific T Cell Responses Fig 3.

Absolute counts of CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cells no longer increased with age and were significantly affected by HIV co-infection in children and adults ( Fig 3B, P = 0.045 and P = 0.0276 respectively). In line with previous reports showing age related differences in the proportion of IFN+ T cells in response to SEB stimulation [ 22-24], we also observed significantly reduced frequencies and absolute counts of IFN +-CD4+ T cell responses after SEB stimulation in children ( Fig 4 ). This could reflect the higher proportion of na\u00efve T cells in children, that cannot express IFN [25] and might also be linked to IFN promoter hyper methylation of na\u00efve T cells in infants [ 26]. Importantly, the proportion of responders with CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cells was similar between HIV+ (12 of 19, 63.1%) and HIV- (11 of 20, 55%) children (P = 0.53). This demon- strates that CMV-specific CD4+ T cells persisted in children <10 years of age during concur- rent HIV infection as described previously for adults [ 10,27], even though absolute numbers of CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cells were reduced in HIV+ adults and children ( Fig 3B ). Relative resistance of CMV-specific CD4+ T cells to HIV-induced depletion has been linked to their high capacity for Mip-1 secretion [ 7] together with their mature phenotype, characterized by a high proportion of cells expressing the senescence marker CD57 [ 28].

We thus wanted to determine whether the capacity for Mip-1 production is associated with aging in our cohort. There was no linear relationship between age and capacity for Mip-1 production in IFN + CMV-specific CD4+ T cells in HIV- subjects (data not shown). Both HIV- adults and children had IFN+ CMV-specific CD4+ T cells characterized by a CD27low phenotype (P = 0.332) and a similar capacity to co-express Mip-1 (median 32.4% v 50%, P = 0.372, Fig 5 and Fig 1C and 1D for gating strategy details). A previous study reported a predominance of undifferentiated CD27+ CMV-specific CD4 T cells in 29] and an unusual immature CD27 phenotype predominance in adults contrasting with several other reports [ 10],[ 30],[31]. Differences in study population or methodology could account for this discrepancy. Interest- ingly, down regulation of CD27 and increased frequencies of Mip-1 co-producing CD4+ T cells occurred in adults with active TB (P = 0.036 and 0.0596) and particularly in those co-in- fected with HIV (P = 0.008 and 0.002). This result demonstrates to our knowledge for the first time that active TB infection alone is associated with phenotypic and functional changes in CMV-specific CD4+ T cell response in adults. A significant impact of HIV and active Fig 6. CD27 and Mip-1 expression of CMV specific IFN producing CD8 T cell responses are not significantly influenced by HIV as well as tuberculosis co-infection in adults.

Based on these results, we hypothesis that that the CMV virus might reactivate during active TB, particularly so in HIV+ subjects - driving further antigen-driven CMV-specific cel- lular maturation and increased Mip-1 production [ 9,10]. This is supported by the known he- matopoietic niche for latent CMV viruses which reactivate upon differentiation of myeloid precursor into tissue macrophages [ 32]. Cellular recruitment including monocyte-derived macrophages is essential for the granuloma formation that typifies tuberculosis pathogenesis [33]. Similar changes were not detected in HIV+ children. However, the number of children in- cluded in the analyses and the fact that all enrolled children were TB suspects limits the validity of this finding. Conclusion We show that CMVpp65-specific T cell responses are detectable in the peripheral blood of most Tanzanian children indicating that acquisition of CMV infection typically occurs during infancy and early childhood with HIV being a risk factor. In comparison to adults, there was an increased proportion of CD8+ T cells participating in the response and this was particularly apparent in HIV+ children. In children, CMVpp65-specific CD4+ T cells had a mature CD27low effector memory phenotype and a high capacity for Mip-1 production similar to those detected in adults, and there was no apparent effect of HIV co-infection. Despite some limitations of the current study, such as the hospital based inclusion of children, our results suggest that the high capacity for Mip-1 production of CMV-specific CD4+ T cells is indepen- dent of age. Importantly, we observed for the first time that active TB impacts on the CMV- specific CD4+ T cell phenotype. This may reflect recent CMV reactivation and would indicate a previously unknown interplay between CMV virus infection and active tuberculosis pathogenesis. Materials and Methods Ethics Statement The study was conducted at two Tanzanian research sites \u2014the NIMR-Mbeya Medical Re- search Center, Mbeya, and the Ifakara Health Institute, Bagamoyo. The Institutional Review Board of the Ifakara Health Institute, the Mbeya Medical Research and Ethics Committee, and the Medical Research Coordinating Committee of Tanzania approved the study protocols. We obtained written informed consents from adults or for children from a literate parent or legal guardian who participated in the TB child study [ 17] or the Worm HIV Interaction study (adults only) [ 34]. Study subjects and blood sampling Children older than 7 years provided assent for participation. Children and adolescents (\u00c7 16 years old) were enrolled in the context of clinical consultation for illnesses that resemble active tuberculosis. HIV-/TB- healthy controls and MTB culture-confirmed TB cases were enrolled into the adult group (\u00c7 18 years old). Blood was collected into Vacuette CPDA tubes and 219 of 222PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0126716 May 14, 2015 8 / 10 Impact of Age, HIV and MTB Infections on CMV-Specific T Cell Responses CD4-PerCP Cy5.5 cytokine staining PBMC containing benzonase (Novagen, 25KU, 1/5000 V/V).
