Prior to 1906, there had existed in Bowling Gr een the Southern Normal Sc hool and Bowling Green Busi- ness University, whose president was Dr. Henry Hardin Cher ry. In 1907, the Southern Normal School was transferred to the state, and Dr. Cherry was selected as the first pres ident of Western Kentucky State Normal School. In 1922, the Kentucky Legislature changed the school's name to Western Kentucky State No rmal School and Teachers College and empowered the College to award degrees to its graduates. In 1930, the school's name was changed to Western Kentucky State Teachers' College, and in 1948 to Western Kentucky State Colleg e. The Kentucky General Assembly in 1966 designated Western as a University and ch anged the name to Wester n Kentucky University. Western began offering the Master of Arts degr ee in 1931. This program was discontinued in 1936 but was resumed in 1941. The granting of university status in 1966 ga ve the Graduate School (renamed the Graduate College in 1969) increased opportunity both to strengthen existing programs and to offer an even wider choice of programs. In 1992 the Graduate College was renamed Graduate Studies. The school's first president, Henry Hardin Cherry, e xpressed a theme for Western's e ducational commitm ent that is a constant inspiration to faculty, students and alumni: \"The Spirit Makes the Master.\" As a university, Western has produced educati onal opportunities to more than 110,000 alumni who proudly call WKU \"the home of the Hilltoppers.\" W KU's campus crowns a hill overlooking the city of Bowling Green and is proclaimed as one of the most beautiful in the nation.

Graduation Fee Candidates for graduate degree s must complete the Application for Gr aduation available through TopNet under Student Services and pay the appropriate fee. This fee will cover the cost of cap, gown and hood, diploma and other necessary expenses. The Application for Graduation should be submitted according to the dates established by the Registrar for each semest er. Applications not received by the Registrar's Office by the due date will result in the omission of the student's name from the graduate ceremony bulletin. Degrees are conferred for fall graduates in December, for spring gradua tes in May, and for summer graduates in August. Any degree requirements completed in the May/June /July summer sessions will result in the student receiving the degree in August. Any degree requirements completed dur ing the Winter term will result in the student receiving the degree in May. Commencement ceremonies are held in May and Decembe r. August graduates may participate in either the preceding May or following December commencement ceremony. Transcript Fees Official WKU transcripts may be ordered by any of the following methods: mail, TopNet, fax, or in person. Contact the Office of the Registrar at (270) 745-5448 or visit the following website fo r additional information: http://www.wku.edu/Dept/Support/AcadA ffairs/Registrar/transcript.htm . Parking Fees Students who register a vehicle should refer to WKU Student Handbook for vehicle regulations and assessments. Parking rules and regulations are dist ributed at the time of parking perm it purchase. Contact the Parking and Transportation at (270) 745- 2361 or visit the following website for additional information: http://transportation.wku.edu/ . Fee Payment All registration fees, housing fees, course or laboratory fees, m eal charges, student health service charges, and other assessments, fees and charges are due and payable in accordance with the statements rendered by the appropriate University office. Registration and housing fees must be paid on the date a student registers or on other dates as specified by the Office of the Bursar. Students who do not make payment of required fees are not registered students. The University offers a deferred payment plan, which is available for the fall and spring semesters. Fifty percent of the amount due for tuition, fees, housing and meal plans, plus a contract service fee, must be paid by the due date indicated on the bill. The student must sign a Deferred Payment Contract in the Bursar's Office or obtain the form from the WKU Tuition and Fees website. The rema ining tuition and fees will be billed with the due date of October 15 for the fall semester or March 15 for the sp ring semester. A late fee of $100 will be charged for failure to pay the balance by the due date. Students who fail to pay the balance will be obligated and not al lowed to register for another semester or receive a transcript. A payment plan is not offered for the summer term. The University expects the students to be financially responsib le and not be delinquent in financial obligations to the University or to any department or division of the Univers ity. A student who fails to meet a financial obligation within ten (10) days after the date of notice from the appropriate university official will be subj ect to regulations promulgated by the University. If the student does not settle the obligat ion by the date designated on the notice, the appropriate business office shall notify the Registrar. After the Regi strar has been notified that a student is delinquent, the 12Registrar shall not allow the student to register or obtain an official transcript until the Re gistrar has been notified that the obligation has been settled. The University expects all students to register fo r classes and pay tuition prior to the first day of class. Class schedules will be cancelled fo r students who fail to pay or make arrangement s to pay by the due date on the statement rendered by the University. A late payment charge of $100 may be assessed. Failure to re ceive a bill does not relieve the student of the obligation to pay tuition and fees by the due date. In the event that any tuition, fees and/or expenses ar e not paid when due, and the University undertakes collection of any unpaid portion, the st udent shall also be assessed and be responsible for any collection costs incurred by the University. Tuition and Fee Refund Policy Tuition refunds or reductions in outstanding fee liabilities for students who of ficially withdraw through the Registrar's Office or TopNet , or who change their status from full-time to part-time or further reduce their part-time status through drop/add, will be made according to the schedules below. Th e refund percentage is applied to the number of credit hours dropped, not the dollar amount of the tuition and fees assessed. To calculate a refund: Multiply the refund percentage by the number of hours dropped. This number is subtracted from the student's current liable hours. For more information visit http://www.wku.edu/bur sar/refund.html . RESIDENCY The determination of residency for admission and tuitio n assessment is governed by st ate regulation 13 KAR 2:045. The regulation can be reviewed on the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education website at www.cpe.state.ky.us/pol icies/policies_st udent_residency.asp . Enrolled students may contact Graduate Studies & Research for additional information. ADMISSION Application and Fee Students seeking a graduate degree must apply for admission by completing the online graduate application available on the Gradua te Studies website at http://www.wku.edu/graduate/ . All students seeking admission into a graduate degree program should submit the Graduate Studies application by the following dates: Fall Semester: June 15 Spring Semester: November 15 (Some programs have earlier date s for application submission.) Application and all s upporting materials (e.g., transcri pts, GRE/GMAT, teaching certificat e) need to be received in Graduate Studies by the above dates to en sure adequate time for departmental re view. To be eligible for any type of financial aid or a graduate a ssistantship, students must be admitted in good standing to a degree program. Non-degree seeking students are ineligible for fina ncial aid and graduate assistantships. Transcript Record Graduates of accredited institutions other than Western Kentucky University must request that one official transcript showing the completed undergraduate degree be sent to Western Kentucky University . The transcript must be forwarded from the college or university registrar directly to the Office of Graduate Studies and Research at 1906 College Heights Blvd., #11010, Bowling Green, KY 42101. Appl icants who have not co mpleted the undergraduate degree are required to submit one offici al transcript at the time of appli cation and one offici al transcript upon completion of the degree. Transcript records should be submitted for any gradua te and undergraduate courses taken at any institution other than WKU. Transcripts sent to Graduate Studies become the property of the University and will not be returned to the student under any circumstances nor will a copy of the transcri pt be given to the student. Standardized Examination Scores Most degree-seeking students must submit appropriate stan dardized test scores rega rdless of their undergraduate grade point average. Most degree programs require the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test. The Master of Business Administ ration requires the Graduate Management Ad mission Test (GMAT), and the Master of Arts in Leadership Dynamics, accepts either the GRE or GMAT. As of October 1, 2002, the GRE General Te st is comprised of the verbal and qua ntitative sections and an analytical writing assessment. For programs that require standardized test scores, the scores must be received by the Office of Graduate Studies and Research prior to admission. The ad mission decision will be based upon both the undergraduate transcript grade point average and the GRE or GMAT score in its entirety. Registration materials for the GRE and GMAT are availabl e at the Counseling and Test ing Center, the Office of Graduate Studies and Research, http://www.gre.org , or http://www.gmat.org , or by calling 1 (800) 473-2255. 13A student who has earned a master's degree from an accredited institution in a field related to the desired area of study may use this in place of the GRE General Test. Each department has the discretion to approve this exception to the GRE requirement. GAP Score Except where otherwise noted in the program descriptions, admission decisi ons are based upon both the undergraduate grade point average and the GRE General Test score. The GAP score is the sum of the GRE Verbal & Quantitative scores times the overall unde rgraduate grade point average. For ex ample, a GRE score of 800 (Verbal + Quantitative) and a grade average of 3.5/4.0 would produc e a GAP score of 2800. Because GAP is a product of both the GRE score and undergraduate grade point average, both th e GRE and transcript record are essential for making an admission decision. The GRE General Te st also includes a writing component ; some programs have established a minimum Analytical Writing score re quirement. Most programs require a GAP score of 2200 (individual degree programs may be higher). Previous graduate course work does not have any bearing on admission requirements, i.e., GAP score calculation. Students who took the GRE General Te st prior to October 1, 2002, must have a GAP score of 3500 or better. This GRE General Test cons isted of verbal, quantitative, and anal ytical sections, and in this case the GAP score is generated by the sum of the three parts of th e GRE times the overall undergraduate grade point average. GMAT Score Admission decisions for the Master of Business Administration are based upon the scores of the Graduate Management Admission Test. The requirements for general admission to the MBA program are a 500 total GMAT test score and an undergraduate GPA of 2.75. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Individual programs may have more stringe nt requirements than the Office of Graduate Studies, but all students must meet the minimum Graduate St udies requirements to be considered for admission. Master's Degrees Applicants for a mast er's degree program must have: A. Submit the completed application, along with the curr ent non-refundable application fee by the admission deadline; B. Provide an official transcript to document receipt of a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university (Applicants from non- accredited institutions see Applicants from Non-Re gionally Accredited Institutions ); C. Have adequate preparation in the field of specialization; D. If they hold teacher certification or have a statement of eligibility for certification, submit a copy of the current teaching certificate or statement of eligibility; and E. Document qualifying standardized test scores and/ or undergraduate GPAs as required in the programs to which they are applying. Specialist Degrees Applicants for a specialist degree program must: A. Submit the completed application, along with the current non-refundable applica tion fee by the admission deadline; B. Hold a master's degree from an accredited colleg e or university (Ed.S. in School Psychology does not require applicants to hold a master's degree); C. Have adequate preparation in th e proposed field of specialization; D. Submit a copy of a current teaching certificate (this requirement applies to applicants to the Ed.S. in Elementary Education, Secondary E ducation or School Administration); E. Document qualifying GRE scores - no less than 850 on the GRE General Test Verbal and Quantitative sections and a Writing Score of 4.0 or have a grade point average of not less than 3.5 on the course work for the master's degree program; the specialist degree in School Ad ministration require s a 3.5 GPA and 850 GRE score) and F. Submit three letters of recommendation from gr aduate faculty and pr ofessional associates. Doctoral Degree Applicants for the EdD must: A. Hold a master's degree in a related field; B. Submit the following: completed appl ication and non-refundabl e application fee, a cademic transcripts, GRE/GMAT scores, personal statemen t of goals and rational for gradua te study; current resume/vitae, completed leadership self-study survey, and three letters of recommendation. 14Graduate Certificate Programs Students may apply to a graduate certificate program ; however, admission or completi on of a graduate certificate does not guarantee admission to a graduate degree program. Admission to pursue a graduate certificate is based upon a bachelor's degree and adequate preparation in the area of study. A maximum of 12 hours of graduate certificate course work, if appropriate, may subsequently be a pplied toward graduate degree requirements. Applicants from Non-Regional ly Accredited Institutions Graduates of non-regionally accredited, four-year e ducational institutions may be considered for admission to a master's degree program with adequate preparation in the field of specializa tion and a minimum of 40 hours of general education course work, including the following: 1. At least 6 semester hours (or the equivalent) in each of the areas of communication, humanities, and natural science. 2. At least 12 semester hours (or the equivalent) in social and behavioral studies, including history. 3. At least 2 semester hours (or the eq uivalent) in mathematics or logic. Transient Students Students working toward a degree at other institutions must complete an Application for Admission and pay the required application fee, but are not required to submit transcripts. Instead of official transcripts, they must submit a letter from the graduate dean of the degree-granting institutio n verifying good standing status to the Office of Graduate Studies at WKU prior to enrollment. Non-Degree Seeking Students Students not seeking a graduate degree must submit an Application for Admission along with the current application fee and, if not a WKU gradua te, submit all transcripts from colleges attende d to the Graduate St udies Office. Should the non-degree seeking student later apply for and be gran ted admission into a degree program, no more than 12 hours taken while in the non-degree category may be used to fulf ill degree requirements. Non-de gree seeking students are not eligible for financial aid or graduate assistantships. International Students Applicants who are not U.S. citizens must submit the following materials for admission: 1. Properly completed Interna tional Application for Admission and current application fee, 2. An official transcript indicating completion of a baccalaureate degree (or the equivalent); 3. GRE General Test Score if required by program or GMAT score (if seeking admission to the MBA program); 4. Evidence of ability to communicate in English; (A minimum of 550 on the paper based TOEFL, a minimum of 213 on the computer based TOEFL, a minimum of 79 on the iBT TOEFL, or a minimum of 6.0 on the IELTS); and 5. Evidence of adequate financial resources. After the international student has submitted these application materials, evaluation is made within the department offering the degree program. Official transcripts sent to WKU will not be returned to the student for any reason. Students wishing to keep an official transcript should request two copies from the undergraduate institution. International students must participate in orientation the we ek prior to the beginning of the semester of admission. Students found to be deficient in English skills must take re medial course work. Health insurance must be purchased upon arrival at the University. For additional information, contact the Offi ce of International Student and Scholar Services at (270) 745-4857. Senior Citizens A senior citizen (65 years or older) who holds a bachel or's degree may be admitted to Graduate Studies as a Special Student. Upon completion of 12 hours of cour se work in a degree program with a minimum grade point average of 3.0, the student may be admitted to that degree program. Alternate Admission for Master's Degree Applicants who do not meet admission requirements may pursue alternate admission. In that process, the admission decision may be based upon considerati on of accomplishments and qualifications as evidenced by a professional portfolio consisting of the record of vocational attainment and recognition; a statement of goals indicating commitment to pursue graduate education; letters of support from instru ctors, co-workers, or work supervisors; scholarly papers and/or projects; and any other supportive materials. This add itional information is consider ed by an academic college alternate admission committee and may result in one of three recommendations: full admission to Graduate Studies; conditional admission (full admission to be based upon performan ce in specified undergraduate /graduate course work); or denial of admission. Some departme nts may have more specific guidelines on alternate admission materials. 15 Appeal requests for admission requirements for th e specialist or doctoral degree program should follow the procedure outlined above for the master's program. Second Master's Guidelines The student who wishes to earn a second master's degree from Western Kentucky Un iversity must apply for and gain admission to the new program and satis fy all requirements (specific course work, research tool, thesis, etc.) for the new degree. No more than 12 hours of previous course wo rk, whether transferred from another university, from the previous master's degree at Western (or a combination of the two) or as a non-degree seeking student at WKU may be used to fulfill program and research tool requirements. An y course work used must be earned within the six years allowed for the second master's degree program. Seeking Dual Degrees Students may not seek two degrees (master's, specialist, or doctorate) simultaneously nor may they pursue a master's or Rank I at the same time. A student may, however, pursue a certificate (i.e., Women's Studies Certificate, Leadership Studies Certificate, etc.) along wi th a graduate degree program. Academic Common Market Kentucky, along with 12 other southern states, particip ates in the Academic Co mmon Market\u2014an interstate agreement for sharing non-duplicative acad emic programs. Selected graduate programs are included in this cooperative arrangement. A Kent ucky resident who has gained admission in to one of these se lected out-of-state programs can enroll and pay the respective state's resident tuition. A listing of the programs is available from the Director of Undergraduate Admissions. Program Residency Graduate Studies and Research does not have a re sidency requirement for completing a graduate degree. WKU courses offered by distance educatio n are considered resident credit. GRADUATE PROGRAM INFORMATION Graduate Studies & Research Wetherby Administration Building 207 (270) 745-2446 Office (270) 745-6950 Fax Additional information about degree programs may be obtained from the department offering the degree. Privacy Policy Graduate Studies and Research will not disclose info rmation to a third party regardless of association to the student (e.g., spouse, parent, friend, or other family member) without signed, written permission from the student. This is to protect the student's identification and ensure student information is not misused in any way. Course Load In general, the number of semester hours of credit that may be earned during a given term may not exceed the number of weeks of instruction. During a regular semester, the course load for a full-time graduate student is 9-15 hours with 9 being the minimum and 15 the maximum. Students are discouraged from requesting approval of a course overload . Graduate assistants may carry a course load of 9-12 hours during each semester while holding an assistantship appointment. Course Numbering 500 to 800 Courses numbered 500 and above are open to graduate students only. 400G Upper division undergraduat e courses numbered at the 400-level an d have a \"G\" designation (e.g., ENG 401G) may be taken for graduate credit. In these c ourses, graduate students are expected to complete additional course requirements as prescribed by the inst ructor. However, a student who has taken a particular 400-level course may not re peat that same course for 400G level credit. A maximum of 12 hours of 400G courses may be applied to the maste r's degree. Neither specialist nor doctoral degree candidates may not use any 400G-level courses to fu lfill degree requirements. 400 and below Courses numbered at the 400-level or below cannot be taken for graduate credit. Courses of this nature are counted in a student's overall GPA, but will not affect the student's degree GPA. 16Course Descriptions Course descriptions may be found in the back of the Graduate Catalog and are availa ble through TopNet. To view a course description, go to TopNet fro m Western's homepage Quick Links. Once at the TopNet Registration homepage, select Course Catalog then View Course Descriptions . To choose a course, locate the department in the drop-down menu and select Go, then choose the course number and select Go. Time Limitation for Completion of Degree All requirements for graduate degr ees must be completed within six years from the date the first course is taken. Failure to complete a degree in six years will result in the loss of all credits taken outside of the time limit. Students may request an extension to be approved by the Dean of Gr aduate Studies and Research. Extensions are considered on a case-by-case basis, and a student is not guaranteed approval. All records are purged after six years from the date of last enrollment at the university or degree completion. Credit Prior to Program Admission The total number of credits master's and specialist de gree students may apply to their degree program from credits earned prior to admission to the program (courses taken during th e senior semester, unclassified status courses, transfer courses, previous master's courses, pr evious certificate courses) may not exce ed twelve (12) hours. EdD students may count up to 15 hours of previously comple ted courses toward their degree programs. Transfer Credit A maximum of 12 transfer credits may be used in an y master's or specialist degree program, and up to 15 transfer credits may be permitted in the EdD program. However, some programs have more restrictive policies regarding the number of hours that will be accepted in a particular progr am. In any case, the follow ing requirements must be met: 1. The credit(s) must have been earned at an accredited graduate institution. 2. The course work to be transferred must be properly designated as having been taken for graduate credit. 3. The grade point average must be at least 3.0 (4.0 scale) on all graduate course work appearing on the transcript before specific courses can be transferred. 4. Additionally, the courses to be tr ansferred must carry a grade of 3.0 (4.0 scale) or better. 5. Credits earned during a given term must not exceed the number of weeks of instruc tion and must have been earned within the six-year time limit for degree completion. 6. Any course(s) to be transferred must be appropriate for degree completion. 7. At least 12 hours in the major area and at least 6 hour s in the minor area must be taken at Western. The \"Transfer Credit Practices\" report published by the American Associat ion of Registrar's and Admissions Officers is the reference used in evaluating credits. Transfer credits taken during the final semester of a progra m will delay program completion until official transcripts have been received in the Office of Graduate Studies and Research. In cooperative or joint programs with other universities, credits earned in the program at these institutions are not considered tr ansfer credits. A majority of credits applied toward certificat e requirements must be earned at Western. Independent Study Courses A maximum of 6 hours of workshops, independent studie s, special problems, individual special topics, and readings in the discipline may be us ed on any degree program. Graduate Advising Upon admission to a graduate progr am, each student is assigne d a major advisor from the graduate faculty in the respective department. Although student advising at Western Ke ntucky University is speci fically designed to assist students as they progress through degree programs, it is the responsibility of all st udents to be thoroughly familiar with all rules, regulations, and requir ements pertaining to graduate study . Readmission If a graduate student is not enrolled in the semester in which he or she initially applied or have not enrolled in more than three semesters, the student must be readmitted. A Readmit Form may be obtained from the Office of Graduate Studies or via email at graduate.studies@wku.edu . Once admitted to a program or enrolled in courses, a student may complete a readmission application online at the following website: https://acsapps.wku.edu/pls/ prod/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name =wkumenu.P_GradReAdmUnsecMnu . Program of Study (Form B/C) All degree-seeking students must submit a planned progr am of study (Form B/C) to th e Office of Graduate Studies and Research within the first semester (o r up to 12 credit hours) of course work (inclusive of transfer credit). The degree program is to be developed in consultation with and approved by th e advisor(s) assigned at the time of admission. If a program of study is not on file with the Offi ce of Graduate Studies and Re search, a student will not be permitted to enroll in a second semester or beyond 12 hours of courses (whichever comes first). Removal of this hold 17is contingent upon receipt and approval of the program of study (Form B/C). No ex ceptions will be made regarding this matter. All degree programs must be reviewed and approved in the Office of Graduate Studies and Research. Students in education graduate programs must have degree programs approved by the Teac her Certification Officer prior to submitting the program to Graduate Studies. The total number of credits master's and specialist degree students may apply to their degree programs from cr edits earned prior to admission to the program (courses taken during the senior semester, unclassified status courses, tr ansfer courses, previous master's course s, previous certificate courses) may not exceed 12 hours; EdD students may apply up to 15 hours of previously-completed course work. Non-degree education programs are reviewed and approv ed in the Office of Teacher Certification. Students entering the planned fifth-year (Rank II) or sixth-year (Rank I) prof essional education programs mu st have an approved program of study on file in the Office of Teacher Certification. These planned programs lead to the Rank II or Rank I salary classifications as recognized by the Kentucky Department of Education. The approved program must be on file before a letter certifying completion of hours can be se nt to the appropriate board of education. Course Substitutions Any change in the approved program of study mu st be specified on a Course Change Form, approved by the advisor and the Teacher Certification Officer (if applicable ), and submitted to Graduate Studies for final approval. Course changes include the addition or deletion of a course , the substitution of a transfer course, or substitution of another course offered by Western for a course on the program. The final approval should be obtained prior to enrollment in the course(s) affected by the requested course change. Change of Program Students who wish to change from one program of study to another must apply for readmission by completing a new graduate application or readmit application. Admission to the desired program must be gained, and such admission constitutes a new date of admission. The advisor(s) assigne d to the new program will evaluate any previously-taken courses for their applicability to the new program. Students may submit a change of program online at the following website: https://acsapps.wku.edu/pls/ prod/twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name =wkumenu.P_GradReAdmUnsecMnu . GRADUATE STUDIES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Grading and the Quality Point System The letters A, B, C, D, F, P and X are used by the University to indicate the student's academic proficiency. These letters have the fo llowing significance: A - Excellent, four quality points per semester hour B - Good, three quality points per semester hour C - Average, two quality points per semester hour D - Below Average, Unsatisfactory, one quality point per semester hour F - Failure, no semester hours earned and no quality points P - Pass, credit is awarded towards a degree, but no quality points are assigned. The \"P\" designation is restricted to specific cour ses approved for its use. X - Incomplete. A grade of \"X\" (inc omplete) is given only when a rela tively small amount of work is not completed because of illness or other reason satisfactory to the instructor. A grade of \"X\" received by a graduate student, with the exception of thesis courses or similar projects, will automatically become an \"F\" unless removed within twelve (12) weeks of the next full term (summer term excluded). An incomplete must be removed within this twelve-week period regardless of whether the student is registered for additional work in the next term. A student should work with the inst ructor who assigned the incomplete on an independent basis to complete the necessary assignments. The grade of \"X\" will continue to appear as the initial grade on the student's transcript, along with the revised grad e. A grade of incomplete is not used under any circumstances as a substitute for \"F\" or \"W\". The designations of AU, W, NR, ER, and NG are not included in the determination of grade point average and are used in the following cases: AU - Auditor of a course (See below for additional information). W - Officially withdrew NR - No report. Grades for an entire class were not received by the Office of the Registrar in time for processing. The designation \"NR\" is not to be used as a grade for individual students. ER - Error in reporting. This designation is used by the Office of the Registrar when a grade is not reported for an individual student. NG - No grade. A grade is not appropriate to the c ourse. The \"NG\" designation is restricted to specific courses approved for its use. 18IP - In Progress. The IP designation is restricted to specific courses designed to span more than one term. Unless approved otherwise, an IP desi gnation unresolved at the end of one year after its assignment will be converted to an F. Auditing of Courses An auditor is one who enrolls a nd participates in a course without expect ing to receive academic credit. The same registration procedure is followed and the same fees are char ged as for courses taken for cr edit. An audited course is not applicable to any degree or certificate program. Regular class attendance is expected of an auditor. Other course requirements, which may be obtained in writing from the instructor, will vary depending on the nature of the course. Students interested in auditing a course should secure perm ission from the instructor and discuss course requirements prior to enrolling. Failure to meet course requirements may result in the auditor being withdrawn from the course at the request of the instructor. A successful audit will be record ed on the transcript with the designation of AU. Any change from audit to credit must be done by the last day to add a cl ass. Changes from credit to audit must be done by the last day to drop a class with a grade of \"W\". Refunds for wit hdrawals from audited courses will be prorated on the same basis as refunds for withdrawals from courses taken for credit. Recording of Grades Grades are recorded in the Office of the Registrar as reported by the faculty at the end of each term. No grade filed in that office may be changed except on a written statement from the instructor certifying that an error has been made, or in the case of an incomplete, that the work was comp leted within the time limit. All conditions must be removed before the student will be recomme nded for any certificate or degree. Grades Candidates for graduate degrees and/or certificates are required to maintain a combined average grade of B (3.0 grade point average) in all course work. Grades lower th an a C may not be used in meeting degree or non-degree requirements. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA in all courses taken as a graduate student (including all transfer courses and unde rgraduate level courses). Students who fa il to meet the 3.0 GPA requirements for the graduate program GPA (courses on approved Form C) and overall cumulative GP A will not be awarded a degree or certificate. Graduate Academic Probation and Dismissal Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 grade point average (GPA) for all courses taken at WKU and those graduate courses transferred to WKU to fulfill graduate program re quirements. Students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0 in both the major and the cumulative (overall) GPA to earn a degree or certificate. If a student's overall GPA falls below 3.0, the student will receive a letter of a cademic warning informing the student that the GPA is below 3.0. The student will have one additional full-time semester or the equivalent (9 hours) to remove the academic probation by attaining a 3.0 cumulative GPA. If the GPA rema ins below a 3.0 after completing the one semester of full- time course work or the equivalent (9 hours), the student ma y not register for any additional graduate credit at WKU and will be dismissed from the graduate program. Students placed on academic probation are not eligible for graduate assistantship appointments. Any student failing to obtain the required 3.0 GPA afte r the probationary period who wishes to be readmitted to Graduate Studies must submit a written academic plan deta iling how the required GPA can be obtained. The request for readmission must have the support of the graduate faculty in the academic pr ogram before being reviewed/considered in Graduate Studies. This request for readmission must be submitted with a new application following the semester of academic probation. Each case will be reviewed by the D ean of Graduate Studies and Research for a determination regarding readmission to the desired academic program. If they are accepted for readmission to the program, readmitted students will have one full-tim e semester or the equivalent (9 hours) to remove the academic pr obation by attaining a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Please note that each program reserves the right to apply more restrictive requirements to graduate students regarding probation and dismissal. Dismissal Graduate students may be dismissed from the program for having failed twice the final comprehensive examination for the graduate degree. A graduate stude nt may also be dismissed from the gradua te program if the overall GPA, as a graduate student, (including graduate and undergraduate c ourse work) falls below 3.0 as described in the academic probation section above. Students may also be dismissed from programs for reasons other than failure to maintain a satisfactory grade point average. Expectations regarding student conduct are descri bed in the Western Kentucky University Student Handbook and apply to students in all programs. Additional program-specifi c policies regarding student conduct and dismissal from a program for non-academic reasons ma y also apply. Students should contact their advisors for more information regarding expectations for appropriate student conduct. 19Repeating a Course A course in which a student has received a passing grade (C or better) may not be repeated for the purpose of raising the grade. If a course is repeated in which a pa ssing grade was received, the cour se credit(s) w ill only count once toward the program and both grades w ill be used in calculati ng the GPA. A course in which a grade of D or F is received must be repeated if the course is used in meeting degree requirements. When the c ourse is repeated, the course credit(s) will only count once toward the program and both grades are used in calculating the GPA. If the course is not being used to fulfill degree requirement s it may be repeated and both grades are used in computing the overall grade point average. In graduate education, grades are not replaced by repeating courses. Research Tool Grades For those students who choose programs that allow course work in lie u of the foreign language requirement, a minimum grade of B must be attained for the research tool. The research tool is included in the grade point average. Research tool requirements must be met prior to attain ing admission to candidacy. The research tool should be completed within the first 15 hours of the graduate program. Foreign Language Examination Students may choose to complete the research tool requirement by taking a fore ign language examination. The foreign language application must be filed and approved prior to the completion of the examination. Applications for the foreign language examination are available in the Office of Graduate Studies and Resear ch or in the Department of Modern Languages & Intercultural Studies. Admission to Candidacy (Form D) Admission to candidacy is a traditional component of gr aduate study, the purpose of which is to provide a planned, formal review of the student's progre ss toward the specified program of study. The review enables the student, in consultation with appropriate University officials, to make warranted ch anges in the program. Admission to candidacy should be an expression of confidence that the student will (w ith appropriate, continued effort ) be able to complete all requirements for the degree. All degree-seeking graduate students must apply for and be admitted to candidacy by submitting an Admission to Candidacy Form (Form D) to the Office of Graduate Studies. Admission to Graduate Studies and Research and admission to candidacy are two separate procedures. Students seeking master's or specialist degrees should submit a Form D before the completion of 21 credit hours and after completing at least 15 hours of course work and, if applicable, completing the research tool and removing any deficiencies with a grade of A or B. The Form D MUST be submitted no later than one semester prior to the intended semester of planned degree completion. Failure to meet the filing deadline for the Form D may delay graduation by at least one semester. Students who have not filed a Form D prior to the comp letion of 21 hours of course work are subject to a registration hold. This hold will not be removed until the Form D is signed by the major advisor, and received in the Graduate Studies office. Failure to complete this requi rement can delay graduation by at least one semester. Once an EdD student has completed 30 hours, s/he should apply for the qualifying exam with the department. This application is to be completed by the doctoral student and dissertation chair at, or prior to, the completion of thirty (30) required core credits. Once the student complete s the qualifying exam the student may apply for and gain admission to candidacy. Admission to candidacy should occur no later than the semester prior to your final semester of course work. Admission to Candidacy requirements: 1. An approved program of study, 2. Removal of any deficiencies or conditions for admission, 3. Attainment of at least a 3.0 grade point average on all graduate course work and at least a 3.0 overall GPA at the time of admission to candidacy, 4. Completion of the foreign language examination or research tool as specified for the program, and 5. Approval of the major advisor and Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Note: Master's or specialist degree students who enroll in 12 to 15 hours of course work (applicable to their approved degree programs) during their first semest er should submit their applications for candidacy (Form D) to the Office of Graduate Studies at the end of that semester; Ed.D. stude nts should submit their applica tions for candidacy after the complete the requirements to be admitted as a candidate for the degree. Comprehensive Examination All graduate degree programs require that either a written or an oral examination be satisfactorily completed, or that an approved capstone course be successfully completed. For students in master's de gree programs with thesis (Plan A), an oral defense of the thesis is required. For doctoral students, an oral defense of the disserta tion is required. Students must meet the following guidelines before they are permitted to attempt the comprehensive examination: 1. Gain admission to candidacy (Form D on file with Graduate Studies and Research) 2. Complete at least one half of the course work in an approved program minor (if applicable), 203. Have no more than nine hours remaining on the approved program, and 4. Complete any additional requirements as specified by faculty in the department in which the program is housed. The major advisor or dissertation chair, in consultation with the student, appoints the oral examination committee consisting of three graduate faculty members. If the student's program includes a minor, or a significant amount of course work in an area outside the major, one of the co mmittee members must represent th at area. The chairperson will notify Graduate Studies of the results of the examinatio n by sending a Comprehensive Examination Report (Form E). The department or dissertation chair is responsible for turn ing in the results of the exam ination to Graduate Studies. Failure to receive the Form E can delay gr aduation by at least one semester. Form E' s will not be accepted by students. Undergraduate Seniors Earning Graduate Credit Undergraduate seniors at Western may enro ll in graduate course work (i.e., co urses requiring graduate standing) during their final semester provided th ey meet the following conditions: 1. Admission requirements (see Standard Examination Scores for admi ssion to graduate studies and to the program of interest) except for completion of the bachelor's degree, 2. Make formal application to graduate study (Form A s hould be submitted to Graduate Studies at least four weeks prior to the beginning of the semester), 3. Seniors lacking no more than 9 hours to complete a bachelor's degree may enroll in a maximum of 6 hours of graduate credit. Seniors lacking no more than 12 hours may enroll in a maximum of 3 hours of graduate credit. 4. Carry a final semester course load of no more th an 15 hours (combined undergraduate and graduate hours), and 5. Do not, in any way, attempt to apply the gr aduate course(s) to th e undergraduate degree. Students wishing to pursue graduate credit must file the appr opriate paper work, which can be obtained in the Office of Graduate Studies and Research. Requests for enrolling in gra duate courses will not be c onsidered without this form. Thesis and Specialist Project Committees Students pursuing graduate programs requiring the thesis or specialist project are assisted by a thesis or specialist project committee. The student in conjun ction with the thesis chairperson selects at least two additional graduate faculty members. In some cases, an individual who is not a part of We stern's faculty may be asked to serve on a thesis or specialist project committee. Prior to this service, such an indivi dual must qualify and be reco mmended for adjunct membership on Western's graduate faculty. An indi vidual who has expertise in a pertin ent area, but who does not meet the requirements for appointment to regular or associate membership on the graduate faculty, may serve as a fourth member of the committee with approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. Thesis, Specialist Project , or Dissertation The program of a student pursuing the master's thesis or specialist project must c ontain 6 hours of credit in 599- Thesis Research and Writing or in 699-Specialist Project. St udents in the Doctor of Educational Leadership program must have 12 hours of credit in EDAD 799-Dissertation Research. The thesis/project must be submitted to the Offi ce of Graduate Studies following approval by the student's committee members. Contact Graduate Studies and Research for semester dates. Instructions and requirements for preparing, submitting, and distributing the thesis or specialist project are given in the Guidelines for Master's Th eses and Specialist Projects . Copies are available in the O ffice of Graduate Studies or on the website. It is the student's responsibility to obt ain and comply with these guidelines. Maintaining Matriculation If the thesis, specialist, or dissertation project is not completed during the initial period of registration for this cre dit, the student must maintain matriculation until the thesis or project has been submitted and approved. To maintain matriculation, the student must register for 600 (thesis), 700 (project), or 800 (dissertation) during any semester or summer term in which he/she will be actively pursuing th e thesis/project or will be submitting it for approval. Enrollment in matriculation courses does not result in a grad e or credit toward any degree or non-degree program. Posthumous Degree Policy WKU recognizes the significance of acknowledging disti nguished student achievemen t at all times, including following the tragic death of student who has made consid erable progress toward the completion of a degree and remained in good academic standing with the University. A student who dies while actively pursui ng a graduate degree may be consider ed for a posthumous graduate degree if he or she is in good academic standing at the time of de ath, maintained a 3.0 grade poi nt average or better in the program of study, and had obtained Ca ndidacy plus completed 75% of their program requirements for the Master's degree . The student may be nominated for posthumous degree recognition by the Chair of his/her department. 21A request for an awarding of posthumous degree recognition shall be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies, the Provost and the Vice President of Academic Affairs. In the event it is determined that a graduate student di d not meet the above requirement s for a degree, a \"posthumous certificate of recognition\" may be awarded, if appropriate, by the Provost and Vice Presiden t of Academic Affairs. The certificate recognizes a student's progress toward the attain ment of a degree. The certificate will be noted on the student's transcript.

Policy on Expiration of Graduate Courses and Programs Leading to Professional Education Certification The following policy applies only to graduate certification-only programs, endorsement programs, Planned Fifth-Year (Rank II) program s, and Planned Sixth Year (Rank I) programs : Course work for programs leading to certification in professional education must be aligned with current standards. Some older courses ar e not aligned with current standards, and thus it may not be appropriate to count them in a student's program. Generally speaking, courses used to satisfy program requirements in programs leading to professional educati on certification should be no more than 10 years old at the time that the certifi cation program is written. Decisions about whether older courses may be used will be made on a case-by-case basis by the department head of the student's major. Students may be required to demonstrate proficiency related to current course c ontent if they wish to satisfy program requirements using courses taken more than 10 years prior to when the student's program of studies is written. All requir ements for graduate certification-only, endorsement, Planned Fifth-Year, and Pl anned Sixth-Year programs must be completed within 10 years from the date when the program was written. Students may request an extension, which must be approved by the Dean of the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences on r ecommendation of the department head. If the Commonwealth of Kentucky makes changes in certification requirements, students seeking certificat ion may be required to modify their programs of study to meet the new requirements.

Alternate Route to Prin cipal Certification Kentucky Senate Bill #77 made it possible for higher education institutions with approved school administration certification programs to pr ovide alternate route to certification programs upon application and approval by th e Education Professional Standards Board (EPSB). Western Kentucky University (WKU) has an EPSB approve d Alternate Route to Principal Certification program. Under the provisions of Senate Bill #77 and state regulations , Western Kentucky University established procedures for the a lternate route program as follows: 1. A local district superintende nt must nominate a candidate for the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program at WKU. The letter of nomination must specifically state that the superintendent is recommending th e candidate to the sc hool council and will be employed for the coming academic year if selected by the school council. 2. Once the letter of nomination a nd a letter of application from the candidate are received, WKU will admit the candidate to the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program providing the candidate is accepted by Graduate Studies and Research. 3. WKU will provide the candidate with a letter stating that the candidate has been admitted to the Alternate Route to Pr incipal Certification program , thus, under the provision of Senate Bill #77 and state regulations, making the candidate eligible to interview and accept a principal position. It should be not ed that these candidates have the same eligibility status as any other candidate who has completed a regular certification program and already has the certification endorsement. 4. WKU will also notify the Office of Teacher Cer tification/Services that the candidate has been admitted to the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program. 5. If the candidate is offered the position, the superintendent must pr ovide verification of employment to WKU and the candidate. WKU will assign the candidate an advisor, who will prepare the student's program. The candidate will submit the verification of employment and a TC-TP to the Office of Teach er Certification/Services. That office will sign and verify the enrollment of the candi date in the Alternate Route to Principal Certification program and return the TC-TP to the candidate. The candidate will then forward the TC-TP with the verification of employment as a principal (or assistant principal) and the appropriate fee payment. 6. EPSB will issue the candidate a two-year, Temporary Provisional Certificate for All Grades Principal. The candidate will have two-years to complete all requirements for the principal certification, after which the candidate receives a regular Provisional Certification. 94 Non-degree Certification Programs Principalship\u2014All grades Supervisor of Instruction Director of Pupil Personnel School Superintendent The Department of Educational Administ ration, Leadership, and Research offers programs designed to prepare school pers onnel for effective leadership in P-12 schools. The curricula meet professional certification standards in schoo l administration. The department also provides educational foundations courses that give graduate students a great er understanding of their roles and the function of educationa l institutions in society. Course work associated with degree progr ams at Western Kentucky University may be used to meet certification requirements established by the Commonwealth of Kentucky; however, the Commonwealth may institute changes in certific ation requirements at any time. When the Commonwealth initiates such chan ges, students seeking certifica tion may be required to modify their courses/experiences to meet th e new certification requirements. Students wishing to pursue one of th e non-degree programs must make application to Graduate Studies and Research. Upon completion of the program, individuals must contact the Office of Teacher Certification/Se rvices in the College of Edu cation and Behavioral Sciences. That official then certifies to the Kentucky Education Professional Standards Board that rank requirements have been met.
