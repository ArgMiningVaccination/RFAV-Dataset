Holistic Therapies for Summer In traditional Chinese medicine, summer is associated with the element of Fire, expansive energy, and the emotion of joy. Summer is the perfect time to try a new physical wellness activity and invest in your health. This is the time to restore the reserves that keep us healthy and strong all through the winter months. Acupuncture Employed over centuries for health maintenance and preventative care, acupuncture can help the body smoothly transition into a new season by reducing stress, relieving pain, enhancing immunity, and restoring the natural flow of energy.
