While their methods may differ, they are alike in that each form of healing utilizes some external method to create a change in the function of the body. The Medical Doctor uses drugs and surgery. The Chiropractor uses the spinal adjustment. The Homeopath uses a specific remedy and the Herbalist uses herbs. The Acupuncturist uses needles and the Body Worker uses his hands. With each method, the patient is a passive participant hoping to be healed by a skilled practitioner. External healing techniques help to heal the symptom but ignore the underlying cause. Healing the symptom has value, it alleviates suffering and should not be ignored, but it is limited. Unless the underlying cause within the person is corrected, soon the person will unconsciously create a new illness to take its place. I recall a patient I treated early in my career for stress induced headaches. I succeeded in alleviating this \"symptom\" with chiropractic care. He continued on with no internal change having been made. Years later, he died of a heart attack. Was this man really healed when he came to see me? I think not. His headache had been a smoke alarm warning him of a deeper fire. I unplugged the smoke alarm, but ignorantly allowed the fire to destroy his house. The path of self-healing is not an easy one. In fact, it is the most difficult path because it is a path into the self. It is a path of self-discovery on the physical, emotional, and spiritual levels. This path encompasses one's whole being and is the basis of holistic healing. This is a path that each person must walk for themselves; no one can walk it for them. Other people can serve as guides along the way: doctors, shamans, healers and teachers. However, choose your guides carefully. A helpful guide is one who is willing to teach you, but then is willing to let you walk your own path and does not demand that you walk theirs. The path of self-healing is an arduous one. It often requires many stops along the way for directions. To succeed requires commitment, patience, self-compassion, and self-understanding. The path of self-healing is also very rewarding. This journey brings along with it many gifts. These gifts are more valuable than precious gemstones and makes all the work and time spent worth while. These gifts bring about our healing on the physical and emotional level that our growth spiritually. Good luck on your "}
