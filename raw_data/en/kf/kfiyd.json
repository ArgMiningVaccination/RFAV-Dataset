Hostetter, MD B.K. Rachford Professor Chair, Department of Pediatrics Director, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation Chief Medical Officer Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Dear Colleagues, I am pleased to present this year's annual report of the top scientific achievements of the Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation. As you will soon see, this publication assembles a truly remarkable set of insights, innovations and discoveries produced by our equally remarkable and steadily growing faculty. In many ways, this report helps establish a baseline for the next five years as we embark upon our strategic objective to lead the world in improving child health through our collaborative culture of discovery, translation and learning. We are accelerating our efforts to expand the impact of our research enterprise across the entire spectrum of discovery, from basic exploration of the mechanisms of human health and disease, through the process of translating innovation into practice, all the way to assessing the impact of research upon community health. In this publication, you can read about six of the most innovative, farthest reaching breakthroughs achieved at Cincinnati Children's since 2010. You can also read about more than 50 significant discoveries achieved in fiscal 2015. Yet I want to emphasize that these works represent just a portion of the high-impact research happening here, just one slice of the output generated by a scientific infrastructure that took decades to build. In just the past year, our faculty published more than 2,000 peer-reviewed articles, chapters, books and other publications. Very few pediatric medical centers can match this level of productivity. The cover of this report celebrates the inspiring art installed throughout our new Clinical Sciences Pavilion, the latest physical example of our deep and ongoing commitment to research. The content of this report outlines many other ways Cincinnati Children's supports our mission to improve child health through scientific endeavor. We have established a wide variety of internally funded pilot grant programs to nurture emerging concepts. We invest in more than 20 research core facilities to make the very best technology available to some of the very best minds in pediatrics. Our ability to invest in outstanding people and our long track record of collaboration have placed Cincinnati Children's in the position to be a significant force in the emerging world of \"team science.\" We look forward to forging new partnerships and collaborations with other leading pediatric institutions. Together, we will make bold progress against the greatest challenges in improving child health. Five years from now, we expect to report upon an even more remarkable set of scientific achievements.From the Director CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 56 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONThomas Cody Chair, Board of T rusteesNancy Krieger Eddy PhD, Research ChairMichael Fisher President and CEO INNOVATION IS A WAY OF LIFE AT CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S. IT TRANSCENDS EVERYTHING WE DO. This year's Research Foundation Annual Report is a comprehensive account of our finest published work over the past year. The breadth and depth of these findings come from the efforts of our diverse and talented scientists and their support staffs, who are from more than 80 countries and make up about one-third of the total workforce at Cincinnati Children's. The importance we place on innovation at Cincinnati Children's was strongly reinforced this year as we: Earned almost $200 million in external grant and industry funding at a time when funding for medical research is, in general, declining. Invested $109 million in laboratory and applied research costs that are not covered by external grants or industry support. This significant commitment by our institution underscores our confidence in the people who work here and the quality of their endeavors. Launched our 2020 strategic plan, which continues to emphasize our focus on medical research and our drive to transform child health with our collaborative culture of discovery, translation and learning. Opened our new 15-story Clinical Sciences Pavilion, a symbol of our longstanding and future commitment to pediatric research. It was designed to elevate our full continuum of discovery, including innovation, translation, community health and improvement science, and accelerate discoveries into practice. The new facility will also help us retain and continue to attract top talent from around the world. Cincinnati Children's is proud to have some of the best and brightest minds working on some of the most difficult problems in pediatric medicine. Their simple and singular motivation is to be the leader in improving child health. The advances summarized in this report are inspiring. Yet, we are reminded every day of the gaps that still exist, the cures that remain undiscovered, and the children who face uncertain futures. As we move into another exciting year filled with promise and anticipation, we thank our partners, funders, donors and the community for the many ways you show your support of our pediatric research efforts. Together, we are changing the outcome for children and families from down the street, across the country, and around the world.From Our Board CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 7Six Premier Achievements Set Standard for Changing Outcomes Together 8 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONSince 2010, the highly talented and productive faculty members of the Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation have produced more than 7,000 studies published in peer-reviewed scientific and medical journals. These contributions have had far-reaching impact across pediatric medicine, leading to new therapeutics, improved diagnostics, and significant advances in our fundamental understanding of human development and disease. From this impressive body of work, six advances stand out as Cincinnati Children's premier scientific achievements of 2010-15. The following innovations and breakthroughs were selected by committees of senior research leaders, led by Tracy Glauser, MD, and Jeffrey Whitsett, MD. Their selections reflect work with particularly powerful influence upon basic, translational and clinical research \u2014 and they set a challenging standard for the work we will pursue in the next five years. \"These researchers truly exemplify our mission at Cincinnati Children's to improve child health through innovation,\" \u2014 Margaret Hostetter, MD, Director, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 910 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION Organoid Revolution Happening Here 10 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONCINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 11James Wells, PhD BE THEY TEST PLATFORMS TO EVALUATE NEW MEDICATIONS OR THE FU - TURE OF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE, THE TINY INTESTINE AND STOMACH ORGANOIDS DEVELOPED AT CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S BY JAMES WELLS, PhD, and colleagues have only just begun to demonstrate their potential to transform medicine. In December 2010, a paper posted online in Nature revealed that Wells' team had created functional, three-dimensional intestinal tissue from a combination of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). With this break - through, Cincinnati Children's joined an elite class of med - ical centers making dra - matic progress at growing miniature human brains, kidneys, pancreata, and other complex tissues in laboratory settings. In a series of cell ma - nipulations, Wells' team coaxed stem cells to trans - form from denitive endoderm into hindgut progenitor cells, and ultimately into organoids containing all the major intestinal cell types - including entero - cytes, goblet, Paneth and enteroendocrine cells. The tissue demonstrated absorptive and secre - tory functions and even began forming its own intestine-specic stem cells. At this point, Wells' team had an organ- on-a-chip, a research tool potentially capable of supplanting mice as a human-based model for studying disease. The mini-intestine shows promise as a model to further study necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome and more. But the team did not stop here. In a study published online Oct. 19, 2014, in Nature Medicine , Wells collaborated with Michael Helmrath, MD, MS, to demonstrate that intes - tinal organoids can grow into fully mature human tissue once grafted to a mouse kidney to pro - vide a blood supply. This tissue included muscle layers and a self-renewing mucosal lining. The success was an encouraging sign that stem cell-derived organoids might be able to grow on their own once transplanted into the human body. The very same month, Wells and graduate student Kyle McCracken published another paper in Nature announcing success at forming a mini-stomach. This \"gastric organoid\" specically resembled the antrum, the portion of the stomach that connects to the intestine. Importantly, the organoids can harbor gut bacteria, which makes them immediately useful in research related to H. pylori , the bacterium that causes stomach ulcers. Further organoid development continues at a rapid pace. Wells and colleagues are working on growing the fundus, the acid-secreting por - tion of the stomach and several other projects. An exciting aspect of the stomach project is that the organoids were developed from functional anterior foregut spheroids, which also serve as the developmental root of the pancreas and the lung. In fact, Jason Spence, PhD, one of the col - leagues who worked with Wells on the intestine organoid project, has carried on the work at the University of Michigan. In March 2015, Spence reported success at developing a lung organoid with structures resembling bronchi and alveoli that survived in the laboratory for 100 days. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 11A Study That Changed the Direction of Cardiac Stem Cell Research 12 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONJeffery Molkentin, PhD SOMETIMES GREAT MEDICINE BOILS DOWN TO FIGURING OUT WHY AN EXCITING NEW TREATMENT APPROACH JUST DOES NOT WORK. THIS IS HOW JEFFERY MOLKENTIN, PHD, ROCKED THE WORLD OF CARDIAC research in 2014. From the instant scientists dis - covered how to create stem cells that did not re - quire the use of embryonic tissue, experiments began to nd a way to use stem cells to regen - erate the human heart. Few missions in medicine have had higher priority. Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death. Beyond the fatalities, the damage caused by sudden heart attacks and gradual heart failure destroys the quality of life for millions of people while incurring hundreds of billions in health care costs. And yet, despite massive de - mand for cures, deep investment in research, and great expectations for stem cell technology, cardiac muscle remains stubbornly resistant to repair. For several years, it seemed that regener - ative medicine was poised for a breakthrough. Excitement ran high for the possibility that car - diac progenitor cells or even bone marrow cells expressing the cell surface protein c-kit could be injected into damaged or dead areas of the heart to directly create new beating tissue. However, what was reported to work so well in mice and rats produced dismal results in human clinical trials in more than 4,000 patients worldwide. Molkentin's team explained why in a paper published May 7, 2014, in Nature . Molkentin is a widely published cardiovas - cular molecular biologist at Cincinnati Children's Heart Institute who was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator in 2008. His work to understand the intracellular signaling pathways and transcriptional regula - tory circuits that control cell growth and differ - entiation has signicantly advanced un - derstanding of heart disease and muscular dystrophy. In this study, Molkentin's team developed a genetic strategy in mice so that any new myocyte arising from a potential c-kit stem cell would be labeled green with a fluorescent protein. The lack of color told the story; just 0.027 percent of the murine cardiomyocytes originated from c-kit stem cells. To the extent that c-kit stem cells offered any therapeutic benet, it was through small improvements to blood vessels, not generation of new muscle tissue. \"What we showed in our study is that c-kit-positive stem cells from the heart can make endothelial cells that form capillaries. But these c-kit positive cells do not like to make cardiomyo - cytes,\" Molkentin says. \"If they really do generate new cardiomyocytes, the rates are exceptionally low - roughly one in every 3,000 cells - and that becomes meaningless.\" These ndings shocked the eld and stirred extensive scientic debate. Ultimately, Molkentin's work helped reprioritize how future clinical trials are planned, or no longer planned, and freed the research community to begin looking in new directions for a regenerative therapy that can work as intended. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 13Gene Therapy Advances Raise Hopes for Curing Sickle Cell Disease 14 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONFor many years, clinicians could do little more than try to manage the pain of sickle cell disease and treat complications as they occurred. For patients, it has been a world of daily antibiotics as young children, blood transfusions, hospital admissions, and \u2014 for those lucky enough to nd a matching donor \u2014 bone marrow transplants. Now, scientists are closing in on a potential cure. Human clinical trials have begun to evaluate a patented treatment that could reshape the fu - ture for children born with sickle cell dis - ease and respresent a major step forward for the eld of gene therapy. Developed at Cincin- nati Children's by Punam Malik, MD, the treatment employs a modied lenti - virus to transfer a healthy fetal hemoglobin gene to people with sickle cell dis - ease, which can allow their bodies to produce normal red blood cells instead of the sickle-shaped cells that dene the inherited disorder. If successful, the treatment would effectively cure a disease that affects more than 90,000 people in the United States and millions of people worldwide. It also may serve as a treatment for thalassemia, a re - lated rare blood disease. A U.S. patent application was led in 2011 for the gene therapy method after years of research led by Malik demonstrated that the technique was effective in halting blood cell sickling in mice and in human tissue samples. Malik joined Cincinnati Children's in 2007. She received her MBBS in 1985 and her MD in 1989 from Delhi University in New Delhi, India. She earned an MS from the University of Maryland in 1991, then launched a career in Hematology-Oncology at Children's Hospital Los Angeles before moving to Cincinnati.In sickle cell disease, a genetic defect makes red blood cells carry hemoglobin S, which produces misshapen blood cells that cannot ef - ciently deliver oxygen. Over time, the condi - tion can trigger strokes, kidney failure and other forms of tissue damage. Malik's innovation flows from the observation that some adults never stop producing fetal hemo - globin (HbF), which prevents red blood cell sickling when present in the body in suf - cient quantity. Normally, the fetal hemoglobin gene switches off shortly after birth. The new gene therapy reactivates it. The clinical trial, which envisions following 10 par - ticipants for 15 years, began enrolling participants in 2014. The treatment involves collecting bone marrow stem cells from patients, using a lenti - virus vector to deliver a healthy -globin gene to the cells, then returning the engineered cells to the patients where they can multiply into perma - nent HbF factories. The technique patented at Cincinnati Children's stands out because it restricts trans - gene expression to maturing erythroid cells, which reduces the cancer risks that have plagued other gene therapy efforts. It remains unclear whether gene therapy will become the ultimate cure for sickle cell disease. Newer technologies, including the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, may be able to directly cor - rect the sickle cell genetic defect in hematopoi - etic stem cells without the need for gene inser - tion therapy. Punam Malik, MD CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 15A Quest to Unlock the Secrets of Eosinophilic Disorders 16 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONTHE MISSION STARTED BECAUSE SCIENTISTS WANTED TO FIND OUT WHY SOME CHILDREN DEVELOP FOOD ALLERGIES SO SEVERE THAT IT AFFECTS THEIR GROWTH. THESE CHILDREN SUFFER FREQUENT STOMACHACHES, vomiting and diarrhea. They have trouble swal - lowing and often must endure life on strictly lim - ited diets. The search for answers has changed our understanding of food allergies and estab - lished a newly recognized set of conditions, called eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID), in which the immune system treats food as a foreign invader. Marc Rothenberg, MD, PhD, has been a pioneer in the eld, and Cincinnati Children's has become a global leader in researching and treating these conditions. Until the last decade, eosinophils were best known as end-stage cells of the immune system. Their only acknowledged job was to provide host protection against parasites. However, Rothenberg and col - leagues have shown that eosinophils are multifunctional leukocytes involved in di - verse inflammatory responses. The work pro - gressed from describing a single condition \u2014 eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) \u2014 to establishing an entire class of disorders. Rothenberg coined the term EGID in 2004, coinciding with him be - coming the Founding Director of the Cincinnati Center for Eosinophilic Disorders, the rst center of its kind in the U.S. Rothenberg has published over 300 papers researching these topics, in - cluding many that have deeply influenced the eld. Rothenberg's team has characterized several critical pathways that regulate al - lergic responses, including the eotaxin family of chemokines (eosinophil chemoattractants) and interleukin 5 (eosinophil growth/activating cytokine), which now a proven target for eosin - ophilic subtypes of asthma. His laboratory estab - lished the rst animal models of EoE and identi - ed the EoE transcriptome, a genome-wide set of molecular markers that have been translated into a commercially available EoE diagnostic panel. Rothenberg's team conducted the rst controlled clinical trial in EoE, demon - strating the effectiveness of topical glucocorticoid therapy, which is now in clinical use. In 2010, Rothenberg published the rst ge - nome-wide association study of EoE in Nature Genetics . This study demonstrated a genetic linkage with chromosome 5q22 and that genetic variants of the immune hor - mone thymic stromal lympho - poietin were involved With John Harley, MD, PhD, Leah Kottyan, PhD, and other collaborators at Cincinnati Children's, Rothenberg conducted another ge - nome-wide analysis that interrogated more than 1.5 million genetic variants in EoE. The team pub - lished a breakthrough in 2014 in Nature Genetics identifying a powerful association between EoE and chromosome region 2p23, particularly in the gene CAPN14. They found that CAPN14 was located in an epigenetic \"hotspot\" modied by IL-13 and was dynamically upregulated as a function of disease activity. Remarkably, the CAPN14-encoded pro - tein, calpain 14, was specically and most highly expressed in the esophagus, answering the long-standing question in the allergy eld of why patients develop tissue-specic manifestations.Marc Rothenberg, MD, PhD CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 17Macrophage Transplantation Could Take Familial PAP Off the Map 18 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONCINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 19PULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS (PAP) IS A RARE AND BRUTAL PUL - MONARY DISORDER. PEOPLE WITH THIS CONDITION HAVE LUNGS THAT CANNOT REMOVE USED SURFACTANT, WHICH GRADUALLY BUILDS UP IN air sacs and erodes the ability to breathe. For years, the only way to relieve symptoms was to perform whole-lung lavage, a surgical procedure introduced in the 1960s that involves flushing as much as 50 liters of saline solution through each lung to clear away accumulated surfactant. However, the effects are temporary. While some patients can go long periods between lavages, others require treatment as often as every one to two months. In 1999, a research team in Japan discovered that people with idiopathic PAP produce a neutralizing autoantibody against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This was im - portant because GM-CSF is crucial for developing the fully mature macrophages needed to clear away used surfactant. Bruce Trapnell, MD, and colleagues at Cincinnati Children's have dramatically ad - vanced that early work. First, they proved that the antibody was not merely present, but was actually causing the disease; a nding that re-de - ned idiopathic PAP as an autoimmune disorder. This work led to a diagnostic test for autoimmune PAP currently provided as a clinical research test by Trapnell's team at the Translational Pulmonary Science Center. It also supports their program to develop potentially benecial alternatives to whole-lung lavage, including inhaled GM-CSF, plasmapheresis, and rituximab therapy. That was just the beginning. Trapnell and his colleague Takuji Suzuki, MD, PhD, also found that some children have a hereditary form of PAP (hPAP) that does not in - volve the antibody. Instead, these children had a genetic defect that prevents macrophages from receiving signals from GM-CSF. This nding launched an effort to develop what could be the rst successful form of lung gene therapy. In a breakthrough paper, published in October 2014 in Nature , Trapnell and col - leagues reported achieving a major milestone. In mice, they successfully performed pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT) of both wild-type and Csf2rb-gene- corrected macrophages. Not only was the procedure safe and well-tolerated, the healthy macrophage cells proliferated in the lungs and began doing their job of clearing away the ex - cess surfactant. One ad - ministration fully corrected the lung disease as well as the secondary systemic man - ifestations and restored dis - ease-related biomarkers to normal. Importantly, testing also found that the transplanted macrophages remain conned to the lungs and did not expand into the blood, bone marrow, or spleen. The ability to introduce gene-corrected macrophages in such a con - trolled fashion has implications that could go well beyond treating hPAP, including potential for treating a variety of serious lung infections. In humans, Trapnell says transplants could be performed using the patient's own cells, thus eliminating the need for immunosuppression. Delivery can be achieved via bronchoscopic in - stillation versus much riskier surgical procedures. With so much potential, many eyes will be watching as Trapnell and colleagues work through the preclinical studies needed to pre - pare for human clinical trials. Bruce Trapnell, MD CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 19Learning Networks Multiply the Speed and Reach of Innovation 20 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONCINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 21WHAT IF THERE WAS A WAY TO CREATE A VASTLY BETTER CHRONIC ILL - NESS CARE SYSTEM BY HARNESSING THE INHERENT MOTIVATION AND COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE OF PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS? Answering that question has been the driving force behind the impressive achieve - ments of Peter Margolis, MD, PhD, and col - leagues at Cincinnati Children's whose work is transforming pediatric medicine in fundamental ways. Margolis is Director of Research for the James M. Anderson Center for Health Systems Excel - lence at Cincinnati Chil - dren's. He has been a pioneer in developing \"pediatric learning health systems,\" including the disease-specic Improve - CareNow network and the wider-scale PEDSnet project. Both projects have assembled massive com - munities of physicians, families and scientists who can come together to improve outcomes by sharing data, experiences and insights. Since its launch four years ago, the ImproveCareNow network has grown to include more than 50 gastroenterology sites in the U.S. Their collaborative efforts have resulted in a dramatic 22 percentage point improvement in remission rates for patients in the network, from 55 percent to 77 percent. Now Margolis is working to expand the lessons learned from the ImproveCareNow pro- ject to many more chronic conditions. The new PEDSnet consortium includes eight academic pediatric medical centers, two disease-specic pediatric networks, and two national data part - ners. Margolis and Christopher Forrest, MD, PhD, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia are the prin - cipal investigators. Details about PEDSnet were published in July 2014 in a paper Margolis co-au - thored for the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. PEDSnet will support the wider goals of the National Pediatric Learning Health System, which seeks to integrate clinical studies done in routine care set - tings, leverage structured data capture at every encounter, and incorpo - rate quality improvement methods to advance care delivery - including active and meaningful patient participa - tion. By 2018, plans call for expanding PEDSnet to include 10 percent of the nation's children, and to use the network to conduct 25 observational research and 10 interventional studies. PEDSnet itself is part of a still larger ef - fort known as PCORnet, the National Patient- Centered Clinical Research Network. PCORnet has grown to include 34 research networks like PEDSnet. Margolis was recently chosen to chair the PCORnet Steering Committee. Already, the participating networks have mapped data for 1 million individuals to the PCORnet Common Data Model. The next phase will include using that information to accelerate discoveries in more than 150 diseases and conditions.

Hormone changes in peripubertal girls. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism . 2014;99(10):3829-3835.Adolescent and Transition Medicine PUBLISHED ONLINE JULY 16, 2014 Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism Using new methods to determine hormone levels in prepubertal girls, a Cincinnati Children's research team has demonstrated that significant changes in hormone levels can be detected prior to clinically evident changes in puberty \u2014 a finding that could help explain why breast cancer risks vary among obese and non-obese women later in life. This longitudinal study examined relationships between adrenal and sex hormones in 252 peripubertal girls in Cincinnati who were recruited between 2004 and 2010. Participants entered the study between ages 6 and 7 and were followed from 30 months before to six months after the appearance of breast development. Detailed findings were published online July 16, 2014, in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. \"We noted radical differences between overweight and normal weight girls, and our data suggest that heavy girls are producing some of their circulating estrogens from their adipose tissue, rather than from their ovaries,\" says Frank Biro, MD, first author of the study. \"That finding is consistent with differing rates of breast cancer among postmenopausal women when comparing obese and non-obese.\" Gathering data on estradiol, estrone, androstenedione, serum concentrations required using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry, a newer and highly sensitive analytic approach. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and SHBG were measured through established methods. The research team reports that the average age of breast development in the study group was 8.78 years. Testing revealed that hormone concentrations of DHEA-S increased 30 to 18 months prior to breast development; androstenedione and estrone levels increased 12 and 18 months before onset of breast development; estradiol and T-serum concentrations increased while SHBG levels decreased six to 12 months before breast development. Heavier peripubertal girls had lower estradiol levels at puberty. These findings suggest a mechanism, especially in heavier girls, for pubertal changes without activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.Frank Biro, MDPrepubertal Hormone Levels Differ Sharply Between Overweight, Normal-Weight Girls 24 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION\"Our data suggest that heavy girls are producing some of their circulating estrogens from their adipose tissue, rather than from their ovaries.\" Serum hormone concentration of estradiol by BMI group relative to onset of puberty.

In effect, EoE turns out to develop from interplay of a patient's underlying genetic susceptibility to allergies and a tissue-specific process dictated by the molecular aspects of the CAPN14 gene, according to Marc Rothenberg, MD, PhD, Director of the Cincinnati Center for Eosinophilic Disorders and the Division of Allergy and Immunology. Rothenberg, and colleagues in the Divisions of Gastroenterology, Hepatol - ogy and Nutrition; Human Genetics; and the Center for the Genetics Autoimmune Etiology, probed millions of genetic variants in nearly 1,000 people with EoE and 9,000 people without EoE. They found several genetic linkages, with the strongest asso - ciations being at the CAPN14 and TSLP loci. The study was published online July 13, 2014, in the journal Nature Genetics. EoE is triggered by allergic sensitivity to certain foods and an accumulation of eosinophils, specialized immune cells, in the esophagus. Rothenberg and his team found that CAPN14, which encodes the enzyme calpain 14 in the esophagus, is dramatically upregulated when epithelial cells in the esopha - gus are exposed to IL-13, a known molecular activator of EoE. The CAPN14 gene is part of the esophageal disease process of EoE. CAPN14's upregulation, Rothenberg's team noted, occurs spot\" that encodes for an EoE-associat - ed genetic variant that regulates the binding of transcription factors to the upstream region of the CAPN14 gene.

The key was found in \u00b51 opioid receptor genetic variant A118G, which decreases the binding potential of the \u00b5-receptor in the brain, and therefore increases morphine requirement. Postoperative respiratory depression is the most serious adverse effect of opioids. Researchers believe genetics account for up to 30 percent of the variability in respiratory depression. The study, published online Sept. 30, 2014, in The Pharmacogenomics Journal , was led by Senthilkumar Sadhasivam, MD, MPH, and Vidya Chidambaran, MD, both of the Division of Anesthesia, and also involved researchers from the Division of Human Genetics. It was the first clinical study to show significant association of a functionally relevant polymorphism \u2014 A118G \u2014 of the opioid receptor gene in predicting MIRD susceptibility. The team analyzed 88 cases of adolescents who had undergone spine fusion for scoliosis, and found that in the first 48 hours after surgery, MIRD in patients with AA genotype was significantly higher. The findings could have wide implications because the variant is present in an estimated 11-17 percent of the Caucasian population. \"This translates to immediate clinical relevance for a large part of the population,\" Chidambaran says, \"as identifying genotype predicted risk of MIRD will facilitate safer individualized opioid dosing.\" The team also has recently reported additional associations of respiratory depression in children with novel variants of the gene FAAH, published in January 2015, and with ABCB1, published in April 2015. \"These findings show that multiple genes play a role in opioids' clinical responses,\" Sadhasivam says. \"As we identify more of these associations, the future of preoperative genetic risk signature stratification and personalizing postoperative pain management in children is promising.\" RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 60 Joint Appointment Faculty 2 Research Fellows 10 Research Students 5 Support Personnel 30 Direct Annual Grant Support $936,373 Direct Annual Industry Support $227,279 Peer Reviewed Publications 61 Chidambaran V, Mavi J, Esslinger H, Pili - penko V, LJ, Zhang K, Sadhasivam S.

The discovery of the biomarker VNN-1, reported April 21, 2014, in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology , provides a genetic basis for understanding why some children with asthma respond effectively to medicines that control underlying inflammation \u2014 and why other children do not. It also holds out hope that difficult-to-treat patients can be identified quickly, and that researchers can find better therapies for asthma, which affects seven million children in the U.S. Gurjit Khurana Hershey, MD, PhD, Director of Asthma Research, and her team collected and tested cells from the nasal passages of 57 children whose emergency room visits for acute asthma required hospitalization. From a list of 20,000 gene candidates, doctors singled out and tested one gene, vanin-1 or VNN1, as the primary target for their study. According to Hershey, expression of the VNN-1 gene helps discriminate between good and poor responders to corticosteroids. Laboratory tests showed that VNN-1 expression is required for inhaled corticosteroids to provide relief during an asthma attack. Children whose asthma did not respond well to corticosteroids exhibited a biochemical variation of VNN-1 that hindered its expression. Subsequent tests on laboratory mouse models of asthma suggested that targeting the VNN- 1 pathway therapeutically might be valuable for improving outcomes for difficult-to-treat patients.

Parents who participated in the behavior- and nutrition- focused sessions for six months learned about food records, mealtime behaviors, energy intake goals, snacking, directed praise of the child when eating, strategies for introducing new foods and other tactics to help their children meet their daily calorie needs and the specific enzyme/nutritional demands of CF , a chronic respiratory disease. The children's' food intake increased by 485 calories a day and met 140 percent of the dietary recommendations for an active preschool child, according to the May 4, 2015, study in JAMA Pediatrics . Children whose parents participated in the program also experienced increases in scores for height milestones, but not weight, according to the multi-center study led by Scott Powers, PhD, ABPP . The study, involving parents of 78 children from seven CF centers across the United States (including Cincinnati Children's), compared results from the behavior-nutritional intervention program against a control group of parents who received basic education about their children's nutritional and enzyme needs, respiratory control, growth milestones and child safety. \"Our most important findings are that clinical trials can be successfully executed in this age range across multiple centers, and that intervention has an impact on change in growth in this age group,\" says Powers. \"Our hope is that this type of evidence will become part of routine care and be incorporated into the new CF Foundation Preschool Care Guidelines to be used by CF centers in the U.S.\" Scott Powers, PhD, ABPPBehavioral Medicine RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 50 Joint Appointment Faculty 2 Research Fellows 11 Research Students 63 Support Personnel 62 Direct Annual Grant Support $7.2M Direct Annual Industry Support $19,250 Peer Reviewed Publications 114 Powers SW, Stark LJ, Chamberlin Filigno BS, Clancy JP.

CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 33Quantitative Model Provides Big Clues Into How Tiny Embryos Develop PUBLISHED MARCH 26, 2015 Nature Communications A biological-mathematical-genetic model called TEMS, or Tissue Expansion-Modulated Maternal Morphogen Scaling, is providing insights into one of nature's most intriguing genetic questions about scaling \u2014 the proportional growth of tissues, organs and structures from tiny ovaries, eggs and embryos. The model provides new insights into the delicate connections between ovarian tissue and ensuing embryonic development, and it can be applied to future research into birth defects. Developed by Biomedical Informatics scientist Jun Ma, PhD, and published March 26, 2015, in Nature Communications , the TEMS model was applied to fruit flies from development of the ovary through embryo. Ma's team focused on two developmental components: morphogens \u2014 proteins that form concentration gradients along the axis of an embryo and instruct the genes that control the proportional formation of body parts and organs; and ovary-active genes that produce messengers delivered to the egg for instructing the production of morphogen proteins in the embryo. His team studied front-to-back proportional scaling in embryos before organs start to develop, and found that the size of embryos was influenced by the quantity of initial tissue in the female's ovary, particularly the size of the ovarian egg chamber and the expansion of the copy numbers of an ovary- active gene called bicoid. \"The model provides a new perspective of embryonic development and contributes to our fundamental knowledge that may ultimately lead to an improved understanding of the basis of birth defects,\" says Ma. Of particular interest for future research, according to Ma, is the similarity between the peak number of bicoid gene copies in a female fly's nurse cells and the peak number of cell nuclei in the offspring blastoderm, or early-stage embryo. Aided by TEMS, Ma and his team hope to better understand, quantify and predict how life forms grow and develop, and to explore the interplay between biology and evolution.

The Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology partners with nearly all clinical and translational research programs at Cincinnati Children's to help them design studies and manage statistical analysis. Its faculty members also conduct direct studies to ensure and enhance the strength and innovation of research. In a recent example of this work, a study published in July 2014 in Contemporary Clinical Trials , explored findings from previous work on treatments for the inflammatory disorder familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). The study's authors included first author Bin Huang, PhD, from Biostatistics and Epidemiology; senior author Philip Hashkes, MD, from the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Israel; and colleagues from the Division of Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children's. The team compared study power and dropout rates among three types of crossover trial designs: traditional without early escape, early escape as a patient choice, and early escape based on accepted protocol. Both early-escape approaches were preferable to the traditional method. Researchers found that supporting exits based on patient choice reduced the dropout rate as much as 29 percent. However, the patient choice approach also increased patient exposure to the less effective treatment arm, which suggests that investigators must be mindful of the trade-offs between study design methods.

Diagnostic and risk criteria for HSCT-associated thrombotic microangiopathy: a study in children and young adults. Blood. 2014;124(4):645- 653.Sonata Jodele, MDPUBLISHED JULY 24, 2014 Blood After children undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT), one of the most severe complications they can develop is thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). This condition can trigger a cascade of events leading to potentially fatal multi-organ injury. Prompt clinical intervention can save lives, but only if TMA is detected in its earliest stages. In an important paper published July 24, 2014, in the journal Blood , a research team led by Sonata Jodele, MD, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immune Deficiency, reports developing an algorithm that can provide the information clinicians need to act. The researchers prospectively evaluated 100 HSCT recipients to track TMA incidence and outcomes. They found 39 children who met criteria for TMA. These children had a 43.6 percent non-relapse mortality rate at one year post- transplant, compared to 7.8 percent mortality among children who did not develop TMA. The team observed that those who died after TMA diagnosis had a greater degree of anemia, higher risk of proteinuria, and were more likely to have evidence of terminal complement activation. Elevated levels of sC5b-9 were present in nearly all subjects with TMA who died but in only about half of those who survived. In contrast, kidney dysfunction assessed by serum creatinine was a very late marker of TMA. The paper details a series of daily, twice weekly and weekly tests that can detect early TMA markers. Specifically, proteinuria >30 mg/dL as measured by routine dipstick and hypertension >95th percentile were the earliest signs of TMA, along with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). These data suggest that complement activation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of severe TMA after HSCT. The team recommends that patients with proteinuria and evidence of complement activation should be considered for treatment with eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that functions as a terminal complement inhibitor.Algorithm Enables Prompt Response to High-Risk Cases of Transplant-Associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) 38 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONA new algorithm offers a possible tool for intervening early to treat children who develop a severe complication following hematopoietic cell transplantation.

The G protein alpha subunit Galphas is a tumor suppressor in Sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma. Nat Med. 2014;20(9):1035-1042.PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 2014 Nature Medicine An international research team, led by Qing \"Richard\" Lu, PhD, scientific director of the Brain Tumor Center at Cincinnati Children's, has discovered a novel tumor suppressor gene that could help overcoming rapid drug resistance when treating pediatric brain cancer. The latest findings specifically address aggressive sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven medulloblastomas. However, the work may have wider impact. The team showed that Rolipram, a cellular cAMP-elevating agent and antidepressant approved for use in Europe and Japan, effectively inhibits tumor cell proliferation and progression in mice. The findings were published in September 2014 in Nature Medicine . The study included collaborators from nine medical centers in four countries. In healthy people, the GNAS gene encodes a Gs-alpha protein, which initiates a molecular signaling cascade that suppresses tumor growth. Mutations disrupting this pathway can lead to rapid cancer cell growth. Lu and colleagues discovered the gene's role while employing a genome-wide screen to analyze childhood brain tumor samples. In a line of mice bred to lack the GNAS gene, medulloblastomas shrank when given Rolipram. The researchers believe the drug restores the Gs-alpha pathway's tumor suppressing power by elevating levels of the signaling molecule cAMP . \"Many chemotherapies become ineffective as soon as the surface receptors they target change, but this drug may help to get inside the cells by targeting a signaling juncture downstream to overcome the drug resistance,\" Lu says. Rolipram is only one drug affecting one part of the Gs- alpha signaling pathway. Lu and colleagues are working to identify other genes and related markers along the pathway. It may be that other drugs acting at other points will prove to be even more effective.

Factor XIII Transglutami - nase Supports the Resolution of Mucosal Damage in Experimental Colitis. PLoS One. 2015;10(6):e0128113.PUBLISHED JUNE 22, 2015 PLOS ONE The thrombin-activated transglutaminase factor XIII (FXIII) plays an important supportive role in the repair of colitis-induced mucosal damage in mice, according to research led by Joseph Palumbo, MD, a scientist in the Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute. FXIII is best known as the enzyme that stabilizes fibrin clots. However, new findings published June 22, 2015, in PLOS ONE demonstrate that FXIII also plays a larger-than- expected role in tissue regeneration. \"Until our published report, the only direct evidence for a contribution of FXIII to tissue remodeling was for incisional skin wounds,\" Palumbo says. \"Our findings illustrate the potential to utilize FXIII to resolve a wider range of injuries.\" Palumbo, in collaboration with Novo Nordisk scientists Christina Andersson and Brian Lauritzen, evaluated how colitis-challenged mice responded when treated with recombinant human FXIII-A (rFXIII). They found that wildtype (WT) mice and mice genetically bred to lack the FXIII enzyme developed comparable mucosal damage when challenged with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis symptoms. However, the FXIII-deficient mice failed to resolve the damage after DSS was withdrawn. Treating mice with rFXIII significantly mitigated the clinical signs of colitis (e.g., weight loss, intestinal bleeding, diarrhea) while also largely resolving mucosal ulceration. Most strikingly, the benefit was not limited to FXIII-deficient animals. Control mice with normal FXIII gene expression also demonstrated a dramatic improvement in mucosal repair when treated with rFXIII following colitis challenge. Further research is needed to determine the ultimate clinical utility of FXIII in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the impact of this work may extend beyond IBD. \"For example, Matthew Flick in Experimental Hematology has published work detailing the contribution of FXIII to inflammatory arthritis pathogenesis, and Eric Mullins in Hematology has findings suggesting FXIII is linked to neuroinflammatory disease,\" Palumbo says. \"Furthermore, FXIII may play a fundamental role in cardiac tissue repair, another area of intense interest for our group.\"Joseph Palumbo, MDCancer & Blood Diseases Institute CANCER AND BLOOD DISEASES INSTITUTE RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 85 Joint Appointment Faculty 26 Research Fellows 54 Research Students 23 Support Personnel 341 Direct Annual Grant Support $16.6M Direct Annual Industry Support $1.1M Peer Reviewed Publications 209 42 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONThe factor a signicant role in mucosal tissue regeneration.

This new insight significantly improves predicting capacity for gene expression mechanisms for many disease- mechanism problems, and essentially all of eukaryotic biology. The study, led by Matthew Weirauch, PhD, a computational biologist in the Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, was published Sept. 11, 2014, in the journal Cell. The findings have enabled researchers who study any organism to begin to understand how genes are regulated on a global scale. For human disease, the study increases researchers' ability to understand the function of disease- associated genetic variants that fall in non-coding regions. It is estimated that approximately 90 percent of disease- associated variants are non-coding. In genomics, noncoding DNA sequences are components of an organism's DNA that do not encode protein sequences. \"Doubling our knowledge of human DNA sequence binding motifs essentially doubles our chance of figuring out which proteins these variants might affect the binding of,\" Weirauch says. The center's primary focus is the genesis of lupus and other immunological diseases, and to explore the mechanisms of disease through the complex interactions of genetics, the immune system and environmental factors such as stress, exercise and diet. Two findings of the study surprised researchers. \"First, that our scheme for mapping DNA sequence binding motifs across organisms based on protein similarity works for most protein families,\" says Weirauch. \"Second, the fact that we increased knowledge of these motifs so substantially across all of eukaryotic life, from less than one percent to almost 40 percent of all proteins.\"RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 11 Joint Appointment Faculty 3 Research Fellows 8 Research Students 12 Support Personnel 31 Direct Annual Grant Support $2.3M Direct Annual Industry Support $196,802 Peer Reviewed Publications 57 Matthew Weirauch, PhDNovel Mapping Approach for DNA Sequence Binding Motifs Sharply Expands Library of Genetic KnowledgeCenter for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology (CAGE) Weirauch MT, Yang A, Albu M, Cote AG, Montenegro-Montero A, Drewe P, Najafabadi HS, Lambert SA, Mann I, Cook K, Zheng H, Goity A, van Bakel H, Lozano JC, Galli M, Lewsey Huang transcrip - tion factor CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONThis gure is a close-up of the boxed region in the rst gure.

It is a far better system, says lead author Alexander Vinks, PharmD, PhD, Director of Clinical Pharmacology, than the traditional practice of dosing drugs for infants and neonates using a kilogram-to-milligram scale based on a child's weight \u2014 a scaled-down but inaccurate version of adult doses that are downsized and applied to tinier bodies. \"It's always been a tricky question, one that's very difficult to predict at any given age: how much of a drug to give to a two-week old infant vs. a year-and-a-half-old toddler,\" says Vinks. \"The moment a child is born, all these physiological systems kick in, but we haven't known the pace and maturation levels of various systems until we looked at data from various studies.\" Vinks and colleagues participated in a concentration- controlled clinical trial of sirolimus, a drug increasingly used to treat vascular abnormalities but not extensively studied in children. Researchers started a dose and measured sirolimus levels. Next, enzyme measurements reflective of each patient's liver enzyme CYP3A activity, known to metabolize drugs, were combined with other data, including the child's age, weight, gender, ethnicity, height, sirolimus concentrations, dosing regimens and other medications. Data from three studies were combined to create an algorithm \u2014 still being refined \u2014 to pinpoint accurate drug dosing levels. Findings appeared Feb. 4, 2015, in CPT: Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology . \"It's a very sophisticated way of using state-of-the-art techniques to tease out data for specific drug doses \u2014 a sophisticated way of personalized precision dosing,\" according to Vinks.

But researchers have been limited by the disease's non-specific spectrum of symptoms and treatment results that vary from patient to patient. The editors of the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine describe a finding by Hector Wong, MD, Director of the Division of Critical Care Medicine, as a new approach that \"might help shift this impasse for children with septic shock.\" Published Feb. 1, 2015, the study reports success at identifying subclasses of septic shock in individual patients based on gene expression patterns linked to their immune system responses and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. The RNA-quantifying gene expression method also has the potential to rapidly generate clinical data, possibly within 8 to 10 hours. This could become a valuable advantage for a disease that can progress from diagnosis to death in a matter of days or hours. Septic shock has a mortality rate of 40-60 percent in adults and 25 percent in children. Knowing a patient's specific disease subclass for septic shock can potentially aid therapeutic decisions. Corticosteroids \u2014 a standard protocol for septic shock treatment that works through the glucocorticoid receptor \u2014 can be life saving for many patients. However, this study shows that steroids are associated with a four-fold increase in mortality within one subclass of septic shock patients. Having a gene-based classification method for septic shock patients will help doctors quickly identify which patients should not receive steroid therapy, Wong says. Information from gene expression also holds hope of more personalized medicine approaches for treating septic shock. Doctors may one day be able to use the patient's own adaptive immune responses to treat the disease, or to link symptom-specific drugs to the patient's symptom-based subclass in hopes of a greater chance of survival, Wong says.Genetic Expression Method Allows Doctors to Rapidly Identify Subclasses of Septic Shock Hector Wong, MDCritical Care Medicine Wong HR, Cvijanovich NZ, Anas N, Allen GL, Thomas NJ, Bigham MT, Weiss SL, Fitzgerald J, Checchia PA, Meyer K, Shanley TP, Quasney M, Hall M, Gedeit R, Freishtat RJ, Nowak J, Shekhar RS, Gertz S, Dawson E, Howard K, Harmon K, Beckman E, Frank E, Lindsell CJ.

The July 2014 study, published in Cleft Palate- Craniofacial Journal , was the first designed solely to quantify how often these unerupted teeth are aligned incorrectly in the gums. The goal of the study is to help identify children who need early dental and orthodontic interventions. Researchers compared the images of 364 children who were born with a cleft lip or palate, and 364 kids who were not. Fifty-two children (14.3 percent) who were affected by a cleft condition also had transposed, missing or pegged teeth, compared to just one child (three-tenths of one percent) who did not. A tooth is considered transposed if it partially or fully occupies the space of an adjacent tooth. The study was led by senior author Howard Saal, MD, Director of Clinical Genetics, and first author Richard Campbell, DMD, MS, Director of Orthodontics. \"Transposed teeth may be related to the overall smaller size of the upper jaw in children with clefts, which leads to more crowding, but that's speculative at this point,\" says Campbell. \"Jaw size discrepancies are a fertile area for future research.\" Cleft lip and palate result from in utero malformations in which tissue fails to fuse, or connect. Corrective surgery is typically done when a child is nine months to two years old. Full panoramic radiograph images show all the developing teeth and jaws, unlike close-up bitewing radiographs used in cavity detection. Earlier studies referenced tooth transposition in children with clefts, but not the prevalence compared to kids who did not.

However, clinical trials in children are needed to resolve concerns about increased risk of infections and malignancy. So states a review study published online Feb. 26, 2015, in the journal Pediatric Dermatology authored by Kara Shah, MD, PhD, Director of the Division of Dermatology, and Fernanda Bellodi Schmidt, MD, an assistant professor in the division. Currently, there are no FDA-approved medications to treat more severe cases of pediatric psoriasis. Shah and Bellodi Schmidt reviewed the current literature of the use of systemic medications to treat pediatric psoriasis, including case reports, case series, and a large clinical trial involving the use of etanercept, a biopharmaceutical effective in treating autoimmune diseases by acting as a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor. Clinical trials have demonstrated that etanercept and several other drugs in its class have shown safety and effectiveness in treating other pediatric inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease and juvenile arthritis. Only etanercept has been formally studied in pediatric psoriasis, and currently only the European Union has approved its use for the treatment of psoriasis in children. \"Pediatric dermatologists strongly support clinical trials evaluating the comparative efficacy and risks of medications used for the treatment of psoriasis in children, in particular systemic medications,\" Shah says. Scientific concerns about this class of biologic response modifiers, which also includes adalimumab and infliximab, as well other biologic response modifiers such as ustekinumab, center on increased susceptibility to infection and increased risk of certain malignancies, particularly lymphoreticular malignancy. \"These risks appear low,\" says Shah, \"and must be weighed against the concerns inherent to a chronic disease such as psoriasis, especially when severe enough to warrant systemic therapy.\"RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 2 Research Fellows 1 Support Personnel 7 Direct Annual Industry Support $24,603 Peer Reviewed Publications 4 Bellodi Schmidt F, Shah KN. 52 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONOnly etanercept has been formally studied in children.Psoriasis, a chronic skin condition, varies in severity but pediatric dermatologists have long been challenged by the lack of biologic medications approved specically for severe cases in children. Psoriasis changes the life cycle of skin cells, prompting them to build up rapidly on the skin, forming thick scales. The resulting itchy, dry, red patches can be painful. In this study, researchers analyzed previous reports, case series and clinical-trial data that might one day lead to FDA approval of a drug that resolves concerns about infection-risk and malignancy.

Researchers Amie Duncan, PhD, and Somer Bishop, PhD, studied the daily living skills (DLS) of 417 autistic teens ages 10-17 with average intelligence (IQ of 85 or higher). Daily living skills include activities such as taking a shower, getting dressed, cooking, doing laundry, managing finances, and navigating the community. The researchers were surprised to find that more than half of these high-functioning autistic teens exhibited DLS abilities that were \"significantly below\" expectations based on their intellectual abilities. \"There is clearly a need to address the substantial gap between cognitive ability and actual performance in activities of daily living,\" says Duncan, whose study was published Dec. 15, 2014, in Autism . \"Addressing these skills prior to the transition to adulthood is crucial if we expect young adults to have the necessary skills to live independently.\" Interestingly, being older and having more social- communication impairments accounted for only 10 percent of the DLS deficit \u2014 a finding that raises hope that adolescents with high functioning ASD have the potential to acquire age- appropriate life skills regardless of the severity of their autism symptoms. Duncan and Bishop theorize that other factors are involved in autistic teens' abilities to acquire daily living skills; factors that include executive functioning or language capabilities, the number of siblings in the family, the emotional well-being of caregivers, socioeconomic status, race, availability of community and school support services, and involvement in extracurricular activities. Interventions that support the development of critical daily living skills may increase the likelihood that individuals with ASD can achieve positive outcomes in postsecondary education, employment, and independent living.

Thirty years later, James Wells, PhD, and fellow researchers with the Divisions of Developmental Biology and Endocrinology are using human pluripotent stem cells as building blocks to create functional, three-dimensional, architecturally complex stomach tissues in the laboratory. Their anatomical breakthrough will enable researchers to study stomach development and a wide range of diseases including peptic ulcer disease, cancer and diabetes \u2014 without resorting to Marshall's drastic solution. Until Wells' team's discovery, experimental models of human stomach tissue did not exist, and mouse stomachs and other animal tissues have not been ideal models for studying stomach diseases in humans. In a study published online Oct. 29, 2014, in Nature , Wells described how his team performed a series of manipulations of the growth environment to guide human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) \u2014 stem cells that can grow into any type of tissue \u2014 into forming tiny, pea-sized human stomachs, dubbed \"human gastric organoids\" (hGOs). In collaboration with colleague Yana Zavros, PhD, at the University of Cincinnati, Wells demonstrated the hGOs can be used to study how the bacteria H. pylori causes peptic ulcers and stomach cancer, as the team was able to observe cellular and tissue changes associated with the bacterial infection. The team's accomplishment represents the first time that researchers have produced a 3-D model of the human stomach. The team plans to use a similar approach to develop other \"mini-organs,\" including the lungs and esophagus.

Nature. 2015;517(7535):501-504 Some Antibodies Play 'Back-Up Defense' Against Kidney Disease in Mice PUBLISHED ONLINE NOV. 2, 2014 Nature Immune system researchers have long known that some antibodies are highly capable of identifying and disabling foreign substances inside the body \u2014 called antigens \u2014 by clumping them together and removing them from the body by activating complement and binding to antibody surface receptors, called FcgRs, on cells. In a Nov. 2, 2014, study published online in Nature , researchers led by Richard Strait, MD, have discovered that certain types of antibodies \u2014 even though they do not acti - vate, complement or interact strongly with activating antibody receptors \u2014 still play critical roles in clearing these antigens from the body and preventing disease. Strait's study, co-published with several other investigators including senior author and his mentor, Fred Finkelman, MD, Division of Immunobiology, looked specifically at kidney dis - ease associated with the interaction of antibodies with antigen in mice. In normal healthy mice, antigen exposure did not cause disease. However, in mice genetically deficient in IgG1, the most abundant subtype of antibody and roughly equiva - lent to human IgG4, antigen exposure resulted in developing a fatal kidney disease. The fatal kidney disease arose secondary to the occurrence of large and numerous cryoglobulin complexes made from the interaction between the antigen and the antibody subtype IgG3. These complexes proceeded to obstruct blood flow to the kidney, eventually causing organ failure and death. Cryoglobulins also are responsible for kidney damage and other tissue injury in hepatitis C and other diseases. Providing IgG1 back to IgG1-deficient mice prevented cryoglobulin development and saved the mice. Of extreme interest is that the IgG1 performed this disease prevention independent of the usual involvement of the complement system and the antibody receptors.Richard Strait, MDEmergency Medicine 58 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONThis gure in IgG2a or IgG2b intravenously in increased amounts differentially prevents kidney disease (as measured by proteinuria) invoked by antigen plus antigen-specic IgG3 immune complex precipitation in the capillaries of the glomeruli.Emergency MedicineUrine Protein (0-4) 0 0.5 1**** * * ****DAY 1 2 44 3 2 1 0+# Non-IgG3 dose (mg)Urine Protein (0-4) 0 0.5 Non-IgG3 dose (mg)1+**DAY 2 # 2 44 3 2 1 0* * ** + ++IgG3 alone +IgG1 +IgG2a +IgG2b CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 59RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 17 Joint Appointment Faculty 3 Support Personnel 27 Direct Annual Grant Support $1.4M Direct Annual Industry Support $113,816 Peer Reviewed Publications 37 de Bruin C, Mericq V, Andrew SF, van Duyvenvoorde HA, Verkaik NS, Losekoot M, Porollo A, Garcia H, Kuang Y, Hanson D, Clayton P, van Gent DC, Wit JM, Hwa V, Dauber A. An XRCC4 splice mutation associated with severe short stature, gonadal failure, meta Defective Gene Linked to Severe Growth and Metabolic Disorder PUBLISHED MARCH 5, 2015 The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism An emerging technology called whole exome sequencing \u2014 which enables researchers to sequence all 20,000 of the body's genes at once rather than one gene at a time \u2014 has helped identify a defective gene that causes a rare condition marked by a spectrum of growth and metabolic disorders in children. The defective XRCC4 gene, identified by Andrew Dauber, MD, MMSc, co-leader of the newly formed Cincinnati Center for Growth Disorders, includes a splice mutation that deletes 23 amino acids from the gene, interfering with the body's ability to repair DNA damage. XRCC4 was discovered by examining DNA from a Chilean brother and sister, both of whom were diagnosed with severe short statue, gonadal failure and early-onset metabolic syndromes that resulted in a gastrointestinal tumor in the sister, diabetes and other multi-system complications. The 39-year-old brother is still alive; the sister died at 36. Findings based on their tissues were published online March 5, 2015, in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism . \"The body is constantly repairing damage that occurs to DNA, and this gene is part of the DNA damage repair process,\" says Dauber. \"We were able to show in skin cells from one of the patients that the cells were not able to execute the DNA damage repair process correctly.\" The finding creates deeper understanding of a spectrum of complications associated with the defective gene, and creates direct links among patient genome sequencing, translational biology in the lab, patient diagnosis and genetic counseling, he says. \"Our patients are among the oldest in the world to be identified, and because of this new understanding, the hope is that we'll be better able to counsel them and their families about a variety of other issues that they might face, including predisposition to tumors, insulin resistance and other complications.\" Andrew Dauber, MD, MScEndocrinology 60 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION\"The body is constantly repairing damage that occurs to DNA, and this gene is part of the DNA damage repair process.\"Growth charts (top) of two siblings from a rural family in Chile exhibit a novel syndrome consisting of severe short stature, microcephaly, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, early-onset metabolic syndrome, and possible increased tumor susceptibility.

Robert Ammerman, PhD, ABBP , and colleagues studied the long-term progress of 93 post-partum mothers half of whom received 15 in-home visits from a licensed CBT therapist to treat depression. Before the study, mothers were screened for childhood histories of emotional or physical abuse. Although women with histories of physical abuse responded more positively to CBT compared to those who did not receive therapy, those with the most severe histories of childhood abuse had comparatively lower CBT outcomes than those with less-severe abusive experiences. At-risk depressed mothers with histories of emotional abuse, likewise, were able to develop stronger social networks as a result of CBT. Study findings were detailed online Nov. 13, 2014, in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence . \"Exposure to high levels of trauma changes the way the brain works, how you react to stress and how you control your emotions,\" says Ammerman, Scientific Director of ECS. \"We are going to have to augment our depression treatment to address more directly any trauma experiences in order to help these women do even better in their lives.\" Colleague and co-author Judith Van Ginkel, PhD, President of ECS, says the study's findings indicate that public health funds spent on in-home visits for at-risk mothers also need to address underlying, abuse-related trauma in order for depression treatments to be most effective.

PUBLISHED ONLINE JULY 8, 2014 Journal of Clinical Investigation Gastroenterologists have known that several genes and types of bacteria are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in children, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And while more than 160 areas of the genome have been identified as containing risk factors for IBD, no definite cause has been found. Lee Denson, MD, Director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, and his team have narrowed the focus to the ileum as the primary inductive site for IBD, and they have identified specific bacteria activated by ileal cells, depending on the IBD diagnosis. Their findings appeared July 8, 2014, in the Journal of Clinical Investigation . By comparing ileal tissues from children with IBD and healthy tissues, they found that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients had higher levels of Proteobacteria and an increase in the activity of the DUOX2 gene. Some patients with Crohn's disease also had lower levels of Firmicutes bacteria and lower activity of the APOA1 gene. More than 80,000 children in the U.S. have been diagnosed with IBD, and the number is climbing. By identifying a microbial and gene expression \"signature\" for the disease, researchers are now better positioned to understand IBD, diagnose it more accurately and develop targeted therapies, Denson says. Of special interest, he notes, is new knowledge about the role of the APOA1 gene, which is linked to changes in about 500 other genes. Patients with the APOA1 profile, regardless of the type of therapy or length of treatment, tend to have less successful outcomes. \"By characterizing this profile, we have potentially identified a new pathway to target to benefit kids who have not done well with other types of treatments,\" Denson says.Novel Genetic, Bacterial Signature for IBD Suggests a Target for Developing New Therapies Lee Denson, MDGastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition 64 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONMore than 80,000 children in the U.S. have been diagnosed with IBD, and the number is climbing.These illustrations show the progressive induction of an ileal DUOX2 host gene coexpression signature in association with expansion of Proteobacteria taxa across multiple forms of inflammatory bowel disease.

The critical role played by housing agency data is identified in a November 2014 Health Affairs study by Andrew Beck, MD, MPH, of the Division of General and Community Pediatrics, and the Virginia-based Project HOPE: The People- to-People Health Foundation, Inc. Geo-mapping tools helped Beck and his team identify a link between the density of housing code violations \u2014 reports that logged the presence of mold or cockroaches, both of which are known asthma triggers \u2014 and asthma morbidity, based on asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Independent of poverty, code violation density explained 22 percent of the variation in asthma utilization rates across the areas studied. Children who had been hospitalized for asthma had an 84 percent increased chance of returning to the emergency department or being rehospitalized within 12 months if they lived in areas with the highest rates of housing code violations, compared to children living in low-density areas for violations. Beck's study involved 4,355 children, ages 1-16, who were hospitalized or received emergency room treatment for asthma at Cincinnati Children's over nearly four years. \"Integrating housing and health data could highlight at- risk areas and patients for targeted interventions,\" says Beck. Housing data also could be used to study health disparities that occur in small geographic areas, identify medically at-risk areas for programs to improve housing conditions, incorporate into patients' electronic health records for improved clinical care, or inform health systems' strategies in support of preventive medicine and accountable care.

Efficient Transplacental Antibody Transfer From Mother to Fetus Crucial to Infant Health PUBLISHED NOV. 15, 2014 The Journal of Infectious Diseases An international collaboration led by Mark Steinhoff, MD, Director of the Division of Global Child Health, is advancing scientific understanding of how to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most important viral cause of infant pneumonia, though there is limited information from tropical regions. The study, published Nov. 15, 2014, in The Journal of Infectious Diseases , is crucial research because, globally, pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood mortality. The research team, which included colleagues in Seattle, WA, Rochester, NY, and Dhaka, Bangladesh, examined the role of maternal serum antibody in protecting infants from RSV. The team found that efficient transplacental transfer of RSV-specific antibody from mother to the fetus was documented in mother-infant pairs in Asia, and that higher cord-blood antibody titers were associated with infant protection from serologic RSV infection. Findings were based on serial serum samples collected from mother-infant pairs in Bangladesh, from the third trimester of pregnancy to 72 weeks postpartum. They tested these using an RSV antibody microneutralization assay, and defined serologic infection as a four-fold increase in antibody titer (the highest dilution factor at which a positive reading is yielded). Maternal antibody half-life was calculated using infant antibody titers from birth to 20 weeks. Researchers found that the ratio of infant cord blood to maternal serum RSV antibody titers in 149 mother-infant pairs was 1.01, and that there was a clear association between higher cord blood RSV antibody titers and lower risk of infant serologic infection. In addition to this major initiative in battling pneumonia in Bangladesh, Global Child Health also works to assess the disease risks and increase the availability of childhood vaccines for pneumococcal and influenza viruses in other countries with limited resources, including India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Nepal. Mark Steinhoff, MDGlobal Child Health 68 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONIn a study examining the role of transplacental antibody transfer in infant health, these titer testing images show how mean maternal Ab titers in the third trimester were correlated with titers at birth and week 72 of the postpartum period (R = 0.68 and R = 0.47, respectively). The top charts compare the mother's antibody titer to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in the third trimester (left) and at birth.

The condition can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, with a 5-year mortality rate exceeding 70 percent. To date, no medications have proven effective against RCM, which has left heart transplantation as the sole definitive treatment option. Now, fresh clues for finding new therapeutic targets are emerging thanks to a study led by Enkhsaikhan Purevjav, MD, PhD, a former researcher with the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children's who recently moved to the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Purevjav and former research fellow Anne-Cecile Huby, PhD, report that mutations in the myopalladin (MYPN) gene cause diverse cardiomyopathic phenotypes within a critical \"final common pathway.\" These mutations could explain why ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers are ineffective in patients with RCM. Their findings were published Dec. 30, 2014, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology . The study involved developing \"knock-in\" mice to carry mutations of the murine Mypn gene that would be homologous to the human MYPN-Q529X mutation. At six weeks, signs of restrictive physiology (RP) were detected in the mice carrying the mutation. At 12 weeks, the mice showed signs of impaired diastolic filling of the left ventricle, decreased T-wave duration, and other RCM symptoms. \"From these data, we hypothesize that the RCM phenotype results from persistence of dysfunctional truncated MypnQ526X protein and consequent multiple pathological 'hits,' \" Purevjav says. MYPN is one of several genes that appear to be involved in RCM. These findings suggest that further studies on time- dependent expression changes in CARP , MLP , DES, and ERK1/2 proteins in patients with RCM may provide useful information for discovering diagnostic and therapeutic targets.MYPN Mutations Affect Medication Effectiveness for Children with Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Huby AC, Mendsaikhan U, Takagi K, Martherus R, Wansapura J, Gong N, Osinska H, James JF, Kramer K, Saito K, Robbins J, Khuchua Z, Towbin JA, Purevjav E.

Some of the most complex heart defects occur in children born with heterotaxy syndrome, in which abdominal organs form on the opposite side of the body. The cardiac lesions that result, which are almost always multiple, can vary widely in severity and potential outcome. An analysis led by David Morales, MD, and colleagues, published April 23, 2015, in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery is the first to provide national-level data on the mortality risks that certain patient populations face when receiving TAPVC repairs. The study examined 261 operations for TAPVC repair in 258 patients from 65 medical centers. Overall, mortality was 38 percent. Heterotaxy patients undergoing TAPVC repair and requiring postcardiotomy ECMO had still higher operative mortality rates. The findings suggest that early outcomes of TAPVC repair are significantly worse when patients with heterotaxy are in high-risk subgroups such as those who have functionally univentricular physiology. \"It is clear that TAPVC heterotaxy patients are very rare and present with extremely complicated anatomy and physiology that varies with patients, and therefore their care has to be individualized,\" Morales says. \"However, there are centers that have achieved higher levels of success treating these patients such as ours. The key next steps will be to understand and share best patient management practices, so that through education they can be spread throughout the country to improve outcomes for all of these children.\" Khan MS, Bryant R, 3rd, Kim SH, Hill KD, Jacobs JP, Jacobs ML, Pasquali SK, Morales DL.

CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 73PUBLISHED ONLINE JULY 13, 2014 Genes and Development A new scientist at Cincinnati Children's is beginning to unlock the genetic secrets of muscle cell fusion, an advance that could have extensive implications for health. While working as a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas, Doug Millay, PhD, and his mentor found the only muscle-specific protein known to be essential for fusion of embryonic and adult myoblasts. In a paper published in 2013 in Nature , they dubbed the gene \"myomaker.\" Then in a more recent paper in Genes and Development , the team showed that myomaker also is necessary for normal adult muscle cell regeneration. Their work shows that myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors induce myomaker expression in satellite cells during acute and chronic muscle regeneration. Moreover, genetic deletion of myomaker in adult satellite cells completely abolishes muscle regeneration, resulting in severe muscle destruction after injury. The ability of myomaker to promote fusion to adult muscle fibers and muscle regeneration suggests opportunities to enhance muscle repair through myomaker-directed cell-cell fusion. In mice, the myomaker gene can be expressed in non- muscle cells, which then allows these cells to fuse to skeletal muscle. This implies that myomaker might be useful as a delivery vehicle for future therapies to address muscle loss in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cancer, AIDS, and COPD. \"In all of these conditions, restoring muscle cell growth may likely do even more than impact quality of life,\" Millay says. \"It could also slow the progression of the disease itself.\" Millay is one of two scientists at Cincinnati Children's to be named Pew Scholars in 2015. He is continuing his work to more fully understand the machinery of muscle cell development.

Family-Activated Medical Emergency Team Model Demonstrates Wisdom of Loved Ones PUBLISHED DEC. 14, 2014 BMJ Quality and Safety Every children's hospital could benefit from a family- activated Medical Emergency Team, (MET) based on results of a seven-year study showing that parents and family members of hospitalized children are capable of identifying complications and medical emergencies that require immediate intervention. The 4.5-year study of the MET program at Cincinnati Children's found that parents did not overuse a system that empowers them to notify an on-site, multi-disciplinary team if they feel their child's condition is worsening (high fever, breathing difficulties, worsening abdominal pain) or if they feel hospital staff are not responding to their concerns. Parents made an average of 1.2 calls a month (2.9 percent of the total) to the hospital's MET team; 24 percent of which resulted in children being moved to the intensive care unit (ICU). Staff-initiated calls (97 percent of the total) to the MET resulted in 60 percent of children being transferred to ICU. The study, published Dec. 14, 2014, in BMJ Quality and Safety , is accompanied by an editorial by a British father whose son's infection-caused death shortly after birth was linked to the UK hospital staff's inattentiveness to the parents' concerns. He advocates the formation of MET teams in pediatric hospitals worldwide because of the study's positive findings. Cincinnati Children's adopted the MET program in 2007, supported by in-room posters that inform parents when, why and how to active the team. Lead author Patrick Brady, MD, MSc, attending physician with the Division of Hospital Medicine, says the study clearly shows some patient needs would have been missed without family-initiated alerts. He urges hospitals to devise their own MET strategies to leverage family expertise. \"Given the growing evidence of modest cost and potential benefits, we advocate for testing and adaptation of family-activated METs in all contexts,\" Brady says.

Am J Hum Genet. 2015;96(5):765-774.PUBLISHED APRIL 23, 2015 American Journal of Human Genetics A Cincinnati geneticist's exploration of rare cranioskeletal malformations and abnormal limbs in three patients worldwide has led to the discovery of a dysfunctional gene as the culprit and a name for the syndrome \u2014 acrofacial dysostosis, Cincinnati Type. K. Nicole Weaver, MD, a geneticist with the Division of Human Genetics, said the severity of a Cincinnati patient's craniofacial abnormalities and discovery of a suspicious gene led her on a worldwide search for answers for the child's family. A German colleague scoured a large database of patients with undiagnosed craniofacial anomalies and identified two additional patients with a defective copy of the same gene, POLR1A, which is involved in ribosome biogenesis. Ribosomes play an essential role in the process of synthesizing proteins. A Missouri genetics colleague studied zebrafish with absent POLR1A expression, and the fish developed skull, facial, jaw and limb abnormalities similar to those in the children. Discovering similar cranioskeletal abnormalities in zebrafish lacking expression of POLR1A provided \"pretty strong evidence that dysfunction of this gene could cause these problems in a human,\" says Weaver, whose findings were published online April 23, 2015, in the American Journal of Human Genetics . The defective POLR1A gene, the team found, resulted in a deficiency of neural-crest-derived skeletal precursor cells that led to the craniofacial anomalies. \"It's unclear why the dysfunction of this ribosome gene gene affects only certain parts of the body,\" she says. Follow- up research will try to reproduce the anomalies in mice as a way to learn more about the role of ribosome malfunction in human development. \"For this patient, it was really important to be able to tell the family why this abnormality happened, that it wasn't inherited and that it likely would not happen again in another child,\" Weaver says. \"And the patient is doing really, really well.\"K.

Children diagnosed with AMLs with 11q23 translocations have experienced especially poor outcomes. However, a new approach based on silencing targeted microRNAs that was developed by a Cincinnati Children's research team led by H. Leighton Grimes, PhD, has shown intriguing early success in mouse models. MicroRNAs have long been thought to play an important role in oncogenesis, but so far, converting this concept into therapeutics has been slow. Grimes and colleagues found one potential solution by exploiting an ancient competition between GFI1 and HOX transcription factors, which both act as leukemia-initiating \"gatekeeper\" pathways. As the team studied the competing transcription factors, they found two microRNA that appeared to play important roles in AML relapse. The team went on to test antagomir treatment as a tool to silence the targeted microRNA. \"Therapeutic inhibition of microRNA-21 and microRNA-196b inhibited in vitro leukemic colony forming activity and depleted in vivo leukemia-initiating cell activity of HOX-based leukemias, which led to leukemia-free survival in a murine AML model and delayed disease onset in xenograft models,\" Grimes and co-authors wrote. The study establishes microRNA as functional effectors of endogenous HOXA9 and HOX-based leukemia oncoproteins. At one level, this means the research world now has a mouse model that can serve effectively as an in vivo platform to test RNA-based cancer therapies. At another level, it means children who develop notoriously hard-to-treat forms of AML may have increased hope for longer-term survival. \"Overall, our studies provide a strong rationale to develop microRNA antagonists for clinical use in AML,\" Grimes says.Targeting MicroRNA Emerges as Potential Weapon Against Acute Myelogenous Leukemia RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 19 Research Fellows 18 Research Students 19 Support Personnel 29 Direct Annual Grant Support $3.8M Direct Annual Industry Support $78,897 Peer Reviewed Publications 49 Velu CS, Chaubey A, Phelan JD, Horman SR, Wunderlich M, Guzman ML, Jegga AG, Zeleznik-le J, Mulloy JC, Cancelas BJ, G, B, Grimes HL.

The causes of premature birth and many other pregnancy complications are not completely known, but maternal infection is an important contributor, says senior author Sing Sing Way, MD, PhD, Division of Infectious Diseases. When infection strikes, maternal immune cells can \"overreact\" and attack the placenta as if it were a foreign invader. Way's study, published March 9, 2015, in The Journal of Clinical Investigation , identifies a pathway that could reduce these harmful overreactions. \"It might seem counterintuitive to prevent maternal immune cells from optimally penetrating into tissues,\" says Way. \"But restricting harmful immune cells' access to developmentally delicate placental tissue represents a highly innovative therapeutic strategy.\" The research team, led by Way and first author Vandana Chaturvedi, PhD, infected pregnant mice with Listeria monocytogenes , a bacterium commonly found in food supplies that causes invasive infection in pregnant women. It is often fatal to the fetus. Mice and human share this susceptibility. The researchers found that specialized subsets of first-responder immune cells \u2014 neutrophils and macrophages \u2014 rapidly infiltrate the placenta, producing high levels of a chemoattractant protein, CXCL9, which attracts harmful maternal T cells to attack genetically foreign placental-fetal tissue. The finding is significant because placental cells are not programmed to express chemoattractant proteins like CXCL9. The team found neutralizing CXCL9 activity by blocking its receptor on T cells efficiently protects against fetal injury after prenatal Listeria infections.Sing Sing Way, MD, PhDInfectious Diseases 82 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION\"Restricting harmful immune cells' access to developmentally delicate placental tissue represents a highly innovative therapeutic strategy.\"Histological analysis of the placentas recovered from female mice during allogeneic pregnancies sired by ovalbumin expressing transgenic male mice showing no infection control compared with L. monocytogenes infection after H&E staining, along with anti-CD90.1 the low-magnication elds indicate the source of decidual tissue harvested for analysis by flow cytometry. Myo = myometrium; Lab = labyrinth; Cause of Lapsed Nursing Care in Neonatal ICUs PUBLISHED ONLINE NOV. 27, 2014 Journal of Advanced Nursing Researchers examining nursing care lapses in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), including missed rounds, found that the most commonly cited reasons were frequent interruptions and urgent situations involving other patients. The lapses themselves were wide-ranging, including oral care for ventilated infants, educating and involving parents in care, and oral feedings. The least common lapses were hand hygiene, safety and physical assessment, and medication administration. The study, first published online Nov. 27, 2014, in the Journal of Advanced Nursing , achieved significant national attention for calling attention to nursing care quality in NICUs. The team was led by Heather Tubbs-Cooley, PhD, RN, a faculty member in Research in Patient Services with a secondary appointment with the James M. Anderson Center for Health Systems Excellence. The study focused on the frequency of nurse-reported missed care, and nurses' reports of factors contributing to missed care on their last shift worked. While previous studies highlighted the frequency of missed nursing care in adult settings, there was little or no such information on incidents in NICUs. Using a cross-sectional web-based survey, researchers took a random sample of certified neonatal ICU nurses in seven states. Descriptive statistics constituted the primary analytic approach. The team concluded that system factors might have contributed to missed care. The most frequent reasons nurses cited were: frequent interruptions (73 percent), urgent patient situations (66 percent) and an unexpected rise in patient volume and/or acuity on the unit (61 percent). Approximately half of respondents reported that an inadequate number of nurses and missing equipment/supplies were reasons for missed care. Tubbs-Cooley and colleagues are analyzing data from a separate longitudinal study in one NICU to examine relationships between nurse workload, specific instances of missed care, and the occurrence of adverse events.

Living in an adverse, unsafe, or unstable environment can lead to the release of stress hormones throughout the body and developing brain of a child. If a child does not have the resources to effectively cope with this stress, the prolonged release of these hormones can have a toxic impact. This \"toxic stress\" can cause harmful physiological changes and damage to the regions of the brain essential for memory, learning, and behavior. These changes can alter a child's capacity to learn and reason, to develop healthy attachments and behaviors, and to navigate social relationships. A child may also adopt risky behaviors to help them cope with the stress that may compromise their health. Childhood adversity has been strongly associated with an extensive list of health problems in adulthood. The Mayerson Center is teaming up with Biostatistics and Epidemiology to design and conduct studies examining the biological processes of how childhood adversity disrupts normal brain development, the impact of parental adverse childhood experiences on child development, and the prevention, detection, and early intervention for adversity in families. The Mayerson Center has partnered with local pediatricians to begin adversity screening and brief interventions in primary care practices to identify and address social risk factors in families.

Proximal tubule epithelial cells internalize albumin by receptor-mediated endocytosis and undergo apoptosis programmed cell death when exposed to too much albumin, the primary protein in the filtrate. A team led by Elif Erkan, MD, MS, in the Division of Nephrology, has identified an interaction between receptors and proteins in the proximal tubule that support albumin endocytosis and cell survival. The link involves protein kinase B (Akt), a pivotal protein involved in cell survival, megalin- cubilin complex receptor and the endocytic adaptor disabled-2 (Dab2). Detailed findings appeared online Sept. 24, 2014, in the American Journal of Physiology - Renal Physiology .

In Akt1 and Akt2 knock-out mice, the location of Dab2 is shifted from the cell membrane to the perinuclear area of the proximal tubule indicating the role of Akt in trafficking of Dab2. Erkan says the highlight of the work is the discovery of the link between the endocytic pathway and cell survival/ cell death. \"Because Akt mediates albumin endocytosis, its expression is down-regulated in tubular epithelial cells in kidney disease, leading to apoptosis\" she says. \"If we can figure out a way to up-regulate Akt in tubular epithelial cells, perhaps we can promote cell survival and prevent progression in glomerular diseases.\" Erkan and her team are continuing to study the link between Akt and Dab2 in mice. Additional research may identify other potential targets or additional regulating roles for Akt in a search for novel pharmaceutical agents to reduce kidney damage.

Findings appeared online Oct. 29, 2014, in Neurology . The study used electronic monitoring devices to track adherence patterns and seizure patterns in 109 children. The researchers found that patients fell into four distinct adherence groups: severe early non-adherence (9 percent), variable non-adherence (15 percent), moderate non-adherence (37 percent) and high adherence (39 percent). Children with epilepsy also fell into two distinct seizure groups: high or low seizure probability. Overall, children whose adherence patterns changed significantly had the worse seizure outcomes. Children in the variable non-adherence group were more likely to be in the high seizure probability group, even after accounting for important medical characteristics such as seizure type and brain abnormalities. Their drug adherence started at 71 percent, dropped to 32 percent and then improved to 58 percent by the end of the study \u2014 a variability rate that put them at high risk for ongoing seizures. \"What was previously unrecognized,\" Modi says, \"is that monitoring and addressing drug adherence is a highly important, modifiable variable that can impact long-term seizure outcome.\" This new understanding of the role of drug adherence \"empowers the family to really contribute to the child's outcome in a way that no one previously understood,\" says co-author Tracy Glauser, MD, Director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at Cincinnati Children's. \"Now,\" Modi says, \"we can say with more confidence to families, 'Our job is to give you the best medications and treatments for your child's particular epilepsy diagnosis, and your job is to take the medications.' \" RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 43 Joint Appointment Faculty 3 Research Fellows 5 Research Students 45 Support Personnel 35 Direct Annual Grant Support $3.6M Direct Annual Industry Support $1,818,692 Peer Reviewed Publications 105 Modi AC, Wu Tracy Glauser, MDNeurology 90 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONNeurology This new understanding of the role of drug adherence empowers the family to really contribute to the child's outcome in a way that no one previously understood.These gures show four distinct adherence patterns among children with pediatric epilepsy (shown here) and two distinct seizure patterns.

J Neurosurg Pediatr. 2015;15(1):26-33.Novel Surgical Protocol Helps Eliminate Seizures for Some Children With TSC- Related Epilepsy PUBLISHED JANUARY 2015 Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics Some children with a form of epilepsy that previously made them poor candidates for surgery are now able to live without seizures, experience drastically reduced seizure episodes and symptoms, or take fewer anti-seizure medications as the result of a novel pre-surgical evaluation protocol developed by researchers in the Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery Program at Cincinnati Children's. A research team led by Francesco Mangano, DO, FACS, FACOS, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery, studied 37 children who developed epilepsy as a result of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder in which non-malignant tumors form in different organs, including the brain. More than 80 percent of children with TSC develop epilepsy that involves multi-focal brain abnormalities that vary from child to child. Their epilepsy symptoms vary as well. The study, thought to be the largest single-center study in this pediatric epilepsy population, appeared in the January 2015 issue of the Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics . Pre-surgery evaluations relied on non-invasive and invasive brain mapping to identify the origin of seizure patterns in each patient. Neurosurgeons then decided which types of resective surgery to pursue \u2014 craniotomy to remove tuberous tissue, lobar resections, and even hemispherectomy in some cases. After five years, 56 percent of the children were seizure- free, and 87 percent had far fewer seizures and significantly less severe seizures, based on a scale developed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). \"In those children who were not seizure-free, we were able to decrease the number of anti-epileptic drugs needed to continue to control their disease, and we were able to reduce their medication frequencies and doses to improve their side effect profiles,\" Mangano says.Francesco Mangano, DO, FACSNeurosurgery 92 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONNeurosurgeons at Cincinnati Children's employed a novel surgical protocol to help a 5-year-old girl with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) who developed multiple types of seizures.

Among several diagnostic scans, FDG-PET showed multiple focal areas of decreased metabolism (image C). SPM imaging revealed a prominent area of hypometabolism involving the left frontal, temporal, and anterior parietal lobes (image G). Subdural grids and interhemispheric strips were placed for invasive monitoring (Image M) in preparation for a right occipital lobectomy.

The influence of light Light-Bulb Moment About Body Temperature Regulation PUBLISHED APRIL 20, 2015 Current Biology Researchers have long known that human body temperature rises when people are exposed to light during the night. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that cause such temperature changes could advance the study of sleep disorders, seasonal affective disorders and temperature regulation. A study published in April 2015 in Current Biology reports finding important clues about these mechanisms in a most-unusual place: the temperature sensitivities of the tiny, cold-blooded fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster . A research team led by Fumika Hamada, PhD, Division of Ophthalmology, found that Drosophila exhibit light- dependent temperature preference (LDTP) in which the flies prefer a one-degree higher temperature in light than in dark. Because the flies are cold-blooded, their body temperature is also higher in light. The team uncovered the molecular mechanisms that control LDTP in flies, and theorize that acute light on temperature regulation may be conserved evolutionarily between flies and humans. \"Light affects many physiological responses, but the underlying mechanisms of it are unclear,\" Hamada says. The team also found a well-known circadian clock molecule \u2014 pigment dispersing factor receptor \u2014 in subsets of the circadian clock cells that control the flies' LDTP . The result suggests a connection between light and circadian clock neurons. Given that LDTP occurs irrespective of the state of the circadian rhythms, the research provides new insights into how circadian clock mechanisms impact light and temperature regulation. Heat generation is different between humans and flies, but the light/temperature connection has similarities. Eventually, this line of research could benefit people who work night shifts and are exposed to light in nighttime. \"Long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease,\" Hamada says. \"This evening light exposure increases body temperature, which causes abnormal circadian rhythmicity.\"Fumika Hamada, PhDOphthalmology 94 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION The two gures here show how acute light positively influences temperature preference in cold- blooded Drosophila , commonly known as fruit flies.

Novel radiographic feature classication of knee osteochondritis dissecans: a multicenter reliability study. Am. J. Sports Med . 2015;43(2):303-309.Orthopaedics PUBLISHED FEBRUARY 2015 The American Journal of Sports Medicine Pediatric orthopaedic surgeons around the country remain baffled by a rare condition called osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), a degenerative cartilage disorder that strikes the knees of active, athletic teenagers. The surgeons teleconference frequently and meet several times a year to share information about their rare cases to better understand a condition with no known cause, and no proven best treatment. Their collaborative team, Research in OsteoChondritis of the Knee (ROCK) Group, has cleared one hurdle by reaching baseline agreement on the key anatomical features that mark the condition. Results of the team's first Cincinnati- led, multi-center study appeared in the February 2015 issue of The American Journal of Sports Medicine . In the ROCK study, seven orthopaedic specialists rated X-rays of 45 different knees for nine or more specific OCD characteristics. The study showed highly reliable agreement among the doctors on features such as growth plate maturity, condylar width and lesion size, and the ability to differentiate medial and lateral lesions in the knee. Other characteristics were less reliable for identifying OCD. \"We all hate osteochondritis dissecans because it's so nebulous and so debilitating,\" according to Eric Wall, MD, study coordinator and Director of Orthopaedic Sports Medicine. Aided by new data, doctors will now focus on how specific OCD features correlate to treatment outcomes, Wall says. With treatment failure rates of 30 percent, some OCD- diagnosed adolescents must drastically reduce physical activities for up to two years as cartilage recovers, and others can develop early onset degenerative arthritis. Affected knee tissue, Wall says, \"looks like a Cincinnati road after a hard winter, with a big deep pothole in the knee cartilage.

The research team presented new findings from an ongoing research effort at the Triological Society Combined Sections Meeting in San Diego in January 2015. One article based on the presented findings has been accepted for publication in The Laryngoscope , while another has been submitted to the journal Otolaryngology \u2014 Head & Neck Surgery . In the initial, smaller study, Stacey Ishman, MD, MPH, led a team that examined 324 decisions on 58 patients made at clinics and care conferences over a one-week period. Subspecialists explained the basis of their decisions, which were then classified into 10 categories. The findings: only 34 percent of decisions were evidence-based, while 59 percent were non-evidence-based and 7 percent were based on parental preference. Providers were able to cite specific studies for less than 20 percent of their decisions. In a companion study for The Laryngoscope , the team analyzed these gaps over a two-month period. That study of 507 decisions found that the proportion of non-evidence- based decisions actually increased two percentage points from the shorter study, while parental-based decisions dropped by two percentage points. The most common non-evidence-based decisions analyzed included the timing and appropriate subspecialty clinic follow-up location (38 percent), as well as indications for overnight-sleep studies (11 percent), especially in children at high-risk for persistent OSA such as those with Down syndrome or obesity. Additional gaps included the likelihood of OSA improvement from weight loss and the effectiveness of sleep surgical procedures.

This bile acid treatment \u2014 when given to children \u2014 tricks the liver into thinking it is producing enough of its own healthy bile acid so that it shuts down production of defective bile acids that lead to liver disease. Now, Heubi and Setchell have identified another liver enzyme irregularity called an amidation defect, in which the liver produces too much unconjugated cholic acid because the amino acids glycine or taurine cannot conjugate it effectively. Normally, cholic acid dissolves fats and helps the body excrete cholesterol. Heubi and Setchell identified five children with the amidation defect, all of whom showed mutations in the BAAT gene and exhibited failure to grow, vitamin absorption deficiencies or choleostasis. After treatment of up to 92 months with glycocholic acid (GCA), the patients were able to absorb the fat-soluble vitamins D-2 and tocopherol, showed improvement in growth, and experienced no side effects. This is the sixth of 17 known liver enzyme defects that Heubi and Setchell have identified, and they are working on testing and funding for development of a GCA drug. Their work appeared online Dec. 23, 2014, in Hepatology . \"All of these defects manifest as fatal forms of liver disease if they're not diagnosed, and there is no other form of liver disease you can reverse like this,\" Setchell says. \"This is lifelong therapy for all these kids.

In an Oct. 19, 2014, study in Nature Medicine , Mi- chael Helmrath, MD, MS, Division of Pediatric General and Thoracic Surgery, reported his team had generated human intestinal organoids (HIOs) by manipulating either human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs). Implanted into mice and connected to the kidney for blood flow, the HIOs developed specialized intestinal epithe - lial and stem cells, enzymes, and vascular structures of the intestines. They also demonstrated basic digestive functions. \"The ability to regrow an organ is now possible, and it's so impressive how the cells themselves know how to do this,\" says Helmrath. \"These studies support the concept that patient-specific cells can be used to grow intestine, and they provide a new way to study the many diseases and condi - tions that can cause intestinal failure, from genetic disorders appearing at birth to conditions that strike later in life, such as cancer and Crohn's disease. These studies also advance the longer-term goal of growing tissues that can replace damaged human intestine.\" The ability to grow intestines from a patient's own cells also has broad implications for organ transplantation, post-surgical responses, accelerated drug development (by bypassing animal tests), and developing personalized medicine protocols for patients, depending on how their tissues respond to certain drugs or treatments.

PLoS Genet . 2014;10(9):e1004656.PUBLISHED SEPT. 25, 2014 PLOS Genetics Prostate cancer continues to be the most common malignancy diagnosed in American men and the second leading cause of male cancer mortality. Tanya Kalin, MD, PhD, leads a research team at Cincinnati Children's that seeks to identify the direct role of several transcription factors (Foxm1, Foxf1, Foxf2, SPDEF) in prostate cancer. The team's latest findings, published Sept. 25, 2014, in PLOS Genetics , explain how SPDEF transcription factor expression changes during prostate carcinogenesis, which suggests that new treatments could be developed that target Foxm1 via SPDEF dependent pathways. \"Our data demonstrate that SPDEF functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancers by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation via disruption of an auto-regulatory element in the Foxm1 promoter,\" Kalin says. \"It is possible that the loss of SPDEF causes increased expression of oncogenic Foxm1, accelerating tumor cell proliferation and leading to poor outcome in prostate cancer patients.\" Until now, researchers lacked useful transgenic mouse models to study the role of SPDEF in prostate cancer. Kalin and colleagues generated mice that either lacked or over-expressed SPDEF function. The mice revealed that loss of SPDEF increased cancer progression and tumor cell proliferation, whereas over-expression inhibited carcinogenesis and reduced tumor cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro . Specifically, over-expression of SPDEF inhibited RNA and protein levels of Foxm1, a transcription factor critical for tumor cell proliferation, and reduced expression of Foxm1 target genes, including inverse correlation between SPDEF and Foxm1 levels was found in human prostate cancers, with the two-gene signature of low SPDEF and high Foxm1 predicting poor survival.

Bruce Trapnell, MD, and Takuji Suzuki, MD, PhD, discovered hPAP at Cincinnati Children's and first reported it in 2008. Children with hPAP have mutations in the genes of GM-CSF receptor alpha or beta (CSFR2RA or CSFR2RB). These mutations reduce the ability of alveolar macrophages to remove used surfactant from the lungs, which can lead to respiratory failure. The only current treatment is repeated, invasive whole-lung lavage. In a recent study published in Nature , Suzuki and Trapnell report that macrophage transplantation (involving normal or gene-corrected cells) fully reversed the disease in mice bred to mimic hPAP . The treatment also prevented disease-specific mortality for at least one year. \"These are significant findings with potential implications beyond the treatment of a rare lung disease,\" says Trapnell, senior author, and a researcher in the Translational Pulmonary Science Center at Cincinnati Children's. \"Our findings support the feasibility of pulmonary macrophage transplantation as the first specific therapy for children with hPAP .\" The research team utilized mice with the homologous CSFR2RB gene that mimics hPAP knocked out. The team then used a viral vector to deliver a correct version of CSFR2RB to abnormal alveolar macrophages taken from the animals. The gene-corrected cells were returned to the mice by direct instillation into the lungs. Since publication, the researchers have begun the pre- clinical studies needed to prepare for human clinical trials.

Jeffrey Whitsett, MD, Co-Director of the Perinatal Institute, and a team of pulmonary biology researchers have shown that airway epithelial cells orchestrate immune responses after birth that influence subsequent allergic inflammation, leading to asthma. Specifically, the researchers found that the genes SPDEF and FOXA3, which control mucus production and goblet cell differentiation, program pulmonary immune responses early in life and are sufficient and required to induce asthma. Goblet cells secrete the major components of mucus. The SDPEF and FOXA3 genes, expressed only in airway epithelial cells, control inflammatory responses to allergens and infections, programming subsequent asthma-like responses. Whitsett's study, which measured immune system responses in the lungs of neonatal mice, appeared May 4, 2015, in The Journal of Clinical Investigation . It concludes that exposure to commensal and pathogenic microbes and antigens influences goblet cells in the airways that determine the acquisition of immune responses after birth, responses that are likely to have long-term effects on the patterning of subsequent immune and inflammatory responses of the lung, leading to asthma. \"Inhibition of mucus cell hyperactivity induced by SPDEF following lung infections or exposure to allergies,\" says Whitsett, \"provides a novel, therapeutic approach for treatment and prevention of chronic airway diseases associated with excess mucus, including asthma and cystic fibrosis, common causes of severe lung disease in children.\" Jeffrey Whitsett, MDTwo Genes Expressed in Airway Epithelial Cells Play Important Roles in the Development of Asthma Perinatal Institute THE PERINATAL INSTITUTE RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 60 Joint Appointment Faculty 1 Research Fellows 14 Research Students 14 Support Personnel 95 Direct Annual Grant Support $10.5M Direct Annual Industry Support $167,672 Peer Reviewed Publications 134 110 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONPerinatal Institute This confocal microscope image shows airway goblet cells and mucus accumulation in the airways of mice caused by expression of FOXA3 and SPDEF.

Online prob - lem-solving therapy after traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial. Pediatrics. 2015;135(2):e487-495.PUBLISHED MAY 18, 2015 Pediatrics Children and teens who experience traumatic brain injuries (TBI) often struggle with everyday tasks, school performance, jobs and community interactions \u2014 and their families also struggle to help them recover and rehabilitate. The only study to examine the long-term impact of family intervention programs finds that online sessions can result in long-term improvements in child functioning, particularly among families of lower socioeconomic status (SES). The study, led by Shari Wade, PhD, Director of Research in the Division of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, appeared May 18, 2015, in Pediatrics . Five centers enlisted 132 TBI teens ages 12-17. Sixty- five were randomly assigned to Counselor-Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS), a six-month, web-based intervention program in which four licensed therapists used web training and follow-up video conference sessions using Skype to train teens and their families in problem-solving, communication and self-regulation techniques. Another 66 teens were assigned to an Internet Resource Comparison (IRC) control group, which involved self-guided, web-based information and resources that families were encouraged to explore at least one hour a week. Both groups were tracked for 18 months. Although children of lower SES typically have poorer outcomes following brain injury, findings from this study suggests that online problem solving may be especially beneficial for this population. Differences in functioning between the CAPS and IFC families were not evident until 12 months after sessions ended, \"suggesting that the effects of problem-solving therapy delivered soon after injury may successfully generalize to the youth's functioning in everyday settings over time.\" CAPS teens also performed better on tasks outside the home, including at work. \"Given that adolescents with TBI are at risk of deficits in school performance and may have difficulty sustaining employment as they transition into adulthood, improving school and community functioning may be particularly important for long-term success,\" said Wade.

However, talpid \u00b2 has been of limited utility because researchers did not know what caused the mutation \u2014 until now. The solution came from the lab of Samantha Brugmann, PhD, which cracked the genetic, molecular and cellular code on how and why the talpid \u00b2 mutation occurs. Their findings appeared in the August 2014 issue of Development . Using whole-genome sequencing, a group of researchers from Cincinnati Children's and four other universities traced the talpid \u00b2 mutation to a ciliary gene called C2CD3, which causes a significant reduction in the number of cells that extend a primary cilium. The team also identified molecular disruptions that occur in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, leading to the facial and limb abnormalities associated with talpid \u00b2. \"Recently, the study of primary cilia has exploded because of the identification of a large class of human diseases called ciliopathies,\" Brugmann says. \"Now that we know what gene causes this defect in chickens \u2014 as well as the molecular and cellular pathway that is involved \u2014 we have an avian model for human disease.\" An accompanying Development editorial, titled \"talpid \u00b2: A Solved,\" states: \"Identification of the talpid \u00b2 locus has been long awaited, and although there is still much to understand about how C2CD3 regulates cilia formation and function, and SHH signaling, these data provide an important step in this direction.\" This prediction has come to fruition as the group, in a subsequent publication (Schock et al., 2015, in Disease Models & Mechanisms ), has shown that talpid \u00b2 is a bona fide model for the human ciliopathy called Oral-facial-digital Syndrome.

J Psychiatr Res . 2014;59:220-228..Alcoholism Drug May Help Treat Fragile X Syndrome-Related Autism Spectrum Disorder PUBLISHED ONLINE AUG. 19, 2014 Journal of Psychiatric Research A drug originally approved for treating alcoholism is showing promise in modulating the underlying neurochemistry of a type of autism linked to Fragile X Syndrome, an inherited genetic disorder. Craig Erickson, MD, and his team have discovered that acamprosate, a drug that may modulate glutamate and gaba- aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in the brain, normalizes the expression of proteins in the blood known to be dysregulated in people with Fragile X Syndrome-related autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and it produces improved behavior and social interaction skills in some of them. Nearly half of children with Fragile X syndrome exhibit a type of autism marked by development disabilities, distinctive facial characteristics, social anxiety, communication deficiencies or repetitive movement behaviors. They also tend to have higher plasma levels of a derivative of amyloid- b precursor protein, called secreted APPa (sAPPa), as well as excessive levels of glutamate and insufficient levels of GABA, two abundant and critical neurotransmitters. In collaboration with researchers at the Indiana University School of Medicine, Erickson reported on initial results of the positive impact of acamprosate on APP levels in blood. Now Erickson is collaborating with Rush Medical Center in Chicago on a 48-participant clinical trial of the drug, in which researchers will analyze blood levels for sAPPa, eye-tracking data, social interactions, and other ASD behavioral markers. \"Acamprosate is really a targeted treatment based on the physiology and neurochemistry of the disease,\" Erickson says. \"We're trying to regulate and normalize some of the signaling pathways by use of this drug.\" Tests on mice, he notes, produce similar molecular neurochemistry results. Plasma protein derivative analysis, Erickson says, holds promise as a biomarker for ASD-targeted treatment, and acamprosate may have \"novel pharmacodynamics properties\" to reduce amyloid- b precursor proteins in children with this type of ASD.

J Biol Chem. 2015;290(18):11246-11257.Understanding of Cystic Fibrosis Leads to Novel Findings About Drug-Induced Diarrhea PUBLISHED MAY 1, 2015 The Journal of Biological Chemistry Research by Anjaparavanda Naren, PhD, into the underlying mechanisms of cystic fibrosis \u2014 a disease marked by impaired fluid secretions in the lung \u2014 is providing insights into why 7 percent of patients develop diarrhea as an adverse effect of certain prescription drugs. Naren is the Thomas Boat Chair in Cystic Fibrosis Research and Co-Director, Cystic Fibrosis Research Center. He and a Pulmonary Medicine research team that included Chang Suk Moon, PhD, Kavisha Arora, PhD, and Sunitha Yarlagadda have identified an interplay resistance protein (MRP4) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduct regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel on epithelial cells that retains and releases fluids. In cystic fibrosis, the channel underperforms, keeping fluids in the lungs; in diarrhea, the channel over-performs and releases fluids into the intestines and bowel. \"Until now, we did not have a good model system to study intestinal biopsies, because the tissue samples are so small,\" Naren explains. His team deployed stem-cell technologies to create intestinal organoids, called \"enteroids,\" from tissue biopsies from mice. The enteroids were exposed in the laboratory to two drugs and monitored for excessive secretions \u2014 the symptoms of diarrhea. The enteroids also were monitored to determine how they responded to anti- diarrhea treatments. The study in The Journal of Biological Chemistry involved irinotecan (a colon cancer drug) and AZT, an antiviral drug for HIV/AIDS. The drugs inhibited MRP4, producing compartmentalized accumulation of cAMP (3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) in close proximity to the CFTR, activating the channel function and causing excessive fluid secretion and diarrhea. \"Our findings have broad implications and may help to identify therapeutic targets for ameliorating medication- induced diarrheas,\" Naren says. \"Enteroids allow us to use stem-cell techniques to develop a better index of chloride channel function, giving us the kinds of tools to move into personalized medicine.\" Anjaparavanda Naren, PhDPulmonary Medicine 118 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATION\"Enteroids allow us to use stem-cell techniques to develop a better index of chloride channel function, giving us the kinds of tools to move into personalized medicine.\"A study led by Cincinnati Children's researchers was featured on the May 2015 cover of The Journal of Biological Chemistry .

Researchers were quick to caution that direct causation remains unresolved, and additional studies were needed to determine anesthesia's precise molecular effects on several functions, including language comprehension, in children who underwent surgery before age 4. The study, published online June 8, 2015, in Pediatrics , garnered wide-ranging media coverage, including pieces in Scientific American , U.S. News and World Report and Anesthesiology News and coverage on NPR, CTV and Slate.com. Andreas Loepke, MD, PhD, of the Department of Anesthesia, was the lead author. Scott Holland, PhD, Director of the Pediatric Neuroimaging Research Consortium, led the Division of Radiology's contributions. This new knowledge could make it possible to develop mitigating strategies for what scientists describe as a potential dilemma for child health. \"We have to better understand to what extent anesthetics and other factors contribute to learning abnormalities in children before making drastic changes to our current practice, which by all measures has become very safe,\" Loepke says. In the study, researchers compared test scores of 53 healthy participants in a language development study (ages 5 to 18 years with no history of surgery) with those of 53 children in the same age range who had undergone surgery before age 4. The authors emphasized that average test scores for all 106 children were within population norms. Still, compared with children who had not undergone surgery, children exposed to anesthesia scored significantly lower in key areas that warrant additional examination. Loepke, Holland and Mekbib Altaye, PhD, Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, have submitted an application to the National Institutes of Health seeking funding for a follow up study to investigate more deeply the influence of early anesthesia exposure on brain development.

SCML2 establishes the male germline epigenome histone H2A ubiquitination. Dev Cell. 2015;32(5):574-588. Genomic Research Sheds Light on Possible Causes of Male Infertility PUBLISHED ONLINE FEB. 19, 2015 Developmental Cell Research at Cincinnati Children's has identified a critical determinant of the germline epigenome that has important implications for the genomics and evolution of the male germline. The study in the journal Developmental Cell advances research into the possible causes of male infertility, says senior author Satoshi Namekawa, PhD. Namekawa and colleagues found that genes commonly expressed in somatic lineages and spermatogenesis-progenitor cells undergo a repression in a genome-wide manner. This repression occurs in the late developmental stages of the male germline, the only lineage that ensures the perpetuation of genetic and epigenetic information across generations. The research team theorizes that this repression may, in turn, indirectly ensure activation of spermatogenesis-specific genes, an essential step for producing mature spermatozoa. Disruptions to this normal process may explain some forms of male infertility because this mechanism underlies activation of essential genes in spermatogenesis. The study identifies SCML2, a germline-specific subunit of a polycomb repressive complex 1 as the critical determinant of the germline epigenome. SCML2 establishes the unique epigenome of the germline through two distinct and antithetical mechanisms: SCML2 works with PRC1 to promote ubiquitination of histone H2A, a histone modification associated with gene repression, in the stem cell phase of spermatogenesis- progenitor cells. This process appears to mark somatic/ progenitor genes on autosomes for repression. At the same time, SCML2 also prevents ubiquitination of histone H2A on sex chromosomes during meiosis, thereby enabling unique epigenetic programming of sex chromosomes for male reproduction. The key finding was revealing essential mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis, which will lead to more focused exploration of how the mechanisms of reproduction operate.Satoshi Namekawa, PhDReproductive Sciences 122 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONThis illustration describes the distinct mechanisms followed by SMCL2 as it regulates histone H2A ubiquitination.

Am J Sports Med . 2014;42(7):1567-1573.PUBLISHED JULY 2014 The American Journal of Sports Medicine Young athletes who undergo ACL reconstructive knee surgery have a significantly higher rate of suffering a second ACL injury within two years. In addition, girls appear to face greater risk than boys for injuring their other ACL during that time. Findings of the study, published in July 2014 in The American Journal of Sports Medicine , could lead to improved post-operative care and intervention strategies. \"The incidence of repeat injury is much higher than once thought in young, active patients,\" says Mark Paterno, PhD, Scientific Director in the Division of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy and Associate Professor in the Division of Sports Medicine. \"Essentially, this highlights the concern that our current outcome after ACL reconstruction is sub-optimal. With this knowledge, it is imperative that we challenge the current management after ACL injuries.\" Thirty areas of patient care at Cincinnati Children's work within Patient Services, ranging from OT/PT and ambulatory services to audiology and outpatient clinics. In the field of sports medicine, numerous studies have examined the prevalence of second ACL injuries within the first year of post-reconstruction, but none have reported the incidence normalized to athletic exposure further out. The team found that, overall, 29.5 percent of these young athletes suffered a second ACL injury within two years of returning to sports. The proportion of athletes reinjuring the same ACL during this period of time was similar between girls and boys. However, 23.7 percent of girls with such an injury later injured the other ACL, compared to just 10.5 percent of boys.

PUBLISHED ONLINE MAY 16, 2014 Annals of Rheumatic Diseases Children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) can now be treated safely and effectively with tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor drug, according to a 58-center global study coordinated and co- designed at Cincinnati Children's. An extended report on the results of the Phase III CHERISH study was first published online May 16, 2014, in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has used positive results of this clinical trial to expand the indication for tocilizumab, which had previously been approved to treat moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis and systemic JIA. Tocilizumab is the first new treatment for polyarticular JIA in five years, and significantly enhances options for treating joint pain and swelling in children with JIA. Hermine Brunner, MD, MSc, MB, Director of the Division of Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children's and Scientific Director of the multinational Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group (PRCSG), led the study. Daniel Lovell, MD, MPH, Chairman of the PRCSG and Clinical Director of Rheumatology, also participated in study design and coordination. The CHERISH study showed that 89 percent of children treated with tocilizumab markedly improved within 16 weeks, including significantly fewer JIA exacerbations or flares. The study enrolled 188 patients with active polyarticular JIA, ages 2-17 years. All received monthly infusions of tocilizumab for 16 weeks. Those whose symptoms improved then joined a 24-week, double-blind phase in which half the patients received a placebo and half continued on the drug. Arthritis symptoms flared in 48 percent of placebo patients versus 26 percent in the tocilizumab group. Side effects, primarily upper respiratory infections, occurred in 8.5 percent of participants. \"The overall pediatric safety profile of tocilizumab was consistent with that seen in adults with rheumatoid arthritis,\" Brunner says. \"Most importantly, tocilizumab provides sustained and clinically meaningful improvement of polyarticular JIA.\"Tocilizumab Shown to be Safe and Effective as Novel Treatment for Children With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 10 Joint Appointment Faculty 2 Research Students 5 Support Personnel 16 Direct Annual Grant Support $1.4M Direct Annual Industry Support $839,732 Peer Reviewed Publications 27Hermine MD, MSc, MBRheumatology 126 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONDivision ofRheumatology These four charts, published in the Annals of Rheumatic Diseases, show: (A) Improvement of JIA as measured by the American College of Rheumatology Criteria for improvement at JIA- ACR30/50/70/90 levels after open- label treatment with tocilizumab for 16 weeks; (B) Improvements in the individual components contributing to the measurement of JIA-ACR level response of children with polyarticular JIA treated with tocilizumab; (C) Treatment responses considering dosing regimens suggested by pre-trial pharmacokinetic modeling; and (D) Time to JIA-ACR30 flare during the double-blinded phase of the trial when patients with at least a JIA ACR30 response by week 16 were randomized to continue tocilizumab or newly receive placebo.JIA-ACR30 response JIA-ACR50 response JIA-ACR70 response response% of responders (N=188) 0 4 Week8 12 16100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0JIA-ACR30/50/70/90% change from baseline 0 4 Week8 12 160 -10 -20 -30 -40 -50 -60 -70 -80JIA-ACR CORE COMPONENTSNumber of joints with active arthritis Number of joints with limitations of movement Assessment of patient overall well-being VAS (0-100) Physician global assessment of disease activity VAS (0-100) Chaq-DI ESR% of patients with response at the end of part 1 (week 16) JIA-ACR30 JIA-ACR50 JIA-ACR70 JIA-ACR90100 80 60 10 mg/kg 8 mg/kg 30 kg 1 29 Days85 57 141 113 197 1691.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 All placebo [tocilizumab] (n) All tocilizumab [tocilizumab] (n)81 66 58 51 45 43 11 0 82 75 67 66 61 61 28 0All placebo [tocilizumab] All tocilizumab [tocilizumab] A B C D CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 127RESEARCH AND TRAINING DETAILS Faculty 7 Joint Appointment Faculty 1 Support Personnel 7 Direct Annual Grant Support $291,407 Direct Annual Industry Support $164,967 Peer Reviewed Publications 36 PUBLISHED JANUARY 2014 Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy Can woodpeckers and big horn sheep help solve the troubling and often debilitating problem of football concussions? Does a city's altitude affect the likelihood that its NFL team members will experience concussions? Are better- padded helmets or stricter NFL rules on helmet-to-helmet contact actually solving football's concussion problems? Yes, yes, and no, according to a study by Gregory Myer, PhD, FACSM, Director of Sports Medicine Research at Cincinnati Children's. Myer led a team of scientists who analyzed 300 concussions sustained by 284 professional football players during the 2012 and 2013 NFL seasons. Their findings, published in the Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy , include: \"Brain slosh,\" the rapid acceleration and deceleration of the brain inside the skull, is the suspected common cause of concussions - not direct impact to the head. Big horn sheep and woodpeckers, which routinely experience tremendous blows to the head at 10 and 20 times that, respectively, of a head-to-head tackle, appear to be protected from brain injury via modulations of their intracranial blood volume that help make a tighter fit inside their skulls prior to impact. This finding could influence concussion prevention strategies that will better protect human athletes' brains. Players in cities at the highest altitudes \u2014 Phoenix, Atlanta, Buffalo, Charlotte, Denver, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Minneapolis and Pittsburgh \u2014 have a combined 30 percent lower odds of sustaining a concussion relative to players in the NFL 's other 23 cities at 644 feet at sea level or lower. At higher altitudes, cerebral blood flow increases, which the research team hypothesized, might influence the brain to fit tighter inside the skull \u2014 like a bubble wrapping the brain. \"If we're going to solve this problem, we have to figure out how to protect the brain from the inside out,\" Myer says. \"That's why we think we might be on the leading edge of something that could influence a paradigm shift in concussion-prevention strategies.\"Football Helmets Do Not Necessarily Protect Against AM, Thomas SM, Sucharew H, Khoury JC.

The study, published online in July 2014 in the journal Development , included senior author Steven Potter, PhD, Division of Developmental Biology; Joo-Seop Park, PhD, Division of Urology, and research associate Eunah Chung. The study reports that during organogenesis in mice, single cells often express genes related to several developmental pathways \u2014 not just a single, predetermined fate. This finding provides powerful evidence of a concept called multilineage priming. During early development, cells partially activate multiple programs, priming them for their next step in development. This is followed by a combination of gene repressions, which turn off the genes associated with various possible lineages until each cell settles upon its ultimate state. \"This was a surprise,\" Potter says. \"We had expected that cells would just gradually fire up the correct program as they assumed their differentiated state.\" The team also was surprised to see an abundance of genes with partially degraded noncoding RNA. All these findings are changing our understanding of early organ development, which in turn could lead to new ways to treat or prevent disease. \"As is common in science, this new data raises new questions,\" Potter says. \"How do cells decide which programs to test and how do they make their final decisions?

Individual RV cells express markers of multiple differentiated cell types. Genes normally expressed in differentiated Podocytes (Pod), proximal tubules (PT), distal tubules (DT) and parietal epithelial cells (PEC) are shown on the left. Red represents high expression and green low expression. The numbers represent approximate log, median baseline and normalized expression values. This image shows unexpected Wnt4 expression in progenitor cells that appear to not yet be induced. Wnt4 is normally thought to be expressed only in cells that are induced. Researchers found that during organogenesis in mice, single cells often express genes related to numerous developmental pathways, which bolsters evidence of a concept called multilineage priming.

Say you wanted to know how certain genes operated in kidney development. You would, as S. Steven Potter, PhD, Director of the Gene Ex - pression Core at Cincinnati Children's, explains, take a developing murine kidney sample, \"mush it up,\" amplify its RNA , then see which genes were being expressed. The results were not unlike the early glimps - es astronomers had of far off objects in space. The blurry evidence shows something important out there, but with unclear images it was im -possible to understand their origins or how they developed. Similarly, in analyzing kidney devel - opment using early methods of gene analysis, scientists like Potter could see particular genes expressed in the mush, but could not tell precise - ly which cells expressed the genes. Such imperfect, noisy data makes it difficult to understand the normal development of com - plex organs with multiple cells types, and even harder to detect the points when development goes wrong and leads to congenital malforma - tions and disease. About five years ago, much better data be - gan to emerge when it became possible for Gene Expression Core scientists to sequence one cell at a time. However, the work was incredibly labor intensive\u2014imagine a project that begins with pipetting one cell at a time into tubes in order to analyze 23,000 genes. Then two years ago, Cincinnati Children's purchased a $150,000 Fluidigm C1 System, which uses microfluidic chips to sequence up to 96 individual cells, simultaneously. This leap in The Gene Expression Core is beta testing a chip that can analzye 800 cells at a time. Accelerating Single-Cell AnalysisGene Expression Core 134 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONGene Expression Core capability has supported a wave of important basic science projects at Cincinnati Children's including: A study led by Potter, recently published in Development , shows that developing kidney stem cells do not differentiate ac - cording to a single fated path, but prepare for a variety of developmental paths be - fore committing to one. A project led by Potter and James Wells, PhD, Director of Basic Research in the Division of Endocrinology, is developing novel markers for cells in the human gut, defining their complete gene expression profiles for the first time. Their work is beginning to uncover intermediate states between stem cells and differentiated cells. Jeffrey Whitsett, PhD, Co-Direc - tor of Perinatal Institute, through the NIH-funded LungMap project, is using single cell analysis to better understand gene expressions that drive lung cell for - mation.And more automation is coming. The Gene Expression Core is beta testing a new microfluidic chip for Fluidigm, which puts Cincinnati Children's among the first to be able to analyze 800 individual cells at a time. Now, as researchers here analyze cell de - velopment across the kidneys, lungs, gut and immune system, they can obtain a staggering - ly detailed series of snapshots along specific developmental pathways. It is like moving from taking months to find the fuzzy dot of a single far-off galaxy to taking just a few days to see a collection of stars and planets within. With such dra - matically improved maps, there is no telling what discoveries the next wave of explorers will make. Two years ago, Cincinnati Children's purchased a $150,000 Fluidigm C1 System that can sequence up to 96 individual cells, simultaneously. This leap in capability has supported a wave of important basic science projects. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 135By knocking in a gene here, knocking out a gene there, Yueh-Chiang Hu, PhD, and colleagues are opening the door to a medical revolution that may soon produce made-to- order treatments for genetic diseases. Hu directs the Transgenic Animal and Genome Editing (TAGE) Core at Cincinnati Children's, where a team of scientists use a new technology called CRISPR to rapidly produce gene-edited mice for research, and increasingly, for customized treatment. The TAGE core is among the first of its kind in the nation. Hu learned how to use CRISPR technology from one of its pioneers, while com - pleting a post-doctoral fellowship at the MIT-af - filiated Whitehead Institute. The technology allows editing, adding or removing any gene in a one-cell (fertilized egg) embryo, dramatically reducing the time it takes to produce biological models expressing specific gene combinations. \"CRISPR is changing the way we do genetic study. You can manipulate the genome in any cell type or organism you want at a previously unimaginable speed,\" Hu says. With CRISPR, mouse lines can be devel - oped in a matter of weeks instead of years, and costs have dropped from upwards of $25,000 to as low as $6,000. Since its inception, the core has created 60 new mouse lines, averaging one line a week. Made-to-Order Mice Transgenic Animal And Genome Editing ( TAGE ) Core Lab Ushers in a Research RevolutionTransgenic Animal and Genome Editing (TAGE) \"Usually it takes years to conrm novel genetic variants to be the cause of a disease, but now it is just a matter of few months.\" 136 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONThe TAGE Core is critical to Cincin - nati Children's success in bringing genomics to the bedside, says John Harley, MD, PhD, Director of the Center for Autoimmune Ge - nomics and Etiology. \"The facile ability to manipulate chromatin constitution in cells and whole animals opens powerful technol - ogies for genetic insight into normal physiol - ogy and the pathophysiology of virtually any disease state,\" Harley says. For knock-out mouse lines, in the past six months, 92 percent of mice developed by TAGE were born with the desired mutation. For more challenging knock-in mutations (inserting tags or changing nucleotides), about 50 percent of mice were born with the desired mutation. Already, TAGE is making a difference for children with rare genetic diseases. Earlier this year, clinical geneticist Taosheng Huang, MD, PhD, was treating three children who suffered a set of identical symptoms including ataxia and seizures. Huang screened the chil - dren and found that they shared an otherwise unknown gene mutation. Within two months, TAGE had devel - oped a line of mice with the children's disease, which has allowed the team to understand disease pathogenesis and test potential treat - ments. If an off-label treatment can be found, the core lab will have dramatically reduced the cost and time involved in diagnosing and treating a rare disease. \"Usually it takes years to confirm novel genetic variants to be the cause of a disease, but now it is just a matter of few months,\" Hu says. Yueh-Chiang Hu, PhD, and colleagues use CRISPR technology to \"edit\" mouse genomes by adding or removing genes, allowing mouse lines to be developed within weeks. Transgenic Animal and Genome Editing (TAGE) CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 137Gene therapy is one of the most exciting developments in modern medicine. Gene therapy also is one of the most complex capabilities for a medical center to build. Cincinnati Children's is one of the very few pediatric centers worldwide to successful - ly assemble every component needed to move this exciting new technology all the way from an intriguing idea to an actual tool for treating disease. The T ranslational Core Laboratory at Cin - cinnati Children's is something special. Here, a Viral Vector Core, Vector Production Facility, Hematopoietic Cell Processing Core, Cell Ma - nipulation Lab and T ranslational T rial Devel - opment and Support Lab (TTDSL) all work in concert to function much like a biopharmaceu - tical company. \"Other children's hospitals may have some of these facilities, but there are not any that have all of the resources in a single group of labora - tories,\" says Lilith Reeves, Translational Core Administrative Director. \"Our benefit is that we can help with most any part of moving cellular and molecular therapies from the researcher's lab through the manufacturing and regulatory steps, all the way into clinic. Then we can continue to do the follow-up on patients after treatment.\" Specializing in gene and cell therapies for rare diseases and cancer puts the Translational Core Labs right at the cutting edge of medical research, says Diana Nordling, Translational Core Director. The work happening within the Translational Core supports several Cincinnati Children's investigators as they move potential - ly breakthrough discoveries far beyond animal studies and into Phase I/II human clinical trials. The facility produced the carefully manufac - tured, strictly regulated products to be used for a Phase I/II gene therapy clinical trial for sickle cell disease, which is open to enrollment. Col - laborative work is underway with investigators for development of products to be used in new gene therapy treatments for thalassemia and he - reditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP). The facility also has served as a partner in multi-institutional projects, including the recent X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) gene therapy trial. That trial, which included Boston Children's, UCLA Children's Rare Asset: Complete In-House Production to Support Gene TherapyTranslational Core Laboratory 138 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONTranslational Core Laboratory and hospitals in Paris, London and Milan, earned a Distinguished Clinical Research Achievement Award for 2015 and was named one of the Top 10 Clinical Research Awards by the Clinical Research Forum. This shared facility includes 30 cross- trained researchers and specialists who pro - duce research-quality, pre-clinical and clin - ical-quality viral vectors, vector modified autologous cell products, along with normal donor hematological cell products. They con - duct translational development and process scale-up, translational trials assay support, clinical assay support, assay development, iPSC translation and characterization and more. The lab's key features include: Nine ISO-class clean rooms that meet U.S. and EU standards for pharmaceutical grade biologics and cellular-based therapies Compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Tissue Practic - es (GTP) A testing lab certified with the American College of Pathology and compliant with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CAP/CLIA) Three active Type V Drug Master Files with the FDA. FDA Registered GTP Facility The Translational Core takes on some of the early-stage drug development duties that pharmaceutical makers can be reluctant to perform for products with small potential markets. The core's structure allows a primary investigator to focus on the science while the laboratory team handles the scale-up, valida - tions, and quality oversight. \"In addition to performing the manu - facturing and testing, we also provide docu - mentation to support the required regulatory submissions,\" Reeves says. The 30 team members of our Translational Core Lab have supported projects ranging from a gene therapy clinical trial for sickle cell disease to a multi-center clinical trial to treat X-SCID. The team produces viral vectors and other cell products that meet strict U.S. and European standards. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 139140 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONThe productivity of our research faculty is enhanced by a wide variety of research support programs funded by Cincinnati Children's and the University of Cincinnati. We employ teams of experts who consult with investigators on grant writing, project planning, study design, regulatory compliance, intellectual property protection, and much more. This year, we feature three of these special programs.Support Services CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 141The Center for Clinical and Translational Science and T raining (CCTST) provided the investigational backbone that led to the FDA approval of two drugs for rare diseases that have eluded researchers for many years. The CCTST, based at Cincinnati Chil - dren's and led by Director James Heubi, MD, serves the University of Cincinnati and its Ac - ademic Health Center partners. Its two most significant accomplishments culminated with - in a three-month span early in 2015. An arduous 25-year process led to the March 17 FDA approval of Cholbam (cholic acid) for treatment of bile acid synthesis dis - orders due to single enzyme defects, condi - tions estimated to occur once in every 80,000 births. Spearheaded by Heubi and Kenneth Setchell, PhD, Director of the Clinical Mass Spectrometry Lab at Cincinnati Children's, clinical trials to establish the safety and effi - cacy of cholic acid therapy were based exclu -Teamwork Behind the Scenes Fuels Major Medical BreakthroughsCenter for Clinical and Translational Science and Training 142 CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S RESEARCH FOUNDATIONsively in the CCTST's Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC). As a result of this investigator-initiated \"bench to bedside\" drug development \u2014 from conceptualization to approval \u2014 a daily pill has replaced liver transplant as treatment for these conditions. Three months later, more major news arrived for the CCTST. Lymphangioleio - myomatosis (LAM) is a rare and frequently fatal lung disease of women, affecting only five people per million. It is characterized by smooth muscle infiltration and cystic destruc - tion of the pulmonary parenchyma. The safe - ty and efficacy of sirolimus (Rapamune) in the treatment of LAM was established by the multi-site MILES study, led by UC's Frank McCormack, MD. Locally, the trial was based in the CTRC, in collaboration with the Rare Lung Disease Consortium led by Bruce Trapnell, MD, MS, of the Division of Pulmonary Medicine. FDA approval was announced on May 28. Modern medical research is increasingly about \"team science.\" At Cincinnati Children's, the CCTST is a crucial element of making the goal of team science a functional reality. Consultants with the CCTST help investigators produce the most effective study designs and most competitive grant proposals.Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training The CCTST was established in 2005 to consult with investigators on research design, help them prepare large multi- institutional grants, and more. CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 143The road to the medical world market crosses the intersection of innovation and collaboration. The Center for Technology Commercializa - tion (CTC) identifies and protects innovative re - search and delivers them to the market through licensing and the creation of start-up companies. It also provides crucial funding for emerging projects and facilitates collaborations with exter - nal partners. In the past year, the CTC established three new research collaborations with leading indus - try partners to identify and advance discoveries towards the market where they can have the greatest impact on patient lives. These partner - ships combine Cincinnati Children's research strengths with the drug development and com - mercial capabilities of world-class pharmaceuti - cal and biotech companies. The collaborations were: Shire Research Alliance \u2014 a multi-year re - search collaboration designed to discover and develop novel therapies to treat rare diseases with Advancing Promising Discoveries to MarketCenter for Technology Commercialization \"Cincinnati Children's researchers discover dozens of health innovations every year.

Meanwhile, a smart sensing catheter conceived at Cincinnati Children's (above) and under early-stage development in Israel may make pediatric surgery safer. Our Center for Technology Commericalization provides the marketing know-how to improve the success of these and other collaborations with companies, including Shire, Alexion and GlaxoSmithKline. Center for Technology Commercialization CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 145In October 2014, pulmonologist Bruce Trapnell, MD, MS, and his collaborators published a groundbreaking report in the journal Nature , demonstrating that transplanting normal or gene-corrected macrophages into the lungs of mice with hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) was safe and well-tolerated. The team showed that a single administra - tion corrected the lung disease and secondary systemic manifestations, normalized disease-re - lated biomarkers, and prevented disease-specific mortality. This data advanced the future of medicine in which a patient's own cells will be corrected for their disease-causing mutation, reprogrammed and transplanted back into the patient \u2014 thus curing their disease. Translational team members within the Office for Clinical and Translational Research (OCTR) work alongside the basic scientists and clinicians to move these promising results into human studies and treatments. The office pro -The OCTR provides sponsors and investigators with comprehensive support services, research tools, personnel and facilities to support pediatric and adult clinical research studies.

During the Trapnell team's pre-clinical work, for instance, an OCTR team of trans - lational specialists concurrently began the exploration of the regulatory pathway for - ward to begin a treatment in humans based upon the mouse results. This team includes regulatory specialists with strong scientific backgrounds, FDA and IRB expertise and knowledge of clinical trials. As the work progresses toward first-in- human studies, OCTR experts will navigate the trial through the regulatory approval pro - cess, with the safety of all study participants as their foremost concern. Working closely with the Trapnell Lab, the center looks forward to the day on which Cincinnati Children's announces the cure has been found for PAP . With the 2015 grand opening of our Clinical Sciences Pavilion, families have a state-of-the-art facility to serve their needs as they participate in clinical trials. The OCTR helps clinical trials get off the ground at Cincinnati Children's by assisting investigators as they navigate the complex regulatory requirements involved in human-subjects research.
