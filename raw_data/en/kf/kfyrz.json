When you ADD life threatening and permanent disability the total is 30,121. This is only the United States. ALSO, PER CDC VAERS WEBSITE Healthcare providers are required by law to report to VAERS: HOWEVER, MOST HOSPITALS DO NOT REPORT TO VAERS. CDC also states less than 7% of actual adverse events are reported to VAERS revealing a gruesome \"grave danger\" from these vaccines. PER CDC WEBPAGE https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html - Case numbers of 1,822 Myocarditis or pericarditis reported from 12-29 years old (young people!), 1,059 of those have been confirmed so far investigating.\" 10,104 deaths but \"still investigating.\" Anaphylaxis, thrombosis, Gillian barre (nerve cell damage causing paralysis and muscle weakness), death, blood clots. 3100 Cases reported to HRSA but zero payouts so far. Many pharmaceuticals have been taken off the market for less than 100 deaths, why not this one? ***FDA NEEDS UNTIL 2076 TO ANALYZE ALL VACCINE DATA *** This makes the Nuremberg code applicable as these vaccines are experimental http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/nuremberg/ Every manufacturer states clearly on their vaccine page that these are NOT FDA approved. However Pfizer has had to release 500 pages by court order so I have attached that to these comments showing the over 10,000 adverse events they knew about in February. ADVERSE EVENTS FROM VACCINES MOST OF WHICH ARE BEING CENSORED BY SOCIAL MEDIA AND NEWS OUTLETS: (compensation payouts are zero-even for original trial victims) https://thefederalist.com/2021/06/29/twitter-censors-video-of-mother-describing-daughters-covid-19-vaccine-side- effects/ https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thomas-w-jones-jr-a7210b61_vaccine-injury-attorney-fda-asks-judge-to-activity- 6867249223017074688-Bdcm respiratory viruses such as influenza and other gastrointestinal infections such as Norovirus\" IT IS PROPOSTEROUS TO THINK WE WILL PROTECT PEOPLE FROM EVERY VIRUS. SO NEVADA IS SETTING US UP FOR PERPETUAL MASK WEARING THE EFFICACY AND ADVERSE AFFECTS OF MASK WEARING ON HUMAN HEALTH AND PSYCOLOGY WHEN BEING MANDATED TO WEAR THEM FOR THESE EXTENSIVE LONG PERIODS OF A WORKDAY HOWEVER CAN LEAD TO LONG TERM DAMAGE PHYSICALLY AND PSYCOLOGICALLY BASED ON THESE STUDIES https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8072811/ - We not only found evidence in the reviewed mask literature of potential long-term effects, but also evidence of an increase in direct short-term effects with increased mask-wearing time in terms of cumulative effects for: carbon dioxide retention, drowsiness, headache, feeling of exhaustion, skin irritation (redness, itching) and microbiological contamination (germ colonization) [19,22,37,66,68,69,89,91,92]. Overall, the exact frequency of the described symptom constellation MIES (mask induced exhaustion syndrome) in the mask-using populace remains unclear and cannot be estimated due to insufficient data. Theoretically, the mask-induced effects of the drop in blood gas oxygen and increase in carbon dioxide extend to the cellular level with induction of the transcription factor HIF (hypoxia-induced factor) and increased inflammatory and cancer-promoting effects [ 160] and can, thus, also have a negative influence on pre-existing clinical pictures. In any case, the MIES potentially triggered by masks ( Figure 3 and Figure 4) contrasts with the WHO definition of health: \"health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" [178]. IT IS IMMINENT THAT STUDIES TAKE PLACE REGARDING THE GRAVE DANGER VERSUS BENEFIT OF LONG TERM MASK WEARING IN COMPARISON TO COVID-19 HEALTH DANGERS ESPECIALLY IN THE HEALTHY POPULATION.

I have attached studies that have been hidden by main search engines but you can find everything by using the Duck Duck go filter on Google about how you all have made it practically impossible to get these proven life saving medications such as Ivermectin which in fact was successful against COVID and Chloriquine. Yet you are allowing treatment with Remdesivir which causes renal failure and death. \"Natural and Vaccine induced immunity seem to be waning\" HOW DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT NATURAL IMMUNITY? I HAVE ATTACHED A FOIA REQUEST LETTER FROM CDC THAT THEY ARE NOT COLLECTING ANY DATA ON NATURAL IMMUNITY I have also attached studies showing 13x better immunity naturally as well as long immunity over time. \"expansion of testing, randomized workplace testing\" THIS IS ALL AGAINST THE LAW EVEN WITH THE CHANGES TO THE EOCC WITH COVID- EITHER YOU TEST EVERYONE, VACCINATED, UNVACCINATED AND SYMPTOMATIC OR YOU TEST NO ONE! **TESTING ASYMPTOMATIC EMPLOYEES IS ALSO AGAINST THE EEOCC THE PANDEMIC MODIFICATIONS TO THE EEOC MADE IN 2020 *** DO NOT EMPLOY MANADATORY TESTING FOR AN ASYMPTOMATIC PERSON : https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/pandemic-preparedness-workplace-and-americans-disabilities-act PROHIBITED BY EEOC - A \"medical examination\" is a procedure or test that seeks information about an individual's physical or mental impairments or health.(14) Whether a procedure is a medical examination under the ADA is determined by considering factors such as whether the test involves the use of medical equipment; whether it is invasive; whether it is designed to reveal the existence of a physical or mental impairment; and whether it is given or interpreted by a medical professional. During employment: The ADA prohibits employee disability-related inquiries or medical examinations unless they are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination of an employee is job-related and consistent with business necessity when an employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: 1. An employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or 2. An employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. 3. \"The DPBH recommends vaccination for all eligible students and staff and testing of all those that are unvaccinated\" \"testing a random sample of at least 10% of staff and students who are not fully vaccinated\" THIS IS DISCRIMINATORY - YOU HAVE TO EITHER TEST ONLY SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE OR EVERYONE BY LAW See studies attached also regarding viral loads the same in both vaccinated and unvaccinated, and vaccinated can spread and contract just the same REFER TO UC DAVIS CA STUDY HERE https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v1.full No Significant Difference in Viral Load Between Vaccinated and Unvaccinated, Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Groups Infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant ALSO: CDC DIRECTOR WALLENSKY STATED BACK IN JULY https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0730-mmwr-covid- 19.html \"Today, some of those data were published in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), demonstrating that Delta infection resulted in similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated people. High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus. This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC's updated mask recommendation. The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones.\" ***THESE STUDIES BELOW SHOW INACCURACY AND BIAS IN TESTING CAUSING UNFAIR DISCRIMINATORY QUARANTINES, LOSS OF WAGES, UNNESSESARY COSTS TO EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS FOR TESTING WITHOUT CAUSE: FDA - https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests- rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory \"The FDA reminds clinical laboratory staff and health care providers about the risk of false positive results with all laboratory tests.

Learn more \u00bb Home > Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) > Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) Data Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) Data Aggregate Data as of October 1, 2021 The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) provides compensation for covered serious injuries or deaths that, based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientic evidence, are found to be directly caused by the administration or use of a covered countermeasure or are determined to meet the requirements of a countermeasure injury table. Temporal association between administration or use of the covered countermeasure and onset of the injury (i.e., the injury occurs a certain time after the administration or use) is not sucient, by itself, to prove that an injury is the direct result of a covered countermeasure. It is important to note that the CICP data only captures the alleged countermeasure(s) and the alleged injuries that CICP requesters list on their Request for Benets forms (RFB) or claim. The countermeasure or injury listed by the requester on the RFB may or may not be consistent with the requester's medical documentation or the injury resulting in compensation. While requesters are required to identify the alleged countermeasure on their RFB form, they are not required to list the specic manufacturer or trade name on their RFB form. Furthermore, while requesters must submit their RFB form within 1 year from the administration or use of the covered countermeasure, requesters are permitted to submit the necessary medical records and other documentation, such as a copy of a requester's COVID-19 vaccination record, after the RFB is led. For the majority of COVID-19 countermeasure claims, including COVID-19 vaccine claims, the CICP is still waiting for records and documentation to be submitted. When was the rst CICP claim led? The rst CICP claim was led in Fiscal Year (FY) 2010; there are no CICP claims to report on prior to FY 2010. Is the CICP data available by specic manufacturer or trade name? The CICP does not maintain its aggregated data concerning alleged countermeasures, including vaccines, by specic manufacturer. How many claims has the CICP compensated? The CICP is the payer of last resort and can only reimburse or pay for medical expenses or lost employment income that are not covered by other third-party payers. To date, the CICP has paid compensation for 29 CICP claims, totaling more than $6 million. An additional 10 CICP claims were eligible for compensation after a review of the required medical records and documentation; however, in these cases there were no eligible reported medical expenses or lost employment income for the CICP to compensate. Has the CICP made any decisions regarding COVID-19 Claims? As of October 1, 2021, the CICP has not compensated any COVID-19 countermeasures claims. Three COVID-19 countermeasures have been denied compensation because the standard of proof for causation was not met and/or a covered injury was not sustained. One COVID-19 claim has been determined eligible for compensation and is pending a review of eligible expenses.

A covered injury is a serious physical injury (which, as a general matter, is an injury that warranted hospitalization, whether or not the person was actually hospitalized, or that led to a signicant loss of function or disability, whether or not hospitalization was warranted), or death, determined to be: 1. An injury meeting the requirements of a covered countermeasures injury table, unless there is another more likely cause; or 2. An injury (or its health complications) that is the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. This includes serious aggravation caused by a covered countermeasure of a pre-existing condition. Please note that the number column within the tables are not assigned numbers for a particular claim, but reflect the number of listed items in a given table.

Purpose: Estimate the IFR of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly populations and other age groups from seroprevalence studies. Study protocol: https://osf.io/47cgb . Data Sources: Seroprevalence studies done in 2020 and identified by any of four existing systematic reviews. Study Selection: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies with 1000 participants aged 70 years that presented seroprevalence in elderly people; aimed to generate samples reflecting the general population; and whose location had available data on cumulative COVID-19 deaths in elderly (primary cutoff 70 years; 65 or 60 also eligible). Data Extraction: We extracted the most fully adjusted (if unavailable, unadjusted) seroprevalence estimates and sampling procedure details. We also extracted age- and residence-stratified cumulative COVID-19 deaths (until 1 week after the seroprevalence sampling midpoint) from official reports, and population statistics, to calculate IFRs corrected for unmeasured antibody types. Sample size- weighted IFRs were estimated for countries with multiple estimates. Secondary analyses examined data on younger age strata from the same studies. Data Synthesis: Twenty-three seroprevalence surveys representing 14 countries were included. Across all countries, the median IFR in community-dwelling elderly and elderly overall was 2.4% (range 0.3%-7.2%) and 5.5% (range 0.3%-12.1%). IFR was higher with larger proportions of people >85 years. Younger age strata had low IFR values mortality data. Conclusions: The IFR of COVID-19 in community-dwelling elderly people is lower than previously reported. Very low IFRs were confirmed in the youngest populations. .

Hundreds of seroprevalence studies have been conducted in various populations, locations, and settings. These data have been used and synthesized in several published efforts to obtain estimates of the infection fatality rate (IFR, proportion of deceased among those infected), and its heterogeneity (3-6). All analyses identify very strong risk- gradient based on age, although absolute risk values still have substantial uncertainty. Importantly, the vast majority of seroprevalence studies include very few elderly people (7). Extrapolating from seroprevalence in younger to older age groups is tenuous. Elderly people may genuinely have different seroprevalence. Ideally, elderly should be more protected from exposure/infection than younger people, although probably the ability to protect the elderly has varied substantially across countries (8). Moreover, besides age, comorbidities and lower functional status markedly affects COVID-19 death risk (9). Particularly elderly nursing home residents accounted for 30-70% of COVID-19 deaths in high-income countries in the first wave (2), despite comprising <1% of the population. IFR in nursing home residents has been estimated to as high as 25% (10). Not separating residents of nursing homes from the community-dwelling may provide an average that is too low for the former and too high for the latter. Moreover, ascertainment and reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing home populations show considerable variation across countries (2), with potentially heavy bearing on overall mortality, while community-dwelling elderly data may be less unreliable (especially in high-income countries). Finally, seroprevalence estimates reflect typically community- dwelling populations (enrollment of nursing home residents is scarce/absent in serosurveys). Here we estimated the COVID-19 IFR in community-dwelling populations at all locations where seroprevalence studies with many elderly individuals have been conducted. Primary emphasis .

(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted July 13, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.21260210doi: medRxiv preprint 5 METHODS Data Sources and Searches We identified seroprevalence studies (peer-reviewed publications, official reports, or preprints) in four existing systematic reviews (3, 7, 11, 12) as for a previous project (13), using the most recent updates of these reviews and their respective databases as of March 16, 2021. The protocol of this study was registered at the Open Science Framework ( https://osf.io/47cgb ) after piloting data availability in December 2020 but before extracting full data, communicating with local authorities and study authors for additional data and performing any calculations. Amendments to the protocol and their justification are described in Appendix Table 1. Study Selection We included studies on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence that had sampled at least 1000 participants aged 70 years in the location and/or setting of interest, provided an estimate of seroprevalence for elderly people, explicitly aimed to generate samples reflecting the general population, and were conducted at a location for which there is official data available on the proportion of cumulative COVID-19 deaths among elderly (with a cutoff placed between 60-70 years; e.g., eligible cutoffs were 70, 65, or 60, but not 75 or 55). Besides general population samples we also accepted studies focusing on patient cohorts (including residual clinical samples), insurance applicants, blood donors, and workers (excluding health care workers and others deemed to have higher than average exposure risk, since these would tend to overestimate seroprevalence). USA studies were excluded if they did not adjust seroprevalence for race or ethnicity, since these socio-economically related factors associate strongly with both study participation (14, 15) (blood donation, specific jobs, and insurance seeking) and COVID-19 burden (16-18). We focused on studies sampling participants in 2020, since IFRs in 2021 may be further affected by wide implementation of vaccinations (especially among the elderly) and by other changes (new variants and better treatment). Two authors reviewed records for eligibility. Discrepancies were solved by discussion. .

Discrepancies were solved through discussion. For each location, we identified the age distribution of cumulative COVID-19 deaths and choose as primary age cutoff the one closest to 70, while placed between 60-70 years (e.g., 70, 65, or 60). Similar to a previous project (3), we extracted from eligible studies information on location, recruitment and sampling strategy, dates of sample collection, sample size (overall and elderly group), and types of antibody measured (immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA). We also extracted, for the elderly stratum, the estimated unadjusted seroprevalence, the most fully adjusted seroprevalence, and the factors considered for adjustment. Antibody titers may decline over time. E.g. a modelling study estimated 3-4 months average time to seroreversion (19). A repeated measurements study (20) suggests even 50% seroreversion within a month for asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic patients, although this may be an over-estimate due to initially false-positive antibody results. To address seroreversion, if there were multiple different time points of seroprevalence assessment, we selected the one with the highest seroprevalence estimate. If seroprevalence data were unavailable as defined by the primary cutoff, but with another eligible cutoff (e.g., 70, 65, or 60), we extracted data for that cut-off. Population size (overall, and elderly) and numbers of nursing home residents for the location were obtained from multiple sources (see Appendix Table 2). Cumulative COVID-19 deaths overall and in the elderly stratum (using the primary age cutoff) for the relevant location were extracted from official reports. The total number, i.e., confirmed and probable, was preferred whenever available. We extracted the accumulated deaths until 1 week after the midpoint of the seroprevalence study period, or the closest date with available data. The proportion of cumulative COVID-19 deaths that occurred among nursing home residents for the relevant location and date was extracted from official sources or the International Long Term Care Policy Network (ILTCPN) report closest in time (2, 21). We preferred numbers recorded per residence status, i.e., including COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents occurring in hospital. If the latter were unavailable, we calculated the total number of deaths in nursing home residents with a correction (by multiplying with the median of available ratios of deaths in nursing homes to deaths of nursing home residents in the ILTCPN 10/14/2020 report (2) for countries in the .

We considered 95%, 98%, and 99% of nursing home residents' deaths to have occurred in people 70 years, 65 years and 60 years, respectively (22). For other imputations, see the online protocol. Missing Data We communicated with the authors of the seroprevalence study and with officers responsible for compiling the relevant official reports to obtain missing information or when information was available but not for the preferred age cut-offs. Email requests were sent, with two reminders to non- responders. Calculated Data Variables Infected and deceased community-dwelling elderly The number of infected people among the community dwelling elderly for the preferred date (1 week after the midpoint of the seroprevalence study period) was estimated by multiplying the adjusted estimate of seroprevalence and the population size in community-dwelling elderly. We used unadjusted seroprevalence, when adjusted estimates were unavailable. We applied a non-prespecified correction for studies that excluded persons with diagnosed COVID-19 from sampling, primarily by using study authors' corrections, secondarily by adding the number of identified COVID-19 cases in community-dwelling elderly for the location up to the seroprevalence study midpoint. The total number of fatalities in community-dwelling elderly was obtained by total number of fatalities in elderly minus those accounted for by nursing home residents in the elderly stratum. If the elderly proportion or nursing home residents' share of COVID-19 deaths were only available for another date than the preferred one, we assumed that the proportions were stable between the time points. IFR estimation We present IFR with corrections for unmeasured antibodies (as previously described (3)) as well as uncorrected. When only one or two types of antibodies (among IgG, IgM, IgA) were used in the seroprevalence study, seroprevalence was corrected upwards (and inferred IFR downwards) by 10% for each non-measured antibody. We added a non-prespecified calculation of 95% confidence .

CI estimates should be seen with caution since they depend on adequacy of seroprevalence adjustments. Data Synthesis and Analysis Statistical analyses were done using R version 4.0.2 (23). Similar to a previous overview of IFR-estimating studies (3), we estimated the sample size-weighted IFR of community-dwelling elderly for each country and then estimated the median and range of IFRs across countries. As expected, there was extreme heterogeneity among IFR estimates, thus weighted meta-analysis averages may not be meaningful. We explored a seroreversion correction of the IFR by Xm-fold, where m is the number of months from the peak of the first epidemic wave in the specific location and X is 0.99, 0.95, and 0.90 corresponding to 1%, 5%, and 10% relative monthly rate of seroreversion. We also added a non- prespecified sensitivity analysis to explore the percentage increase in the cumulative number of deaths and IFR, if the cutoff was put two weeks (rather than 1 week) after the study midpoint. We expected IFR would be higher in locations with a higher share of people 85 years old among the analyzed elderly stratum. Estimates of log 10IFR) were plotted against the proportion of people 85 years old among the elderly (for population pyramid sources see Appendix Table 2. Added Secondary Analyses IFR in younger age-strata has become a very important question since we wrote the original protocol and the studies considered here offered a prime opportunity to assess IFR also in younger age strata. Among the included studies, whenever there were seroprevalence estimates and COVID- 19 mortality data available for younger age groups, we complemented data extraction for all available age strata. Studies were excluded if no mortality data were available for any age stratum of maximum width 20 years and maximum age 70 years. We used the same time points as those selected for the elderly data. We included all age strata with a maximum width of 20 years and available COVID-19 mortality information. We corresponded the respective seroprevalence estimates for each age stratum with eligible mortality data. Consecutive strata of 1-5 years were merged to generate 10-year bins. For seroprevalence estimates we used the age strata that most fully .

Population statistics for each analyzed age bin were obtained from the same sources as for the elderly. For age strata with multiple estimates from the same country, we calculated the sample size-weighted IFR per country before estimating median IFRs across locations age groups 0-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 years. IFR estimates were placed in these age groups according to their midpoint, regardless of whether they perfectly matched the age group or not, e.g. an IFR estimate for age 18-29 years was placed in the 20-29 years group. .

Screening and exclusions are shown in Appendix Figure 1 and Appendix Table 2. Twenty-two seroprevalence studies were included, one of which contained two separate surveys. The 23 seroprevalence surveys (Table 1) (24-47) represented 14 countries (Americas n=6, Asia n=3, Europe n=14). Only three studies were conducted in middle-income countries (one in Dominican Republic, two in India) and the other 20 in high-income countries. Nineteen studies targeted general population participants, 2 enrolled blood donors (27, 30), 1 biobank participants (43), and 1 hemodialysis patients (46). Three studies excluded upfront persons with previously diagnosed COVID-19 from participating in their sample (35, 39, 47). Mid-sampling points ranged from April 2020 to November 2020). Sampling had a median length of 5.7 weeks (range 6 days to 5 months). The median number of elderly individuals tested was 1809 (range 1010-21953). Median seroprevalence was 3.2% (range 0.47%-25.2%). Adjusted seroprevalence estimates were available for 20/23 studies. Mortality and population statistics COVID-19 deaths and population data among elderly at each location are shown in Table 1 (for sources, see Appendix Table 3). The proportion of a location's total COVID-19 deaths that happened among elderly had a median of 53% (range 51%-62%) in middle-income countries and 86% (range 51%-96%) in high-income countries. The proportion of a location's total COVID-19 deaths that occurred in nursing home residents was imputed for middle-income countries, and had a median of 44% (range 20%-85%) in in high-income countries with available data (for Qatar, the number was imputed). One study (45) included only COVID-19 deaths that occurred in nursing homes and was corrected to reflect also the deaths among nursing home residents occurring in hospitals. Among the population, the elderly group comprised a median of 9% (range 6%-11%) in middle-income countries and 15% (range 0.6%-24%) in high-income countries. People residing in nursing homes were 0.08-0.20% of elderly in middle-income countries and a median of 4.7% (range 0.5%-9.1%) in high-income countries. Additional data contributed .

Calculated IFRs For 5 countries with more than one IFR estimate available sample size-weighted average IFRs were calculated. In 14 countries, IFRs in community-dwelling elderly (Figure 1, Table 1) had a median of 2.4% (range 0.3%-7.2%). For 2 middle-income countries, IFR was 0.3% versus 2.8% (range 1.3%-7.2%) in 12 high-income countries. Figure 1 also shows 95% CIs for IFRs based on 95% CIs for seroprevalence estimates. Median IFR in all elderly for all 14 individual countries was 5.5% (range 0.3%-12.1%). In the 2 middle-income countries, IFR in all elderly was 0.3-0.4% and in 12 high-income countries it was 6.8% (range 2.3%-12.1%). Sensitivity analyses exploring different rates of seroreversion appear in Appendix Table 4. For the scenario with 5% relative monthly seroreversion, median IFR in community-dwelling elderly was still 2.4% (range 0.3%-6.1%) across all countries (0.3% in 2 middle-income countries, and 2.7% in 12 high-income countries. For the sensitivity analysis that explored the percentage increase in IFR if a later cutoff was used for cumulative deaths (two weeks after study midpoint), data were available for 20/23 seroprevalence surveys. There was a median relative increase of 4%, and median IFR in community-dwelling elderly became2.5% (Appendix Table 5). IFR in the elderly and proportion >85 years There was steeply increasing IFR with larger proportions of people 85 years old (Figure 2). A regression of logIFR against the proportion of people 85 years old had a slope of 0.056 (p=0.002), and suggested IFR=0.62%, 1.18%, and 4.29% when the proportion of people >85 in the elderly group was 5%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. IFR in younger age-strata We could extract data and calculate IFR on another 84 age-strata observations from 19/23 seroprevalence surveys (three had no mortality data for any eligible non-elderly age stratum (25, 30, 35) and one sampled no individuals <65 years of age (44)). The 19 surveys came from 11 countries. For the age group 0-19 years, only five studies had sampled participants for seroprevalence in the corresponding age group (24, 29, 31, 38, 41); for the other studies, the closest available age group .

IFR in community-dwelling elderly was consistently lower than in elderly overall, and in countries where nursing homes are widely used, the difference was very substantial. In secondary analyses, the aggregated estimates show very low IFR estimates for younger age groups. Early estimates of case fatality rate (CFR, ratio of deaths divided by documented infections) in the elderly were very high and they played an instrumental role in disseminating both fear and alacrity in dealing with this serious pandemic. Early estimates of CFR from China (48) described CFR of 8% in the age group 70-79 and 14.8% in those 80 years. Extremely high CFR estimates were also reported initially from Italy (49) and New York (50). However, the number of infected individuals was much larger than the documented cases (51). Therefore, IFR is much lower than CFR. We are aware of three previous evaluations of age-stratified IFR estimates that combine seroprevalence data with age-specific COVID-19 mortality statistics (4, 5, 52). Levin et al (4) is also the basis for the US CDC pandemic planning scenarios (53). Levin et al report IFR 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85 (4) without separating nursing home deaths. The assessment was based on relatively sparse data for these age groups. The authors counted deaths four weeks after the midpoint of the seroprevalence sampling period, which is the longest among the evaluations, with the argument that there is large potential reporting lag (although available mortality statistics are commonly updated retrospectively for the date of death). Also, almost all included studies came from hard-hit locations, where IFR may be substantially higher (3). Selection bias for studies with higher seroprevalence and/or higher death counts (6) may explain why their estimates for middle-aged and elderly are substantially higher than ours. .

For young and middle-aged groups, their estimates largely agree with those presented here. Their estimates for elderly are still higher than ours. For ages 65 years, their model uses data derived from one location (England) on deaths that did not occur in nursing homes and is validated against other locations with such statistics. This may overestimate the community-dwelling proportion, since deaths of nursing home residents occurring in hospitals are counted in the England community estimates. Conversely our evaluation adds granularity by using deaths in nursing home residents from many countries, and by using seroprevalence estimates from 23 serosurveys with many elderly individuals. The Imperial College COVID-19 response team (52) presents much higher IFR estimates for elderly overall. They use a very narrowly selected subset of 10 studies in 9 countries, five of which had sampled >1000 elderly people. Their selection criteria required >100 deaths in the location at the seroprevalence study midpoint, which skews the sample towards heavily-hit areas and higher IFRs (6). Some published studies also present IFRs in elderly people for single locations based on seroprevalence data, but these are unavoidably location-limited (see Appendix text). For persons 0-19 years, the median IFR was one death per 37,000 persons with COVID-19 infection, followed by estimates of 1:7100 in ages 20-29, 1:3200 in ages 30-39, and 1:1200 in ages 40-49. The Imperial College study (52) has 5-10 times higher estimates for persons 0-19 years and 20-29 years old; otherwise estimates in age groups <50 years are fairly consistent across previous (4, 5) and current analyses despite methodological differences. Thus, they may be used for assessing risk-benefits, e.g. with specific vaccines (54) in young populations. .

E.g., obesity is a major risk factor for poor outcome with COVID-19 infection and prevalence of obesity is only 4% in India versus 20-36% in high-income countries analyzed here. Besides differences in risk factor characteristics, documentation criteria for coding COVID-19 deaths may have varied non-trivially across countries. Under- and over-counting of COVID-19 deaths may have occurred even in countries with advanced health systems. Given that nursing home residents account for many COVID-19 deaths (55), a location's overall IFR across all ages is largely dependent on how nursing homes were afflicted (5). Spread in nursing homes was disproportionately high in the first wave (8). The share of nursing home deaths decreased markedly in subsequent waves (55) in most high-income countries with some exceptions (e.g. Australia). This change may be reflected in a much lower IFR among the elderly and the entire population after the first wave. Improved treatments (e.g. dexamethasone), and less use of harmful treatments (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, improper mechanical ventilation) may also have decreased IFR substantially in late 2020 and in 2021. With vaccination being promoted preferentially for elderly and vulnerable individuals in 2021, IFR may have decreased even more sharply (6). New variants becoming dominant in 2021 may also be associated with further lower IFR. E.g., in the last week of June 2021, in the UK, where the delta mutation has spread widely, even CFR has been ~0.1%. Our analysis has several limitations. First, seroprevalence estimates among elderly reported by the included studies could over- or underestimate the proportion infected. We explored adjusted estimates accounting for 1-10% relative seroreversion per month; however, higher seroreversion is likely (19, 20, 56). Higher seroreversion will affect more prominently studies carried out later in the pandemic. Also, the current estimates do not fully account for the unknown share of people who may have tackled the infection without generating detectable serum/plasma antibodies (e.g., by mucosal, .

Sensitivity estimates for antibody assays typically use positive controls from symptomatic individuals with clinically manifest infection; sensitivity may be lower for asymptomatic infections. All seroprevalence studies may have substantial residual biases despite whatever adjustments (6). Even well-designed general population studies may specifically fail to reach and recruit highly vulnerable populations, e.g. disadvantaged groups, immigrants, homeless, and other people at high exposure risks and poor health. Second, the number of deaths may be biased for various reasons (3) leading to potential under- or over-counting. Using excess mortality data is an alternative that has caveats, as those data depend heavily on the reference time period; availability in specific age groups can be restricted; and the proportion of deaths that is directly attributable to COVID-19 may be difficult to separate from indirect effects of the pandemic and adverse effects of measures taken. To match the date for seroprevalence sampling (i.e., seroconversion) with cumulative deaths is an exercise with assumptions. Our sensitivity analysis that extended with one week the cutoff for counting deaths showed a negligible change in the median IFR calculation. Most studies included in our analysis had been performed during periods at or after the end of the first wave. Third, we acknowledge the risk of bias in seroprevalence studies, mortality statistics, and even population statistics. However, assessments of risk of bias are far from straightforward, as illustrated by the discrepant assessments of these seroprevalence studies by other teams (6). Finally, most available studies come from hard-hit locations that tend to have high IFRs (6). Consideration of age strata diminishes this representativeness bias, but cannot eliminate it. E.g., most countries not represented in the available data may have a shift towards lower ages within the stratum of the elderly. This translates to lower IFR. .

Global IFR may thus be substantially lower in both the elderly and the lower age strata than estimates presented herein. This overview synthesis finds a consistently much lower IFR of COVID-19 in community- dwelling elderly than in elderly overall, a difference which is substantial in countries where nursing homes are an established form of residency. Very low IFR estimates were confirmed in younger groups (<50). For middle-aged groups and elderly, estimates were lower than in some previous influential work with biased methodological choices (4, 52), but in agreement with other work (5). The estimates presented here may serve as one of several key pieces of information underlying public health policy decisions. With better management and better preventive measures, in particular vaccines, hopefully IFR estimates have already decreased further. .

Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread Martin J Vincent , Eric Bergeron , Suzanne Benjannet , Bobbie G Ksiazek , Nabil 1 Abstract Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. Results: We report, however, that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. Conclusion: Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV antiviral compounds.

INTRODUCTION Reference is made to the Request for Comments and Advice submitted 04 February 2021 regarding Pfizer/BioNTech's proposal for the clinical and post-authorization safety data package for the Biologics License Application (BLA) for our investigational COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2). Further reference is made to the Agency's 09 March 2021 response to this request, and specifically, the following request from the Agency. \u0093Monthly safety reports primarily focus on events that occurred during the reporting interval and include information not relevant to a BLA submission such as line lists of adverse events by country. We are most interested in a cumulative analysis of post-authorization safety data to support your future BLA submission. Please submit an integrated analysis of your cumulative post-authorization safety data, including U.S. and foreign post-authorization experience, in your upcoming BLA submission. Please include a cumulative analysis of the Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and areas of Important Missing Information identified in your Pharmacovigilance Plan, as well as adverse events of special interest and vaccine administration errors (whether or not associated with an adverse event). Please also include distribution data and an analysis of the most common adverse events. In addition, please submit your updated Pharmacovigilance Plan with your BLA submission.\u0094 This document provides an integrated analysis of the cumulative post-authorization safety data, including U.S. and foreign post-authorization adverse event reports received through 28 February 2021. 2. METHODOLOGY Pfizer is responsible for the management post-authorization safety data on behalf of the MAH BioNTech according to the Pharmacovigilance Agreement in place. Data from BioNTech are included in the report when applicable. Pfizer's safety database contains cases of AEs reported spontaneously to Pfizer, cases reported by the health authorities, cases published in the medical literature, cases from Pfizer-sponsored marketing programs, non-interventional studies, and cases of serious AEs reported from clinical studies regardless of causality assessment. The limitations of post-marketing adverse drug event reporting should be considered when interpreting these data: \u0095Reports are submitted voluntarily, and the magnitude of underreporting is unknown. Some of the factors that may influence whether an event is reported include: length of time since marketing, market share of the drug, publicity about a drug or an AE, seriousness of the reaction, regulatory actions, awareness by health professionals and consumers of adverse drug event reporting, and litigation. \u0095Because many external factors influence whether or not an AE is reported, the spontaneous reporting system yields reporting proportions not incidence rates. As a result, it is generally not appropriate to make between-drug comparisons using these 090177e196ea1800\\Approved\\Approved Adverse Event Reports CONFIDENTIAL Page 6proportions; the spontaneous reporting system should be used for signal detection rather than hypothesis testing. \u0095In some reports, clinical information (such as medical history, validation of diagnosis, time from drug use to onset of illness, dose, and use of concomitant drugs) is missing or incomplete, and follow-up information may not be available. \u0095An accumulation of adverse event reports (AERs) does not necessarily indicate that a particular AE was caused by the drug; rather, the event may be due to an underlying disease or some other factor(s) such as past medical history or concomitant medication. \u0095Among adverse event reports received into the Pfizer safety database during the cumulative period, only those having a complete workflow cycle in the safety database (meaning they progressed to Distribution or Closed workflow status) are included in the monthly SMSR. This approach prevents the inclusion of cases that are not fully processed hence not accurately reflecting final information. Due to the large numbers of spontaneous adverse event reports received for the product, the MAH has prioritised the processing of serious cases, in order to meet expedited regulatory reporting timelines and ensure these reports are available for signal detection and evaluation activity. The increased volume of reports has not impacted case processing for serious reports, and compliance metrics continue to be monitored weekly with prompt action taken as needed to maintain compliance with expedited reporting obligations. Non-serious cases are entered into the safety database no later than 4 calendar days from receipt. Entrance into the database includes the coding of all adverse events; this allow for a manual review of events being received but may not include immediate case processing to completion. Non-serious cases are processed as soon as possible and no later than 90 days from receipt. Pfizer has also taken a multiple actions to help alleviate the large increase of adverse event reports. This includes significant technology enhancements, and process and workflow solutions, as well as increasing the number of data entry and case processing colleagues. To date, Pfizer has onboarded approximately additional full- time employees (FTEs). More are joining each month with an expected total of more than additional resources by the end of June 2021. 3. RESULTS 3.1. Safety Database 3.1.1. General Overview It is estimated that approximately doses of BNT162b2 were shipped worldwide from the receipt of the first temporary authorisation for emergency supply on 01 December 2020 through 28 February 2021. Cumulatively, through 28 February 2021, there was a total of 42,086 case reports (25,379 medically confirmed and 16,707 non-medically confirmed) containing 158,893 events. Most cases (34,762) were received from United States (13,739), United Kingdom (13,404) Italy (2,578), Germany (1913), France (1506), Portugal (866) and Spain (756); the remaining 7,324 were distributed among of Post-authorization Adverse Event Reports CONFIDENTIAL Page 7Table 1 below presents the main characteristics of the overall cases.

Important Identified Risk Topic Description Important Identified RiskPost Authorization Cases Evaluation (cumulative to 28 Feb 2021) Total Number of Cases in the Reporting Period (N=42086) Anaphylaxis Since the first temporary authorization for emergency supply under Regulation 174 in the UK (01 December 2020) and through 28 February 2021, 1833 potentially relevant cases were retrieved from the Anaphylactic reaction SMQ (Narrow and Broad) search strategy, applying the MedDRA algorithm. These cases were individually reviewed and assessed according to Brighton Collaboration (BC) definition and level of diagnostic certainty as shown in the Table below: Brighton Collaboration Level Number of cases BC 1 290 BC 2 311 BC 3 10 BC 4 391 BC 5 831 Total 1833 Level 1 indicates a case with the highest level of diagnostic certainty of anaphylaxis, whereas the diagnostic certainty is lowest for Level 3. Level 4 is defined as \"reported event of anaphylaxis with insufficient evidence to meet the case definition\" and Level 5 as not a case of anaphylaxis. There were 1002 cases (54.0% of the potentially relevant cases retrieved), 2958 potentially relevant events, from the Anaphylactic reaction SMQ (Broad and Narrow) search strategy, meeting BC Level 1 to 4: Country of incidence: UK (261), US (184), Mexico (99), Italy (82), Germany (67), Spain (38), France (36), Portugal (22), Denmark (20), Finland, Greece (19 each), Sweden (17), Czech Republic , Netherlands (16 each), Belgium, Ireland (13 each), Poland (12), Austria (11); the remaining 57 cases originated from 15 different countries. Relevant event seriousness: Serious (2341), Non-Serious (617); Gender: Females (876), Males (106), Unknown (20); Age (n=961) ranged from 16 to 98 years (mean = 54.8 years, median = 42.5 years); Relevant even outcomea: fatal (9)b, resolved/resolving (1922), not resolved (229), resolved with sequelae (48), unknown (754); Most frequently reported relevant PTs (2%), from the Anaphylactic reaction SMQ (Broad and Narrow) search strategy: Anaphylactic reaction (435), Dyspnoea (356), Rash (190), Pruritus (175), Erythema (159), Urticaria (133), Cough (115), Respiratory distress, Throat tightness (97 each), Swollen tongue (93), Anaphylactic shock (80), Hypotension (72), Chest discomfort (71), Swelling face (70), Pharyngeal swelling (68), and Lip swelling (64). Conclusion: Evaluation of BC cases Level 1 - 4 did not reveal any significant new safety information. Anaphylaxis is appropriately described in the product labeling as are non-anaphylactic hypersensitivity events. Surveillance will continue. a Different clinical outcome may be reported for an event that occurred more than once to the same individual. b There were 4 individuals in the anaphylaxis evaluation who died on the same day they were vaccinated. Although these patients experienced adverse events (9) that are potential symptoms of anaphylaxis, they all had serious underlying medical conditions, and one individual appeared to also have COVID-19 pneumonia, that likely contributed to their deaths090177e196ea1800\\Approved\\Approved On: 30-Apr-2021 09:26 (GMT) FDA-CBER-2021-5683-0000063BNT162b2 5.3.6 Adverse Event Reports CONFIDENTIAL Page 11Table 5. Important Potential Risk Topic Description Important Potential RiskPost Authorization Cases Evaluation (cumulative to 28 Feb 2021) Total Number of Cases in the Reporting Period (N=42086) Vaccine- Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED), including Vaccine- Associated Enhanced Respiratory Disease (VAERD)No post-authorized AE reports have been identified as cases of VAED/VAERD, therefore, there is no observed data at this time. An expected rate of VAED is difficult to establish so a meaningful observed/expected analysis cannot be conducted at this point based on available data. The feasibility of conducting such an analysis will be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis as data on the virus grows and the vaccine safety data continues to accrue. The search criteria utilised to identify potential cases of VAED for this report includes PTs indicating a lack of effect of the vaccine and PTs potentially indicative of severe or atypical COVID-19a. Since the first temporary authorization for emergency supply under Regulation 174 in the UK (01 December 2020) and through 28 February 2021, 138 cases [0.33% of the total PM dataset], reporting 317 potentially relevant events were retrieved: Country of incidence: UK (71), US (25), Germany (14), France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, (4 each), Denmark (3); the remaining 9 cases originated from 9 different countries; Cases Seriousness: 138; Seriousness criteria for the total 138 cases: Medically significant (71, of which 8 also serious for disability), Hospitalization required (non-fatal/non-life threatening) (16, of which 1 also serious for disability), Life threatening (13, of which 7 were also serious for hospitalization), Death (38). Gender: Females (73), Males (57), Unknown (8); Age (n=132) ranged from 21 to 100 years (mean = 57.2 years, median = 59.5); Case outcome: fatal (38), resolved/resolving (26), not resolved (65), resolved with sequelae (1), unknown (8); Of the 317 relevant events, the most frequently reported PTs (2%) were: Drug ineffective (135), Dyspnoea (53), Diarrhoea (30), COVID-19 pneumonia (23), Vomiting (20), Respiratory failure (8), and Seizure (7). Conclusion: VAED may present as severe or unusual clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Overall, there were 37 subjects with suspected COVID-19 and 101 subjects with confirmed COVID-19 following one or both doses of the vaccine; 75 of the 101 cases were severe, resulting in hospitalisation, disability, life-threatening consequences or death. None of the 75 cases could be definitively considered as VAED/VAERD. In this review of subjects with COVID-19 following vaccination, based on the current evidence, VAED/VAERD remains a theoretical risk for the vaccine. Surveillance will continue. a.

Conclusion: No new significant safety information was identified based on a review of these cases compared with the non-paediatric population. Vaccine EffectivenessCompany conventions for coding cases indicative of lack of efficacy: The coding conventions for lack of efficacy in the context of administration of the COVID-19 vaccine were revised on 15 February 2021, as shown below: \u0095PT \"Vaccination failure\" is coded when ALL of the following criteria are met: oThe subject has received the series of two doses per the dosing regimen in local labeling. oAt least 7 days have elapsed since the second dose of vaccine has been administered. oThe subject experiences SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed laboratory tests). \u0095PT \"Drug ineffective\" is coded when either of the following applies: oThe infection is not confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 through laboratory tests (irrespective of the vaccination schedule). This includes scenarios where LOE is stated or implied, e.g., \"the vaccine did not work\", \"I got COVID-19\". oIt is unknown: Whether the subject has received the series of two doses per the dosing regimen in local labeling; How many days have passed since the first dose (including unspecified number of days like\" a few days\", \"some days\", etc.); If 7 days have passed since the second dose; oThe subject experiences a vaccine preventable illness 14 days after receiving the first dose up to and through 6 days after receipt of the second dose. Note: after the immune system as had sufficient time (14 days) to respond to the vaccine, a report of COVID-19 is considered a potential lack of efficacy even if the vaccination course is not complete.

Conclusion: No new safety signals of vaccine lack of efficacy have emerged based on a review of these cases. a. From a total of 417 cases, 4 cases were excluded from the analysis. In 3 cases, the MAH was informed that a 33-year-old and two unspecified age pregnant female patients were scheduled to receive bnt162b2 (PT reported Off label use and Product use issue in 2 cases; Circumstance or information capable of leading to medication error in one case). One case reported the PT Morning sickness; however, pregnancy was not confirmed in this case. b. 558 additional cases retrieved in this dataset were excluded from the analysis; upon review, 546 cases cannot be considered true lack of efficacy cases because the PT Drug ineffective was coded but the subjects developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early days from the first dose (days 1 - 13); the vaccine has not had sufficient time to stimulate the immune system and, consequently, the development of a vaccine preventable disease during this time is not considered a potential lack of effect of the vaccine; in 5 cases the PT Drug ineffective was removed after data lock point (DLP) because the subjects did not develop COVID- 19 infection; in 1 case, reporting Treatment failure and Transient ischaemic attack, the Lack of efficacy PT did not refer to BNT162b2 vaccine; 5 cases have been invalidated in the safety database after DLP; 1 case has been deleted from the discussion because the PTs reported Pathogen resistance and Product preparation issue were not indicative of a lack of efficacy. to be eliminated. c. Upon review, 31 additional cases were excluded from the analysis as the data reported (e.g. clinical details, height, weight, etc.) were not consistent with paediatric subjects d. Upon review, 28 additional cases were excluded from the analysis as the data reported (e.g. clinical details, height, weight, etc.) were not consistent with paediatric subjects. e. Different clinical outcomes may be reported for an event that occurred more than once to the same individual f. In 2 cases the PT Vaccination failure was replaced with Drug ineffective after DLP. Another case was not included in the discussion of the Vaccination failure cases because correct scheduling (21 days apart between the first and second dose) cannot be confirmed.090177e196ea1800\\Approved\\Approved On: 30-Apr-2021 09:26 (GMT) FDA-CBER-2021-5683-0000068BNT162b2 5.3.6 Adverse Event Reports CONFIDENTIAL Page 163.1.3. Review of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) Please refer to Appendix 1 for the list of the company's AESIs for BNT162b2. The company's AESI list takes into consideration the lists of AESIs from the following expert groups and regulatory authorities: Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC), ACCESS protocol, US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance), MHRA (unpublished guideline). The AESI terms are incorporated into a TME list and include events of interest due to their association with severe COVID-19 and events of interest for vaccines in general. The AESI list is comprised of MedDRA PTs, HLTs, HLGTs or MedDRA SMQs and can be changed as appropriate based on the evolving safety profile of the vaccine. Table 7 provides a summary review of cumulative cases within AESI categories in the Pfizer safety database. This is distinct from safety signal evaluations which are conducted and included, as appropriate, in the Summary Monthly Safety Reports submitted regularly to the FDA and other Health Authorities.

DISCUSSION Pfizer performs frequent and rigorous signal detection on BNT162b2 cases. The findings of these signal detection analyses are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine. This cumulative analysis to support the Biologics License Application for BNT162b2, is an integrated analysis of post-authorization safety data, from U.S. and foreign experience, focused on Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and areas of Important Missing Information identified in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as well as adverse events of special interest and vaccine administration errors (whether or not associated with an adverse event). The data do not reveal any novel safety concerns or risks requiring label changes and support a favorable benefit risk profile of to the BNT162b2 vaccine.090177e196ea1800\\Approved\\Approved Post-authorization Adverse Event Reports CONFIDENTIAL Page 295. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Review of the available data for this cumulative PM experience, confirms a favorable benefit: risk balance for BNT162b2. Pfizer will continue routine pharmacovigilance activities on behalf of BioNTech according to the Pharmacovigilance Agreement in place, in order to assure patient safety and will inform the Agency if an evaluation of the safety data yields significant new information for BNT162b2.090177e196ea1800\\Approved\\Approved On: 30-Apr-2021 09:26 (GMT) FDA-CBER-2021-5683-0000082BNT162b2 5.3.6 Adverse Event Reports CONFIDENTIAL Page 1APPENDIX 1.

Clin Pharmacol Ther 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 Abstract Remdesivir is approved for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and authorized conditionally by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Its benefit-risk ratio is still being explored because data in the field are rather scant. A decrease of the creatinine clearance associated with remdesivir has been inconstantly reported in clinical trials with unclear relevance. Despite these uncertainties, we searched for a potential signal of acute renal failure (ARF) in pharmacovigilance postmarketing data. An analysis of the international pharmacovigilance postmarketing databases (VigiBase) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was performed, using two disproportionality methods. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) compared the number of ARF cases reported with remdesivir, with those reported with other drugs prescribed in comparable situations of COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and lopinavir/ritonavir). The combination of the terms \"acute renal failure\" and \"remdesivir\" yielded a statistically significant disproportionality signal with 138 observed cases instead of the 9 expected. ROR of ARF with remdesivir was 20-fold (20.3; confidence interval 0.95 [15.7-26.3], P < 0.0001]) that of comparative drugs. Based on ARF cases reported in VigiBase, and despite the caveats inherent to COVID-19 circumstances, we detected a statistically significant pharmacovigilance signal of nephrotoxicity associated with remdesivir, deserving a thorough qualitative assessment of all available data. Meanwhile, as recommended in its Summary of Product Characteristics, assessment of patients with COVID-19 renal function should prevail before and during treatment with remdesivir in COVID- 19.Google monitors you on this domain \u00d712/2/21, 12:31 PM Remdesivir and Acute Renal Failure: A Potential Safety Signal From Disproportionality Analysis of the WHO Safety Database - P ... https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33340409/ 2/2Supplementary conceptsCOVID-19 drug treatment Related information MedGen PubChem Compound (MeSH Keyword) LinkOut - more resources Full Text Sources Ovid Technologies, Inc.

Outbreak investigations suggest that vaccinated persons can spread Delta 3,4. We compared RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) data from 699 swab specimens collected in Wisconsin 29 June through 31 July 2021 and tested with a qualitative assay by a single contract laboratory. Specimens came from residents of 36 counties, most in southern and southeastern Wisconsin, and 81% of cases were not associated with an outbreak. During this time, estimated prevalence of Delta variants in Wisconsin increased from 69% to over 95%. Vaccination status was determined via self-reporting and state immunization records ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). Main text We observed low Ct values (<25) in 212 of 310 fully vaccinated (68%; Figure 1A ) and 246 of 389 (63%) unvaccinated individuals. Testing a subset of low-Ct samples revealed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in 15 of 17 specimens (88%) from unvaccinated individuals and 37 of 39 (95%) from vaccinated people (Figure 1B ). Low Ct values were detected in vaccinated people regardless of symptoms at the time of testing (Figure 1C ). Ct values <25 were detected in 7 of 24 unvaccinated (29%; CI: 13-51%) and 9 of 11 fully vaccinated asymptomatic individuals (82%; CI: 48-97%), and 158 of 232 unvaccinated (68%, CI: and 156 of 225 fully vaccinated (69%; CI: 63-75%) symptomatic individuals. Time from symptom onset to testing did not vary by vaccination status (p=0.40; Supplemental Figure 2 ). Infectious virus was detected in the sole specimen tested from an asymptomatic fully vaccinated individual. Although few asymptomatic individuals were sampled, these results indicate that even asymptomatic, fully vaccinated people might shed infectious virus. Combined with other studies 2-5, these data indicate that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals infected with the Delta variant might transmit infection. Importantly, we show that infectious SARS-CoV- .

The inclusion of viruses from Pango lineages B.1.617.2, AY.2, and AY.3, and multiple counties without a linking outbreak, indicate that Delta-lineage SARS-CoV-2 can achieve low Ct values consistent with transmissibility in fully vaccinated individuals across a range of settings. Vaccinated and unvaccinated persons should get tested when symptomatic or after close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Continued adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions during periods of high community transmission to mitigate spread of COVID-19 remain important for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. .

Concordance between self-reported vaccination status and the Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) or Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS). For all individuals, vaccination status was determined using WIR/WEDSS electronic registries when data were available. Individuals were identified as unvaccinated at the time of testing if WIR/WEDSS data indicated receipt of a first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose after the test date. Individuals were considered fully vaccinated based on WIR/WEDSS data if the registries indicated receipt of a final vaccine dose at least 14 days prior to testing. For individuals whose vaccination status could not be verified in WIR/WEDSS, self-reported data collected at the time of testing were used. Individuals were considered unvaccinated based on self-report only if there was an explicit declaration of unvaccinated status in the self-reported data. Individuals were considered fully vaccinated based on self-report if they fulfilled all of the following criteria: (1) indicated that they had received a COVID vaccine prior to testing; (2) indicated that they did not require another vaccine dose; and (3) reported a date of last vaccine dose that was at least 14 days prior to testing. Specimens lacking data on vaccination status were excluded from the study. Specimens from partially vaccinated individuals (incomplete vaccine series, or <14 days post-final dose) were also excluded. Fully vaccinated status was determined by WIR/WEDSS for 292 specimens and by self-reported data for 18. Unvaccinated status was determined by WIR/WEDSS for 11 and by self-reported data by 378. A.Of the 699 specimens with vaccination status available from at least one source, 165 specimens had data available from both sources.

The results provide hope that people receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will develop similar lasting immune memories after vaccination.12/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-192/5 Colorized scanning electron micrograph of a cell, isolated from a patient sample, that is heavily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (red). NIAIDIntegrated Research Facility, Fort Detrick, MarylandAfter people recover from infection with a virus, the immune system retains a memory of it. Immune cells and proteins that circulate in thebody can recognize and kill the pathogen if it's encountered again, protecting against disease and reducing illness severity.This long-term immune protection involves several components. Antibodies\u2014proteins that circulate in the blood\u2014recognize foreignsubstances like viruses and neutralize them. Different types of T cells help recognize and kill pathogens. B cells make new antibodies whenthe body needs them.All of these immune-system components have been found in people who recover from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But thedetails of this immune response and how long it lasts after infection have been unclear. Scattered reports of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2have raised concerns that the immune response to the virus might not be durable.To better understand immune memory of SARS-CoV-2, researchers led by Drs. Daniela Weiskopf, Alessandro Sette, and Shane Crotty fromthe La Jolla Institute for Immunology analyzed immune cells and antibodies from almost 200 people who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-212/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-193/5and recovered.Time since infection ranged from six days after symptom onset to eight months later. More than 40 participants had been recovered formore than six months before the study began. About 50 people provided blood samples at more than one time after infection.The research was funded in part by NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Cancer Institute (NCI).Results were published on January 6, 2021, in Science .The researchers found durable immune responses in the majority of people studied. Antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,which the virus uses to get inside cells, were found in 98% of participants one month after symptom onset. As seen in previous studies, thenumber of antibodies ranged widely between individuals. But, promisingly, their levels remained fairly stable over time, declining onlymodestly at 6 to 8 months after infection.Virus-specific B cells increased over time. People had more memory B cells six months after symptom onset than at one month afterwards.Although the number of these cells appeared to reach a plateau after a few months, levels didn't decline over the period studied.Levels of T cells for the virus also remained high after infection. Six months after symptom onset, 92% of participants had CD4+ T cells thatrecognized the virus. These cells help coordinate the immune response. About half the participants had CD8+ T cells, which kill cells that areinfected by the virus.As with antibodies, the numbers of different immune cell types varied substantially between individuals. Neither gender nor differences indisease severity could account for this variability. However, 95% of the people had at least 3 out of 5 immune-system components thatcould recognize SARS-CoV-2 up to 8 months after infection.\"Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responseslast,\" Weiskopf says. \"We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-inducedresponses.\"\u2014by Sharon ReynoldsRelated Links Experimental Coronavirus Vaccine Highly Effective (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/experimental- coronavirus-vaccine-highly-effective) Antibodies and T Cells Protect Against SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/antibodies-t-cells- protect-against-sars-cov-2) Immune Cells for Common Cold May Recognize SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-cells- common-cold-may-recognize-sars-cov-2) Potent Neutralizing Antibodies Target New Regions of Coronavirus Spike (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research- matters/potent-neutralizing-antibodies-target-new-regions-coronavirus-spike) Potent Antibodies Found in People Recovered from COVID-19 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/potent- antibodies-found-people-recovered-covid-19) Novel Coronavirus Structure Reveals Targets for Vaccines and matters/novel-coronavirus-structure-reveals-targets-vaccines-treatments) Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://covid19.nih.gov/) Coronavirus Prevention Network (https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/)12/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-194/5Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://www.coronavirus.gov/)References: Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection.

False-negative results may lead to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of SARS-CoV-2, which may cause patient harm including serious illness and death. False- negative results can also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including when presumed negative patients are grouped into cohorts in health care, long-term care, and other facilities based on false test results. False-positive results could lead to a delay in the correct diagnosis and the initiation of an appropriate treatment for the actual cause of patient illness, which could be another life-threatening disease that is not SARS-CoV-2. False-positive results could also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus when presumed positive patients are grouped into cohorts based on false test results.

Curative-Korva SARS-Cov-2 Assay) Emergency Use Authorization was revoked at the company's request effective July 15, 2021, because the company is now using different EUA-authorized tests for the testing offered at its laboratories. The test that is the subject of this safety communication is no longer being offered and is no longer authorized for emergency use by the FDA. Date Issued: January 4, 2021 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting patients and health care providers of the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test. Risks to a patient of a false negative result include: delayed or lack of supportive treatment, lack of monitoring of infected individuals and their household or other close contacts for symptoms resulting in increased risk of spread of COVID-19 within the community, or other unintended adverse events. To reduce the risk of false negative results, it is important to perform the test in accordance with its authorization and as described in the authorized labeling, e.g., the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers (/media/137087/download). When the test is not performed in accordance with its authorization or as described in the authorized labeling, there is a greater risk that the results of the test may not be accurate. Important Recommendations for Health Care Providers, Patients, and Caregivers Be aware of the important information regarding the use of the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test, which is described in the test's authorized labeling, including the following: Collection of nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens is limited to symptomatic individuals within 14 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Specimen collection must be directly observed and directed during the sample collection process by a trained health care worker at the specimen collection site. A negative result does not rule out COVID-19 and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19.

If testing was performed more than two weeks ago, and there is no reason to suspect current SARS-Cov-2 infection, it is not necessary to retest. Patients and caregivers: Talk to your health care provider if you think you were tested with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test (the test name is displayed on this test's authorized Fact Sheets and, generally, the Fact Sheets must be provided with test result reports) and you have concerns about your test results. Report any problems you experience with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test to the FDA, including suspected inaccurate results. Device Description The Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay is a real-time RT-PCR test used to detect SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This test is authorized for prescription-only use. The test is performed by collecting a throat swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or oral fluid specimen from an individual suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider. Under the Emergency Use Authorization, the specimen is then to be processed at the KorvaLabs, Inc., laboratory, and results are returned to the patient. Consistent with the test's authorized labeling (/media/137087/download), collection of nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens is limited to individuals who have shown symptoms of COVID- 19 within 14 days of onset of the symptoms. Specimen collection must be directly observed and directed during the sample collection process by a trained health care worker at the specimen collection site. Consistent with the EUA summary (/media/137089/download), negative results for SARS-Cov- 2 RNA from oral fluid specimens should be confirmed by testing of another specimen type authorized for use with this test if clinically indicated. FDA Actions The FDA regularly monitors the post-authorization use of tests, including reports of problems with test performance or results, and is providing this information to help educate patients, caregivers, and health care providers and reduce the risk of false results. The FDA will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.

Since March 2020, when IVM wasrst used against a new global scourge, COVID-19, more than 20 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have tracked such inpatient and outpatient treatments. Six of seven meta-analyses of IVM treatment RCTs reporting in 2021 found notable reductions in COVID-19 fatalities, with a mean 31% relative risk of mortality vs. controls. During mass IVM treatments in Peru, excess deaths fell by a mean of 74% over 30 days in its ten states with the most extensive treatments. Reductions in deaths correlated with the extent of IVM distributions in all 25 states with p < 0.002. Sharp reductions in morbidity using IVM were also observed in two animal models, of SARS-CoV-2 and a related betacoronavirus. The indicated biological mechanism of IVM, competitive binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, is likely non-epitope specic, possibly yielding full efcacy against emerging viral mutant strains. \u00a9 2021 The by Elsevier E. Scheim. E-mail: dscheim@alum.mit.edu Introduction The 2015 Nobel prize for the discovery of ivermectin (IVM) and an antimalarial treatment was the Nobel committee'srst award for treatment agents for infectious diseases since the one in 1952 for streptomycin [ 1]. 2,3], IVM as deployed worldwide since 1987 has made major inroads against two devastating tropical diseases, onchocerciasis and lymphaticlariasis [ 4]. During the year since IVM treatment wasrst applied to COVID-19, another global scourge [ 5], results from more than 20 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of IVM treatment of COVID-19 have been reported [2,6,7], with inpatient and outpatient treatments of COVID-19 conducted in 25 countries [ 2]. A likely biological mechanismhas been indicated to be competitive binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sites, as reviewed [ 8,9]. Recently, Dr Satoshi Omura, the Nobel co-laureate for the discovery of IVM, and colleagues conducted a comprehensive review of IVM clinical activity against COVID-19, concluding that the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated major reductions in mortality and morbidity [ 2]. Our review of that evidence, updated with consideration of several new studies, supports the same conclusion. Animal studies for IVM treatment of SARS- CoV-2 and a closely related betacoronavirus A framework for the examination of clinical IVM treatment results for COVID-19 is provided by related animal studies using IVM at low human-equivalent doses. In golden hamsters that were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, causing symptomatic COVID-19 infections, concurrent dosing with IVM signicantly reduced the severity of clinical signs New Microbe and New Infect2021;43:100924 \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

In another animal model, mice were infected with mouse hepatitis virus MHV-A59 [ 11], a betacoronavirus strain that does esterase 12], like SARS-CoV-2, SARS- CoV, and 8]. Whereas infected mice had severe histo- pathological liver damage, IVM-treated mice had half the hepatic viral load and minimal liver damage, not signicantly different than that observed in uninfected controls. RCTs for IVM treatment and prevention of COVID-19 More than 20 RCTs for IVM treatment of COVID-19 have been conducted to date, as cited above. A search of Google Scholar for meta-analyses of IVM treatment studies of COVID-19 that appeared in 2021 [ 13] yielded seven such studies that drew conclusions from RCTs only [ 6,14-19 ]. The relative risk (RR) of mortality with IVM treatment vs. controls as calculated in four of these meta-analyses using Cochrane analysis method- ology ranged from 0.25 to 0.37, with a mean of 0.31 [6,14,15,19]. The three other meta-analyses reported odds ratios of 0.16, 0.21 and 0.33, with a mean of 0.23 [ 16-18 ]. Six of these seven meta-analyses concluded that there was a sig- nicant [ 6,14-16 ] or possible [ 17,18] indication of the efcacy of IVM in reducing COVID-19 mortality. One found no evi- dence of IVM efcacy in itsrst version [ 20], reporting an RR of 1.11 for IVM treatment vs. controls, and stuck with thatnding even after changing this RR value to 0.37 and correcting switched treatment and control deaths it had misreported for one study [ 21] in a revised version [ 19]. Among the most recent and comprehensive of these seven meta-analyses re- ported a pooled total of 31 deaths among 1101 subjects in IVM treatment groups and 91 deaths among 1064 controls from 11 RCTs, amounting to a 67% reduction in mortality, with a sta- tistical signicance for an overall effect of p = 0.005 [ 16]. The RCT that used the largest dose of IVM, 400g/kg on each of days 1-4 [ 22], had 2 vs. 24 deaths in the treatment vs. control groups (n = 200 each). An objection that had been raised earlier in 2021 to the preponderance of clinical evidence for the efcacy of IVM treatment of COVID-19 as summarized above was that none of these RCTs had been published in mainstream peer-reviewed scientic journals [ 23]. Closing that gap, however, was the publication in 2021 in journals from major scientic publishers ofve such RCTs for COVID-19 treatment [ 24-28 ], each showing multiple clinical benets for IVM vs. controls, most of these to statistical signicance at p < 0.002. Also published in2021 were three other RCTs for IVM treatment of COVID-19: one that reported briefer hospital stays for IVM treatment short of statistical signicance (p = 0.08) [ 29], another that compared IVM with two other drug treatment groups but not a placebo group and found no benet [ 30], and an additional study conducted in Cali, Columbia with mix-ups between treatment and placebo doses as described below. Another objection that has been raised to the RCT evidence supporting IVM efcacy was that study populations were too small [ 31]. Yet, it is well known in clinical trial design that highly effective drugs will establish statistically signicant results with smaller sample sizes, with larger study populations required for minimally effective drugs [ 32,33]. But for a drug with a more modest RR of 75%, for example, the treatment and control arms would need more than 3800 subjects each to yield the same statistical signicance [ 33]. Although large study populations are useful to screen for adverse effects (AEs) of new drugs, IVM has been used safely in 3.7 billion doses worldwide since 1987 [ 2,3] and is well tolerated even at much greater doses than the stan- dard single dose of 200g/kg [ 34,35]. It has been used in RCTs for COVID-19 treatment at cumulative doses of 1500g/kg [ 36], 1600g/kg [ 22] and 3000g/kg [ 37] over 4 or 5 days with only small percentages of mild or transient adverse effects. Among these RCTs that established safety for high-dose IVM treatment of COVID-19 was one conducted in Cali, Columbia, with generally mild COVID-19 cases, median age 37, having only one death in the control group [ 36]. The study found no statisti- cally signicant symptom improvements with IVM treatment yet reported a striking anomaly: AEs distinctive for its high IVM dose, described in the study protocol as'security parameters'for its IVM use, occurred at almost identical rates in its IVM and placebo arms. These included transient incidences of blurred vision (11.3%, 11.6%) and dizziness (35.6%, 34.3%). These indications of IVM use in controls occurred as over-the-counter sales of IVM surged in the study region during the study period ( Supplementary Table 1 ). Further questions as to the study's treatment/control boundaries were raised by the mistaken substitution of IVM for placebo for 38 patients, discovered by the lead pharmacist a month after the fact (study, p. 3; study protocol supplement, p. 43). In addition, blinding was breached by the use of the dextrose- saline solution as the placebo for 64 control patients (IVM tastes distinctively bitter), while the composition of the replacement placebo solution was not specied [ 38]. Supporting thendings of IVM efcacy in COVID-19 treatment as summarized above were indications of activity against SARS- CoV-2 in prevention studies. Three RCTs evaluated the pro- phylactic effect of IVM administered to cohorts of 100 [ 22], 117 [39] and 203 [ 40] subjects exposed to COVID-19 patients. These studies, all using IVM in doses of at least 150g/kg per week, reported statistically signicant reductions in COVID-192 New Microbes and New Infections, Volume 43 Number C, ---2021 NMNI \u00a9 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd,NMNI,43, 100924 This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ).incidences, with respective RRs of 20%, 26% and 13% as compared with controls, and greater reductions in incidences of moderate and severe cases. Another RCT for COVID-19 prevention administered just one dose of IVM at 12 mg (about 150g/kg) to 617 subjects on day one of a 42-day observation period, while three other preventative regimens were each administered daily over that period [ 41]. IVM at that single low dose yielded the best results of these four regimens, with highly statistically signicant reductions of close to 50% in both symptomatic COVID-19 and acute respiratory symptoms vs. controls. 14-fold reductions in excess deaths with IVM use in Peru, then 13-fold increase after IVM restricted The clinical experience of IVM treatments of COVID-19 in 25 countries extends far beyond the RCT results summarized, yet incomplete tracking and lack of control data exclude most ofthis for evaluation. The record of nationally authorized such treatments in Peru provides a notable exception [ 42]. In ten states of Peru, mass IVM treatments of COVID-19 were con- ducted through a broadside, army-led effort,Mega-Operaci\u00f3n Tayta(MOT), that began on different dates in each state. In theseMOTstates, excess deaths dropped sharply over 30 days from peak deaths by a mean of 74%, in close time conjunction withMOTstart date ( Fig. 1 B). In 14 states of Peru having locally administered IVM distributions, the mean reduction in excess deaths over 30 days from peak deaths was 53%, while in Lima, which had minimal IVM distributions during therst wave of the pandemic due to restrictive government policies there, the corresponding 30-day decrease in excess deaths was 25%. Reductions in excess deaths by state (absolute values) correlated with the extent of IVM distribution (maximal-MOT states, moderate-local distributions, and minimal-Lima) with Kendall b= 0.524, p < 0.002, as shown in Fig. 1 C. Nationwide, excess deaths decreased 14-fold over four months through 1st December 2020. After a restrictive IVM treatment policy was FIG. 1.

Potential confounding factors, including lockdowns and herd immunity, were ruled out using Google community mobility data, seropositivity rates, popula- tion densities and geographic distributions of SARS-CoV-2 ge- netic variations and by restricting all analysis except that for Fig. 1 A to ages60. Excess deaths were used in all analyses rather than COVID-19 case fatalities as gross underreporting of pandemic deaths by case fatalities was known to the Peruvian Ministry of Health since July 2020 [ 43]. This disparity has been consistently manifested in the national health databasegures for COVID-19 case fatalities vs. all natural-cause deaths since that date [ 42]. IVM-based combination treatments and other research in progress Combination treatments using IVM and adjuncts have shown indications of efcacy against COVID-19 in RCTs conducted to date [ 24,44]. Results using IVM, doxycycline and zinc to treat serious and critical cases having spO290 prior to treatment, with spO2 changes tracked 24 hours after treatment, will be reported by TJB with Sabine Hazan, MD. Pronounced im- provements of serious COVID-19 symptoms within 1-2 days after IVM administration have been observed in several patients treated by the lead author (ADS), and studies to objectively track such short-term clinical benets of IVM for COVID-19 are underway. Information on other combination treatments using IVM with agents such asfluvoxamine, for which clinical studies also indicate signicant benets [ 45], is provided by the USA-based FLCCC alliance ( https://covid19criticalcare.com ). The curative potential of combination therapy was demonstrated in a medical breakthrough of three decades prior for another disease, peptic ulcers, for which the dis- covery of its underlying bacterial cause,Helicobacter pylori,was honoured with the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2005. In 1990, Dr Thomas J. Borody published the original clinical trial of a combination treatment forH. pylori, achieving a 96% cure rate for a triple therapy consisting of three repurposed drugs, bismuth subcitrate and two antibiotics [ 46]. Between 1990 and 2015, an estimated 18,665 deaths were prevented by the timely application of this triple therapy for peptic ulcer disease in Australia [ 47]. After the expiration of the patents for two palliative drugs for this condition, Tagamet and Zantac [ 48], which had each earned billions of dollars, triple therapy became the standard of care for peptic ulcers in the rest of the world by the late 1990s.Conclusion We believe that the evidence to date supports the worldwide extension of IVM treatments for COVID-19, complementary to immunizations. The indicated biological mechanism of IVM, competitive binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, is likely non-epitope specic, as reviewed [ 8], possibly yielding full efcacy against emerging viral mutant strains. IVM has been safely used in 3.7 billion doses since 1987, well tolerated even at much greater than standard doses [ 34,35] and used without serious AEs in the three high-dose COVID-19 treatment studies noted above [ 34,36,37]. In the current international emergency of COVID-19, with mutant viral strains, vaccination refusals and potentially waning immunities over months presenting new challenges, IVM can be an effective component of the mix of therapeutics deployed against this pandemic.

Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events, also known as \"safety signals.\" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine. Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines. VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date for which data are available. VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be interpreted in the context of other scientific information. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100% in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to unique events is more than 100%. More information. (/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress) Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 10/08/2021. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated weekly, yet the VAERS system receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. Duplicate event reports and/or reports determined to be false are removed from VAERS. More information. (/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting) Values of Event Category field vary in their availability over time due to changes in the reporting form.

These changes must be considered when evaluating count of events for these categories. About COVID19 vaccines: For more information on how many persons have been vaccinated in the US for COVID19 to date, see https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/ (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations/) . One report may state that the patient received more than one brand of COVID-19 vaccine on the same visit. This is a reporting error, but explains why the total number of reports may not equal the total number of COVID-19 vaccine doses.

Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. I strongly oppose mandatory vaccinations for children, and especially the new Corona virus vaccine. Children's risk of severe illness or death from SARS-COV2 is extremely low. The injury rate of just one of the many adverse events from covid vaccination being tracked by VAERS; myocarditis, is significantly higher than the risk of the disease it is meant to protect children from. In addition, each current covid vaccine available in the U.S. is under Emergency Use Authorization. The only FDA approved covid vaccine is not currently available to consumers in the U.S. Parents must be the only people responsible to make health and medical choices for their children, and no medical treatment should be coerced or mandated upon children. Let's not forget that because these vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of SARS-COV2 but are advertised as a way to reduce symptoms and severity of illness in the injected person, covid vaccination cannot be represented as a \"public health\" measure which has any effect on anyone but the person injected. Anelia Mollova, concerned parentFrom: Dr. Turner Thursday, December 2, 2021 3:47:40 PM WARNING - This email originated from outside the State of Nevada. Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. Dear Dr. Jon Pennell, DVM; Dr. Jeffrey Murawsky, MD; Ponce', DDS; Judith Bittner and Charles Smith:I am contacting you today about any current or future consideration by the NevadaBoard of Health to require that children receive COVID vaccines as a requirement forschool enrollment and attendance in the state of Nevada. I strongly oppose any such measure.My reasons are: 1. Children have the lowest risk of severe disease or death and we must question whether the risk of mRNA vaccine injury outweighs the risk of mild coviddisease in 99.99% of children. If we can not answer that question throughrigorous controlled studies or post EUA monitoring, it is unethical to simplyassume a positive risk reward outcome in this population. 2. Children may have an advantage in getting mild disease as a younger child vs.getting a more severe disease a child ages. Per the CDC, current mRNAvaccines do not prevent spread or infection, but they often prolong the time toinfection as vaccine antibodies wane. Saying vaccines prevent serious diseaseor death is moot in a population that statically already has no risk of seriousdisease or death. 3. Children who have been in school have likely been covid-exposed and alreadyhave robust and durable immunity. 4. There is ample evidence that covid infection and recovery provides robust and durable immunity. Per the CDC, there is no evidence recovered people get repeat covid infections or spread covid. The narrative discounting post-infectionimmunity to support mRNA vaccination is spurious and false. It is well known that recovery from an infection will always provide more reliable immunity than a vaccine for the same disease. Here are 81 studies that say exactly that. 5. Children with robust and durable immunity post-covid infection are already thefoundation of community immunity. Vaccination is not necessary to provide this.Vaccination risk of myocarditis, clots, and neuropathy is well know at this point.Vaccines do not provide long lasting immunity or prevent transmission, butvaccine side effects can be severe and life -altering. 6. This age groups is doing just fine without vaccination. There are not deaths orsevere disease among children 5-17. They are not apparently spreading covidto adults, teachers, parents, or grandparents. The vaccine is available for anyparent that elects to have their child take it. There is no need for an emergencymandate of covid vaccine for this age group. 7. This is the line in the sand for many. Nevada families will leave public school infavor of homeschooling. Public schools can't exist without students. Mandates and school closures have already done more harm than good. 8. These vaccines are currently under EUA, not FDA approved for uptake inchildren ages 5-15. Per federal law, any product licensed under an EUArequires that citizens and therefore in the case of minor children, theirparents/legal guardians, have the option to accept or refuse the product. It isunethical and illegal to mandate these products. In closing, to sum this up one can look at covid disease like a freight train or a tricycle. There is no argument that for certain populations over 65, getting covid can be likebeing hit by a freight train. And the risk of vaccines adverse effects for someone at ornear their life span with high risk may be something they will accept. However, forkids, covid disease is more like being hit by a tricycle. But the small risk of vaccineadverse event, largely unknown at this point, can be like being hit -- quiteunnecessarily -- by a freight train. Best Regards, Caroline TurnerNevada Board of Health Meeting December 3 2021 Agenda Item 3 - Health reports Southern Nevada Health District Report All of this reporting is skewed. The testing process is completely discriminatory. Therefore, there is no way that these numbers are fully accurate as the unvaccinated are being forced to test much more than the vaccinated. This would naturally lead to higher positive cases overall for the unvaccinated. Even though both can equally contract and transmit based on the attached study and admission by the CDC director. This complete discrimination is still going on. Discriminatory treatment of the unvaccinated in hospitals is also happening. The real time database for this reporting that you are basing the livelihoods of Nevada residents on should be disclosed and made public so we can do our own research. The report screen they have published has zero ability to be verified. (Transparency is federal regulated over you) The APA requires that \"administrative policies affecting individual rights and obligations be promulgated pursuant to certain stated procedures so as to avoid the inherently arbitrary nature of unpublished ad hoc determinations.\" Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 232 (1974). The Freedom of Information Act amended the APA to advance this goal, and generally requires that agencies publish in the Federal Register their substantive rules of general applicability, statements of general policy, and interpretations of law that are generally applicable. 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(D). Unless a party has actual and timely notice of the terms of a rule or policy, the Freedom of Information Act generally provides that a party may not be adversely affected by a rule or policy required to be published in the Federal Register that is not so published. 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(flush language). This rule of agency procedure ensures that HHS actions comport with these requirements. II. For a personal example, in my husband's fire station, two fully COVID vaccinated individuals got very sick and tested positive for COVID, the department doctor required the individuals who were contact traced and unvaccinated to quarantine for 10 days and take a negative COVID test before going back to work even though they had previously survived a COVID infection and had ZERO SYMPTOMS and also never did get sick from this contact. However, the sick individuals got cleared to go back once they said they felt better and were not required to quarantine a certain time nor were they required to test to return to work. This is a major flaw in the entire pandemic handling and the numbers over 2 years. I have also attached a study that was released by Harvard University on natural immunity being 13x better than the vaccine, so this would prove that you need to start visiting some hospitals and see what is really going on. PS: I find it amusing that the entire STATE is COVID, COVID, COVID vaccines, masks, etc. Yet when you develop your CHIP team the 4 priorities that are the focus of the community COVID did not make the list. Hypocrisy at its best! Obviously the public wants to move on from this.

Use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death. Recalled Product Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (also distributed under the names Innova COVID-19 Self-Test Kit (3T Configuration), Innova SARS-CoV-2-Antigen Rapid Qualitative (7T Configuration), and SARS-CoV-2-Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (25T Configuration)) Lot codes: X2012711, X2103792 Manufacturing Dates: September 1, 2020 to March 3, 2021 Distribution Dates: November 2, 2020 to March 22, 2021 Devices Recalled in the U.S.: At least 77,339 Date Initiated by Firm: March 24, 2021 Device Description The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test claimed to determine if a person has an active COVID-19 infection.

If the nasal sample had SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a colored test line should have appeared on the test strip, indicating that the personGoogle monitors you on this domain \u00d712/2/21, 3:06 PM Innova Medical Group Recalls Unauthorized SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test with Risk of False Test Results | FDA https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls/innova-medical-group-recalls-unauthorized-sars-cov-2-antigen-rapid-qualitative-test-risk-fa ...2/4may have COVID-19. If the nasal sample did not have SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a colored line should not have appeared on the test strip. The test has not been authorized, cleared, or approved by FDA for commercial distribution in the United States. Reason for Recall Innova Medical Group is recalling its SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test. Labeling distributed with certain configurations of the test includes performance claims that did not accurately reflect the performance estimates observed during the clinical studies of the tests. The performance characteristics of the test have not been adequately established, presenting a risk of false results. False-negative results may lead to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of SARS-CoV-2, which may cause patient harm including serious illness and death. False- negative results can also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including when presumed negative patients are grouped into cohorts in health care, long-term care, and other facilities based on false test results. False-positive results could lead to a delay in the correct diagnosis and the initiation of an appropriate treatment for the actual cause of patient illness, which could be another life-threatening disease that is not SARS-CoV-2. False-positive results could also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus when presumed positive patients are grouped into cohorts based on false test results. Who May Be Affected People who were tested using these devices Health care providers who may have access to and use these tests or whose patients have used these tests Organizers of large testing programs, such as on college campuses, who may be using and distributing these tests for diagnostic use What to Do On April 23, 2021, Innova Medical Group sent all affected device users an Urgent Medical Device Recall letter. The letter provided the following information: Do not use these tests to screen for or diagnose COVID-19. Identify and remove all affected tests from inventory. Either destroy the tests by placing them in the trash or return the tests using the FedEx return label that was included with the letter Innova sent to its customers.Google monitors you on this domain \u00d712/2/21, 3:06 PM Innova Medical Group Recalls Unauthorized SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test with Risk of False Test Results | FDA https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls/innova-medical-group-recalls-unauthorized-sars-cov-2-antigen-rapid-qualitative-test-risk-fa ...3/4Complete and return the form Innova sent to its customers, indicating the number of destroyed or returned tests. The FDA also recommends: Test users and caregivers: Talk to your health care provider if you think you were tested with the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test and you have concerns about your test results. Health care providers: If the test was given less than two weeks ago, consider retesting your patients using a different SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test if you suspect an inaccurate result. If testing was performed more than two weeks ago and there is no reason to suspect current SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not necessary to retest. Testing program organizers: Notify participants in your testing program to discontinue diagnostic use of these tests and to use an FDA-authorized test to continue testing.

Curative-Korva SARS-Cov-2 Assay) Emergency Use Authorization was revoked at the company's request effective July 15, 2021, because the company is now using different EUA-authorized tests for the testing offered at its laboratories. The test that is the subject of this safety communication is no longer being offered and is no longer authorized for emergency use by the FDA. Date Issued: January 4, 2021 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting patients and health care providers of the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test. Risks to a patient of a false negative result include: delayed or lack of supportive treatment, lack of monitoring of infected individuals and their household or other close contacts for symptoms resulting in increased risk of spread of COVID-19 within the community, or other unintended adverse events. To reduce the risk of false negative results, it is important to perform the test in accordance with its authorization and as described in the authorized labeling, e.g., the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers (/media/137087/download). When the test is not performed in accordance with its authorization or as described in the authorized labeling, there is a greater risk that the results of the test may not be accurate. Important Recommendations for Health Care Providers, Patients, and Caregivers Be aware of the important information regarding the use of the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test, which is described in the test's authorized labeling, including the following: Collection of nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens is limited to symptomatic individuals within 14 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Specimen collection must be directly observed and directed during the sample collection process by a trained health care worker at the specimen collection site. A negative result does not rule out COVID-19 and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19.

If testing was performed more than two weeks ago, and there is no reason to suspect current SARS-Cov-2 infection, it is not necessary to retest. Patients and caregivers: Talk to your health care provider if you think you were tested with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test (the test name is displayed on this test's authorized Fact Sheets and, generally, the Fact Sheets must be provided with test result reports) and you have concerns about your test results. Report any problems you experience with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test to the FDA, including suspected inaccurate results. Device Description The Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay is a real-time RT-PCR test used to detect SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This test is authorized for prescription-only use. The test is performed by collecting a throat swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or oral fluid specimen from an individual suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider. Under the Emergency Use Authorization, the specimen is then to be processed at the KorvaLabs, Inc., laboratory, and results are returned to the patient. Consistent with the test's authorized labeling (/media/137087/download), collection of nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens is limited to individuals who have shown symptoms of COVID- 19 within 14 days of onset of the symptoms. Specimen collection must be directly observed and directed during the sample collection process by a trained health care worker at the specimen collection site. Consistent with the EUA summary (/media/137089/download), negative results for SARS-Cov- 2 RNA from oral fluid specimens should be confirmed by testing of another specimen type authorized for use with this test if clinically indicated. FDA Actions The FDA regularly monitors the post-authorization use of tests, including reports of problems with test performance or results, and is providing this information to help educate patients, caregivers, and health care providers and reduce the risk of false results. The FDA will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.

The results provide hope that people receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will develop similar lasting immune memories after vaccination.12/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-192/5 Colorized scanning electron micrograph of a cell, isolated from a patient sample, that is heavily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (red). NIAIDIntegrated Research Facility, Fort Detrick, MarylandAfter people recover from infection with a virus, the immune system retains a memory of it. Immune cells and proteins that circulate in thebody can recognize and kill the pathogen if it's encountered again, protecting against disease and reducing illness severity.This long-term immune protection involves several components. Antibodies\u2014proteins that circulate in the blood\u2014recognize foreignsubstances like viruses and neutralize them. Different types of T cells help recognize and kill pathogens. B cells make new antibodies whenthe body needs them.All of these immune-system components have been found in people who recover from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But thedetails of this immune response and how long it lasts after infection have been unclear. Scattered reports of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2have raised concerns that the immune response to the virus might not be durable.To better understand immune memory of SARS-CoV-2, researchers led by Drs. Daniela Weiskopf, Alessandro Sette, and Shane Crotty fromthe La Jolla Institute for Immunology analyzed immune cells and antibodies from almost 200 people who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-212/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-193/5and recovered.Time since infection ranged from six days after symptom onset to eight months later. More than 40 participants had been recovered formore than six months before the study began. About 50 people provided blood samples at more than one time after infection.The research was funded in part by NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Cancer Institute (NCI).Results were published on January 6, 2021, in Science .The researchers found durable immune responses in the majority of people studied. Antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,which the virus uses to get inside cells, were found in 98% of participants one month after symptom onset. As seen in previous studies, thenumber of antibodies ranged widely between individuals. But, promisingly, their levels remained fairly stable over time, declining onlymodestly at 6 to 8 months after infection.Virus-specific B cells increased over time. People had more memory B cells six months after symptom onset than at one month afterwards.Although the number of these cells appeared to reach a plateau after a few months, levels didn't decline over the period studied.Levels of T cells for the virus also remained high after infection. Six months after symptom onset, 92% of participants had CD4+ T cells thatrecognized the virus. These cells help coordinate the immune response. About half the participants had CD8+ T cells, which kill cells that areinfected by the virus.As with antibodies, the numbers of different immune cell types varied substantially between individuals. Neither gender nor differences indisease severity could account for this variability. However, 95% of the people had at least 3 out of 5 immune-system components thatcould recognize SARS-CoV-2 up to 8 months after infection.\"Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responseslast,\" Weiskopf says. \"We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-inducedresponses.\"\u2014by Sharon ReynoldsRelated Links Experimental Coronavirus Vaccine Highly Effective (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/experimental- coronavirus-vaccine-highly-effective) Antibodies and T Cells Protect Against SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/antibodies-t-cells- protect-against-sars-cov-2) Immune Cells for Common Cold May Recognize SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-cells- common-cold-may-recognize-sars-cov-2) Potent Neutralizing Antibodies Target New Regions of Coronavirus Spike (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research- matters/potent-neutralizing-antibodies-target-new-regions-coronavirus-spike) Potent Antibodies Found in People Recovered from COVID-19 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/potent- antibodies-found-people-recovered-covid-19) Novel Coronavirus Structure Reveals Targets for Vaccines and matters/novel-coronavirus-structure-reveals-targets-vaccines-treatments) Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://covid19.nih.gov/) Coronavirus Prevention Network (https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/)12/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-194/5Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://www.coronavirus.gov/)References: Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection.

Outbreak investigations suggest that vaccinated persons can spread Delta 3,4. We compared RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) data from 699 swab specimens collected in Wisconsin 29 June through 31 July 2021 and tested with a qualitative assay by a single contract laboratory. Specimens came from residents of 36 counties, most in southern and southeastern Wisconsin, and 81% of cases were not associated with an outbreak. During this time, estimated prevalence of Delta variants in Wisconsin increased from 69% to over 95%. Vaccination status was determined via self-reporting and state immunization records ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). Main text We observed low Ct values (<25) in 212 of 310 fully vaccinated (68%; Figure 1A ) and 246 of 389 (63%) unvaccinated individuals. Testing a subset of low-Ct samples revealed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in 15 of 17 specimens (88%) from unvaccinated individuals and 37 of 39 (95%) from vaccinated people (Figure 1B ). Low Ct values were detected in vaccinated people regardless of symptoms at the time of testing (Figure 1C ). Ct values <25 were detected in 7 of 24 unvaccinated (29%; CI: 13-51%) and 9 of 11 fully vaccinated asymptomatic individuals (82%; CI: 48-97%), and 158 of 232 unvaccinated (68%, CI: and 156 of 225 fully vaccinated (69%; CI: 63-75%) symptomatic individuals. Time from symptom onset to testing did not vary by vaccination status (p=0.40; Supplemental Figure 2 ). Infectious virus was detected in the sole specimen tested from an asymptomatic fully vaccinated individual. Although few asymptomatic individuals were sampled, these results indicate that even asymptomatic, fully vaccinated people might shed infectious virus. Combined with other studies 2-5, these data indicate that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals infected with the Delta variant might transmit infection. Importantly, we show that infectious SARS-CoV- .

The inclusion of viruses from Pango lineages B.1.617.2, AY.2, and AY.3, and multiple counties without a linking outbreak, indicate that Delta-lineage SARS-CoV-2 can achieve low Ct values consistent with transmissibility in fully vaccinated individuals across a range of settings. Vaccinated and unvaccinated persons should get tested when symptomatic or after close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Continued adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions during periods of high community transmission to mitigate spread of COVID-19 remain important for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. .

Concordance between self-reported vaccination status and the Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) or Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS). For all individuals, vaccination status was determined using WIR/WEDSS electronic registries when data were available. Individuals were identified as unvaccinated at the time of testing if WIR/WEDSS data indicated receipt of a first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose after the test date. Individuals were considered fully vaccinated based on WIR/WEDSS data if the registries indicated receipt of a final vaccine dose at least 14 days prior to testing. For individuals whose vaccination status could not be verified in WIR/WEDSS, self-reported data collected at the time of testing were used. Individuals were considered unvaccinated based on self-report only if there was an explicit declaration of unvaccinated status in the self-reported data. Individuals were considered fully vaccinated based on self-report if they fulfilled all of the following criteria: (1) indicated that they had received a COVID vaccine prior to testing; (2) indicated that they did not require another vaccine dose; and (3) reported a date of last vaccine dose that was at least 14 days prior to testing. Specimens lacking data on vaccination status were excluded from the study. Specimens from partially vaccinated individuals (incomplete vaccine series, or <14 days post-final dose) were also excluded. Fully vaccinated status was determined by WIR/WEDSS for 292 specimens and by self-reported data for 18. Unvaccinated status was determined by WIR/WEDSS for 11 and by self-reported data by 378.

ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Health and Human Services is issuing regulations promoting transparency and fairness in civil enforcement actions. These regulations will help to ensure that regulated parties receive fair notice of laws and regulations they are subject to, and have an opportunity to contest an agency determination prior to the agency taking an action that has a legal consequence. DATES: Effective January 12, 2021. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brenna Jenny, Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence, Avenue, S.W., Room 713F, Washington, D.C. 20201. Email: Good.Guidance@hhs.gov. Telephone: (202) 690- 7741. I. Statutory and Regulatory Background The primary legal authority supporting this rulemaking is 5 U.S.C. 301. That provision provides that the \"head of an Executive department or military department may prescribe regulations for the government of his department, the conduct of its employees, the distribution and performance of its business, and the custody, use, and preservation of its records, papers, and property.\" This statute authorizes an \"agency to regulate its own affairs,\" and issue rules, such as this one, that are \"rules of agency organization[,] procedure or practice.\" Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 309-10 (1979). Similarly, 42 U.S.C. 1302 provides that the Secretary \"shall make and publish such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with this chapter, as may be necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which [he] is charged\" under Chapter 7 of the Social Security Act. Chapter 7 contains, among other things, statutory provisions governing Medicare, Medicaid, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., specifies the process by which such regulations are promulgated. Department heads generally must prescribe regulations through notice-and-comment rulemaking, but there is an exception for \"rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\" The requirements for notice and comment prior to finalization also do not apply to regulations that involve \"a matter relating to agency management or personnel.\" 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). Because this final rule only specifies procedures that agency personnel must follow or that will govern civil enforcement actions, it is exempt from the requirement for notice and comment prior to finalization. In determining whether notice-and-comment rulemaking is required, the \"critical feature is that [the rule] covers agency actions that do not themselves alter the rights or interests of the parties, although it may alter the manner in which the parties present themselves or their viewpoints to the agency.\" Nat'l Sec. Counselors v. CIA, 931 F. Supp. 2d 106-07 (D.D.C. 2013) (quoting Batterton v. Marshall, 648 F.2d 694, 707 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). This rule is exempt from notice and comment because it does not \"put[] a stamp of approval or disapproval on a given type of behavior.\" Am. Hosp. Assoc. v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 1987). What had been a regulatory violation prior to finalization of this rule still is; the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\" or \"the Department\") is only modifying the procedures governing civil enforcement actions and the Department's civil enforcement action practices. To be sure, these procedural modifications, like most rules of agency procedure or personnel, might have some impact on the public. But agency rules that impose \"derivative,\" \"incidental,\" or \"mechanical\" burdens upon regulated individuals are considered procedural, rather than substantive, and are therefore exempt from the notice-and-comment requirement. Id. at 1051. Moreover, to the extent this rule has effects on the public, it only provides additional protections to the public, rather than depriving the public of any rights or interests it previously had. The APA requires that \"administrative policies affecting individual rights and obligations be promulgated pursuant to certain stated procedures so as to avoid the inherently arbitrary nature of unpublished ad hoc determinations.\" Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 232 (1974). The Freedom of Information Act amended the APA to advance this goal, and generally requires that agencies publish in the Federal Register their substantive rules of general applicability, statements of general policy, and interpretations of law that are generally applicable. 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(D). Unless a party has actual and timely notice of the terms of a rule or policy, the Freedom of Information Act generally provides that a party may not be adversely affected by a rule or policy required to be published in the Federal Register that is not so published. 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1)(flush language). This rule of agency procedure ensures that HHS actions comport with these requirements. II. Summary of Transparency and Fairness Regulations To provide regulated parties with greater transparency and fairness in administrative actions, and consistent with the requirements of Executive Order 13892 of October 9, 2019, \"Promoting the Rule of Law Through Transparency and Fairness in Civil Administrative Enforcement and Adjudication,\" 84 FR 55239 (Oct. 15, 2019), HHS is setting forth policies that promote transparency and fairness in civil enforcement actions that will apply to all divisions of HHS. The requirements in this rule amend 45 CFR part 1. This rule is one component of the Department's broader regulatory reform initiative. The rule is designed to ensure accountability, fairness of how the Department uses guidance, proper use of guidance documents, and opportunities for third parties to be heard, and to safeguard the important principles underlying the United States administrative law system. A. Scope (45 CFR 1.1) The requirements established pursuant to this rule in \u00a7\u00a7 1.2(b) and 1.6 through 1.9 apply to civil enforcement actions by any component of the Department. Sections 1.3 through 1.5 (as well as the definitions in \u00a7 1.2 that were added through the Good Guidance Practices final rule at 85 FR 78770 (Dec. 7, 2020), and that we will recodify in this rule at \u00a7 1.2(a)) will continue to apply to all guidance documents until FDA amends its good guidance practices regulation to be consistent with the HHS Good Guidance Practices rule, at which point \u00a7\u00a7 1.2(a) and 1.3 through 1.5 shall apply to all divisions of HHS except FDA. Nothing in this rule shall apply: To any action that pertains to foreign or military affairs, or to a national security or homeland security function of the United States (other than procurement actions and actions involving the import or export of nondefense articles and services); To any action related to a criminal investigation or prosecution, including undercover operations, or any civil enforcement action or related investigation by the Department of Justice, including any action related to a civil investigative demand under 18 U.S.C. 1968; To any action related to detention, seizure, or destruction of counterfeit goods, pirated goods, or other goods that infringe intellectual property rights; To any investigation of misconduct by an agency employee or any disciplinary, corrective, or employment action taken against an agency employee; or In any other circumstance or proceeding to which application of this order, or any part of this order, would, in the judgment of the Secretary of HHS, undermine the national security.B. Definitions (45 CFR 1.2) The definitions section at 45 CFR 1.2 is amended to include the following definitions at paragraph (b). Civil Enforcement Action HHS defines \"civil enforcement action\" to mean an action with legal consequence taken by the Department based on an alleged violation of the law. Such actions include administrative enforcement proceedings and enforcement adjudication (which is the administrative process undertaken by any component of the Department to resolve the legal rights and obligations of specific parties with regard to a particular enforcement issue pending before it) but do not include actions taken in the normal course of the Department's regulatory communications or decision-making, for example, decisions on product applications (such as approvals or denials/withdrawals of approval), claims authorizations, responses to citizen petitions, food or color additive petitions, or public health notifications. Legal Consequence HHS defines \"legal consequence\" as the result of an action that directly or indirectly affects substantive legal rights or obligations including by subjecting a regulated party to potential liability in an enforcement action. The meaning of this term is informed by the Supreme Court's discussion inU.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co., 136 S. Ct. 1807, 1813-16 (2016), and includes, for example, agency letters or orders establishing or increasing the probability of liability for regulated parties in a subsequent enforcement action, Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Azar, 943 F.3d 953, 956 (D.C. Cir. 2019); Rhea v. Dep't of Labor, 824 F.3d 1023, 1030 (D.C. Cir. 2016). It does not include a warning letter or other communication, such as one describing inspectional observations, that pursuant to agency policy is intended to provide notice to a regulated party and elicit voluntary compliance. Such warning letters and inspectional observations have no immediate regulatory implications for the entity, are an interim step in the agency's compliance communications with an entity, and are not final agency action that has legal consequences for a party. See Orton Motor, Inc. v. HHS, 884 F.3d 1205, 1215 (D.C. Cir. 2018); Holistic Candlers & Consumers Ass'n v. FDA, 664 F.3d 940 (D.C. Cir. 2012); see also Hi-Tech Pharm., WL 248962, *5 (D. Colo. Jan. 16, Sebelius, No. 10-CV-00147-ABJ, 2010 WL 3119279, *11 (D. Wyo. July 26, 2010), aff'd, 446 F. App'x 964, 969 (10th Cir. Azar, No. 1:19-cv-00345-DCN, 2020 WL 3963864, *4-5 (D. Idaho July 13, 2020). Unfair Surprise HHS defines \"unfair surprise\" to mean a lack of reasonable certainty or fair warning, from the perspective of a reasonably prudent member of regulated industry, of what a legal standard administered by an agency requires, or the initiation of litigation by HHS following \"a very lengthy period of conspicuous inaction,\" in other words deliberate inaction, suggesting the agency previously had a different interpretation. Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S. 142, 156 (2012). However, an agency does not create unfair surprise when it proceeds with a new interpretation that it established in notice-and-comment rulemaking. See Martin v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm'n, 499 U.S. 144, 158 (1991) (identifying \"adequacy of notice to regulated parties\" as one factor relevant to the reasonableness of the agency's interpretation). The definitions currently at 45 CFR 1.2 will be moved into a new paragraph (a). All definitions at paragraph (a) apply to all components of HHS until FDA amends its good guidance practices regulation, at which point the definitions at 45 CFR 1.2(a) shall apply to all divisions of HHS except FDA. The definitions at \u00a7 1.2(b) will apply to all components of the Department, including FDA. C. Proper Department Reliance on Guidance Documents (45 CFR 1.6) This rule reiterates the application of certain existing legal principles to HHS's use of guidance documents: When the Department takes a civil enforcement action or otherwise makes a determination based on an alleged violation of law that has legal consequence for a person or state, it must allege or establish the violation of law by applying statutes or regulations. HHS may not use guidance documents to impose binding requirements or prohibitions on persons outside of the executive branch except as authorized by law or expressly incorporated into a contract. Noncompliance with a standard or practice that is not in a statute or regulation and announced solely in a guidance document may not be treated as itself a violation of applicable statutes or regulations, unless expressly authorized by statute. This rule also explains the appropriate circumstances when the Department may use a guidance document in civil enforcement actions. The Department may use a guidance document to explain the legal applicability of a statute or regulation with regard to prohibition of conduct, but when it does so, HHS may only use the guidance document to articulate the Department's understanding of how a statute or regulation applies to particular circumstances. Except when referring to a guidance document for historical facts, the Department may reference a guidance document in a civil enforcement action only if it has notified the public of such document to convey that understanding in advance. The Department must notify the public in advance of a guidance document through publication in the Department's guidance repository (as described in \u00a7 1.4 and available at hhs.gov/guidance). D. Fairness and Notice in Civil Enforcement Actions and Administrative Inspections (45 CFR 1.7) This rule would require the Department to only apply standards or practices that have been publicly stated in a manner that would not cause unfair surprise when HHS takes a civil enforcement action or otherwise makes a determination based on an alleged violation of law that has legal consequence for a person or state, unless a statutory exception applies. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1395hh(e). For purposes of this regulation, the Department would consider standards or practices to be publicly stated if available in paper publications or on the internet.HHS avoids unfair surprise not only when it imposes penalties but also whenever it adjudges past conduct to have violated the law. For example, the Department generally cannot retroactively impose liability on a party for conduct that violates a new agency interpretation. But see 42 U.S.C. 1395hh(e). The Department also may not alter its interpretation during an adjudicative proceeding if doing so would impose new liability on parties who have acted in good faith on the prior interpretation. SmithKline Beecham, 567 U.S. at 156 & n.15. Section 7 of Executive Order 13892 requires that each agency that conducts civil administrative inspections must publish a rule of agency procedure governing such inspections, if such a rule does not already exist. The Department is adding a requirement at 45 CFR 1.7 that HHS shall only conduct civil administrative inspections according to published rules of agency procedure. While the Administrative Procedure Act exempts these subsequently issued rules of agency procedure themselves from notice-and-comment rulemaking, see 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A), each agency must make the rules governing its civil administrative inspections, including audits, publicly available and readily accessible, such as by posting them on a website. E. Fairness and Notice in Jurisdictional Determinations (45 CFR 1.8) The requirement for fairness and notice also extends to jurisdictional determinations. If the Department relies on a decision previously issued by an agency within the Department in an agency adjudication (i.e., proceedings before and decided by the agency), administrative order, or agency document to assert a new or expanded claim of jurisdiction (e.g., a claim to regulate a new subject matter or a new basis for liability, or a relinquishment of a claim of jurisdiction), the Department must give fair notice by publishing the initial decision in the Federal Register or the Department's guidance repository. See 45 CFR 1.4. The Department should not rely on the new claim of jurisdiction to take a civil enforcement action regarding conduct that occurred before such publication. A claim of jurisdiction is not \"new or expanded\" simply because it involves a new or novel set of facts so long as it is based on an established principle of general applicability. If the Department intends to rely on a document arising out of litigation (other than a publicly published opinion of an adjudicator) such as a brief, a consent decree, or a settlement agreement, to establish jurisdiction in future civil enforcement actions involving persons who were not parties to the litigation, the Department must also publish that document in the Federal Register or on the Department's guidance repository. Alongside publication of the document, the Department must also provide an explanation of the document's jurisdictional implications. Publication of a document discussed in this paragraph may either be in full or by citation, if the document is publicly available. HHS is also proposing that if the Department seeks judicial deference to its interpretation of a document arising out of litigation (other than a publicly published opinion of an adjudicator) in order to establish a new or expanded claim of jurisdiction, HHS must, before seeking judicial deference, publish the document or a notice of availability in the Federal Register or on the Department's guidance repository, along with an explanation of the document's jurisdictional implications. F. Opportunity to Contest Agency Determinations (45 CFR 1.9) Providing regulated parties with the opportunity to be heard, including through informal oral or written communications, prior to the Department taking any civil enforcement action that has legal consequence is critical to ensuring that the Department operates with transparency and fairness. This rule will require that, before any component of the Department takes any civil enforcement action with respect to a particular entity that has legal consequence for that entity\u2014 including by issuing to such a person a notice of noncompliance or other similar notice that has immediate regulatory consequence or the immediate effect of subjecting the person to potential liability\u2014the Department must afford that person an opportunity to be heard, either orally or in writing, as deemed appropriate at the Department's election. The rule will require HHS to provide the person with its proposed legal and factual determinations and then give the person a reasonable amount of time to respond to those determinations. The specific timeframe shall be in the discretion of the agency but must be long enough to provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Certain circumstances may warrant a time period of 30 days, while other circumstances may warrant a shorter period, such as 15 days or fewer, particularly where existing agency procedures already offer a shorter period in which to respond. Unless the Department withdraws the action, the Department must then respond in writing to the regulated party and articulate the final basis for the Department's action. This written response may be issued contemporaneous to the Department taking the action with legal consequence. We anticipate that generally, existing HHS procedures will already satisfy these standards, and where they do, those existing procedures will continue in effect unchanged. This rulemaking is not intended to preempt existing rules of agency procedure that are already consistent with this rule. Furthermore, where the Department takes an action based on a predicate finding that was reached following notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a written response, for example, where the Department revokes Medicare enrollment based on a prior exclusion or felony conviction, these procedural requirements are considered to have already been satisfied. These procedures regarding fair notice and an opportunity to respond would not apply where the agency, in its discretion, determines there is a serious threat to health, safety, or similar emergency, or where a statute specifically authorizes proceedings that are inconsistent with this section, including proceedings without a prior opportunity to be heard. Where such a threat arises and a statute does not specifically authorize proceedings without a prior opportunity to be heard, HHS would still provide an affected entity with an opportunity to be heard and a written response as soon as practicable. In this context, a serious threat means that, as reasonably determined by the Department, there is a non-negligible likelihood of the threat materializing. We anticipate that the exception from \u00a7 1.9 for actions taken in the context of threats to health, safety, or similar emergencies will apply broadly to public health agencies acting in furtherance of their missions. Actions will be considered to fall into this exception regardless of whether there is a showing of actual, imminent risk or harm, either to persons or animals. The agency has sole discretion to determine when an action falls into this exception. An agency may invoke this exception regardless of whether agency action is taken reactively (e.g., to address an unsafe item currently on the market) or proactively (e.g., to enforce regulations needed to protect public health prior to actual exposure by the public to unsafe items). Actions that fall into this exception include, for example, enforcing age restrictions or other controls around access to certain regulated products, enforcing manufacturer recordkeeping or reporting requirements, enforcing premarket requirements where there is an absence of or insufficient data concerning the product, protecting beneficiary data privacy or a federal healthcare program beneficiary from harm, and taking action to remove unapproved, misbranded, or adulterated human or animal products from the market. Because of this exception, the procedures in \u00a7 1.9 generally will not impact, for example, the administrative detention process for foods, drugs, devices, and tobacco products (21 U.S.C. 334(g), (h)), the detention, refusal, and where authorized, destruction of imported products regulated by FDA (21 U.S.C. 381), disqualification (21 CFR parts 56, 58, 312, 511, 812), administrative detention, recall requests, import alerts, or other public notifications about food, drug, device, or tobacco products, or other actions related to investigating adulterated or misbranded products. These procedures would also not apply to settlement negotiations between agencies and regulated parties, to notices of a prospective legal action, where a statute specifically precludes review of agency action, or to litigation before courts. Examples of situations where statutes specifically authorize differently structured proceedings include, but are not limited to, the hospital cost report appeals process (42 U.S.C. 1395oo), the individual benefit claims appeals process (42 U.S.C. 1395ff), and the process for the review of disallowances of Medicaid expenditures by the Secretary (42 U.S.C. 1316(e)). In such circumstances, the process and substantive standards governing review of claims arising under a relevant statute or regulation remain governed by those more specific procedures. The procedures would also not apply to any action related to a criminal investigation or prosecution, including undercover operations that may be used in a criminal investigation or prosecution, or any civil enforcement action either related to an investigation by the Department of Justice, or referred to the Department of Justice. III. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices A. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 Executive Order 12866, \"Regulatory Planning and Review,\" and Executive Order 13563, \"Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,\" direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if the regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. The Department does not believe that this rulemaking is a significant regulatory action under these Executive Orders. This rule describes an update to the Department's current processes to ensure that it operates with transparency and fairness. The requirements in 45 CFR 1.6 through 1.9 relating to the proper use of guidance documents and fairness and notice in enforcement actions generally already exist in law. The requirements set forth in Section 6 of Executive Order 13892 and codified at 45 CFR 1.6 may exceed the requirements imposed by the Due Process clause of the Constitution and may impose a burden by delaying the time until HHS can take actions with legal consequence. However, this process will also offer important procedural safeguards and potentially reduce economic costs borne by regulated entities, which will have an opportunity to respond in writing before the Department takes an action that has (potentially costly) legal consequence. The Department anticipates that the public, and, in particular, regulated parties, would benefit from greater efficiencies and more transparency in how the Department regulates, including facilitating smoother operations within HHS by clearly defining how guidance can be used.B. Executive Order 13771 This final rule is neither a regulatory nor a deregulatory action under Executive Order 13771, \"Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,\" 82 FR 9339 (Feb. 3, 2017), because this rule is estimated to impose no more than de minimis costs on regulated entities. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Department has examined the economic implications of this rule as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. The RFA requires an agency to describe the impact of a rulemaking on small entities by providing an initial regulatory flexibility analysis, unless the agency expects that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, provides a factual basis for this determination, and proposes to certify the statement. 5 U.S.C. 603(a), 605(b). The Department considers a proposed or final rule to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities if it has at least a three percent impact on revenue on at least five percent of small entities. The Department anticipates that this rule will allow small entities to operate more efficiently, by increasing the transparency of government regulation. As a result, the Department has determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small entities. D. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) Executive Order 13132, \"Federalism,\" establishes certain requirements that an agency must meet when it promulgates a rule that imposes substantial direct requirement costs on State and local governments or has Federalism implications. The Department has determined that this final rule will not impose such costs or have any federalism implications. E. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and its implementing regulations, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521; 5 CFR part 1320, the Department has reviewed this rule and has determined that it imposes no new collections of information.List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1 Guidance, Government employess. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department of Health and Human Services amends 45 CFR Part I as set forth below: PART 1\u2014TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS IN CIVIL ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AND ADJUDICATION 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 1302, 5 U.S.C. 301, 551 et seq. 2. Section 1.1 is revised to read as follows: \u00a7 1.1 Scope. Sections 1.2(a) and 1.3 through 1.5 of this part shall apply to guidance documents issued by all components of the Department, until the Secretary amends the Food and Drug Administration's good guidance regulations at 21 CFR 10.115 to bring them into conformance with the requirements of this part, at which point, such amended regulations shall apply to the Food and Drug Administration, and \u00a7\u00a7 1.2(a) and 1.3 through 1.5 shall apply to all divisions of the Department except the Food and Drug Administration. Sections 1.2(b) and 1.6 through 1.9 of this part shall apply to all components of the Department. 3. Section 1.2 is amended by designating the existing text as paragraph (a) followed by the alphabetical ordered definitions, revising newly designated paragraph (a) introductory text, and adding paragraph (b). The revision and addition read as follows: \u00a7 1.2 Definitions. (a) The following definitions apply to all components of the Department until the Secretary amends the Food and Drug Administration's good guidance regulations at 21 CFR 10.115 to bring them into conformance with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1.3 through 1.5 of this part:* * * * * (b) The following definitions apply to all components of the Department: Civil enforcement action means an action with legal consequence taken by the Department based on an alleged violation of the law. Such actions include administrative enforcement proceedings and enforcement adjudication (which is the administrative process undertaken by any component of the Department to resolve the legal rights and obligations of specific parties with regard to a particular enforcement issue pending before it) but do not include actions taken in the normal course of the Department's regulatory communications or decision-making, for example, decisions on product applications (such as approvals, denials, or withdrawals of approval), claims authorizations, citizen petitions, food or color additive petitions, or public health notifications. Legal consequence means the result of an action that directly or indirectly affects substantive legal rights or obligations, including by subjecting a regulated party to potential liability in an enforcement action. This includes agency letters or orders establishing greater liability for regulated parties in a subsequent enforcement action, but excludes communications that have no immediate regulatory implications for a person or entity, such as letters (e.g., warning letters) or inspectional observations that serve as an interim step in the agency's compliance communications with a person or entity or that are intended to encourage voluntary compliance. Unfair surprise means a lack of reasonable certainty or fair warning, from the perspective of a reasonably prudent member of regulated industry, of what a legal standard administered by an agency requires. 4. Section 1.6 is added to read as follows: \u00a7 1.6 Proper Department reliance on guidance documents. (a) Overview. A civil enforcement action must have an appropriate legal basis. When the Department takes a civil enforcement action or makes a determination based on an alleged violation of law that has legal consequence for a person or state, it must allege or establish the violation of law by applying statutes or regulations. (b) Limitations on the use of guidance documents. (1) The Department may not use guidance documents to impose binding requirements or prohibitions on persons outside the executive branch except as expressly authorized by law or as expressly incorporated into a contract. (2) The Department may not treat noncompliance with a standard or practice announced solely in a guidance document as itself a violation of applicable statutes or regulations except as expressly authorized by law. (3) If the Department uses a guidance document to explain the legal applicability of a statute or regulation, that document can do no more, with respect to prohibition of conduct, than articulate the Department's understanding of how a statute or regulation applies to particular circumstances. (4) The Department may cite to a guidance document in a civil enforcement action only if it has notified the public of such document in advance through publication, in the Department's guidance repository, as described in \u00a7 1.4. 5. Section 1.7 is added to read as follows: \u00a7 1.7 Fairness and notice in civil enforcement actions and administrative inspections. (a) When the Department takes a civil enforcement action, the Department may only apply standards or practices that have been publicly stated in a manner that would not cause unfair surprise. (b) The Department must avoid unfair surprise when it imposes penalties and whenever it adjudges past conduct to have violated the law. (c) The Department shall only conduct civil administrative inspections according to published rules of agency procedure. 6. Section 1.8 is added to read as follows:\u00a7 1.8 Fairness and notice in jurisdictional determinations. (a) If the Department relies on a decision in an agency adjudication, administrative order, or agency document to assert a new or expanded claim of jurisdiction (e.g., a claim to regulate a new subject matter or a new basis for liability, or a relinquishment of a claim of jurisdiction), the Department must give fair notice by publishing the initial decision before the conduct over which jurisdiction is sought occurs. It must publish the initial decision in full or by citation, if publicly available, in the Federal Register or the Department's guidance repository described in \u00a7 1.4. A claim of jurisdiction is not \"new or expanded\" simply because it involves a new or novel set of facts so long as it is based on an established principle of general applicability. (b) If the Department intends to rely on a document arising out of litigation (other than a publicly published opinion of an adjudicator), such as a brief, a consent decree, or a settlement agreement, to establish jurisdiction in future civil enforcement actions involving persons who were not parties to the litigation, the Department must\u2014 (1) Publish that document, either in full or by citation if publicly available, in the Federal Register or on the Department's guidance repository described in \u00a7 1.4, and (2) Publish an explanation of the document's jurisdictional implications. (c) Before seeking judicial deference to the Department's interpretation of a document arising out of litigation (other than a publicly published opinion of an adjudicator) in order to establish a new or expanded claim of jurisdiction in a different case, the Department must\u2014 (1) Publish the document or a notice of availability in the Federal Register or on the Department's guidance repository described in \u00a7 1.4, and (2) Publish an explanation of the document's jurisdictional implications. 7. Section 1.9 is added to read as follows: \u00a7 1.9 Opportunity to contest agency determination. (a) Departmental overview. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, prior to the Department taking any civil enforcement action with respect to a particular entity that has legal consequence for that entity, including by issuing to such a person a notice of noncompliance, or other similar notice that has immediate regulatory consequence, but excluding communications that have no immediate regulatory implications for the entity, such as those that serve as an interim step in the agency's compliance communications with the entity or that are intended to encourage voluntary compliance, the Department shall provide\u2014 (1) Written notice to the affected entity of the initial legal and factual determinations underpinning the initial adverse determination; (2) An opportunity for the affected entity to respond in writing and, if determined appropriate by the Department, orally; and (3) A written response from the Department to the affected entity after receiving a timely request from the affected entity under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (b) Timing and content of written responses. (1) The Department will select a meaningful amount of time in which the affected entity must submit a written response to the Department. This writing must be submitted within the time period specified by the Department, unless the Department concludes an extension is warranted, and state the reasons for the entity's disagreement with the Department's proposed action for purposes of requiring a response in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section. (2) The Department's written response must respond to the affected entity and articulate the basis for its final decision. This written response may be issued contemporaneous to the Department taking the action with legal consequence. (c) Exceptions. The procedures in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply where the Department, in its discretion, determines there is a serious threat to health, safety, or similar emergency, or where a statute specifically authorizes proceeding without a prior opportunity to be heard. In such event, HHS would still provide an affected entity with an opportunity to be heard and a written response as soon as practicable. The procedures in paragraphs (a) and (b) do not apply to settlement negotiations between agencies and regulated parties, to notices of a prospective legal action, to litigation before courts, or any action related to a criminal investigation or prosecution, including undercover operations that may be used in a criminal investigation or prosecution, or any civil enforcement action either related to an investigation by the Department of Justice, or referred to the Department of Justice.

Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. Children's risk of severe illness or death from SARS-COV2 is extremely low. The injury rate of just one of the many adverse events from covid vaccination being tracked by VAERS; myocarditis, is significantly higher than the risk of the disease it is meant to protect children from. Each current covid vaccine available in the U.S. is under Emergency Use Authorization. The only FDA approved covid vaccine is not currently available to consumers in the U.S. Parents are responsible to make health and medical choices for their children, and no medical treatment should be coerced or mandated upon children. Because these vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of SARS-COV2 but are advertised as a way to reduce symptoms and severity of illness in the injected person, covid vaccination cannot be represented as a \"public health\" measure which has any effect on anyone but the person injected.

(I placed a red thumbtack next to each post to help identify a new resource.) the American Heart Association journal, Circulation: \"At the time of this report, these changes persist for at least 2.5 months post second dose of vac.We conclude that the mRNA vacs dramatically increase inflammation on the endothelium and T cell infiltration of cardiac muscle and may account for the observations of increased thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, and other vascular events following vaccination.\" Abstract Our group has been using the PLUS Cardiac Test (GD Biosciences, Inc, Irvine, CA) a clinically validated measurement of multiple protein biomarkers which generates ascore predicting the 5 yr risk (percentage chance) of a new Acute CoronarySyndrome (ACS). The score is based on changes from the norm of multiple proteinbiomarkers including IL-16, a proinflammatory cytokine, soluble Fas, an inducer ofapoptosis, and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF)which serves as a marker forchemotaxis of T-cells into epithelium and cardiac tissue, among other markers. Elevation above the norm increases the PULS score, while decreases below the norm lowers the PULS score.The score has been measured every 3-6 months in ourpatient population for 8 years. Recently, with the advent of the mRNA COVID 19vaccines (vac) by Moderna and Pfizer, dramatic changes in the PULS score becameapparent in most patients.This report summarizes those results. A total of 566 pts,aged 28 to 97, M:F ratio 1:1 seen in a preventive cardiology practice had a new PULStest drawn from 2 to 10 weeks following the 2 COVID shot and was compared to the previous PULS score drawn 3 to 5 months previously pre- shot. Baseline IL-16increased from 35=/-20 above the norm to 82 =/- 75 above the norm post-vac; sFasincreased from 22+/- 15 above the norm to 46=/-24 above the norm post-vac; HGFincreased from 42+/-12 above the norm to 86+/-31 above the norm post-vac. Thesechanges resulted in an increase of the PULS score from 11% 5 yr ACS risk to 25% 5yr ACS risk. At the time of this report, these changes persist for at least 2.5 monthspost second dose of vac.We conclude that the mRNA vacs dramatically increaseinflammation on the endothelium and T cell infiltration of cardiac muscle and mayaccount for the observations of increased thrombosis, cardiomyopathy, and othervascular events following vaccination. https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.144.suppl_1.10712 The peer-reviewed British Medical Journal: The BMJ is a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal, published by the trade union the British Medical Association. BMJ Investigation Covid-19: Researcher blows the whistle on data integrity issues in Pfizer's vaccine trial \"Revelations of poor practices at a contract research company helping to carry out Pfizer'spivotal covid-19 vaccine trial raise questions about data integrity and regulatory oversight....But, for researchers who were testing Pfizer's vaccine at several sites in Texas during thatautumn, speed may have come at the cost of data integrity and patient safety. A regionaldirector who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has toldThe BMJ that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trainedvaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer's pivotal phase IIItrial. Staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume ofproblems they were finding. After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, theregional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day. Jackson has provided The BMJwith dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails....Since Jackson reported problems with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer hashired Ventavia as a research subcontractor on four other vaccine clinical trials ( covid-19ndvaccine in children and young adults, pregnant women, and a booster dose, as well an RSV vaccine trial; NCT04816643, NCT04754594, NCT04955626, NCT05035212). The advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to discuss the covid-19 paediatric vaccine trial on 2 November.\" https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635 Why are we vaccinating children against COVID-19? Especially check out these points: 3.1.3. Potential short-, mid-, and long-term risks of mass COVID-19 inoculation for children3.1.3.1. Intrinsic inoculant toxicity3.1.3.2. Adverse inoculant effects on children3.1.3.2.1. Potential mid-term adverse health effects3.1.3.2.2. Potential long-term adverse health effects...both Virginia Stoner [85] and Jessica Rose [86] have shown independently that the deaths following inoculation are not coincidental and are strongly related to inoculation throughstrong clustering around the time of injection. Our independent analyses of the VAERSdatabase reported in Appendix 1 confirmed these clustering findings. Additionally, VAERS historically has under-reported adverse events by about two orders-of- magnitude, so COVID-19 inoculation deaths in the short-term could be in the hundreds ofthousands for the USA for the period mid-December 2020 to the end of May 2021, potentiallyswamping the real COVID-19 deaths. Finally, the VAERS deaths reported so far are for thevery short term. We have no idea what the death numbers will be in the intermediate and long-term; the clinical trials did not test for those. The clinical trials used a non-representative younger and healthier sample to get EUA for the injection. Following EUA, the mass inoculations were administered to the very sick (and firstresponders) initially, and many died quite rapidly. However, because the elderly who diedfollowing COVID-19 inoculation were very frail with multiple comorbidities, their deathscould easily be attributed to causes other than the injection (as should have been the case forCOVID-19 deaths as well). Now the objective is the inoculation of the total USA population. Since many of thesepotential serious adverse effects have built-in lag times of at least six months or more, we won't know what they are until most of the population has been inoculated, and corrective action may be too late. sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221475 \"Files released by the Food and Drug Administration in a Freedom of Information lawsuit recorded 158,893 adverse events from the Pfizer vaccine in the first two and a half months ofdistribution, including 25,957 incidents of \"nervous system disorders.\" The documentation was obtained in a Freedom of Information lawsuit filed a group calledPublic Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency, comprised of more than 30professors and scientists from universities including Yale, Harvard, UCLA and Brown. As WND reported, in court papers filed last week, the FDA proposed that it be given 55 years to release all 329,000 pages of documents related to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine requestedby the group. The plaintiffs want the records so they can be assured, amid significant public skepticism, that the Pfizer vaccine is indeed \"safe and effective.\" Aaron Siri, an attorney for the plaintiffs, argued in court papers filed last week that it is \"difficult to imagine a greater need for transparency than immediate disclosure of thedocuments relied upon by the FDA to license a product that is now being mandated to over100 million Americans under penalty of losing their careers, their income, their militaryservice status, and far worse.\" Siri, who wants the FDA to release all the material no later than March 3, 2022, wrote in a piece published on Substack that the adverse effects were reported in a document titled\"Cumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization Adverse Event Reports of [the Vaccine]Received Through 28-Feb-2021.\" On page 6 of the document, Pfizer explains: \"Due to the large numbers of spontaneous adverse event reports received for the product, [Pfizer] has prioritised the processing of serious cases.\" The document says Pfizer \"has also taken a [sic] multiple actions to help alleviate the large increase of adverse event reports,\" including \"increasing the number of data entry [REDACTED] additional fulltimeemployees (FTEs).\" Siri wants to know why Pfizer, or Justice Department lawyers, blacked out the number of people the pharmaceutical company had to hire \"to track all of the adverse events beingreported shortly after launching its product.\" The attorney said most of the reports of adverse events were from the U.S. and disproportionately involved women -- 29,914 women compared to 9,182 men.Most were between the ages of 31 and 50 years old, 13,886, compared to 21,325 for all other age groups combined. There were another 6,876 whose ages were unknown. He noted the 25,957 events classified as \"nervous system disorders,\" with most affecting females between the ages of 30 and 51. Siri pointed out that that description sounds similar to the vaccine injuries suffered by Brianne Dressen (Part 1, Part 2), Kellai Rodriguez and Suzanna Newell, who testified recently toRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson's panel in Washington, D.C. The attorney noted that Pfizer assured the FDA there was no cause for alarm.\"The findings of these signal detection analyses are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine,\" Pfizer said. Siri asks: \"So if they knew these issues were going to arise, then why didn't they appear to have enough staff to process this expected volume of reports?\" Pfizer concluded: \"The data do not reveal any novel safety concerns or risks requiring label changes and support a favorable benefit risk profile of to the BNT162b2 vaccine.\" Whistleblower Earlier this month, hours before a CDC panel's approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children 5-11, the British Medical Journal published an article featuring a whistleblower's charge thatpoor practices at a contract research company helping to carry out the crucial third phase ofPfizer's COVID-19 vaccine trial last fall may have compromised data integrity and patientsafety. Members of FDA and CDC advisory panels, in fact, expressed concern that safety data for children regarding Pfizer's COVID vaccine is lacking. Nevertheless, Pfizers CEO chargedearlier this month that people are spreading \"misinformation\" about the vaccines, calling them\"criminals\" who have cost \"millions of lives.\" The FDA approved the Pfizer shot for young children one week after an FDA advisory panel voted 17-0, with one abstention, to recommended it, despite acknowledging the lack of safetydata and the nearly 100% survival rate for children from infection. During the FDA advisory committee meeting, Dr. Eric Rubin, editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, expressed the concern of many members about possible severeside effects that cannot yet be measured. He concluded, nevertheless, there was no other wayforward. \"We're never going to learn about how safe the vaccine is unless we start giving it,\" he said. \"That's just the way it goes.\" More than 18,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19 vaccines have been reported to the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System website. Health and Human Services points out that a VAERS report is not documentation that a link has been established between a vaccine and an adverse event. However, HHS also notes thatVAERS is a \"passive\" system of reporting, and it \"receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events.\" Many health care workers have disclosed they are instructed by their superiors not to report to VAERS any harm caused by COVID vaccines. And the website OpenVAERS, which compiles summaries of the data on VAERS, points to an analysis known as the \"Lazarus Report,\" which concluded VAERS represents only 1% ofvaccine injuries. In early October, three Pfizer scientists were captured on hidden camera in a Project Veritas investigation admitting, contrary to the claims of Dr. Anthony Fauci and other public healthofficials, that natural immunity is superior to the immunity afforded from COVID vaccines. Project Veritas interviewed an employee of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who secretly recorded colleagues voicing alarm about the safety of the vaccines. Shealleged a cover-up of \"evil at the highest level.\" In another investigation by Project Veritas,two Johnson & Johnson officials said children don't need the vaccine and it poses the risk of\"unknown repercussions down the road.\" Pfizer scientist Rahul Khanke said employees are \"bred and taught\" to insist that the \"vaccine is safer than actually getting COVID.\" He said \"we cannot talk about this\" in public.\" https://www.wnd.com/2021/11/fda-files-26000-nervous-system-disorders-pfizer-vaccine-first- 2-5-months/ HUGE: CDC and Big Pharma Data Confirm that More Children will Die from COVID Vaccine than from the COVID Virus Dr. Michael Yeadon, former Pfizer VP argued earlier this month [November] that children are 50 times more likely to be killed by the COVID vaccines than the virus itself,\" \"The catch is there were 5 heart attack deaths in the vaccine group and only 1 in placebo group. So for every 1 life saved from Covid, the Pfizer vaccine kills 4 from heart attacks. Allcause mortality in the 6 month study was 20 in vaccine group and 14 in placebo group. So a42% all cause mortality increase among the vaccinated. The vaccine loses practically allefficacy after 6 months so they had to curtail the study.\" After noting that Pfizer changed their study parameters when calculating NNTV on children tohide the harms of the vaccine, Rogers shared the following: All of the NNTV estimates above are based on data from adults. In kids the NNTV will be even higher (the lower the risk, the higher the NNTV to prevent a single bad outcome).Children ages 5 to 11 are at extremely low risk of death from coronavirus. In a meta-analysiscombining data from 5 studies, Stanford researchers Cathrine Axfors and John Ioannidis founda median infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.0027% in children ages 0-19. In children ages 5 to11 the IFR is even lower. Depending on the study one looks at, COVID-19 is slightly lessdangerous or roughly equivalent to the flu in children.Rogers then lays out the number of individuals that would need to be vaccinated in order to save one child's life from a COVID death: As of October 30, 2021, the CDC stated that 170 children ages 5 to 11 have died of COVID- 19-related illness since the start of the pandemic. (That represents less than 0.1% of allcoronavirus-related deaths nationwide even though children that age make up 8.7% of the U.S.population).The Pfizer mRNA shot only \"works\" for about 6 months (it increases risk in the first month,provides moderate protection in months 2 through 4 and then effectiveness begins to wane,which is why all of the FDA modeling only used a 6 month time-frame). So any modelingwould have to be based on vaccine effectiveness in connection with the 57 (170/3) childrenwho might otherwise have died of COVID-related illness during a 6-month period.At best, the Pfizer mRNA shot might be 80% effective against hospitalizations and death. Thatnumber comes directly from the FDA modeling (p. 32). I am bending over backwards to givePfizer the benefit of considerable doubt because again, the Pfizer clinical trial showed NOreduction in hospitalizations or death in this age group. So injecting all 28,384,878 childrenages 5 to 11 with two doses of Pfizer (which is what the Biden administration wants to do)would save, at most, 45 lives (0.8 effectiveness x 57 fatalities that otherwise would haveoccurred during that time period = 45). So then the NNTV to prevent a single fatality in this age group is 630,775 (28,384,878 / 45). But it's a two dose regimen so if one wants to calculate the NNTV per injection the numberdoubles to 1,261,550. It's literally the worst NNTV in the history of vaccination. Rogers then goes on to provide an estimate of teh number of children with deadly side effects from taking the COVID vaccine. Kirsch, Rose, and Crawford (2021) estimate that VAERS undercounts fatal reactions by a factor of 41 which would put the total fatal side effects in this age-range at 5,248. (Kirsch etal. represents a conservative estimate because others have put the underreporting factor at100.) Rogers sums it up as follows:So, to put it simply, the Biden administration plan would kill 5,248 children via Pfizer mRNA shots in order to save 45 children from dying of coronavirus. For every one child saved by the shot, another 117 would be killed by the shot.The Pfizer mRNA shot fails any honest risk-benefit analysis in children ages 5 to 11.More... Dr. Michael Yeadon, former Pfizer VP argued earlier this month that children are 50 times more likely to be killed by the COVID vaccines than the virus itself,\" Yeadon was a chief scientific officer and vice president at Pfizer before he left in 2011 after more than 16 years at the company. Yeadon also told Steve Bannon earlier this month, \"It's a crazy thing to vaccinate (children) with something that is actually 50 times more likely to kill them than the virus itself,\"There is no rational reason for giving children the COVID shot. This is insane. https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/11/shockingly-insane-cdc-big-pharma-data-show- save-lives-less-50-children-covid-5000-children-will-die-vaccine/ Heart problems in athletes around the world after Covid-19 vax https://rumble.com/voxcah-athletes-around-the-world-are-dropping-like-flies-with-heart- problems.html Report: The Fully Vaccinated Account for 81% of the COVID Deaths in the UK \"The report reveals that there were 833,332 recorded Covid-19 cases, 9,094 Covid-19 hospitalisations and 3,700 Covid-19 deaths from October 25th to November 21st.

According to the whistleblower, \"So, when they weren't injected, their infection rate was 1.3% and when they got injected, it was 4.34%. It went up by over 300%. They had lessinfection when they had no protection. So, that's a problem.\" Kingston said, \"if you have two doses of Pfizer, your rate for getting infected [with COVID- 19] increases over time.\" Leading to a discovery the biotech analyst called \"super alarming,\" the report looked exclusively at the placebo group, comparing their rate of infection in the first four months,when they had no protection, to the four months following their injections with the Pfizerproduct. During that initial placebo period, the document reports that the infection rate of this group was \"12.6 cases per 1,000 person-years,\" which equates to a 1.3% infection rate. Followingtheir injections, there were \"43.4 cases per 1,000 person- years\" or a 4.34% infection rate. \"So, when they weren't injected, their infection rate was 1.3%, and when they got injected, it was 4.34%. It went up by over 300%,\" Kingston observed. \"That 300% increase is acorrelation, it's not an anomaly.\" Thus, she summarized, \"They had less [COVID-19] infection when they had no protection [from the Pfizer shots]. So, that's a problem.\" While correlation does not prove causation, looking at relevant global data, we find a worldwide trend of high rates of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among the vaccinated. This phenomenon of rising cases occurring in association with high vaccine uptake has become a universal trend while there has also been a correlation between COVID-19 vaccinecampaigns and rising death rates from the disease as well.

Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSVhave never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of thesevaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using thetraditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viralspike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA orRNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID 19 disease via antibodydependent enhancement (ADE).

The Doctor of Medicine explained in her published paper that vaccines aim to achieve two ends - 1. Protect the vaccinated person against the illness 2. Keep vaccinated people from carrying the infection and transmitting it to others. However, the Doctor of Medicine writes that herd immunity will not be reached throughvaccination because new research in multiple settings shows that the alleged Delta variantproduces very high viral loads which are just as high in the vaccinated population compared tothe unvaccinated population. Therefore, according to Nina Pierpont (MD, PhD), vaccine mandates; such as the one now enforced in the UK for all Care Home staff, have no justification because vaccinatingindividuals does not stop or even slow the spread of the alleged dominant Delta Covid-19variant. Which leads the Doctor of Medicine to conclude that natural immunity is much more protective than vaccination because all severities of Covid-19 illness produce healthy levels of natural immunity. Nine Pierpont (MD, PhD) cites three studies whose findings and data support her conclusionsand these include a study published August 6th 2021 in the Centre for Disease Control's (CDC) 'Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report', another study published August 10th 2021 by Oxford University, and a final study published August 24th 2021 which was funded by the UK Department for Health and Social Care.CDC Study The CDC study focused on 469 cases among Massachusetts residents who attended indoor andoutdoor public gatherings over a two week period. The results found that 346 of the caseswere among vaccinated residents with 74% of them presenting with alleged Covid-19symptoms, and 1.2% being hospitalised. However the remaining 123 cases were among the unvaccinated population with just 1 personbeing hospitalised (0.8%. No deaths occurred in either group. The study also found that viralloads were found to be very similar among the vaccinated and unvaccinated, meaning theywere equally infectious. Oxford University Study The Oxford University study examined 900 hospital staff members in Vietnam who had been vaccinated with the Oxford / AstraZeneca viral vector injection between March and April2021. The entire hospital staff tested negative for the Covid-19 virus in mid May 2021however, the first case among the vaccinated staff members was discovered on June 11th. All 900 hospital staff were then retested for the Covid-19 virus and 52 additional cases wereidentified immediately, forcing the hospital into lockdown. Over the next two weeks, 16additional cases were identified. The study found that 76% of the Covid-19 positive staff developed respiratory symptoms, with3 staff members developing pneumonia and one staff member requiring three days of oxygentherapy. Peak viral loads among the fully vaccinated infected group were found to be 251times higher than peak viral loads found among the staff in March - April 2020 when theywere not vaccinated. UK Department of Health & Social Care Study The UK Department of Health & Social Care study is an analysis of ongoing population wide SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in the UK and includes measures of viral load among thepopulation. The study found that viral loads among the vaccinated and unvaccinated population arevirtually the same, and much higher than had been recorded prior to the Covid-19 injectionroll-out. The study also found that the majority of cases among the vaccinated population werepresenting with symptoms when they became positive. The above three studies lead Nina Pierpont (MD, PhD) to conclude in her paper that mandating others to take a vaccine is a potentially harmful, damaging act.She writes that since the principal reason of a mandate is to protect others from infection, and these studies prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they do not do this, those who mandatethe Covid-19 injections may wish to seek legal counsel regarding their culpability and liability for potential long-lasting harm to those whom they pressure into vaccination with the threat ofexclusion from employment, education or society. https://theexpose.uk/2021/09/12/three-studies-find-the-covid-19-vaccines-do-not-work/ History of serious problems in all previous SARS coronavirus vaccine trials: Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on challenge with the SARS virusChien-Te Tseng et al. PLoS One. 2012. Abstract Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in China in 2002 and spreadto other countries before brought under control. Because of a concern for reemergence or adeliberate release of the SARS coronavirus, vaccine development was initiated. Evaluations ofan inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particlevaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited animmunopathologic-type lung disease. Results: All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses. Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days afterchallenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV. All mice exhibitedhistopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated(Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infectionoccurred in all. Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines wasuniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmedwith special eosinophil stains. The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked theeosinophil prominence. Conclusions: These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence ofTh2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components wasinduced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans isindicated.\" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/ Imperfect Vaccination Can Enhance the Transmission of Highly Virulent Pathogens Could some vaccines drive the evolution of more virulent pathogens? Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reducestransmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek's disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, makingit possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit. Immunity elicited by direct vaccination orby maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replicationor transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist.Our data show that anti-disease vaccines that do not prevent transmission can createconditions that promote the emergence of pathogen strains that cause more severe disease inunvaccinated hosts. Author Summary There is a theoretical expectation that some types of vaccines could prompt the evolution ofmore virulent (\"hotter\") pathogens. This idea follows from the notion that natural selectionremoves pathogen strains that are so \"hot\" that they kill their hosts and, therefore, themselves.Vaccines that let the hosts survive but do not prevent the spread of the pathogen relax thisselection, allowing the evolution of hotter pathogens to occur. This type of vaccine is oftencalled a leaky vaccine. When vaccines prevent transmission, as is the case for nearly allvaccines used in humans, this type of evolution towards increased virulence is blocked. Butwhen vaccines leak, allowing at least some pathogen transmission, they could create theecological conditions that would allow hot strains to emerge and persist. This theory provedhighly controversial when it was first proposed over a decade ago, but here we reportexperiments with Marek's disease virus in poultry that show that modern commercial leakyvaccines can have precisely this effect: they allow the onward transmission of strainsotherwise too lethal to persist. Thus, the use of leaky vaccines can facilitate the evolution ofpathogen strains that put unvaccinated hosts at greater risk of severe disease. The futurechallenge is to identify whether there are other types of vaccines used in animals and humansthat might also generate these evolutionary risks.Citation: Read AF, Baigent SJ, Powers C, Kgosana LB, Blackwell L, Smith LP, et al.

A year ago, more than 860,000 infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientistssigned a declaration expressing their \"grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies.\" The Great Barrington Declaration argued that \"the most compassionate\" way to reach herd immunity while minimizing mortality and social harm was \"to allow those who are at minimalrisk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through naturalinfection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk.\"...Among the detractors of this narrative, highlighted below, are medical doctors, infectious-disease researchers, virologists, a former vice president of Pfizer, the inventor of mRNAvaccine technology, and even a state surgeon general. Analysis from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data shows that over a half a million people have had adverse effects from the vaccines, including life-threatening reactions, permanent disability, birth defects, and death. For a variety of reasons, (e.g.deliberate suppression of the truth, laziness) it is widely believed that only a small fraction ofadverse events actually get reported into the system. A 2011 study by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care , for instance, found that the number could be as low as one percent. Forty-five years ago, the federal government pulled a vaccine that caused only a tiny fractionof the number of adverse reactions that are being reported today.In 1976, three states halted the Swine Flu vaccine after only three deaths. Later that year, the CDC pulled the vaccine from the market entirely after about 500 people developed a rare neurological condition called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and about 25 people died.The number of COVID vaccine casualties in 2021 eclipsed those numbers in the first month....https://amgreatness.com/2021/10/02/heroes-of-the-pandemic/ Pfizer's Comirnaty is not available in the USA, only the EUA version, which protects Pfizerfrom lawsuits and leaves all vaccine injured with no recourses or help: \"Between the manipulation by big pharma and the media, the major conflict of interest with the FDA voting panel and Pfizer, FDA's bait-and-switch on the approval process ofComirnaty, the Biden regime threatening the country to get an EUA jab against their will, andthe hundreds of thousands of global adverse events and deaths reported after receiving thejabs, this should all be a huge red flag for anyone considering getting the jab or having theirchildren get the jab.\" NEW ARTICLE with important information and evidence:Pfizer-Connected FDA Panel Approves Pfizer EUA Covid Jab for Children 5-11 While Comirnaty Remains Unavailable and IA2030 Push for Life-Course Vaccines for All https://www.coreysdigs.com/health-science/pfizer-connected-fda-panel-approves-pfizer-eua- covid-jab-for-children-5-11-while-comirnaty-remains-unavailable-and-ia2030-push-for-life- course-vaccines-for-all/ Pfizer Fail to Perform industry Standard Animal Testing Prior to Initiation of mRNA Clinical TrialsSource: EMAhttps://trialsitenews.com/did-pfizer-fail-to-perform-industry-standard-animal-testing-prior-to- initiation-of-mrna-clinical-trials/ How Moderna Rigged Its COVID-19 Vaccine Trials To Falsely Show Effectiveness https://greatmountainpublishing.com/2021/02/27/how-moderna-rigged-its-covid-19-vaccine- trials-to-falsely-show-effectiveness/ Covid variant injections are to be marketed without safety trials, Fauci confirmed it, and that antibodies/antigens to SARS-CoV-2 are found in saliva, making the use of maskscounterproductive in achieving herd immunity. https://rumble.com/vf5vsj-no-clinical-trials-for-vaccines.-fauci-confirms..html 2019 - Fauci and his HHS peeps in 2019 explaining how time-consuming RNA vaccine trials are, and how if only some \"urgent call\" that's \"not beholden to bureaucratic strings andprocesses\" could come along they could introduce the vaccine more easily Host: Why don't we blow this system up? I mean, obviously we can't just turn off the spigot on the system we have and then say \"hey, everyone in the world should get this new vaccine wehaven't given to anyone yet.\" But there must be some way. We grow vaccines mostly in eggsthe way we did in 1947. Fauci: In order to make the transition from getting out of the tried and true egg growing, which we know gives us results that can be, you know, beneficial\u2014I mean we've done well with that\u2014to something that has to be much better, you have to prove that this works, and then you'vegot to go through all of the clinical trials\u2014phase ones, phase twos, phase three\u2014and thenshow that this particular product is going to be good over a period of years. That alone, if itworks perfectly, is going to take a decade. HHS BARDA Director Rick Bright: To make it sexy I think we have to, I like the concept of disrupting this field. There might be a need, or even an urgent call for an entity of excitementout there that's completely disruptive, that's not beholden to bureaucratic strings and processes. Fauci: So we really do have a problem of how the world perceives influenza, and it's going to be very difficult to change that unless you do it from within and say \"I don't care what yourperception is, we're going to address the problem\"\u2014in a disruptive way and in an iterativeway, because you do need both. Rick Bright: But it is not too crazy to think that an outbreak of a novel avian virus could occur in China somewhere. We could get the RNA sequence from that, beam it to a number ofregional centers, if not local, if not even in your home at some point, and print those vaccineson a patch and self-administer.https://youtu.be/5gD2hbTF3qwFauci, Bill Gates, Gates Foundation, GSK's [Glaxo Smith Kline's], Wuhan Institute of Virology, China, China FDA, US FDA, NIAID: New Fauci Emails https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-releases/new-fauci-emails/ 2018.

Since March 2020, when IVM was first used against a new global scourge, COVID-19, more than 20 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have tracked such inpatient and outpatienttreatments. Six of seven meta-analyses of IVM treatment RCTs reporting in 2021 foundnotable reductions in COVID-19 fatalities, with a mean 31% relative risk of mortality vs.controls. During mass IVM treatments in Peru, excess deaths fell by a mean of 74% over 30days in its ten states with the most extensive treatments.\" Feb. 2017: Ivermectin: enigmatic multifaceted 'wonder' drug continues to and expectations https://www.nature.com/articles/ja201711 Feb. 2011: Ivermectin, 'Wonder drug' from Japan: the human use perspective https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043740/#__ffn_sectitle I-MASK+ Prevention and Early Outpatient Treatment Protocol for Covid-19 Current I-MASK+ protocol: version 12, updated on August 11, 2021 (English version,translations follow). https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/i-mask-plus-protocol/ 71 out of 75 Districts in Uttar Pradesh, India - Its Most Populated State - Reported No Covid-19 Cases in 24 Hours After Implementing Ivermectin Protocol https://www. https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/10/update-71-75-districts-uttar- pradesh-india-reported-no-covid-19-cases-24-hours-implementing-ivermectin-protocol/ Dr. Fauci pushed the use of Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) as a treatment for COVID-19 knowing that it would be unsafe and ineffective for patients. Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) is a nucleotide analogue RNA polymerase inhibitor. Dr. Ardis reveals that the symptoms of lungs filling with fluid and the other alleged COVID-19 symptoms wereactually side effects of kidney poisoning and other organ damage that are known side-effectsof Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir). Dr. Ardis alleges that the devestating health toll allegedly causedby COVID-19 was actually caused by the NIH recommended treatment of Veklury\u00ae(remdesivir). Dr. Bryan states that the NIH even cited two studies on its website that showed that Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) was ineffective and unsafe to patients. NIH Recommends Remdesivir On May 12, 2020, the NIH recommended the use of Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) for severe cases ofCOVID-19. At that time, Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) was an unapproved experimental drug madeby Gilead Sciences. It was authorized by the FDA for emergency use treatment of COIVD-19. Conflicts Of Interest The recommendation from the NIH to use Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) to treat COVID-19 camefrom the NIH Panel on COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. There were nine (9) people on theNIH Panel on COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines with financial ties to Gilead Sciences, themaker of Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir).Steering Doctors Away From Hydroxychloroquine The panel tried to steer doctors away from Hydroxychloroquine, by stating that \"[t]here are insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against using chloroquine orhydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID.\" The panel, of course, had an interest in undermining inexpensive and effective treatements: \"[T]he Panel recommends against the use of the following drugs for the treatment of COVID-19: The combination of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin because of the potential fortoxicities.\" That was not true. Indeed many subsequent studies have shown that thehydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin \"combination is safe and may avoid worsening, viruspersistence, and subsequent contagiosity.\" Remdesivir Adverse Events Many of the studies cited in support of NIH's recommendation to use Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir)were in vitro studies or animal studies. A couple of the human studies were at best a mixedbag. Two of the most authoritative studies showed Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) to be ineffectiveand unsafe.Please do not miss the fact that there were reported 71 percent adverse events in the 5-day study and 74 percent adverse events in the 10-day study for patients taking Veklury\u00ae(remdesivir). 21 percent suffered serious adverse events in the 5 day study and 35 percent ofthe patients suffered serious adverse events in the 10-day study. Majority Of Patients On Remdesivir Suffer Liver Damage Amazingly, in the May 2020 FDA publication indicated that a majority of the participants inthe several remdesivir studies conducted have suffered liver damage. Kidney Damage From Remdesivir Is ForeseeableAnother foreseeable side effect of Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) is kidney damage. The FDA pubication reveals that \"[i]ntravenous administration (slow bolus) of remdesivir to rats atdosage levels of =3 mg/kg/day for up to 4 weeks resulted in findings indicative of kidneyinjury and/or dysfunction.\" Invasive Mechanical Ventilation RequiredIn another later published study (ACTT-1, NCT04280705) reported in the October 10, 2010 FDA emergency use auhthorization that alleged to show the benefits of Veklury\u00ae(remdesivir), 27 percent of the patients taking Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) \"were on invasivemechanical ventilation.\" There was no control group in that study. It seems that the ventilationwas the result of Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) because the study revealed that \"[s]ubjects onmechanical ventilation at screening were excluded\" from the study. Early Study Termination Due To Adverse EventsIn another human study conducted in China, 12 percent of the Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) group participants had to discontinue therapy with Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) due to adverse sideeffects. That compared to 5 percent in the control group. Remdesivir Proven Ineffective In Ebola Study There was only one other human study cited, and the results were devastating for the patientsin that study who were administered Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir). In that study, Veklury\u00ae(remdesivir) was compared to three other treatments for Ebola. The control group was notactually a placebo group. The group was administered a medicine identified as ZMapp (atriple monoclonal antibody agent).Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) had the highest mortality of any of the treatment modalities with 53.1percent of the Ebola patients who were administered Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) dying within 28days. Yet, with those studies showing the Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) is unsafe and ineffective, the NIH recommended Veklury\u00ae (remdesivir) as the treatment for COVID-19. The results wereforeseeable. Its use to treat patients with COVID-19 were predictably ineffective and unsafe. https://principia-scientific.com/doctor-reveals-remdesivir-is-real-cause-of-covid-19-maladies/ Reuters reports: \"Four people in southern Germany have tested positive for theOmicron COVID-19 variant even though they were fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, the public health office in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said.\" https://summit.news/2021/12/01/germany-detects-four-cases-of-omicron-in-the-fully- vaccinated/ All Four Batswana \"Nu\" variant patients were fully vaccinated Thank you for taking the time to read what I have researched.

Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. Dear Dr. Jon Pennell, DVM; Dr. Jeffrey Murawsky, MD; Monica Ponce', DDS; Judith Bittner and Charles Smith ~ I am writing to you as a concerned citizen, mother of three, and practicing Pediatric Nurse Practitioner. I am extremely concerned about any current or future consideration of mandating Covid 19 therapies for school attendance and/or any school-related activities. All of the currently available therapies (including Pfizer) have not been fully FDA licensed for use in adults or children and remain under the ongoing Emergency UseAuthorization (EUA). Some erroneously believe that Pfizer's BioNTech therapy has been licensed. However, that is not the case. The therapy from Pfizer's German counterpart, thelicensed product named COMIRNATY, has been FDA approved. This is not availablein our country and per my understanding, will not be available in the United States fortwo or three more years. Further, these two products have been ruled NOTinterchangeable by Federal Courts just this week. As such, all currently available EUA therapies - Pfizer, Moderna, J&J - must be administered with fully informed and written consent of a legal-age adult, or legalguardian of any minor child. Per federal law referenced below, any product licensed under an EUA requires that citizens and therefore in the case of minor children, their parents/legal guardians, have the legal right to accept or refuse the product. Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities Guidance for Industry and Other Stakeholders January 2017https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance- documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related- authorities Section E: Conditions of Authorization; 1. Information relating to the EUA Product; b. Information for Recipients: \"the statute requires that FDA ensure that recipients are informed to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances...That they have the option to accept or refuse the EUA product\".Mandating biologic products which have not been fully tested, licensed, and proved as safe and effective in a target population (in this case minors under 18 years) would not only fly in the face of typical scientific protocols, but could very well incur medical liability for potential harms resulting from administering experimental therapies to children. Thank you for your sincere consideration of this matter, Jenny L. Cole, APRNFrom: L Robinson To: DPBH StateBOH Subject: Public Comment Date: Thursday, December 2, 2021 11:50:14 AM WARNING - This email originated from outside the State of Nevada. Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. To the State Board of Health Members: I oppose covid vaccine mandates or requirements of any sort for all Nevadans. Each of the covid vaccines (Pfizer-Bio-NTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson) currently available inthe United States are authorized under Emergency Use Authorization by the Food & DrugAdministration (FDA). Per federal law, EUA products cannot be mandated, require informedconsent and can be declined. The single FDA approved covid vaccine (Pfizer Comirnaty) isnot currently available to consumers in the U.S.I oppose covid vaccine mandates or requirements for children 0-18. Children's risk of severeillness or death from SARS-COV2 is extremely low. The injury rate of just one of the manyadverse events from covid vaccination being tracked by VAERS; myocarditis, is significantlyhigher than the risk of the disease it is meant to protect children from. As parents we areresponsible to make health and medical choices for our children, and no medical treatmentshould be coerced or mandated upon them. Thank you for your time.

Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. I am very concerned about a mandate for children to get the vacination. There has been no long term studies how this affects children and they are not high risk. It is disturbing thatanyone would force such a risk on children. Especially since many may have other healthconcerns that would make it even more risky. Thank you for taking into account the concerns Iam expressing.

Learn more \u00bb Home > Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) > Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) Data Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) Data Aggregate Data as of October 1, 2021 The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) provides compensation for covered serious injuries or deaths that, based on compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientic evidence, are found to be directly caused by the administration or use of a covered countermeasure or are determined to meet the requirements of a countermeasure injury table. Temporal association between administration or use of the covered countermeasure and onset of the injury (i.e., the injury occurs a certain time after the administration or use) is not sucient, by itself, to prove that an injury is the direct result of a covered countermeasure. It is important to note that the CICP data only captures the alleged countermeasure(s) and the alleged injuries that CICP requesters list on their Request for Benets forms (RFB) or claim. The countermeasure or injury listed by the requester on the RFB may or may not be consistent with the requester's medical documentation or the injury resulting in compensation. While requesters are required to identify the alleged countermeasure on their RFB form, they are not required to list the specic manufacturer or trade name on their RFB form. Furthermore, while requesters must submit their RFB form within 1 year from the administration or use of the covered countermeasure, requesters are permitted to submit the necessary medical records and other documentation, such as a copy of a requester's COVID-19 vaccination record, after the RFB is led. For the majority of COVID-19 countermeasure claims, including COVID-19 vaccine claims, the CICP is still waiting for records and documentation to be submitted. When was the rst CICP claim led? The rst CICP claim was led in Fiscal Year (FY) 2010; there are no CICP claims to report on prior to FY 2010. Is the CICP data available by specic manufacturer or trade name? The CICP does not maintain its aggregated data concerning alleged countermeasures, including vaccines, by specic manufacturer. How many claims has the CICP compensated? The CICP is the payer of last resort and can only reimburse or pay for medical expenses or lost employment income that are not covered by other third-party payers. To date, the CICP has paid compensation for 29 CICP claims, totaling more than $6 million. An additional 10 CICP claims were eligible for compensation after a review of the required medical records and documentation; however, in these cases there were no eligible reported medical expenses or lost employment income for the CICP to compensate. Has the CICP made any decisions regarding COVID-19 Claims? As of October 1, 2021, the CICP has not compensated any COVID-19 countermeasures claims. Three COVID-19 countermeasures have been denied compensation because the standard of proof for causation was not met and/or a covered injury was not sustained. One COVID-19 claim has been determined eligible for compensation and is pending a review of eligible expenses.

CICP Claims Denied Compensation for Not Meeting the Standard of Proof and/or a Covered Injury Was Not Sustained (Fiscal Years 2010 - 2021) As of October 1, 2021 This table displays the alleged countermeasure and alleged injury for each CICP claim led between Fiscal Years 2010 through 2021 that was denied compensation because the standard of proof for causation was not met and/or a covered injury was not sustained. To be eligible for CICP benets, a requester must show that a covered serious physical injury was sustained as the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. A covered injury is a serious physical injury (which, as a general matter, is an injury that warranted hospitalization, whether or not the person was actually hospitalized, or that led to a signicant loss of function or disability, whether or not hospitalization was warranted), or death, determined to be: 1. An injury meeting the requirements of a covered countermeasures injury table, unless there is another more likely cause; or 2. An injury (or its health complications) that is the direct result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. This includes serious aggravation caused by a covered countermeasure of a pre-existing condition. Please note that the number column within the tables are not assigned numbers for a particular claim, but reflect the number of listed items in a given table.

Outbreak investigations suggest that vaccinated persons can spread Delta 3,4. We compared RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) data from 699 swab specimens collected in Wisconsin 29 June through 31 July 2021 and tested with a qualitative assay by a single contract laboratory. Specimens came from residents of 36 counties, most in southern and southeastern Wisconsin, and 81% of cases were not associated with an outbreak. During this time, estimated prevalence of Delta variants in Wisconsin increased from 69% to over 95%. Vaccination status was determined via self-reporting and state immunization records ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). Main text We observed low Ct values (<25) in 212 of 310 fully vaccinated (68%; Figure 1A ) and 246 of 389 (63%) unvaccinated individuals. Testing a subset of low-Ct samples revealed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in 15 of 17 specimens (88%) from unvaccinated individuals and 37 of 39 (95%) from vaccinated people (Figure 1B ). Low Ct values were detected in vaccinated people regardless of symptoms at the time of testing (Figure 1C ). Ct values <25 were detected in 7 of 24 unvaccinated (29%; CI: 13-51%) and 9 of 11 fully vaccinated asymptomatic individuals (82%; CI: 48-97%), and 158 of 232 unvaccinated (68%, CI: and 156 of 225 fully vaccinated (69%; CI: 63-75%) symptomatic individuals. Time from symptom onset to testing did not vary by vaccination status (p=0.40; Supplemental Figure 2 ). Infectious virus was detected in the sole specimen tested from an asymptomatic fully vaccinated individual. Although few asymptomatic individuals were sampled, these results indicate that even asymptomatic, fully vaccinated people might shed infectious virus. Combined with other studies 2-5, these data indicate that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals infected with the Delta variant might transmit infection. Importantly, we show that infectious SARS-CoV- .

The inclusion of viruses from Pango lineages B.1.617.2, AY.2, and AY.3, and multiple counties without a linking outbreak, indicate that Delta-lineage SARS-CoV-2 can achieve low Ct values consistent with transmissibility in fully vaccinated individuals across a range of settings. Vaccinated and unvaccinated persons should get tested when symptomatic or after close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Continued adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions during periods of high community transmission to mitigate spread of COVID-19 remain important for both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. .

Concordance between self-reported vaccination status and the Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) or Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS). For all individuals, vaccination status was determined using WIR/WEDSS electronic registries when data were available. Individuals were identified as unvaccinated at the time of testing if WIR/WEDSS data indicated receipt of a first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose after the test date. Individuals were considered fully vaccinated based on WIR/WEDSS data if the registries indicated receipt of a final vaccine dose at least 14 days prior to testing. For individuals whose vaccination status could not be verified in WIR/WEDSS, self-reported data collected at the time of testing were used. Individuals were considered unvaccinated based on self-report only if there was an explicit declaration of unvaccinated status in the self-reported data. Individuals were considered fully vaccinated based on self-report if they fulfilled all of the following criteria: (1) indicated that they had received a COVID vaccine prior to testing; (2) indicated that they did not require another vaccine dose; and (3) reported a date of last vaccine dose that was at least 14 days prior to testing. Specimens lacking data on vaccination status were excluded from the study. Specimens from partially vaccinated individuals (incomplete vaccine series, or <14 days post-final dose) were also excluded. Fully vaccinated status was determined by WIR/WEDSS for 292 specimens and by self-reported data for 18. Unvaccinated status was determined by WIR/WEDSS for 11 and by self-reported data by 378. A.Of the 699 specimens with vaccination status available from at least one source, 165 specimens had data available from both sources.

The results provide hope that people receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will develop similar lasting immune memories after vaccination.12/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-192/5 Colorized scanning electron micrograph of a cell, isolated from a patient sample, that is heavily infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus particles (red). NIAIDIntegrated Research Facility, Fort Detrick, MarylandAfter people recover from infection with a virus, the immune system retains a memory of it. Immune cells and proteins that circulate in thebody can recognize and kill the pathogen if it's encountered again, protecting against disease and reducing illness severity.This long-term immune protection involves several components. Antibodies\u2014proteins that circulate in the blood\u2014recognize foreignsubstances like viruses and neutralize them. Different types of T cells help recognize and kill pathogens. B cells make new antibodies whenthe body needs them.All of these immune-system components have been found in people who recover from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But thedetails of this immune response and how long it lasts after infection have been unclear. Scattered reports of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2have raised concerns that the immune response to the virus might not be durable.To better understand immune memory of SARS-CoV-2, researchers led by Drs. Daniela Weiskopf, Alessandro Sette, and Shane Crotty fromthe La Jolla Institute for Immunology analyzed immune cells and antibodies from almost 200 people who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-212/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-193/5and recovered.Time since infection ranged from six days after symptom onset to eight months later. More than 40 participants had been recovered formore than six months before the study began. About 50 people provided blood samples at more than one time after infection.The research was funded in part by NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Cancer Institute (NCI).Results were published on January 6, 2021, in Science .The researchers found durable immune responses in the majority of people studied. Antibodies against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2,which the virus uses to get inside cells, were found in 98% of participants one month after symptom onset. As seen in previous studies, thenumber of antibodies ranged widely between individuals. But, promisingly, their levels remained fairly stable over time, declining onlymodestly at 6 to 8 months after infection.Virus-specific B cells increased over time. People had more memory B cells six months after symptom onset than at one month afterwards.Although the number of these cells appeared to reach a plateau after a few months, levels didn't decline over the period studied.Levels of T cells for the virus also remained high after infection. Six months after symptom onset, 92% of participants had CD4+ T cells thatrecognized the virus. These cells help coordinate the immune response. About half the participants had CD8+ T cells, which kill cells that areinfected by the virus.As with antibodies, the numbers of different immune cell types varied substantially between individuals. Neither gender nor differences indisease severity could account for this variability. However, 95% of the people had at least 3 out of 5 immune-system components thatcould recognize SARS-CoV-2 up to 8 months after infection.\"Several months ago, our studies showed that natural infection induced a strong response, and this study now shows that the responseslast,\" Weiskopf says. \"We are hopeful that a similar pattern of responses lasting over time will also emerge for the vaccine-inducedresponses.\"\u2014by Sharon ReynoldsRelated Links Experimental Coronavirus Vaccine Highly Effective (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/experimental- coronavirus-vaccine-highly-effective) Antibodies and T Cells Protect Against SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/antibodies-t-cells- protect-against-sars-cov-2) Immune Cells for Common Cold May Recognize SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-cells- common-cold-may-recognize-sars-cov-2) Potent Neutralizing Antibodies Target New Regions of Coronavirus Spike (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research- matters/potent-neutralizing-antibodies-target-new-regions-coronavirus-spike) Potent Antibodies Found in People Recovered from COVID-19 (https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/potent- antibodies-found-people-recovered-covid-19) Novel Coronavirus Structure Reveals Targets for Vaccines and matters/novel-coronavirus-structure-reveals-targets-vaccines-treatments) Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://covid19.nih.gov/) Coronavirus Prevention Network (https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/)12/2/21, 3:24 PM Lasting immunity found after recovery from COVID-19 | National Institutes of Health (NIH) https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-194/5Coronavirus (COVID-19) (https://www.coronavirus.gov/)References: Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection.

Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to VAERS. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Most reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope and can quickly provide an early warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. As part of CDC and FDA's multi-system approach to post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring, VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events, also known as \"safety signals.\" If a safety signal is found in VAERS, further studies can be done in safety systems such as the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) or the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) project. These systems do not have the same limitations as VAERS, and can better assess health risks and possible connections between adverse events and a vaccine. Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data: Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause. Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information. The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines. VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date for which data are available. VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be interpreted in the context of other scientific information. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers, and Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100% in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more than 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to unique events is more than 100%. More information.

I strongly oppose covid vaccine mandates of any sort for all Nevadans. Each of the covid vaccines (Pfizer-Bio-NTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson) currently available in the United States are authorized under Emergency Use Authorization by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Per federal law, EUA products cannot be mandated, require informed consent and can be declined. The single FDA approved covid vaccine (Pfizer Comirnaty) is not currently available to consumers in the U.S. A child's risk of severe illness or death from SARS-COV2 is extremely low. In fact, peer reviewed data reviewed all cases of childhood deaths from Covid and in every single case, the child had one or more comorbidities. Adults at risk should work with their doctors to formulate a plan to prevent infection if at risk. It makes no sense to subject an entire healthy population to mandates and potentially harmful therapies in order to protect another population. There is a very high injury rate of a serious and debilitating condition, Myocarditis, that is being tracked by VAERS, and proves to be significantly higher than the risk of the disease(ovid-19) that it is meant to protect children from. It goes without saying that parents should be the only responsible party able to make health decisions and medical choices for their children. NO medical treatment should be coerced or mandated upon children. The shots are advertised in a way that the person receiving them will experience a reduction in symptoms and severity of the disease at the onset of illness in the injected person, so far there is no datas supporting this claim. Therefore, the covid vaccination cannot be represented as a \"public health\" safety measure as it has no measurable effect on anyone including the person being injected. Protection from the disease is less than 6 months, showing it is ineffective. College Scholarship opportunities are being given to vaccinated children as young as 5 years old who get their first vaccine by Dec 19. Winners get Tuition, room and board plus money for books and supplies. What is being given to those injured by vaccines? The vaccine mandate is deceitful coercion, as it had now been stated by Dr. Fauci himself that vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission of SARS-COV2. The public is being lied to. If you move forward with this, you will be perpetuating a lie and you will beheld accountable. The continuation of this charade is in serious violation of our human and civil rights and is in effect, totalitarianism. These mandates also violate the Nuremberg code, forcing treatment without consent. As long as I have been a nurse, medical treatments have always been a personal choice, and should remain that way. As long as I have been a parent, I alone make medical decisions for my children.

They also want a six month period in which they do not have to be licensed to be on school campuses. Starting 9/13 when the agreement was signed without approval by the board on 9/29. The entire thing is looking wrong. This is a perfect example of no one paying attention to those who think they can just not follow proper procedures and approve something before the agenda is addressed publicly. If I do not see that this is moved to next meeting with proper notice, I will send this information to the proper authorities. Do the parents know you intend to allow this company to establish clinics on their children's school sites? Were they informed and given time to make public comments? Did you inform the parents that the WHO states that the simple presence of a child on testing or vaccine day is implied consent? Did you inform the parents that if these mobile sites intend to vaccinate in the future and they decide to send their students to school without a written declaration that they wish to exclude their child that the child is at risk of implied consent according to World Health Organization? Are parents aware that the children of high school age could potentially be vaccinated or tested without parent consent? I say no to this and table it for the next meeting and give proper notice to parents of these schools. Let's see ... we want to open 11 clinics on high school campuses and have no license or permit.... That's a hard NO Documents attached: testing adversity/discrimination and affects studies, WHO notice of implied consent if you send your child to school on a clinic day, public notice of court mandated release of Pfizer trial results Elizabeth Hammack - Henderson, NV3common approaches for obtaInIng consent for vaccInatIon 1. A formal, written consent process is used, particularly in middle- and high-income countries that have a higher percentage of literate populations and a longer history of providing vaccination to older age groups.4 Vaccination of this target group may be delivered through school health services. Health authorities inform the parents about the vaccination and written consent from the parent is required to opt-in, i.e. give permission for the older child/adolescent to be vaccinated. Alternatively, a written form is used to allow parents to express non-consent (or refusal) to vaccination of their child. This is known as an opt-out procedure. 2. A verbal consent process, whereby consent is given verbally by the parent after being duly informed about the vaccination. However, this approach can only be used when parents accompany the child to the vaccination. 3. An implied consent process by which parents are informed of imminent vaccination through social mobilization and communication, sometimes including letters directly addressed to the parents. Subsequently, the physical presence of the child or adolescent, with or without an accompanying parent at the vaccination session, is considered to imply consent. This practice is based on the opt-out principle and parents who do not consent to vaccination are expected implicitly to take steps to ensure that their child or adolescent does not participate in the vaccination session. This may include not letting the child or adolescent attend school on a vaccination day, if vaccine delivery occurs through schools.Implied consent procedures are common practice in many countries. However, when children present for vaccination unaccompanied by their parents, it is challenging to determine whether parents indeed provided consent. Therefore, countries are encouraged to adopt procedures that ensure that parents have been informed and agreed to the vaccination. Comprehensive data on whether the approach countries use to deal with consent has changed or evolved over the last decades is not available. ApproAches to obtAin informed consent: 1. Written consent 2. Verbal consent 3. Implied consent 4. A WHO survey in 2012 in 34 selected countries from four regions on consent procedures for vaccination in 6-17 year-olds, found that approximately half of the respondent countries use written consent for vaccination in this age group. current practices of obtaining informed consent for vaccination vary among countries, but can be broadly categorized into three approaches. \u00a9 C.

Use of these devices may cause serious injuries or death. Recalled Product Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (also distributed under the names Innova COVID-19 Self-Test Kit (3T Configuration), Innova SARS-CoV-2-Antigen Rapid Qualitative (7T Configuration), and SARS-CoV-2-Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (25T Configuration)) Lot codes: X2012711, X2103792 Manufacturing Dates: September 1, 2020 to March 3, 2021 Distribution Dates: November 2, 2020 to March 22, 2021 Devices Recalled in the U.S.: At least 77,339 Date Initiated by Firm: March 24, 2021 Device Description The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test claimed to determine if a person has an active COVID-19 infection. The test used a nasal swab sample and test strip to detect specific proteins, called antigens, from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. If the nasal sample had SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a colored test line should have appeared on the test strip, indicating that the personGoogle monitors you on this domain \u00d712/2/21, 3:06 PM Innova Medical Group Recalls Unauthorized SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test with Risk of False Test Results | FDA https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls/innova-medical-group-recalls-unauthorized-sars-cov-2-antigen-rapid-qualitative-test-risk-fa ...2/4may have COVID-19. If the nasal sample did not have SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a colored line should not have appeared on the test strip. The test has not been authorized, cleared, or approved by FDA for commercial distribution in the United States. Reason for Recall Innova Medical Group is recalling its SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test. Labeling distributed with certain configurations of the test includes performance claims that did not accurately reflect the performance estimates observed during the clinical studies of the tests. The performance characteristics of the test have not been adequately established, presenting a risk of false results. False-negative results may lead to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of SARS-CoV-2, which may cause patient harm including serious illness and death. False- negative results can also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including when presumed negative patients are grouped into cohorts in health care, long-term care, and other facilities based on false test results. False-positive results could lead to a delay in the correct diagnosis and the initiation of an appropriate treatment for the actual cause of patient illness, which could be another life-threatening disease that is not SARS-CoV-2. False-positive results could also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus when presumed positive patients are grouped into cohorts based on false test results. Who May Be Affected People who were tested using these devices Health care providers who may have access to and use these tests or whose patients have used these tests Organizers of large testing programs, such as on college campuses, who may be using and distributing these tests for diagnostic use What to Do On April 23, 2021, Innova Medical Group sent all affected device users an Urgent Medical Device Recall letter. The letter provided the following information: Do not use these tests to screen for or diagnose COVID-19. Identify and remove all affected tests from inventory. Either destroy the tests by placing them in the trash or return the tests using the FedEx return label that was included with the letter Innova sent to its customers.Google monitors you on this domain \u00d712/2/21, 3:06 PM Innova Medical Group Recalls Unauthorized SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test with Risk of False Test Results | FDA https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls/innova-medical-group-recalls-unauthorized-sars-cov-2-antigen-rapid-qualitative-test-risk-fa ...3/4Complete and return the form Innova sent to its customers, indicating the number of destroyed or returned tests. The FDA also recommends: Test users and caregivers: Talk to your health care provider if you think you were tested with the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test and you have concerns about your test results. Health care providers: If the test was given less than two weeks ago, consider retesting your patients using a different SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test if you suspect an inaccurate result. If testing was performed more than two weeks ago and there is no reason to suspect current SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not necessary to retest. Testing program organizers: Notify participants in your testing program to discontinue diagnostic use of these tests and to use an FDA-authorized test to continue testing.

Curative-Korva SARS-Cov-2 Assay) Emergency Use Authorization was revoked at the company's request effective July 15, 2021, because the company is now using different EUA-authorized tests for the testing offered at its laboratories. The test that is the subject of this safety communication is no longer being offered and is no longer authorized for emergency use by the FDA. Date Issued: January 4, 2021 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting patients and health care providers of the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test. Risks to a patient of a false negative result include: delayed or lack of supportive treatment, lack of monitoring of infected individuals and their household or other close contacts for symptoms resulting in increased risk of spread of COVID-19 within the community, or other unintended adverse events. To reduce the risk of false negative results, it is important to perform the test in accordance with its authorization and as described in the authorized labeling, e.g., the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers (/media/137087/download). When the test is not performed in accordance with its authorization or as described in the authorized labeling, there is a greater risk that the results of the test may not be accurate. Important Recommendations for Health Care Providers, Patients, and Caregivers Be aware of the important information regarding the use of the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test, which is described in the test's authorized labeling, including the following: Collection of nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens is limited to symptomatic individuals within 14 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Specimen collection must be directly observed and directed during the sample collection process by a trained health care worker at the specimen collection site. A negative result does not rule out COVID-19 and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19.

If testing was performed more than two weeks ago, and there is no reason to suspect current SARS-Cov-2 infection, it is not necessary to retest. Patients and caregivers: Talk to your health care provider if you think you were tested with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test (the test name is displayed on this test's authorized Fact Sheets and, generally, the Fact Sheets must be provided with test result reports) and you have concerns about your test results. Report any problems you experience with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test to the FDA, including suspected inaccurate results. Device Description The Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay is a real-time RT-PCR test used to detect SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This test is authorized for prescription-only use. The test is performed by collecting a throat swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or oral fluid specimen from an individual suspected of COVID-19 by their health care provider. Under the Emergency Use Authorization, the specimen is then to be processed at the KorvaLabs, Inc., laboratory, and results are returned to the patient. Consistent with the test's authorized labeling (/media/137087/download), collection of nasal swabs and oral fluid specimens is limited to individuals who have shown symptoms of COVID- 19 within 14 days of onset of the symptoms. Specimen collection must be directly observed and directed during the sample collection process by a trained health care worker at the specimen collection site. Consistent with the EUA summary (/media/137089/download), negative results for SARS-Cov- 2 RNA from oral fluid specimens should be confirmed by testing of another specimen type authorized for use with this test if clinically indicated. FDA Actions The FDA regularly monitors the post-authorization use of tests, including reports of problems with test performance or results, and is providing this information to help educate patients, caregivers, and health care providers and reduce the risk of false results. The FDA will keep the public informed if significant new information becomes available.

Exercise caution when opening attachments or clicking links, especially from unknown senders. Just a FYI B. Foster Huge new study shows ZERO Covid deaths of healthy German kids over 4 or adolescents The findings, in a nutshell: if you let your healthy child or teenager receive the mRNA Covid vaccine, you are insane Alex Berenson German physician-scientists reported Monday that not a single healthy child between the ages of 5 and 18 died of Covid in Germany in the first 15 monthsof the epidemic. Not one.Even including children and adolescents with preexisting conditions, only six in that age range died, the researchers found. Germany is Europe's largestcountry, with more than 80 million people, including about 10 million school-age children and adolescents. Serious illness was also extremely rare. The odds that a healthy child aged 5- 11 would require intensive care for Covid were about 1 in 50,000, the Dec 2 researchers found. For older and younger children, the odds were somewhat higher, about 1 in 8,000. Another eight infants and toddlers died, including five with preexisting conditions. In all, 14 Germans under 18 died of Covid, about one per month.About 1.5 million German children or adolescents were infected with Sars-Cov-2 between March 2020 and May 2021, the researchers found. \"Overall, the SARS-CoV-2-associated burden of a severe disease course or death in children and adolescents is low,\" the researchers reported. \"Thisseems particularly the case for 5-11-year-old children without comorbidities.\" The researchers reported their findings in an 18-page paper published to the medrxiv preprint server on Monday. The data came from a registry Germany established in March 2020 intended to capture all hospitalizations of people under 18 with Covid. All Germanchildren's hospitals, pediatric infectious disease specialists, and pediatricsocieties were invited to participate.(SOURCE: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.30.21267048v1.full.pdf) British researchers have posted similar findings, reporting that only six healthy children (including those under 18) out of 12 million died of Covid. Given the known risks of vaccine-induced myocarditis in young men, the fact that Pfizer tested its mRNA vaccines on barely 3,000 children 5-11 andfollowed most of them for only weeks after the second dose, the German dataagain raises the question of how health authorities can possibly justifyencouraging children or teenagers to be vaccinated. But they have. So parents will have to decide what's best for their children (at least in thosestates that bar vaccine fanatics from trying to vaccinate teenagers without parental consent).

I am prepared to take an early retirement. Last time I checked, my district alone, is short at least 800 licensed educators. We cannot afford to require this shot and weekly tests, pushing our hardworking educators out... causing MORE vacancies. Furthermore, if you all are thinking about requiring those unvaccinated to test weekly for a virus that continually mutants into variations creating variants and also requiring them to pay for those required tests, that is highly unethical. If you require weekly tests, then you need to absorb the cost, not the people who are exercising their right to choose. Please do not mandate this shot or weekly tests & definitely without a cost.
