I felt that most |\u2014Duchess of Northumberland, creator of The Poison Garden| This list of medicinal plants (and supposedly medicinal plants) aims to analyze medical claims made for herbs and list potential adverse effects they are known to have. [[note 1]](#cite_note-3) Herbal remedies vary greatly in efficacy, strength and price. As with anything else, [moderation is key](/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison). The list will always be incomplete, given the vast number of herbs. The [National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](/wiki/National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine) has a very useful view on this issue: [[3]](#cite_note-4) Herbal products such as [St. John's wort]are classified as dietary supplements by the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](FDA). The FDA's requirements for testing and obtaining approval to sell [dietary supplements]are different from its requirements for [drugs]. Unlike drugs, [herbal products]can be sold without requiring studies on dosage, safety, or effectiveness. The quality of herbal products is often unpredictable. Products can differ in content not only from brand to brand, but from batch to batch. Information on labels may be misleading or inaccurate. In addition, [\"natural\" does not necessarily mean \"safe.\"]Many natural substances can have harmful effects-especially if they are taken in large quantities or if they interact with other supplements or with prescription medicines.

[[30]](#cite_note-betel-31) - Usage may be associated with other diseases ( [HIV/AIDS](/wiki/AIDS), dengue fever, tuberculosis, and typhoid) due to immunosuppression, injury to the oral mucosa, and associated fecal-oral contamination of the betel quid ingredients.

[[38]](#cite_note-pnas-39) - Birthwort is considered to be a significant cause of kidney failure and upper urinary tract cancer in Taiwan, [[38]](#cite_note-pnas-39)because of the popularity of herbal medicine there (approximately 33% of Taiwan's herbal medicine prescriptions contain aristolochic acid, [[38]](#cite_note-pnas-39)and AA has been ingested by approximately 33% of Taiwan's population.) [[39]](#cite_note-40)The Taiwanese Department of Health banned its use in cosmetics and commercial skincare preparations in 1994. [[40]](#cite_note-41) - In [Belgium](/wiki/Belgium), a weight loss spa using TCM herbs gave its clients herbal supplements containing birthwort, and as a result, more than 100 out of 1800 of its patients developed kidney failure, and several also developed urothelial and bladder cancers. Because Traditional Chinese Medicine allows for the substitution of identically or similarly named plants, plants that are botanically unrelated may be substituted. In this case, the relatively safe Stephania tetrandra (, Han Fang Ji) was intended for the clients, but the lethal Aristolochia fangchi (, Guang Fang Ji) was given to the clients. [[41]](#cite_note-42) - European birthwort (Aristolochia clematitis) is also used as a medicinal plant and contains aristolochic acid. It has been linked to thousands of cases of kidney failure ( [Balkan true number of cases of aristolochic acid nephropathy (usually fatal) is unknown and is probably underestimated.

[[49]](#cite_note-50)A 2015 study by the [FDA](/wiki/FDA)found that 52% of blackbrush acacia supplements were contaminated with the amphetamine isomer -methylphenylethylamine (BMPEA), which is not found in natural blackbrush acacia. [[50]](#cite_note-51)Subsequently, the FDA warned supplement manufacturers to cease selling BMPEA because it is not natural.

[[54]](#cite_note-NCCAMCat-55) [[55]](#cite_note-ACSCat-56) - In laboratory studies, cat's claw stimulates part of the immune system, but it has not been proven to reduce inflammation or boost the immune system in humans. [[54]](#cite_note-NCCAMCat-55) [[55]](#cite_note-ACSCat-56) - The National Institute on Aging funded a study that looked at how cat's claw may affect the brain. Findings may point to new avenues for research in Alzheimer's disease treatment.

[[63]](#cite_note-chaparral-64)L. tridentata is often an ingredient in the quack cancer cure [Cansema](/wiki/Cansema). - Harmful effects: Chaparral is not effective for cancer and not known to be effective for anything else, either. [[64]](#cite_note-chapcancer-65)One CAM site claims it's good for lots of unrelated illnesses and only has \"temporary unpleasant side effects\", [[63]](#cite_note-chaparral-64)but, actually, it can cause fatal liver damage and kidney failure. [[64]](#cite_note-chapcancer-65)Other side effects may include fatigue, stomach pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, itching, rash, and allergic reactions.

Studies done on the active chemicals of Ephedra/ma huang demonstrates that it speeds the metabolism, thus, the reason for its use and abuse as a performance-enhancing drug by athletes and for weight loss.

Is effective, however: - Whether or not a given quantity of digitalis contains enough digoxin to lead to an overdose depends on the individual plant(s) it's from (each individual plant - even in the same species - has a different digoxin content), so those using digitalis are effectively playing Russian roulette. There is no way of knowing if one pill is good, or if it will lead to an overdose and kill you. As Encyclopedia.com puts it: Foxglove is no longer used as a heart medicine because the therapeutic dose and the lethal dose are very close. Seasonal variations in the level of cardiac glycosides in the plant make the safe dose impossible to estimate except by an experienced physician and prescriber of the herb who monitors the patient on an hourly basis for signs of overdose. Few living doctors and herbalists can safely use digitalis as a plant extract. Specific standardized doses of pharmaceutical digoxin are used instead.
