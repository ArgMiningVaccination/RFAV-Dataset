The public health emergency area specified in the order is for 'all of Queensland'. Its duration has been extended by regulation to 26 March 2022 and may be further extended. Further to this declaration, l, Dr John Gerrard, Chief Health Officer, reasonably believe it is necessary to give the following directions pursuant to s362B of the Public Health Act 2005 to assist in containing, or to respond to, the spread of COVID-19 within the community. Guidance This public health direction applies to workers in healthcare who enter, work in, or provide services in a healthcare setting. The direction sets out the COVID-19 vaccination requirements for workers in healthcare, their employers and responsible persons in healthcare settings, with limited exceptions, to assist in containing the spread of COVID-19 in vulnerable settings, including health, disability and aged care settings, and in the broader community. Preamble On 1 October 2021, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) issued a statement recommending mandatory vaccination for all workers in healthcare settings. This Public Health Direction aligns with the principles in that Statement, with limited exceptions, and complements existing mandatory vaccination requirements in other public health directions. Separately from the requirements of Public Health Directions, under sections 362G and 362H of the Public Health Act 2005, an emergency officer (public health) can require a responsible person or person to comply with additional directions if the emergency officer believes it is reasonably necessary to assist in containing, or to respond to, the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Revocation The Workers in a Healthcare Setting (COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements) Direction (No.3) made on 4 February 2022 is revoked from the time of publication of this public health direction. Citation This Public Health Direction may be referred to as the Workers in a Healthcare Setting (COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements) Direction (No.4). Commencement This Direction applies from time of publication until the end of the declared public health emergency, unless it is revoked or replaced. Application This Direction applies to workers in healthcare, including those in the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme, all self-regulated allied health professionals and all other individuals who work in a healthcare setting. PART 1 - COVID-19 VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKERS IN HEALTHCARE A worker in healthcare, other than a residential aged care worker at a residential aged care facility, must not enter, work in, or provide services in a healthcare setting unless the worker in healthcare complies with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements. Note: the COVID-19 vaccination requirements for workers in healthcare who are residential aged care workers at residential aged care facilities are set out in Part 1A. The COVID-19 vaccination requirements are that: a worker in healthcare must be fully vaccinated; and the worker in healthcare must: for a sole trader - provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination to any healthcare settings in which they work; or for an employee who is not a sole trader - provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination to their employer; or for an employer that provides staff or services to a healthcare setting - keep a record of the COVID-19 vaccination status of each employee who is a worker in a healthcare setting and confirm that employees are fully vaccinated, to the responsible person for each healthcare setting employees work in, and, if requested by the responsible person, provide evidence to support the undertaking. Note: an employer is not required to keep a copy of an employee's evidence of vaccination or medical contraindication. The employer must record the employee's compliance with the vaccination requirements. Assurance should be provided to the healthcare setting, advising all employees provided to the healthcare setting meet the COVID-19 vaccination requirements. PART 1A - COVID-19 VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKERS IN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE This part only applies to a person who is a residential aged care worker at a residential aged care facility. A residential aged care worker must not enter, work in, or provide services at a residential aged care facility unless the residential aged care worker: has an up-to-date vaccination status; or they meet the requirements for an exception in paragraphs 15 to 19. Note: a residential aged care worker who works in or provides services at a health care setting that is not a residential aged care facility must comply with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements under Part 1. An employer that provides staff or services to a residential aged care facility must keep a record of the COVID-19 vaccine status of each employee who is a worker in a residential aged care facility and provide an undertaking that employees have an up-to-date vaccination status to the operator of a residential aged care facility for each residential aged care facility employees work in, and, if requested by the responsible person, provide evidence to support the undertaking. An operator must take all reasonable steps to facilitate access to COVID-19 vaccine for residential aged care workers engaged by the residential aged care facility, including access to off-site vaccination. An operator of a Queensland Health residential aged care facility must ensure a health service employee who is unable to be vaccinated due to a medical contraindication or because they are a COVID-19 vaccine trial participant is temporarily deployed to another work unit until this Direction is revoked or the medical contraindication or COVID-19 vaccine trial participation no longer applies. Where paragraph 13 applies and deployment is not reasonably practicable the health service employee must discuss the situation with their line manager, and the operator or their nominated representative must consult with the local Human Resources Team for other options. PART 2 - EXCEPTIONS This Part applies to all workers in healthcare, who are required to comply with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements under Part 1 or Part 1A, except workers in healthcare who are undertaking an educational placement. Medical contraindication Paragraphs 7 and 10 do not apply to a worker in healthcare, other than a student, who is unable to be vaccinated due to a current medical contraindication where the responsible person for the healthcare setting: assesses the risk to other staff, patients, clients and other persons at the healthcare setting; and determines that the unvaccinated worker may continue to work in the healthcare setting where their work cannot be performed outside the healthcare setting; and the unvaccinated worker complies with the requirements in paragraph 17. Example: A worker who is unable to be vaccinated due to a medical contraindication, who repairs critical medical equipment onsite in healthcare settings can continue to perform that work if the responsible person for the healthcare settings assesses the risk to others and determines the worker can continue to work there, if they comply with the necessary PPE and testing requirements. A worker in healthcare to whom paragraph 16 applies must: comply with the PPE guideline requirements for the healthcare setting and any COVID safe plans for the healthcare setting; and on commencement of this Direction, on the worker's next day of work, the worker undertakes a COVID-19 test before commencing duties and every second day thereafter, and provides a negative test result to the responsible person for the healthcare setting as soon as reasonably practicable after the result is received; or Example: an unvaccinated worker in healthcare who works consecutive shifts several days in a row is required to undertake a COVID-19 test before starting the first shift after commencement of this direction and every second work day thereafter. where the worker in healthcare is a person to whom the Health Employment Directive 12/21 Employee COVID-19 Vaccination requirements (the HED) applies, comply with the requirements relating to a medical contraindication or any other exceptions to mandatory vaccination requirements in the HED or the direction, or required by an employer to support best practice infection control. Example: an admissions clerk who provides evidence of a current medical contraindication is able to continue working in an alternative administrative role, using PPE consistent with the setting's policies and the PPE guideline and must undertake a daily COVID-19 test and provide a negative COVID-19 test result when it is received. A worker in healthcare to whom paragraph 16 applies must provide evidence of the current medical contraindication. Evidence of a current medical contraindication provided by a worker in healthcare to a employer under a predecessor to this public health direction is deemed to be evidence provided for the purposes of paragraph 17 and additional evidence need not be provided for a current medical contraindication. Participation in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Paragraphs 7 and 10 do not apply to a worker in healthcare, other than a student, where: the worker in healthcare is a participant in a COVID-19 vaccine trial; and the responsible person for the healthcare setting assesses the risk to other staff, patients, clients and other persons in the healthcare setting and determines that the worker in healthcare may continue to work in the healthcare setting. A worker in healthcare to whom paragraph 20 applies must notify the responsible person for the healthcare setting as soon as reasonably practicable upon completion of their participation in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. The exception outlined in paragraph 20 ceases to apply upon the earlier of: the trial COVID-19 vaccine being recognised by the Therapeutic Goods Administration; or the trial COVID-19 vaccine being approved for use in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration; or the trial COVID-19 vaccine being rejected for use in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Critical Support Needs The responsible person may permit a worker in a healthcare setting who has not complied with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements to enter, work and remain at the healthcare setting for a maximum consecutive period of three months to provide support to a patient, client or person with a disability, if: the responsible person has assessed the risk to other persons in the healthcare setting; and the responsible person reasonably believes it is necessary to provide health, wellbeing, legal or advocacy support to the person; and personal protective equipment is used by the worker as required by the responsible person; and where the worker enters the healthcare setting for a single visit, a COVID-19 test is undertaken by the unvaccinated worker within 24 hours prior to entry; and where the worker enters the healthcare setting on multiple consecutive days, a COVID-19 test is undertaken by the unvaccinated worker before entering the healthcare setting every second day thereafter, and the test results provided to the responsible person for the healthcare setting as soon as reasonably practicable when received. Critical Workforce Shortage The responsible person for a healthcare setting may permit a worker in healthcare who has not complied with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements to enter, work in, or provide services in the healthcare setting, for a maximum period of three months from 17 December 2021 or until the critical workforce shortage can be resolved, whichever is shorter, if: the responsible person has assessed the risk to other staff, patients and other persons accessing the healthcare setting; and the responsible person reasonably believes it is necessary to respond to a critical workforce shortage; and personal protective equipment is used by the worker in healthcare in compliance with the PPE guideline and any COVID safe plans for the healthcare setting; and the unvaccinated worker undertakes a COVID-19 test before commencing the next work shift in a healthcare setting and every second work day thereafter, and provides the COVID-19 test result to the responsible person for the healthcare setting as soon as reasonably practicable after the test result is received. Note: the use of PPE and daily COVID-19 surveillance testing is required for a limited period of no more than three months when an unvaccinated worker in healthcare may enter, work, or provide services in a healthcare setting to respond to a critical workforce shortage while fully vaccinated workers are recruited or alternative arrangements are made to respond to the critical workforce shortage. Where a critical workforce shortage extends beyond three months only the Chief Health Officer or his delegate may approve a worker in healthcare who has not complied with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements to continue to enter, work in or provide services in the healthcare setting, on such conditions, including the use of PPE, as the Chief Health Officer or his delegate approves. Emergency Entry Paragraph 7 and 10 does not apply to an unvaccinated worker in healthcare who enters a healthcare setting for any of the following purposes: to respond to an emergency or to provide an emergency service; or to undertake a legislated regulatory or compliance function; or as part of official union duties in response to an emergent need. Examples: a contractor, who is not vaccinated, enters a private hospital to fix malfunctioning medical equipment required for critical patient care. The contractor may enter the hospital but must abide by the COVID-safe plan and practices of the hospital, including any PPE requirements. There is a salmonella outbreak at a healthcare setting and an environmental officer may investigate the setting, regardless of whether the person meets the COVID-19 vaccination requirements or is unvaccinated. An unvaccinated worker in healthcare who enters a healthcare setting under paragraph 26 must comply with the PPE guideline requirements for the healthcare setting, unless to do so would be unsafe due to the nature of the emergency. A worker in healthcare who enters a healthcare setting under paragraph 26 must report the entry under paragraph 26 to the responsible person or their delegate as soon as is reasonably practicable. Entry in a private capacity A worker in healthcare who does not comply with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements may enter the healthcare setting in their personal or private capacity but must not enter, work in, or provide services as a worker in healthcare, and must comply with all other public health directions applicable to entering the healthcare setting, including any mandatory vaccination requirements for visitors to a healthcare setting. Note: an unvaccinated worker in healthcare may enter as a personal visitor of a patient, client or resident of the healthcare setting, as a parent or guardian of a patient, client or resident, or as a patient, client or resident of the healthcare setting unless a visitor vaccination requirement applies to them under another public health direction. Entry to a healthcare setting for law enforcement Where the responsible person for a healthcare setting is satisfied that a worker is entering for the purposes of law enforcement and disclosure of their compliance with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements is inconsistent with the law enforcement function, the responsible person may permit the worker to enter and remain in the healthcare setting without showing evidence of COVID-19 vaccination or of medical contraindication, and the responsible person is not required to record details in relation to the worker. PART 3 - REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKERS IN HEALTHCARE AND THEIR EMPLOYERS A worker in healthcare and their employer must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the worker in healthcare does not enter, work in, or provide services in a healthcare setting if the person is prohibited from doing so under this Direction. An employer of a worker in healthcare must keep a record of: the worker's vaccination status; and the type of evidence of vaccination or of medical contraindication sighted; and the date the evidence is sighted; or for an unvaccinated worker permitted to continue working, sighting a negative COVID-19 test result as soon as practicable after pre-shift testing of the unvaccinated worker. Note: where the COVID-19 test undertaken is a COVID-19 PCR test, the result need not be provided for the test undertaken that day but can be provided as part of a rolling surveillance testing program. A worker in healthcare or, where they are employed by another person their employer must provide the responsible person, or self-managed NDIS participant, with confirmation that the worker in healthcare complies with the COVID-19 vaccination requirements. Where the responsible person for a healthcare setting is not the employer, the responsible person must take reasonable steps to notify employers of workers in the healthcare setting of the COVID-19 vaccination requirements and to record vaccination compliance as advised by the employer in relation to its workforce. Example: a specialist medical practice has consultation rooms at a hospital. The hospital should notify the specialist medical practice of their obligations and seek confirmation that specialists using the consultation rooms meet the COVID-19 vaccination requirements. The specialist medical practice must maintain the records in relation to employee vaccination and confirm employee vaccination compliance in writing to the responsible person for the healthcare setting. Example: unless they are an employer of a worker in healthcare, a support co-ordinator, NDIS plan manager and a self-managing NDIS participant are not a responsible person for a healthcare setting and are not responsible for ensuring another person complies with the vaccination requirements under this public health direction. PART 4 - WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE FACILITIES This part only applies to a residential aged care facility. The operator of a residential aged care facility must develop a Workforce Management Plan that: requires residential aged care workers contractors, volunteers and students to notify a residential aged care facility of their additional place of employment, if relevant; requires residential aged care workers contractors, volunteers and students if they become aware of a COVID-19 case identified at an additional place of employment, to notify the operator of a residential aged care facility; identifies how workforce surge requirements will be met if there is a COVID-19 event at the facility, in accordance with relevant guidance provided by Queensland Health; provides that the operator must notify the local Health Emergency Operations Centre of a critical workforce shortage for notification purposes. It is recommended that the operator of a residential aged care facility ensure, to the extent possible, that employees, contractors, volunteers and students do not work across multiple care facilities. Note: Care facilities include but are not limited to hospitals, retirement villages, residential aged care facilities and distinct sections of a facility providing multiple types of care such as a Multi-Purpose Health Service. The operator of a residential aged care facility must ensure that where employees, contractors, volunteers and students do work across multiple care facilities, they must not enter, or remain on, the premises of the residential aged care facility without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, in accordance with Queensland Health's Residential Aged Care Facility and Disability Accommodation PPE Guidance. Note: A person who does not, or is unable to wear appropriate personal protective equipment, must not enter a residential aged care facility. The operator of a residential aged care facility must take reasonable steps to ensure the following, in accordance with relevant guidance provided by Queensland Health: employees, contractors who have contact with residents, volunteers and students undertake face to face infection control and personal protective equipment training; and ensure an adequate supply of personal protective equipment is available to respond to a confirmed case of COVID-19 within the residential aged care facility. PART 5 - RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS - RESPONSIBLE PERSONS A responsible person or their delegate must keep a record, either locally or centrally, of COVID-19 vaccination compliance reported to it by a worker in healthcare or their employer. The information is collected and used for ensuring compliance with the Direction or other reporting obligations. The information must be stored in a secure database that is accessible to authorised persons only and maintained in accordance with the Information Privacy Act 2009 and the Public Records Act 2002. PART 6 - OTHER MATTERS An emergency officer (public health) can require a responsible person, a worker in healthcare, or their employer to comply with additional directions if the emergency officer believes the direction is reasonably necessary to assist in containing, or to respond to, the spread of COVID-19 within the community.
