Beware of rabies and hepatitis. Thailand? Don't drink the water. Africa? Yellow fever. India? Typhoid. Health experts are concerned that large numbers of Australians are not getting vaccinations before they travel, with exotic diseases such as typhoid on the rise among returning tourists. With the cost of vaccinations ranging from $25 for a flu shot to $250 for a Japanese encephalitis shot, a survey has found up to 2.8 million travellers have failed to have the necessary vaccinations when they have travelled overseas in the past five years.2 There were 134 cases of typhoid among Australians in 2011, up from an average of about 50 in previous years, the Department of Health's national notifiable diseases surveillance system shows. A Queensland university student died from typhoid in January after visiting the Middle East and southern Asia. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Steve Hambleton, said travellers should show some responsibility. ''They have to think about their personal risks but also the risks to their country of origin,'' Dr Hambleton said. ''It would be fair to say that if you cannot afford the vaccines you should not be travelling in the first place.'' A survey released this week conducted by multinational vaccine supplier Sanofi Pasteur of 1042 Australians who have travelled overseas in the past five years found more than half did not receive appropriate vaccinations, indicating that 2.8 million travellers had not been appropriately vaccinated. ''Typhoid is nasty and it can kill you,'' said Dr Tony Gherardin, the national medical adviser for the Travel Doctor TMVC network of clinics, which released the survey. ''It is a bacterial disease from contaminated food or water. The germ invades the gut and multiplies in your body. It is usually characterised by very high fever.'' Dr Hambleton said the lobby opposing childhood immunisations may have rubbed off on travellers. ''It broadly increases community suspicion,'' he said. The doctors also urged travellers to protect themselves from ''the basics'' such as malaria, tetanus, measles, mumps and rubella. DANGER LIST Typhoid: Transmitted by contaminated food or water.
