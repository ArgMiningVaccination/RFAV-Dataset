The results have given a green signal for its development to be fast-tracked. The vaccine is being developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and the global health care company GalxoSmithKline jointly. The preliminary report on trial of VRC 207, which was tested for the safety of the vaccine on 20 healthy adults at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The number of Ebola patients which is on a surge in West Africa prompted the serious efforts to develop safe and effective vaccines. The vaccine aims at not only to stop the current spread but, it can also prevent future outbreak. NIAID director Dr. Anthony S. Fauci says \"based on these positive results from the first human trial of this candidate vaccine, we are continuing our accelerated plan for larger trials to determine if the vaccine is efficacious in preventing Ebola infection\". The vaccine contains harmless carrier virus which is responsible for common cold in chimpanzees but does not affect humans. Also, a genetic material from two strains of Ebola virus, the Sudan strain and the Zaire strain are there in the vaccine. Among the 20 healthy volunteers who were aged 18-50, 10 people were given a low dose and 10 received a high dose of the vaccine via intramuscular injection. The blood of these participants was tested after 2 and 4 weeks to find out whether the vaccine had made their immune system produce antibodies to Ebola. In the result it was seen that all the participants had produced anti-Ebola antibodies at the 4-week point. The highest number of antibodies was found in the volunteers who received higher dose of vaccine. Image courtesy: Getty Images News "}
