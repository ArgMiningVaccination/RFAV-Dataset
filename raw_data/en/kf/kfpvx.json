Below are some questions you might want to ask your doctor and other healthcare professionals. We left some space so you can fill in the answers and keep track of other important information. Questions to Ask the Doctor Which type of IBD do I have, and where is the inflammation located? What medications will I need to take and how often? (Be sure to keep a list of your medications. See the medication log on page 11).Foods That Are Good for Me and Foods that Cause Me Problems With IBD you'll need to pay more attention to what you eat. Keep track of foods that don't cause you problems and foods that make your symptoms worse. Other Important Information About My Health Keep track of your symptoms and other important information that will help you and your healthcare professionals manage your health. Other Questions for My Healthcare Team If you have other questions for your healthcare providers, write them down and take them with you to your next visit. Once I start the medication, how long will it take for it to work and for my symptoms to go away? Will I be able to continue to play sports, dance, or do other activities that I normally do?

On the following pages, you'll find some worksheets and discussion guides to help you talk about your disease with your healthcare team. We encourage you to take these materials with you when you see your healthcare providers and use them to help educate your teachers or friends about your disease. Parents and caregivers, these resources will also help you discuss IBD with your teen!It's normal to feel overwhelmed with this new diagnosis. We know it sounds scary, and you probably have a lot of questions. Some of the questions newly diagnosed patients ask are: What is IBD? How did I get it? Can my disease be cured? How will IBD change my life? Will I be able to go to school, hang out with my friends, or play sports? That's why we wrote this booklet\u2014 to help you and other teens find the answers to your questions, access important information, and get support to help you as you get used to living with IBD.

The GI tract includes all the parts of the body that take in and digest food. It begins with your mouth, continues down your throat into your esophagus, through your stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and ends with your anus (Figure 1). Inflam-mation impairs the ability of your affected organs to work correctly. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are very similar, but there are im - portant differences. For some, their IBD has features of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Sometimes, it's hard to clearly distinguish between the two. When this happens, it is called indetermi-nate colitis (or IBD unclassified). What are the symptoms of IBD? Inflammation can prevent your GI tract from working normally, which can lead to IBD symptoms. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic (lifelong) disease that causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The two main types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. What is IBD? THE GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) TRACT Oral Cavity (mouth) Esophagus (throat)LiverStomachSmall IntestineLarge Intestine/ Colon RectumAnus1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Figure 11 2 34 5 6 7 8 Your symptoms will depend on which disease you have, where it's located within the GI tract, and how severe it is. Your symptoms may change over time or even disappear for a while. Keep in mind that you may not have every symptom, and IBD is not the same for everyone. Symptoms often go away once the inflammation is under control and you enter a period called remission. When symptoms return, it is called a flare. WHAT IS IBD? WHAT IS IBD?4 5 WHAT IS IBD? WHAT IS IBD?Crohn's Disease Ulcerative Colitis Affects any part of the GI tract, from the mouth to the anus Often affects the end of the small intestine (the ileum) where it joins the beginning of the colon May appear in \"patches,\" affecting some areas of the GI tract while leaving other sec - tions completely untouched Inflammation may extend through the layers of the intestinal wall Limited to the large intestine (colon) and rectum Can involve the entire colon or can be limited to the lower colon Usually starts at the end of the colon (rectum) and can spread upward to other areas of the colon Inflammation occurs only in the innermost layer of the intestinal wall Sometimes symptoms of IBD occur outside the GI tract and include: Joint pain and stiffness Fever (indicates inflammation somewhere in the body) Eye irritation Skin rash IBD and its symptoms can affect other parts of your life, too. They can affect your growth and can even delay puberty. Puberty happens at different times for different people, but for people with active symp-toms of IBD, it may happen later. It's important that you and your parents discuss your development with your healthcare providers (HCP). How did I get IBD? Millions of people in the United States live with IBD. People of any age can develop IBD, and it is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. It is not contagious, so no one gave it to you, and you can't pass it on to anyone else. We're learning more every day about why people develop IBD and how to prevent it. Scientists suspect that a combination of four factors leads to IBD: Genetics: There are certain genes (family traits) that make it more likely for some individuals to get IBD. However, some people may carry these genes but never de-velop the disease themselves. Environmental triggers: Coming in contact with certain bacteria and other microbes, medications, cigarette smoke, and toxins can trigger an inflammatory response and the onset of IBD. Gut bacteria: Inflammation can occur if there are too many bad bacteria in the intestine, making the good and bad bacteria unbalanced. Common symptoms/signs of IBD are: An urgent need to go to the bathroom Frequent diarrhea, sometimes bloody Poor growth Lack of appetite Nausea Weight loss Fatigue (extreme tiredness and low energy) Abdominal pain Mouth ulcers (canker sores) Immune system response: Inflammation can occur if the immune system mistakes some- thing helpful (like good bacteria) for something harmful (like bad bacteria) and attacks it, causing inflammation. IBD is not caused by stress or diet alone, but once you have IBD, both stress and diet can affect your symptoms. Can IBD be cured? There are currently no cures for IBD, and it is a lifelong, chronic disease. This might sound scary, but we are making great strides every day toward finding cures for Crohn's and colitis. Until there are cures, there are many effec - tive treatments that can control inflammation and the symptoms it causes. Researchers are making incredible progress, and many new treatments and technologies are being developed as you read this! Check out a more detailed expla- nation of these illnesses at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/what-is-crohns-disease or www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/what-is-ulcerative-colitisTREATMENTS TREATMENTS7experience, and treatments can be different for everyone. Therefore, the medication plan will be different for each person. If you know some-one else with IBD, their treatment plan will likely not be the same as yours. There are five different types of prescription medications that your healthcare provider may recom-mend for your IBD. Each type works in a slightly different way. Medication to treat IBD can be taken in a few ways: Oral medications are tablets or liquids that are taken by mouth Rectal medications are suppos-itories or enemas that can be inserted into your anus You'll want to talk with your doctor about what treatment(s) might be right for you and your disease. Treatment for IBD typically includes a combination of prescription medications and over-the-counter medications that you can buy without a prescription. It's important that you be open with your care team about your symptoms, concerns, and what you hope to get out of your treatment. Your doctors and other healthcare providers will recommend one or a combination of medications to see what works best for you. Living with IBD is a very individual What about treatments?TREATMENTS TREATMENTS TREATMENTS TREATMENTS8 9 Intravenous medications are delivered directly into your blood-stream through insertion of an IV Subcutaneous medications that are given through a shot Topical medications that are applied directly to areas of inflammation including the mouth, eyes, or skin Every medication comes with potential benefits and side effects. Figure 2 shows you the purpose and side effects of different types of drugs typically prescribed to IBD patients. You'll want to discuss what to expect from your medications with your healthcare team. If you experience side effects, let your parents and healthcare profession-als know immediately. Do not stop taking your medication without talking to your healthcare provider first. If you are experiencing any severe reactions, or changes in symptoms, you and your parent(s) should be sure to consult with your healthcare provider.

The best way to get control of your symptoms and get into remission is to follow the treatment plan your healthcare provider has prescribed. This is called adher - ence , and it is your responsibility to stay on top of your health. Even if you are feeling great, it is very important to continue your treatment. If you stop taking your medication, you risk a flare. Some strategies that patients find useful to stay on top of medications include: Using a reminder app or an alarm clock on your phone. Making a chart that lists your medicine, and checking it off when you've taken it (see next page). Sorting a whole week's pills into a pillbox; it will be easy to see what you've taken (as well as any missed medications).

Although it is common among patients with IBD, it's important to remember that not every patient will require surgery. The type of surgery you might have depends on your disease type, location of disease in the GI tract, response to medications, and symptoms. After surgery, your healthcare provider may recommend that you continue medication. Even with surgery, it's possible that your IBD symptoms will reoccur. That's why continuing your treatment plan, as prescribed by your healthcare provider, is important. Tests and procedures You probably had several tests before your final diagnosis of IBD, but the testing doesn't stop there. Throughout your disease journey, you'll likely need to have follow-up blood, stool, and imaging tests, such as colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, video capsule endos-copy (pill camera), computerized tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests help your healthcare provider monitor your progress and/or make changes to your treatment.Managing uncomfortable symptoms While they will treat many of your symptoms, the medications that are prescribed for you may not get rid of all your symptoms. Some-times your healthcare provider may recommend using over-the-counter products to help address: Diarrhea Bloating and gas Joint pain and fever Irritation of the skin around the anus and other uncomfortable symptoms If you experience symptoms or discomfort, be sure to write them down and let your parents and healthcare provider know about them. Nutritional support therapy IBD can affect the digestion of food. Sometimes the food we eat nor - mally (by mouth) is not digested well, so we don't get the nutrients we need. IBD can also decrease your appetite so you don't feel like eating, even when you need to. In these cases, your healthcare pro- vider or dietitian may suggest that you use nutritional support therapy. There are a few types that can be prescribed based on your disease activity and nutritional needs: Enteral nutrition is a form of liquid nutrition that can be taken by mouth or delivered directly to your stomach or small intestine through a tube There are two types of enteral nutrition: Partial enteral nutrition, which will deliver 30-50% of your calories from formula and the remainder from regular food. Exclusive enteral nutrition, which will deliver all the cal-ories, vitamins, and minerals you need through a prescrip-tion formula, and you do not eat regular food. Parenteral nutrition delivers necessary nutrients and calories directly into your bloodstream through a thin intravenous tube called a catheter that is inserted directly into a large vein in the chest, arm, or neck. Using nutritional support therapy allows your body to get healthier and gives your GI tract a chance to heal. In some pediatric patients with Crohn's disease, exclusive enteral nutrition can actually lead to remission.Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition StomachHeart Jejunum DuodenumFeeding through the central vein Feeding through peripheral veinsPARENTERAL NUTRITION Feeding intravenousl y, bypassing the usual process of eating and digestion.

Once you have your symptoms under control, you may be able to eat the foods you want once again. So, you probably want to know what you should eat, or if there is a diet you should follow. Right now, there is no one-size-fits-all approach for diet, though lots of research is happening to better understand how certain diets affect IBD symp-toms. In general, you want to make sure you are eating a well-bal-anced diet with an adequate intake of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. This can be achieved by eating a variety of foods from all the food groups. Figure 3 shows the healthy balance Figure 3Diet (what you eat) and nutrition (absorbing food and staying healthy) are important parts of managing your IBD. Since IBD affects the organs responsible for absorbing vitamins, nutrients, and water, it is important that you maintain a healthy diet and get proper nutrition. IBD tends to increase the body's need for calories, nutrients, and energy. During disease flares, it may be hard to maintain adequate nutrition. Although what you eat won't cause a flare, it can make you feel worse during one. However, if you maintain good nutrition, it can improve your overall wellness, promote healing and immunity, How does food affect my IBD symptoms?FOOD FOOD FOOD FOOD16 17of food that should be eaten at each meal. Meat, fish, poultry, and dairy products are sources of pro- tein. Bread, cereal, starches, fruits, and vegetables are sources of carbohydrates. Butter, margarine, and oils are sources of fat. Now, you probably think that there's no way you can eat all these foods, and that might be true. Some patients find it hard to digest certain foods, such as raw vegetables or fruits with skin or seeds. Others have trouble with dairy or meat. It's important to pay attention to what you eat so you can identify what foods work or don't work for you. Keeping a food diary or journal is a great way to keep track of what you are eating and how your body responds. You may have to use trial and error to see what reduces your symptoms. If you cut a certain food out of your diet, do you feel better? You will probably see a pattern and notice which foods are affecting you and should be avoided. If you feel the need to limit certain foods, make sure you speak with your healthcare provider or a dietitian to ensure that you are getting those nutrients from another source, such as a vitamin or supplement. When going to a party, bring an item you know you can eat and bring enough for the group. If you can't eat, hold a glass with your favorite drink in your hand! There is nothing wrong with drinking liquids if you can't find a meal that will work for you. If your friends make comments or asks questions, help educate them about IBD and your diet.When experiencing symptoms, here are some general tips: Eat smaller meals more often. Reduce the amount of greasy or fried foods you eat. Avoid trigger foods (foods that make your symptoms worse). Ask your healthcare provider about limiting certain high-fiber foods, such as seeds, nuts, popcorn, beans, green leafy vegetables, wheat bran, and raw fruits, if these foods make your symptoms worse. Limit drinking milk or milk prod-ucts if you are lactose intolerant (when you can't tolerate the sugar in milk). Avoid caffeine in coffee, tea, soda and other beverages. Caffeine can act as a stimulant to \"rev\" up the bowel, resulting in diarrhea. If your healthcare provider approves, consider vitamin and mineral supplements, such as vitamin D and calcium. Drink extra fluids. With IBD, it may be easier for you to become dehydrated, especially when you are experiencing a flare.Eating Out Here are some tips to keep in mind if you are eating in the school cafe-teria, at a restaurant, or at a party: Try not to go out feeling too hungry. You may not make the best food choices if you are being driven by hunger and the desire to feel full. Eat smaller portions, perhaps an appetizer or a half-size portion. When in doubt, keep it simple. Go for boiled, grilled, broiled, steamed, poached, or saut\u00e9ed, and limit sauces and spices.LIFE WITH IBD LIFE WITH IBD19 Will I be able to go to school, hang out with my friends, or play sports? Absolutely! The goal of treating your disease is to get your symp-toms under control so you can get back to being a teen. You will be able to do many of the same activ - ities that you did before. However, you may need to take certain pre-cautions and rearrange your plans when you are not feeling well or are too tired. How do I cope with symptoms? You can't predict when your IBD symptoms may become a prob-lem. There will be periods lasting from weeks to years where you'll feel well, and other times when your IBD symptoms will recur and require some additional attention. However, you are more than your IBD. It's important to accept your illness and continue to do what you enjoy. Here are some things you can still do, even with IBD: Explore the activities you enjoyed before IBD and try new ones. Modify them, if you need to, so you can participate and enjoy fully. Form friendships with people who understand and support you. Participate in a regular exercise routine, with your healthcare provider's approval. Exercise can improve overall health, reduce stress, and help to maintain and improve bone strength. Please let your parents or healthcare provider know if your symptoms are making it difficult to live your life, as there may be changes to your medications, or other treatments that can help. Many parts of your life may be affected by your IBD. However, there are things you can do to make your day-to-day life easier. Although people with IBD might have ongoing symptoms and flares, you can still live a successful, productive, and fulfilling life. Here are some answers to questions you might have:Life with IBDLIFE WITH IBD LIFE WITH IBD LIFE WITH IBD LIFE WITH IBD20 21management methods, and no one method has been proven to be more effective than any other. Try an approach that you like. If it doesn't work, try another. Here are some techniques you can try to help manage your stress: Relaxation and breathing exercises Meditation and mindfulness Reading books or listening to podcasts and music Practicing yoga, or other low-impact movements You might also want to try attending a support group where you can connect with other teens who understand what you're going through. You can find a local support group in your community by going to: www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/community-support How can I be prepared? There will be times when your dis-ease is in deep remission and you feel great. But at other times, your IBD symptoms might be unpredict - able and happen at the most inconvenient times. Just in case you need it, be prepared with emergency supplies. It can also help to obtain a Foundation \"I Can't Wait\" card and download a bath-room locator app to your phone. You might want to keep a kit on you that includes the following: Toilet paper Wet wipes Hand sanitizer Small can of air freshener Disposable gloves (to handle any soiled clothes) Large-sized freezer bags (for the soiled clothes) or garbage bags Clean underwear Clean shorts, pants, or leggings (anything that you can wear until you get home) Cleaning supplies What will happen as I get older? As you get older, you will begin to take more responsibility for man-aging your treatment. That way, by the time you are in college or living on your own, you will be able to take full control of your medical needs. If you can answer yes to the below questions, you're doing great! Younger Teens Can you describe your IBD? Can you name your medications, when you need to take them, and their side effects? Can you describe how your IBD affects your daily life, at home, in school, and in the outside world? Can you give the name and pur - pose of each of the medical tests that you have taken? Do you speak up when you're not feeling well? Older Teens Can you describe what will happen if you don't follow your treatment plan? Do you understand the impact that drinking alcohol and smoking can have on your IBD? Can you identify people and places you can turn to for support? Do you know how to contact your medical team in case of an emergency? Do you carry your insurance card with you at all times? Visit www.crohnscolitisfoundation .org/campus-connection/managing -your-care and naspghan.org/ for more information about transition-ing to adult care.What about my emotional health? Living with a lifelong disease can affect your mental health and emo-tional well-being. It's normal to feel anxious, depressed, or stressed throughout your disease journey. Coping with the emotional burden of your disease can be hard, but it's important to remember that you aren't alone. Making sure you are getting help and support for your mental health and emotional well-being is just as important as treating the physical symptoms of your disease. Talking with your parents, friends, and other people with IBD can be helpful. If you need more help, talk to your healthcare provider or another professional, like a teach-er or guidance counselor. These professionals have a lot of experi-ence helping kids and teens with IBD and can discuss some coping strategies with you. Stress is part of everyone's life, and you can't always avoid it. It's important to find ways to manage it because it can make symptoms worse and even cause more stress. Learning stress reduction tech- niques can be helpful if you're finding it hard to manage your stress. There are many stress PEOPLE23 PEOPLESome people, like your parents, guardians, and the school nurse, might need to know more details about your disease, any symptoms you have been experiencing, and which medications you are taking. If you are away from home, maybe at college, someone needs to be your healthcare point person for when your healthcare provider is not available. They need to know your history, symptoms, and your emergency care plan. Others, like your friends, teachers, or your boss, only need to know some details to understand how your IBD symptoms can affect your daily life. Sometimes it's hard to know what to say when someone asks a ques-tion that makes you feel embar - rassed. Here are some ideas (on page 24). Add your own questions and think of some good answers (page 25). What about school? You spend a lot of time at school, and IBD is unpredictable. There-fore, it's a good idea to make a plan with someone at school who knows what's going on. The symptoms of your IBD and IBD treatments might affect your school attendance or performance. You might have to miss school when you have medical appoint - ments or if you're feeling bad during a flare. Remember, you are still responsible for learning the re-quired subject matter, but having a plan for accommodations will help make that process less stressful so you can thrive at school. Talking about your disease to people who are unfamiliar with it can be hard. But the good news is that it's your decision who you tell and how much you share. You may find that it becomes easier over time to share details, but you should not feel pres-sured to share more than you are comfortable with.Talking about my diseasePEOPLE PEOPLE24 25 PEOPLE PEOPLEQuestions I may be asked: How I can respond: Questions I may be asked: How I can respond: Add your own questions and answers below: What's wrong with you? It's a chronic illness called inflam - matory bowel disease, where part of my digestive system is inflamed. Can I catch it? Don't worry, you can't catch it. It's not contagious. Are you OK? Why is your face so puffy? It's because of my medicine. It won't be like this for long. It will become less puffy once I finish taking this medicine. My disease symptoms can come and go, and sometimes I'm in a lot of pain, but I'm okay overall. I might need to rest or take things easy at times. PEOPLE PEOPLE26 27 PEOPLE PEOPLEWhat do I need to do when I travel? Travel takes planning, whether it's to the mall, to grandma's house in the next town, or across the country on an airplane. You can do it\u2014just think ahead: Know the fastest route to the nearest bathroom. On a plane, train, or bus, sit near the restroom. Keep your medicine, snacks, and drinks within easy reach. Store your extra medicine and emergency supplies with you in your carry-on, just in case there are any airplane delays. Carry a letter from your health-care provider describing your IBD and identifying any specific instructions they may give you. Carry a list of your medicines and when you take them. Know who you'd call in an emergency and have their number handy at all times. Be sure you have your health insurance cards and the health insurance company's phone number. Excused absences due to illness, medical appointments, and treatments A home tutor if you are going to be out of school for a while Even if you are doing well and do not feel like you need a 504 plan, it is always good to have it in place\u2014just in case. Ask your teachers and school nurses to download the brochure: A Guide for Teachers and Other School Personnel. It has informa-tion to help them understand IBD, its effect on you, and what they can do to help. Find it and other resources at: www.crohnscolitis-foundation.org/brochures School accommodations To help you meet all of your aca-demic requirements, your parents can request a 504 (accommo-dation) plan. Once you and your healthcare providers identify how your IBD could affect you in school, a 504 plan is created with school professionals that lists the accom-modations, special services, or adjustments you need. Once an evaluation of your needs is completed, changes to your school activities can be made. These accommodations can include, but are not limited to: The freedom to go to the bathroom whenever you need to Access to a private bathroom, like the one in the nurse's office A place to keep your emergency supplies, maybe near that bathroom in the nurse's office Permission to take regularly scheduled and emergency medication at the nurse's office Permission to eat snacks and drink liquids throughout the day Help with classwork that you missed and having quizzes, tests, and projects rescheduled \"Stop the clock\" during tests so you can use the bathroom and not lose any test-taking time COLLEGE COLLEGE29and what may be right for you. In college, these accommodations can also apply to dorm life and not just the classroom. They might include extended time on exams, adjusted deadlines and attendance, note-taking support, priority en-rollment, and a private dorm room or bathroom. Talk to your school's disability office to arrange neces-sary accommodations, and visit the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation's Campus connection website at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/ campus-connection for more information. To learn more about the Americans with Disabilities Act, visit www.ada.gov. Work If you are looking for a job, you should consider yourself just an-other job applicant. Don't feel like it's necessary for you to discuss your IBD during your interview. Your interview should focus on College You can still receive accommo-dations when you are in college, including undergraduate and graduate school. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits public colleges, universities, and trade schools from discriminating against students with a disability. Note that if you had an IEP (Individualized Education Plan) or 504 Plan in high school, this does not automatically carry over to college. Although the accommodations you receive may be similar to those you received in the past, you must apply for accommodations through your college's Disability Resource Center (or equivalent department). To register with your school's disability office, you typically must submit acceptable proof of why you need accommodations and meet with the proper staff members to learn what accommodations are available Your teen years are filled with good, bad, and unexpected things. So how do you deal with all the changes in your life while living with IBD? Here's some information to help you navigate your future:Preparing for college, work, and moreCOLLEGE COLLEGE COLLEGE COLLEGE30 31your qualifications and suitability for the job. After you land the job, are doing it well, and are through the probationary period, then you may want to discuss your need for any specific work accommo-dations. The ADA requires that employers provide reasonable modifications, like the frequent use of a restroom or flexible time off for treatments and appointments. Smoking Smoking carries many health risks, including lung cancer and heart disease. Smoking can also make IBD symptoms worse and may trigger flares. People with Crohn's disease who smoke tend to have more recurrences of their disease, more frequent need for surgery, and a greater need for immune- system-suppressing medications. So, don't get started, or get help to stop. Alcohol and drugs Alcohol affects each patient with IBD differently. The use or abuse of alcohol or other drugs, can have damaging effects on your GI tract and may interfere with your medications. Be sure to discuss your use of alcohol with your healthcare provider.Friends and dating When dating or socializing with your friends, you may need to explain that because of IBD you might not always be able to go out. If you feel like talking more about it, that's up to you. IBD shouldn't prevent you from dating or having a successful and rewarding relationship. Whether you tell your partner about your IBD is up to you. If you're not sure, get some advice from a parent, friend, or maybe another IBD patient. The bottom line is that you shouldn't feel pressured to share more than you're comfortable with at any time. If you choose to share information and the person doesn't respond well, it may not be healthy to have this person in your life. General healthcare maintenance It's important to stay up to date with health maintenance in addition to staying on track with your IBD treatment. Remember to speak with your healthcare provider about general health issues, including: Vaccinations: Teens with IBD should generally follow the same vaccination schedules as the general pediatric population. If you are on immunomodulators or biologic therapy, you should avoid live virus vaccines. These live virus vaccines can include but are not limited to the intra-nasal flu vaccine, measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), and varicella (chicken pox). Be sure you or your parents ask your healthcare provider about flu shots, HPV, pneumo-coccal and other immunizations. Oral health: Symptoms of IBD outside the GI tract may include aphthous ulcers in the mouth (commonly called canker sores). These may be caused by the IBD itself, or they might be due to a lack of nutrients that your body needs. These ulcers can be quite painful, and mouth rinses and other topical treatments may help relieve the discomfort. It is important to also see your dentist for routine dental care and checkups.

Your journey with your disease will be full of ups and downs. Here are some quick things to remem-ber as you navigate your new normal: Nothing you did or didn't do gave you IBD. You didn't catch it from anyone else and you can't give it to anyone. Most people who live with IBD are healthy more often than they are sick. Ask your healthcare provider questions so you can learn more about managing your disease. Understand that sometimes the disease might be a hurdle, but overcoming these hurdles will make you stronger. Keep working toward your goals. Remember that there is an IBD community of other patients, including doctors, lawyers, celebrities, professional athletes, teachers, and people from all walks of life.
