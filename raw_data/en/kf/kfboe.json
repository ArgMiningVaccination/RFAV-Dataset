Special thanks to the development team: Michelle Farr Donna Jessen Paul Kratchman Rebekah Philippart Camelia Pierre Natalie Quashie-Guerra Roni Seabrook Deborah Wagner Pamela White A special thank you also goes out to the reviewers who took time to provide essential feedback on the Practice Guide. * The CPS Investigations Practice Guide (IPG) is a uniform guide that clarifies the standards of CFSA social work practice for child abuse & neglect investigations. It incorporates elements of various CFSA procedures and D.C. regulations pertaining to child abuse and neglect investigations. The IPG does not, however, represent the comprehensive collection of social work practices and procedures. Therefore, CPS staff should refer to the CPS Investigations Policy, FACES.NET SDM manual for CPS, training material and federal and local child welfar e legislation. As always, you should consult with your CPS management team to answer any questions and to provide further guidance. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 5 To the CPS Social Workers: This guide was created for you! We hope that yo u find it useful in support of your day-to-day work on the frontline working with our most vulnerable and challenging children and families in the District . Its purpose is to create clea r standards and improve the quality and timeliness of practice. Nowhere are the efforts of social workers more essential than in the protection of our children. We admire you for the important work you do and for the compassion and commitment that you exhibit each day. ~The Child Protective Services Administration Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 6 INTRODUCTION Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 7 INTRODUCTION The Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigations Prac tice Guide (IPG) is an easy-to-use reference tool for investigating child abuse and/or neglect allegations rece ived by the Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) Hotline. Designed specifically for the CPS social worker , the Guide provides hands-on, step-by-step procedures for giving children the immediate attention they need for their safety and protection, followed by long-range planning for their permanency and well being. Please note in recognition that a child's biological parent is not necessarily the child's caregiver, this Guide uses the term \"caregiver\" inclusively to reflect the same possi ble relationships as cited in DC Code, i.e., \"parent, guardian, or custodian\". AGENCY MISSION The DC Child and Family Services Agency works to im prove the safety, permanence, and well being of abused and neglected children in the District of Columbia and to strengthen their families. This Practice Guide is a living document that fully supports this stated mission. The role of the CPS social worker in helping to fulfill this mission cannot be underestimated! Safety -All children have a right to be safe from abuse and neglect. Permanency -All children need a permanent family who can provide an unconditional, lasting commitment to them. Child and family well-being -Children deserve to grow up in nurturing environments where their physical, emotional, educational and social needs are metChild Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 8 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 9GUIDING PRINCIPLES In addition to supporting CFSA's stated mission, the Practi ce Guide also reinforces the guiding principles of the CPS Administration: \u00be Quality & Competence \u00be Excellence \u00be Accountability \u00be Efficiency \u00be Timeliness Quality & Competence- High quality investigations, including safety and risk assessments, are essential for the protection of children, youth, and families. When a high q uality investigation is completed, the Agency's clients are ensured the protection and safety they deserve. \u00a7 Excellence - Excellence in service delivery is a continuous proc ess and involves critical thinking, non-judgmental communication, professional interpersonal interviewing, adherence to policy and procedure, and the use of best practices. \u00a7 Accountability - Sound decision-making based on policy and procedures helps to ensure accountability. Accountability is also accomplished through comprehensive assessments informed by the gathering of pertinent facts and details. Accurate and concise documentation of ou r decisions and the information which supports them prove our efforts. \u00a7 Efficiency - Through use of the Agency's state-of-the-art aut omated child welfare information system, known as FACES.NET, you increase the efficiency of services to clie nts as well as the Agency's ability to track placement and permanency data \u00a7 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 10Timeliness - Children in need of protection also need rapid intervention to secure their safety. The timeliness and accuracy of your response, along with policy compliance will ensure the best safety intervention process possible. Equally important is timeliness in the documentation of th e investigation notes. Details should be documented as soon as possible after you have gathered the information (and within 24 hours), and concerns that need to be raised to a supervisory level should never be delayed. This includes making calls from the field as needed to support your work and decision making. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 11As a gatekeeper for the children and families entering the child welfare system, you are bound by the above guiding principles whenever you are investigating reports of alleged maltreatment, or child abuse and neglect. In partnership with your management team, the CPS Invest igations Practice Guide will support your ability to respond to allegations of child abuse and/or neglect. It was specifically designed to function as a living document, and to evolve alongside the changing needs of the District's child welfar e population. Accordingly, the Guide will automatically serve as a vehicle for impl ementing new evidence-informed child welfare practices while simultaneously incorporating current policy and procedures, and relevant federal and District CPS requirements. \"Practice Points\" are included in the Guide to further support your activities in key subject matters. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 12 OVERVIEW OF THE Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 13CPS ADMINISTRATION Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 14 The CPS Administration is comprised of three divisions staffed by a program administrator, program managers, supervisor s, social workers, and family support workers. Although the divisions are not sp ecifically divided by investigation type, there are specialized units (e.g., sexual abus e and institutional abuse) that serve the entire Administration. CPS ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The more you understand the individual roles and respon sibilities for each member of the CPS team, the more effective and stream-lined your communication will be and the more successful your outcomes for child safety. Remember : the CPS teaming process is a built-in st ructure and support network for workers and managers to perform their assigned roles and duties. Program Administrator In support of CFSA's teaming principles and best practice standards, the Child Protective Services administrator is a hands-on leader who is available for consultation, f eedback, and direction. In addition to providing strong leadership and oversight for all CPS field operations, the administrator establishes the core vision, goals, objectives, short and long-range plans, and any CPS admi nistration projects designed to enhance the Agency's child protection outcomes. The administrator is further responsible for developing and interpreting both operational and program policies along with specific procedures. Although the CPS administrator ultimately reports directly to the Deputy Director of Agency programs, there is consistent and ongoing communication with other internal and external stakeholders to ensure the integrity of the CPS administration, specifically for CPS performance outcomes, future developments, evaluative procedures, and cutting-edge strategies for the protection of children, youth, and families. Program Managers The CPS program manager is experienced in assessment and evaluation, communication and negotiation, performance management, staff development and training, as well as the ability to provide day-to-day oversight of CPS units that provide direct and/or indirect services to and/or for children and families. In addition to providing assistance to the CPS administrator as needed , a program manager's responsibilities may include [but are definitely not limited to] handling information related to child fatalities, responding to or approving referrals when a worker is unable to contact a supervisor, as well as functioning as a liaison between CPS and both internal and external stakeholders. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 15Supervisory Social Workers The CPS supervisor is responsible for supervising the full ra nge of direct social work services provided by his or her team of social workers. The importance of the su pervisory role in consulting and overseeing child safety decision-making is as important as the actual practice occurring among CPS workers in the field. CPS supervisors must make every effort to ensure that the safety and well-being of children and families is secured through the delivery of professional, high quality, competent, and timely services. The following functions are expected of CPS supervisors as part of their supervisory responsibilities: \u009a Set clear expectations for staff and assist with their professional development. \u009a Coach, support, and role model exemplary practice standards. \u009a Inform workers of any practice or policy changes, and give guidance as needed. \u009a Be available for supervisions and consultation as needed. \u009a Create a climate of teaming, and address the need s of staff to maintain the teaming environment. \u009a Model behaviors that are consistent with CFSA's mission and the National Association of Social Workers' (NASW) code of ethics. CPS Social Workers Child protection is the most challenging area of child welf are. As the CPS social worker, you are responsible for the referrals assigned to you, including field investigations and provision of services. You are required to determine if the report of suspected child abuse or maltre atment is substantiated and requires further action, and if so, what action is necessary. In addition, you are required to continue to assess the risk of further abuse and maltreatment of the child in the requisite time period noted in the DC Code. Ideally, the CPS social worker employs the following skill sets on a daily basis: Family Support Workers (FSW) The main goal of the Family Support Worker is to assist the Administration in ensuring the safety and minimized risk to any child with a suspicion of abuse and neglect by their parent or caretaker. The CPS Family Support Worker will assist in tasks across the administration that include, but are not limited to, independent visits to ensure child safety, assistance in emergency and planned removals of children from their homes into safe and secure environments and the obtaining and assessing of information that will assist in the determination of referrals alleging abuse and or neglect. Given the close contact and sensitive nature of child protec tive services in general, it is important that the FSW have a clear understanding of child welfare practices, child development, and the helping relationship. The FSW is a valued member of the CPS team who performs casework under the supervision of a Supervisory Social Worker. The FSW provides a wide range of support and services for complicated cases. The FSW may provide, but is not limited to, one or more of the following key supports to CPS social workers: \u009a Seven- Day family visit o Entering documentation of the activity during the visit Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 16 \u009a Placement of children into foster care o Entering of documentation of the activity during the visit \u009a Medical Screenings of children in preparation for placement into foster care o Completion and delivery of the placement packet o Entering documentation reflecting the activity of the placement and medical screening \u009a Supervision of Visits o Documentation of parent/child and sibling interaction during the visit \u009a Interviews of Supporting persons or entities to assist in the completion of an investigation o Documentation of all activity during this task \u009a Referrals for services as needed during each referral o Documentation of referrals made and or requested Types of Units CPS employees are essential and this administration is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Under its current structure, CPS Investigations has four types of units to address the various allegations reported to the Hotline. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 17Resource needs of the CPS administration, however, ma y sometimes require any given CPS social worker to handle an investigation that falls outside of the social worker's particular unit. Therefore, every CPS social worker should be well versed in all aspects of child maltreatment and be able to complete all types of investigations. Traditional Units Traditional CPS units investigate the majority of negl ect allegations. Depending upon the severity of the allegation, physical abuse allegations are also investigated in traditional units. Special Abuse Unit This unit investigates allegations of serious physical ab use of younger children, sexual abuse of children of all ages, and child fatalities. Institutional Unit This unit investigates allegations of abuse or neglect in foster homes, group homes, congregate care facilities, residential hospital facilities, boarding schools, licensed daycare facilities or homes, and/or juvenile detention facilities (including the District's Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services' New Beginnings Facility which, although located in Laurel, Maryland, is a District-run and District-owned facility). This unit also assists with sexual abuse investigations as needed. Note: CFSA does not investigate assaults by staff members in sch ools (such as DCPS or charter schools) unless the staff members are acting in loco parentis (such as in a resi dential school). Concerns related to assaults that occur in schools may come through the CPS Hotline but these are forwarded to the District's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for investigation as assaults ( please refer to the CPS Hotline Practice Guide for referral standards ). Afterhours Units CPS is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The afterhours shifts are comprised of evening and midnight shifts who rotate their assigned days of the week to include weekends. These units primarily address emergency situations but also assist the overall needs of the admi nistration by maintaining workloads, as needed, and by completing requests for assistance from other shifts. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 18 INVESTIGATION RESPONSE TIMES Timely initiation of investigation s is required in order to de termine children's safety. The following guidelines for th e assignment of response times are highlighted from the CPS Hotline Policy. 1. It is mandatory for all CPS investigations to be init iated as soon as possibl e, but no later than 24 hours after the receipt of the report. 2. If a report is prioritized for \"Immediate Respon se\", the investigation must be initiated within 2 hours of receipt of the report. 3. Initiation of investigations is considered to ha ve been established when the CPS social worker has made face-to-face contact with the alleged vi ctim child(ren). Good faith efforts must be made to see the child(ren) not only in the home, but in school or daycare when applicable. Immediate Response An \"immediate response\" is required when a report of suspected abuse or neglect indicates that the child's health or safety is in immediate danger , i.e., there is present danger to the child that qualifies as an emergency and requires an immediate response. 24-hour Response A 24-hour response time is assigned to a report when there is no immediate danger or imminent risk of abuse or neglect. Members of the CPS management team may use their disc retion to issue an immediate response time when appropriate to the circumstances. It is understood that even after good faith efforts th e CPS social worker may not be able to accomplish a response within the assigned time period. In such cases, it is important that you immediately inform your management team and that you thoroughly document all such attempts to make contact and next steps. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 19 IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TRIGGERS \u009a Children are left alone. \u009a Child has a serious medical condition or serious injury that requires immediate medical attention. \u009a There is a death of a child. \u009a A hospital, physician, or the police are currently holdi ng the child (e.g., as the result of a positive toxicity screen). \u009a The child has been caged, bound, or is significantly physically restricted in the home. \u009a The caregiver has made a plausible or credible th reat to seriously harm or abandon the child. \u009a A perpetrator who has sexually abused a child has access to the child. \u009a The family is living in an abandoned building, or living without essential utilities, or there are environmental hazards present that are a safety concern. \u009a Walk-in reports. \u009a The caregiver is currently or was recently violent and/or out of control. \u009a The caregiver is mentally ill or developmentally-disabled and cannot make a reasonable judgment about the child's safety . \u009a The caregiver is currently involved in dangerous criminal activity, e.g., weapons are found in the home, and/or an arrest has occurred. \u009a There is a history of serious maltreatment, e.g., chil d fatality, child removed from home, child at school with a bruise, etc. \u009a Caregiver or child appears suicidal or homicidal. \u009a The examples above are not the complete list of immediate response triggers. Better three hours too soon, than one minute too late. - William Shakespeare Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 20ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES Every weekday morning, the CPS Review Panel is held as a formalized method of investigation distribution and review of select hotline reports. Assignment procedures are detailed below. Some Hotline reports may be flagged for a CPS Review Panel due to concerns related to whether or not the report meets le gal sufficiency for a full investigation. Such reports are currently reviewed by CPS staff. On occasion, staff members from one of the six Healthy Families Thriving Communities Collaboratives may also be present. The panel may choose to override the FACES.Net Decision Tool Summary and Outcome Results, based on appropriate clinical assessment and authorization from the CPS program manager. Such reviewed referrals may not be forwarded to the investigation units or may be forwarded solely for a safety assessment. Additionally, a referral to the collaborative is a potential outcome. Decisions to screen out a referral are made by the panel and documented in FACES by a member of the CPS management team before final approval. Child Protective Services' assignments require that soci al workers be available at irregular hours, always ready to perform the CPS duties of protecting children and youth. In addition to investigations, worker assignments might include linking re ferrals or 30-day returns. The assignment procedures below apply primarily to dayshift assignments. However, links and 30-day returns may apply to afterhours shifts. Regular response investigations are assigned at the be ginning of the dayshift on a rotating basis to the unit supervisors. Consideration is given to the nu mber of staff in rotation in each unit. Immediate response investigations are assigned throughout the shift on a rotating basis to unit supervisors. Assignments are made to the social worker from the direct supervisor or a member of the CPS management team and follow a rotation developed within your unit. These rotation patterns vary across units and shifts to best meet each unit's functioning ne eds. Some common scenarios are described belo w regarding other aspects of assignments: Regular Day Off (RDO) and Worker Leave Assignments \u009a When a social worker or unit is on RDO, there will be no assignments , including links or 30-day returns. These matters may be \"initialed\", howeve r, by another social worker and returned to the assigned social worker for completion after he or she returns from RDO. \u009a When a social worker is on leave , but would have received a link or 30-day return assignment, the investigation will be assigned to the unit of that worker. Companion Investigations \u009a To streamline investigations involving families in the same household and/or investigations involving the same incident, the CPS assigns these matters as \" companion \" investigations that are assessed by the same CPS social worker or unit . However, at the discretion of CPS management, companion investigations may be hand led by separate units if there is a mixture of traditional and specialized allegation s or special circumstances warrant. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 21 Links \u009a When there is an open investigation on a family and a new allegation regarding this family is taken at the Hotline, a linked referral will be created. This streamlines the investigation process to ensure that the same worker handles all open allegations regarding a family. \u009a Regardless of the type of investigation, links are assigned to the worker involved with the family. This includes linking a traditional allegation to a specia lized investigation or vice versa, i.e., linking a specialized allegation during an investigation made by a traditional unit. The supervisor of the specialized unit will assist with specialized allega tions if this consultation is needed. 30-Day Returns \u009a CPS makes every effort to minimize duplication of in vestigations and services. Therefore, when a social worker has closed an investigation within the last thirty days , and a new allegation is received on this family, the new referral will be assigned to the same social worker previously assigned to the family. \u009a In contrast to the practice regarding links where investigation types might be combined, assignments of 30-day returns are restricted to same investigation type, e.g., specialized units will only receive 30-day returns with specialized allegations, etc. Weekend Assignments All CPS social workers are requir ed to work rotating weekends. \u009a Only supervisors of the traditional investigation s unit are assigned to weekends. Traditional supervisors will ensure that each unit member in rotation will be permanently assigned at least one investigation. Up to two additional referr als will be retained by the unit for permanent assignment. \u009a Staff members from the specialized units also wo rk on the weekends. Their assignments will be addressed by their respective supervisors on the next business day. With the exception of removals, the traditional unit supervisor will no t make permanent assignments to the specialized workers. \u009a Weekend staff members are tasked with ensuring that 24-hour contacts and safety assessments are completed for as many investigations as possibl e. As a result, an \"all hands\" approach is frequently necessary when determining work ass ignments. Ideally, specialized investigations will be first given to specialized workers but these ma y also be addressed by traditional workers. \u009a Specialized staff may need to assist with initia ling traditional investigations to reach the goal of ensuring child safety in a timely manner. \u009a If social workers need to conduct removals on investigations outside of their typical unit assignments, these investigations (whether specia lized or traditional) will remain with the removal worker. Holiday Assignments \u009a All CPS social workers are required to work at least one holiday during the year. \u009a Social workers do not retain permanent assignments from the holiday shift, unless they have a removal. Removal Assignments \u009a At times it may be necessary for a social work er to conduct a removal pertaining to a family Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 22that may also be the subject of a link or 30-day return to a different social worker. In these instances, the two social workers must coord inate efforts to best serve this family. \u009a If the non-removing social worker has information pertinent to the removal and/or services for the family, they should attend the Family Team Meeting,1 confer with the Assistant Attorney General (AAG), and attend the initial hearing (along with the removing social worker). This worker will also be responsible for completing the investigation. \u009a If the non-removing social worker has not yet met the family or does not have information pertinent to the removal or services for the fami ly, consideration should be given to reassigning the investigation to the removing social worker. This decision will be made jointly between the supervisors of the respective social workers. Management Assignment Discretion \u009a In the best interests of children as well as CFSA employees, CPS management at all times retains the discretion to make assignment decisions through a panel review based on a variety of relevant factors, including the need for \"new eyes\" on an investigation or the availability of staff and/or resources. 1 For more information on FTMs, see th e CFSA Family Team Meeting policy. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 23Additional Information on Referrals At times, a reporting source will provide the Hotline with additional information on referrals and/or cases that are already active with CFSA. When this information does not rise to the level of a new abuse or neglect referral, the information is forwarded to you via e-mail by Hotline staff. This new information should be explored and your findings documented in your investigation notes. INVESTIGATION TRACKING How can this section be simplified? Is somewhat cumbersome ~KFL Investigations at CFSA are tracked by the biological moth er's name. This has several implications for practice and there are a few exceptions. \u009a If the biological mother's name is not known at the time of the Hotline report, the investigation name will be \"Unknown.\" It is your responsibility to change this to the correct name once the identity of the biological mother is learned. \u009a Please note that tracking the investigations in th e biological mother's name does not automatically indicate that the mother is the maltreater. Please do not presume the mother is the maltreater based on the tracking mechanism! \u009a If there are alleged victim children in a home who have different mothers, there must be separate investigations for the children under each mother's name. These are called \"companion investigations.\" \u009a At times you will deal with a mother who is a minor. This minor (sometimes referred to as a \"junior mom\") may or may not be the legal caregiver for her child, and therefore any investigation involving the neglect or abuse of her child may be tracked in her name. Any questions about her legal custody can be confirmed via the domestic relations court. If the \"junior mom\" resides as a minor with her own caregiver, you must determine whether that said caregiver is acting in loco parentis for the junior mom's child. If there are allegations against said caregiver, they are still tracked in the investigation under the junior mom's name. If said caregiver is alleged to also neglect or abuse his/her own children (possibly including the junior mom), this would be a separate companion investigation. \u009a Please note that we can substantiate allegations rega rding a child by the parents, guardians or custodian who are under 18 years of age. We can and should still open a case when appropriate. \u009a If the biological mother's rights have been terminat ed and the child has been adopted, the investigation will be tracked by the adoptive caregiver's name, regardless of the alleged maltreater. Guardianship and legal custody matters generally do not involve terminat ion of parental rights (TPR) and therefore are still tracked in the name of the biological mother. \u009a If the biological mother's rights have been te rminated and the child has not been adopted, the investigation will be tracked based on the circumstance s of the allegations. The decision will be made by the Hotline supervisor or a member of the CPS management team. \u009a If children are maltreated by a pl acement provider or other individual in an institutional setting, as defined by the CFSA Investigations Policy, the investigation will be tracked in the name of the organization that is the subject of the investigation. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 24 FOUNDATIONAL CPS SKILLS Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 25 FOUNDATIONAL CPS SKILLS THE HELPING RELATIONSHIP \"The potential value of a sound relati onship base cannot be overlooked...the relationship conveys interest in and acceptance of the client as a unique and worthwhile person and builds sufficient trust...\" (Cormier and Cormier) It is important that every CPS program manager, su pervisor, social worker, and family support worker understand the importance of building the helping rela tionship and maximizing existing strengths as well as developing new ones. The \"Core Conditions of the Helping Relationship\"2 include respect, empathy, and genuineness. These are the essential conditions for laying the foundation for engagement , and for developing any professional helping relationship. Regardless of yo ur title, when you project these attributes as you intervene in the lives of families, caregivers and children, you provide an opportunity for everyone - yourself included - to experience a sense of \"being understood\" and valued. The natural outcome is a relationship where both parties are more willing to engage in helping one another as well as themselves. 2 Rogers, C. (1957). The necessary and sufficient conditions of therapeutic personality change. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 21, 95-103 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 26 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 27 Respect, Empathy, and Genuineness These are the 3 core attributes that you must project in order to develop relationships with families and to help them get their needs met while promoting safety for their children. Respect -\"...valuing another person because he/she is a human being. Respect implies that being a human being has value in itself.\" When you display respect you show that you believe that human beings are worthy of respect, you understand the uniqueness of each person, and you believe that people can change. When you communicate respect , you accomplish the following positive goals: \u009a Reinforcing caregivers' strengths. \u009a Communicating warmth. \u009a Suspending critical judgment. \u009a Demonstrating commitment. \u009a Developing empathy. Empathy - \"...the process of tuning into (feeling) another pe rson's feelings, developing a sense of what the situation means to and feels like for the individual, and communicating understanding and compassion to that person. It is in the nature of empathy that we build a bridge between ourselves and others.\" You display empathy when you develop the following skills: \u009a Tuning into another person's feelings. \u009a Communicating compassion. \u009a Expressing your desire to understand. \u009a Learning what is important to the family. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 28Genuineness - \"...involves being aware of one's own feelings and making a conscious choice about how to respond to the other person, based on what will be most helpful in facilitating communication and developing a good relationship.\" Expressing genuineness includes the following positive actions: \u009a Being yourself. \u009a Remaining non-defensive. \u009a Matching your verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Each of these core attributes is critical for reinforcing th e helping relationships between CFSA staff as well as with our clients and external stakeholders. When embarking on any investigation, check yourself on each of these three attributes, so that you can be your best professional self when engaging with families. OBJECTIVITY Objectivity is the principle of examining situations with out bias. As a CPS social worker, you must be objective enough to systematically evaluate clients and their situations in an unbiased, factual way. THE IMPORTANCE OF OBJECTIVITY Throughout the investigation process it is very important that you remain OBJECTIVE. To maintain objectivity throughout the CPS response, you should consider the following requirements: 9 Be aware of your own values, belief s, feelings, and needs, and consider their influence on your perceptions. 9 Pay careful attention to deta il when making observations. 9 Conduct an open, systematic search for facts before drawing conclusions. 9 Practice consistency in your de cision-making; following policy and procedures over emotion Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 29 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 30UNDERSTANDING AND ENGAGING THE FAMILY SYSTEM Families often become involved in the child welfare system because of disturbances in the family system, usually due to changes in the larger environment and/or within the family itself. In order to assess safety and assist the family, the assessment must be made within the requir ed response time. When you respond according to the response time noted on the referral, it allows you to accurately determine whether there are any safety factors that place the child in immediate danger or impending danger. During the assessment you will examine and evaluate the home conditions, and you will interview and observe all of the children in the household, including the alleged victim, parent or caregiver, alleged maltreater, and all other household members. Finding a CPS worker at the door almost always arouses discomfort and undermines emotional security, as well as threatens the family's balance. When conducting an investigation of reported child abuse or neglect, the best way to start any interview is by engaging the alleged maltreater, caregiver, or family member . Engagement is the process of connecting with the ch ild/youth, mother, father, extended family, primary caregiver, and other team members for the purpose of building an authentic, trusting, and collaborative working relationship. When you \"engage\" with a family, you actively work with them to promote safety, permanency and well being for their children. To be successful, you must also embrace the core conditions of the helping relationship: respect, empathy and genuineness and you must embrace the following key elements: \u009a Active listening to each family member. \u009a Developing an understanding of the family's past ex periences, current situation, concerns, strengths, and potential. \u009a Responding quickly to a family's concrete needs. \u009a Clearly establishing the purpose of involvement with the family. \u009a Being aware of one's own biases and prejudices about families. \u009a Validating the participatory role of the family in planning and making decisions for their child. \u009a Being consistent, reliable, and honest with families. \u009a Fully disclosing information with families. \u009a Honoring the culture, racial, ethnic, linguistic, an d religious or spiritual backgrounds of children, youth, and families, as well as respecting differences in sexual orientation. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 31 Engagement \u009a Remember the core conditions of the helping relation ship in all of your inte ractions with families. \u009a CPS social workers should never read the allegations as they are narrated on the referral. Reading the allegations word for word may place the reporter and /or the children at risk of harm. You may also miss critical information by focusing on specific incidents when a broader co nversation would yield a truer picture of the family situation. \u009a Remember, all members of the household must be interviewed alone and separately. This process allows you to gain individual explanations of the a llegations on the referral to gather information about the presence of safety factors and to assess for evid ence of any abuse or maltreatment. Adults must be interviewed separately to ensure that they are not in fluenced by others and that their individual voice is heard. Children must also be interviewed sepa rately for the same reasons, including from the caregiver/alleged maltreater as well as any other children in the home. \u009a Later in the assessment it may be of use to interv iew adults and/or children together to be able to observe their interactions or to jointly plan for the family. Engaging Challenging Clients In all probability, a certain subset of your clients will become upset, hostile, verbally abusive and/or threatening. These individua ls can be caregivers, relatives, yout h or even professional members of the community. When handling a difficult conversation or phone call, the key role you are expected to play is one of a calming influence so that you can ga ther the pertinent information that will help to protect (or save) a child. The following popular st rategies are useful for minimizing an angry or verbal attack from a client: 1) Simple Listening : Wait until the person is finished talking. Listen and wait for him or her to take a breath, and then ask a directed question, such as \"What can I do to help you?\" Your tone should be determined, not placating. 2) Active Listening : Make a genuine attempt to put yourself in the other person's situation as best you can. Listen to what is not being said as well as the words that ar e expressed. Identify the underlying emotions. 3) Acknowledgement: Respond honestly - and respectfully - when you calmly acknowledge the person's position. You might say, \"I can see how something like that could cause some anger.\" or \"If that happened to me, I would be angry, too.\" This confirms the legitimacy of the emotion, but it also diffuses the approach the caller has taken to communicate the intensity of the emotion. 4) Apologizing: Sincerely apologizing for anything in the situation that you recognize as problematic is not the same as taking the blame. You can always say, \"I'm so sorry that happened to you\" or \"I'm sorry the situation is so frustrating.\" This allows the individual to Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 32 feel that they are not alone, that you identify with them in the particular circumstance, and that a certain measure of trust can be invested in you as the worker. 5) Agreeing: There are usually three truths to any given situation - your truth, the other's truth, and THE truth. It is important to listen for THE truth. Agreeing with the truth of a situation can help redirect the interaction towards a productive outcome. 6) Inviting Criticism: Sometimes it is effective to invite the client to get their criticisms out in the open. You might say something like, \"Go ahead and tell me everything that has you upset. Don't hold anything back. I want to hear all that yo u have to say.\" It may seem at first that this strategy intensifies their emotional state but ev entually, the distraught person will expend themselves and you will have the opportunit y to continue gathering necessary facts. TEAMING Teaming is the foundation of the District's child welfare practice and a core component of your practice when addressing child abuse and negl ect. By teaming with the family and other team members, you will gain the advantage of genuine collaboration during case planning and decision-making. As a CPS social worker and licensed clinician, you must use your expertise and practice wisdom to work with families in ways that encourage them to fully participate in the assessment, case planning and other ke y decisions involved with CPS intervention. Remember that your efforts are more likely to succeed when clients are involved and actively participate in the process. Key Outcomes of Effective Teaming: \u009a Children/youth and families benefit from active involvement. \u009a Collaboration supports sound decisions and coordinated, effective services. \u009a Children/youth achieve permanence promptly. When you team with the family, you allow the child (when developmentally appropriate) or youth, birth parents (including non-custodia l parents), extended family, and caregivers to participate in decision-making regarding safety, permanence, and well being. As a joint process between the entire family and other professionals, the team's insight becomes a part of the CPS assessment. As the CPS social worker, you will te am with families during the FTM process, and you may also team with the non-offending caregiver in developing a safety plan. You may team as well with a teen in the home around what they believe their family needs, as well as external professionals. Keep in mind, that when you team with the family, you improve their chances for successful outcomes! Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 33BASIC INTERVIEWING The interview is the primary method used to gather information from the children and families that you will meet in your work. In fact, your ability to perform your primary responsibilities depends in large part on your interviewing skills. During your init ial contact with the family, your goal is to obtain and assess select information to make informed and effective decision s on behalf of the children, and to help develop an appropriate set of interventions. The CPS interview can be a very difficult part of your involvement with families. The core helping conditions of empathy, respect and genuineness will support you throughout this important process. Introduction: When beginning an interview with a caregiver, it is best to start broadly before narrowing in on the allegations. For example, begin the conversation by introducing yourself and explaining the reasons why you are there to speak with them: \"My name is [....] and I'm representing the District of Columbia's Child & Family Services Agency. I am here because there are some concerns about the safety of your child(ren). The reason for my visit is to make sure you and your children are safe, and if necessary, to assi st you and your family in keeping them safe. To do this I need to ask you some questions about your childr en and family. Please know that I will carefully listen to whatever you have to say. You can also tell me of any concerns you have.\" During the introduction, explain both the philosophy of CPS and your obligation to conduct a comprehensive investigation on the well-being of the family. This will ju stify your request for certain information, particularly when you ask to see children who may not be the direct subject of a report. For example: \"When we receive a report from the Hotline, part of what we do in CPS is check on the safety and well- being of everyone in the family. That means I need to talk with you about the basic things you do as a caregiver, for example, feeding and clothing your family , maintaining the household, and so on. I also need to learn about supervision and discipline of the children , and so forth. Afterward I'll need to talk with your children individually to hear th eir thoughts about your family.\" Remember that your conversation with the alleged maltre ater (or non-offending parent or caregiver) is about getting to know the family dynamics and how the family fu nctions as a whole, not just one specific level. Many times you will address the allegations through this introductory, general conversation. It is important to avoid accusatory language that may instigate or elevate tension . Try to use words like \"concerns\" or \"questions\" rather than \"allegations\". Later in the interview you may have to be more direct in your questioning but the initial process should take place with a conversational tone. Special Note: not all standards work with every client. That is why interviewing is more art than science. If you are dealing with a hostile client or a client who is fixate d on the allegations, you may have to begin with direct questioning to make any progress in the investigation. Ei ther way, use your engagement and conflict-resolution skills. Hopefully, you can develop a collaborative dialog ue as you continue the interviewing and investigative process. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 34 REMINDER: YOU CANNOT REVEAL A REPORTING SOURCE! If the caregiver insists on knowing the reporting source, be prepared to redirect the conversation. Explain frankly to the caregiver the legal reasons why you cannot share this information. Use empathic language: \"It's reasonable for you to wonder where this report came from. If I were you, I would want to know as well but because of the rules I have to follow, I can't confirm or deny the reporting source. It's just a legal fact that people who contact CPS have the right to remain anonymous. I do know, however, that sometimes people don't know the whole situation or make false reports. You can imagine that the reporter might fear retaliation so they need to know that they can safely report legitimate concerns. That's why it's so important for you to have this opportunity to share your information with me and for me to keep an open mind when I come out to investigate. We don't know what is true without talking with you. So I'm hoping we can sit down together and sort through this report. The most important thing is the safety of children.\" Key points to remember: \u009a When you show up at the door, you will like ly be unwelcome. You must work hard to build rapport and engage the family in the interview process. \u009a Determine the caregiver's understanding of the purpose of the interview. \u009a Ask for his or her questions or concerns. Engagement: After you have introduced yourself and explained the re ason for the interview, you can begin to build rapport with the family member and gather the information you need to assess the safety of the children. Ask general questions about the family. If there is more than one caregiver, is important to interview each caregiver separately and also to compare the answers of all family members. Key points to remember: \u009a Pay attention to the emotional state of the fa mily. Family members experience a variety of powerful emotions and may express their anger, fear, and frustration during the interview. A highly-charged or emotional fa mily member may not be able to provide clear and detailed information. Show your conc ern; this often helps to decrease the level of tension. Free Narrative : When it is time to discuss the allegations, remember to avoid accusatory language. Do not read the allegations described in the referral snapshot. Start by asking questions that will allow the caregiver to have an opportunity to provide his or her own version of the events: Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 35\"So I'm here because of some concerns about your chil dren that were brought to the Agency's attention. I'd really like to hear your though ts about how things are going with your family. We'd also like to offer assistance if there is something we can help your family with.\" At this stage of the interview, avoid interrupting the ca regiver's account of the circumstances. Allow them to respond at their own pace, and you can ask follow-up questions afterwards. Let the caregiver talk about what is important to them. They will likely tell you significant information about their thoughts and feelings on the family even if you do not immediately get to the heart of the allegations. You ability to listen and acknowledge what is important to your client provides a foundation to move into more specific conversation about the allegations. Open-ended Requests and Questions : Once the caregiver has had an opportunity to express their thoughts on why you are investigating the family, you can begin exploring the allegations by asking open-e nded questions and/or requesting information. Do not directly identify the allegations as described in the in take report. Rather, start with generalized questioning. EXAMPLES OF APPROPRIATE VS. INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS APPROPRIATE INAPPROPRIATE \"Please share with me your understanding of how your daughter was injured.\" \"So tell me, why did you punch your daughter in the eye?\" \"How is your child doing in school? Does your son or daughter enjoy school?\" \"Why is your child falling so far behind in school? How come your child is in danger of repeating a grade?\" \"How is your child's school attendance?\" \"This allegation says you do not send your child to school.\" \"Let's talk about the use of alcohol.\" \"It looks to me like you have a drinking problem.\" Specific Questions : It is important to realize that some people do not view their actions as maltreatment and most people do not readily admit to mistreating their child. Reminder: denial of an allegation does not automatically mean that Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 36the allegation is not true, nor does it imply that there ar e no legitimate safety concerns for the child. To gather as many facts as possible, it may be necessary to ask ve ry pointed, specific questions regarding the allegations. You may need to be equally specific when requesting information that will influence your overall assessment. How and when you discuss or describe the nature of the allegations will be determined based on the circumstances of the investigation, the family circumstances, and your own judgment. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 37 Concluding the Interview : A respectful conclusion to the interview builds trust and opens the door for ongoing or future engagement opportunities with the caregiver. Always give the client an opportunity to ask questions. Always thank him or her for taking the time to speak to you, and remember to provide your contact information. All essential information has now been collected, an d as many gaps as possib le have been filled, including information on demographi cs and family composition. At this stage, you will give the individual an opportunity to share any additional in formation that may not have been revealed during the Exploratory Stage of the interview. Key points to remember: \u009a Summarize the key points, decisions, and a ny additional information that have been discussed. \u009a Ask the individual if they have any questi ons, and respond hone stly and directly. \u009a Discuss future actions and next steps. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 38 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR CPS PRACTICE Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 39 PHILOSOPHY OF COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS When CPS staff accepts an investigation regarding a family, we accept a \"special relationship\" with them which involves teaming to support the safety, wellbeing, and pe rmanence for the children and the family overall. To this end, CPS involvement is not solely allegation focu sed; rather it is focused on carrying out the agency mission. CONFIDENTIALITY DC Code \u00a74-1303.06 states that \"in formation acquired... which identifies individual children reported as or found to be abused or neglected or which identifies other members of their fa milies or other persons or other individuals shall be considered confidential.\" Further, according to the Code, this information ma y only be released or divulged for the following reasons: \u009a purposes relating to the identification of abuse or neglect \u009a identification of service needs or resources \u009a securing or provision of treatment or direct services for the child or individual identified \u009a the investigation or review of child fatalities by representatives of the Child Fatality Review Committee Additionally, the Code notes that \"persons or ag encies who are not covered by confidentiality requirements comparable to those [above], to whom in formation is released pursuant to this section, must sign a statement that they will not divulge such confidential information for purposes unrelated to the purposes of treatment, identification or evaluation.\" You must always exercise discretion when sharing in formation for the purposes identified above. In general, information should be shared on a \"need to know basis\" for the purposes discussed. If you have questions, please consul t your management team or the General Counsel's office. In many areas of investigative work, you will find that you have the ability to ask questions of and receive information from collateral sources. You must recognize that you may not always be able to, or need to, share information in response. Acclima te yourself to this concept and be able to comfortably discuss this with individuals. Many peop le will still be willing to share information with you once they understand the boundaries within which you have to operate. In general, you cannot confirm or deny that the Agen cy has involvement with a given child or family. If collateral sources of in formation reach out to you without proper releases of information, you may accept information from them and explain that if th e Agency is aware of this family, the information will be forwarded to the assigned social worker an d management team. You may, at times, determine that information sharing is warranted with certain co llateral sources but you should take care to obtain proper releases ( Authorization to Disclose Information ) of information whenever possible, even though this may not be a legal requirement. If you are not able to obta in releases of information, Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 40and information needs to be shared for the purpos es discussed above, you must limit this sharing information that is absolutely necessary. Biological Parents Who are Not Primary Caregivers Biological parents usually have a right to informa tion on CPS investigations involving their children, provided that their caregiver rights have not been terminated. Provided that you have properly identified an individ ual as a biological parent whose rights are intact, you may share information about the investigation with this individual. You must still exercise discretion when sharing the informati on, ensuring that it follows the provisions discussed above. One person's information may not be ab le to be shared with another person, but information concerning their child in common would be. However, informati on on a half-sibling should not be shared with the non-legal guardian or custodian. Specific care should be used when sharing information with a parent who is not a primary caregiver or who may have a level of hostility toward, or estr angement from, the primary caregiver. You should realize that at times, information sharing might jeop ardize the physical or emotional safety of a child or other individual. This must be considered prio r to disclosing information. For example, a secondary parent may be entitled to information on the disp osition of whether their child has been abused or neglected, but they may not be entitled to the de tails of how that determination was made, including demographic information and so forth. When in do ubt, you should consult with your management team about confidentiality concerns. You may also wish to consult with the CFSA Privacy Officer. Neighbors Neighbors can be a vital source of infor mation for your investigation. You are allowed to speak with neighbors but you ar e not allowed to reveal that you have an investigation on a given ch ild or family, as this breaks their confidentiality. You may explain to neighbors that you would like to speak with a given child or family but you cannot give any detail as to the reason for such contact. You may explain to neighbors that your job is to protect children and that they may talk with you about any concerns they have regarding the well-being of any child, including the ones about whom you may have directly asked. If you receive information from neighbors that is cr itical to the investigation, talk with them about their willingness to share their name or contact information and whether they are willing to be witnesses to this information. If they are not will ing to share their information in an official capacity, you should respect this. You are still able to do cument their concerns in FACES (as an anonymous source) and use this toward your overall decision-m aking and disposition if you believe the source of information is credible ( see definition of \"credible evidence \" in the appendix). Extended family For investigations that do not involve a removal, ex tended family do not have a right to information about the investigation. If you are contacted by ex tended family, you may receive information from them but cannot share information (unless it is rela ted to the purposes discussed in the introduction Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 41to this section). You cannot confirm or deny involvem ent with a given family without proper releases of information. Remember that many extended fami ly members care deeply for the children and families about whom they may be contacti ng you. Empathize with their concern. There are times when you will be able to communic ate with extended family with proper consent from the parent or caregiver. This consent should be in writing for the protection of all parties. In these situations, this communication should still be hand led thoughtfully, on a \"need to know\" basis. The only information shared should be that which is related to the planning for the family safety and well- being, and even then, only the component s that involve the extended family. In removal situations, you are able to share with extended family that a child is in CFSA custody. Without a proper release of information, you are not able to share any reasons why the child is in care. You may talk with family members in genera l about CPS processes and also receive information from family members that may be critical to the inv estigation. Family members should be informed of the Family Team Meeting (FTM) process but also should be made aware that the legal caregivers give consent for extended family to be invited to th is meeting. Family members may be informed of the initial court hearing and, if the judge permits, ma y be present in the hearing to become aware of the circumstances of the removal. Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) Partners The multi-disciplinary team was established for th e purposes of improving service provision to victims and family and enhancing legal responses to child maltreatment. Therefore, you are able to share information with our MDT partners about investigations for the purposes discussed in the introduction to this section. Service Providers As noted in the introduction to this section, you may share information with individuals who may be providing services to a child or fami ly. The information you share must only be related to the service provision need, however, and should not fall outside of this scope. Whenever possible, obtaining an appropriat e release of information is preferred. Custody Court Personnel You are prohibited from sharing information with custody court personnel, including judges, without express permission from the CFSA Office of the Ge neral Counsel (OGC). If you are approached for information in a custody proceeding, you must explain that you cannot confirm or deny involvement with a family and refer the individual requesting information to the OGC. Talking to Individuals Represented by Counsel While not expressly related to confidentiality, you mu st be prepared to speak with individuals who are represented by counsel, be it in a family court ma tter or some other court proceeding. Counsel for an individual can express to their client that the client should not speak with you without representation. It is still up to the client to make a decision as to whether they will adhere to this. You are not required to speak with clients through their counsel and should not feel compelled to do so. Your function is to assess for child maltreatment and to coordinate an appropriate professional response to the concerns identified. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 42CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE CONSIDERATIONS With every CPS investigation and assessment, a person's history and culture may affect certain areas. As a CPS social worker, it is important that you gain an understa nding of each family's culture. You must also recognize that a given culture cannot be defined simply as a static bundle of fixed traits. The following questions may be used as part of the assessment to guide your understanding of cultural differences. \u009a What roles do males and females play in the family? \u009a What is the role of religion for the family? \u009a How do the family's beliefs infl uence child-rearing practices? \u009a What is the meaning, identity and involvement of th e larger homogeneous group (e.g. race, nationality)? \u009a What family rituals, traditions and behaviors exist? \u009a What is the usual role of children in the family? \u009a What is the perception of the role of children in society? \u009a What types of discipline does the family consider to be appropriate? \u009a What are the family's attitudes or beliefs regarding health care? \u009a What are the family's sexual attitudes and values? \u009a Who is assigned authority and power of decision making? \u009a What tasks are assigned based on traditional roles in the family? \u009a What are the communication styles in the family? \u009a How does the family solve problems? Deal with conflicts? A culturally sensitive CPS assessment recognizes caregiver pr actices and family structures vary as the result of ethnic, community and familial differences, and this range can result in different but safe and adequate care for children within the parameters of the law. The C PS assessment process must acknowledge, respect and honor the diversity of families. The following are examples of cultural practices which are considered unacceptable (but this list is not exhaustive): \u009a Coining- a\" medicinal\" folk practice that involves the rubbing of heated oil on the skin, most commonly on the chest, back, or shoulders, and then vigorously rubbing a coin over the area in a linear fashion until a red mark is seen. \u009a Cupping (or cupping method) - a \"therapeutic\" method involving the application of suction by placing a vacuumized (usually by fire) cup or jar on to the affected or any part of the body surface. \u009a Female Circumcision (or female genital mutila tion [FGM])- this practice comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 43 LANGUAGE CONSIDERATIONS The investigation process for every refe rral must accommodate individuals who have a limited ability to communicate in English, either because the individual speaks a foreign language or because th ere is sight, speech, and/or hearing impairments. Limited English Proficiency (LEP) ma y impact the parent, caregiver, the children in need of protection, the alleged maltreater, other members of the househ old, key collateral contacts, other relatives who may need explanations of the investigation process, the investigation findings, and/or the outcome of the investigation. Every client with LEP has the legal right to understand, as fully as possible, all significant CPS actions at each stage of the investigation process and serv ice, including but not limited to the following investigative procedures: \u009a investigation of the allegations of child abuse or neglect \u009a adverse actions such as removal of a child from his home \u009a case planning and service delivery \u009a judicial proceedings in which the court does not itself provide bilingual or interpreter services \u009a the right to a fair hearing and the appeal proceedings \u009a the administrative review process It is your obligation as the CPS investigative soci al worker to make reasonable efforts to provide information and services in a language or medium that the client can understand through the use of interpreters, translators, readers, or other methods. You must offer a translator or other communication support for every visit. If the client declines such services, please have them sign a statement indicating such and include it in your record. Note: Your efforts to provide bilingual or interpreter services must not delay or interfere with either of the following necessary actions: \u009a protecting a child from harm or risk of harm \u009a compliance with all federal and local laws, rules and regulations Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 44Language Access Line Services Language Access Line Services give you access to over-t he-phone interpretation 24 hours-a-day, seven days a week. This program ensures that clients with LEP will have access to the services they need while simultaneously providing you with the support you need to deliver those services. Every CPS investigator is required to take the Language Access Line training. When you first become aware of the need for la nguage line services (e.g., at the onset of an investigation, you realize a witness to an allegation cannot be intervi ewed without the language access line service), or when you are placing a call to a client with known LEP, you should adhere to the following procedures: 1. Dial 1-866 874-3972 2. When the language line representative answers, provide him or her with the following information (or enter the information on your telephone keypad according to the prompts): o Enter the 6 digit Client ID: XXXXXX o Provide our Agency's name: DC Child and Family Services Agency o Press 1 for Spanish. o Press 2 for all other languages (be prepared to state the language that needs to be interpreted). o Enter the secured Access Code: (this number is received during training). 3. Once the interpreter is connected to the call, provide the following information: o Brief the interpreter regarding the purpose of the call. o Summarize your objectives and goals for the conversation. o Provide any additional or special instructions. 4. Lastly, connect the client or individual with LEP to the line. NEVER use family members, friends, or child vi ctims as translators! Even with consent of the party, this is inappropriate. CPS does not use family members, friends, or childr en (including child victims) to interpret, translate, sign, or read for clients with LEP. A Metropolitan Police Officer (MPD) if present and who speaks the same language as the client may be used to translat e for brief interactions that specifically assist a client's request and/or arranges for the requested translation services. Ideally, interpreters and translators will be profession ally trained and/or be a CPS staff pe rson who is fluent in the client's preferred language. Some MPD officers are certified and can be used as an interpretation resource. Ensuring Comprehension of Written Material Notwithstanding LEP status, a client may have a limite d ability to understand ma terial written in his or her own language. When communicating your purpose, goals, and services to a client, you should verbally review written material with the client and th e interpreter to ensure that it is fully understood. Removal Concerns If you must remove a child from his or her home, you must consider the child's language needs and assess the importance of placing the child with a foster family th at speaks the same language. Language is not the only Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 45factor to consider in placing the child, but it must no t be neglected. You must ensure that any LEP needs are communicated to the Placement Services Administration. If the parent or caregiver speaks a language other than English, you must document the language on the complaint form and in FACES to ensure that the Family Court will obtain a translator and assign an attorney who is appropriate for the client during all court hearings. Documentation You must carefully document in FACES: \u009a any offer of an interpreter to assist in tr anslation for a client (whether the client accepts or rejects the offer) \u009a when the use of an interpreter occurs \u009a the interpreter's name (e.g., the Language Access Line)or agency affiliation (e.g., staff at CFSA) \u009a the interpreter's relationship (if any)or professional affiliation with the person with LEP \u009a use of any type of communication aids \u009a your own ability (or inability) to communicate in the client's preferred language \u009a any reason why an interpreter might not have been used PROTOCOL FOR DETERMINING A CHILD' S BIOLOGICAL OR LEGAL CAREGIVER Biological parents Every child has two biological parents and neither shou ld be overlooked in your investigation. You must exercise care, however, in determining the identity of biological parents and make effort to obtain names, address, telephone number, and nature of parent's relationship with the child. For most investigations, the biological mother will be known but there may be times when the maternity is questioned. When this occurs, you should seek out guidance from your management and legal team. In contrast, the identity of the biological father may not be legally obvious during many investigations. For the purposes of CFSA involvement with families, a man may be considered the biological father under the following circumstances: \u00b7 He was legally married to the mother at the time of the child's birth. \u00b7 His name is on the child's birth certificate. \u00b7 Paternity testing has been completed and demonstrates that he is the father. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 46\u00b7 Court paperwork (paternity affida vit, child support documentation, etc.) exists reflecting that he is the father. Whenever you face a question of maternity or paternity, you must view legally appropriate paperwork to show that the individual in question is in fact the biological parent. It is not sufficient to simply hear that someone is named on a birth certificate or to see unofficial paperw ork suggesting that an individual is a parent. You must see the actual birth certificate yourself. Examples of un official paperwork might include a person's name as the parent on a permission slip for a school field trip, or a person's name on a note excusing an absence from school. Legal Caregivers Many families make informal (or formal) living arrangeme nts for the care of children, which may be perfectly acceptable. Regardless of such arrangements, you are required to be aware of and in contact with a child's legal caregiver whenever you engage with a family. You must also exercise care in situations where you are responsible for releasing a child to a caregiver (e.g., a chil d who is not picked up afterschool and presents to CPS for assistance). You may not release a child to a non-legal caregiver . You must verify a child's legal caregiver through the following documentation: \u0083 Legal paperwork that proves the legal caregiver was changed through Agency involvement that resulted in a new legal custody, guardianship, or adoption relationship. \u0083 An order from an established court of law granting physical custody of the child to the individual. INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING OTHER JURISDICTIONS If the maltreatment occurred in another jurisdiction, but the family or children reside in the District of Columbia, you must complete the following tasks: \u009a Conduct an investigation to determine where the alleged maltreatment occurred. \u009a Make a report of the alleged maltreatment to the jurisdiction where it occurred. \u009a Conduct a courtesy interview and home visi t if requested by the other jurisdiction. \u009a Consider whether an investigation or safety check is warranted in the District given the overall mosaic of the family. This decision will be made in concert with your management team. \u009a Under no circumstances may you close an accepted CPS investigation without verifying the whereabouts of the alleged victim children and family and ensuring that a CPS professional has made contact with them. \u009a Consult with CFSA's Office of the General Counsel for legal advice as needed. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 47If the maltreatment occurred in the District but the family lives or is visiting in a nearby jurisdiction you have conditional ability to enter that jurisdiction to visi t the family. The following must be considered and any questions should be directed to your management team or the General Counsel's office: \u009a You may visit a child or family in another jurisdiction to ensure that you have physically met and interviewed required parties to the investigation. \u009a You may NEVER physically remove a child from another jurisdiction. \u009a If, when visiting another jurisdiction, you encounter sa fety concerns those must be immediately reported to that jurisdiction's CPS and/or police department. INABILITY TO IDENTIFY OR LOCATE A CHILD OR FAMILY Per Administrative Issuance CFSA-08-2 No investigation will be closed solely on the grounds that the child could not be located until thoroughly good faith efforts have been made by the CPS worker to locate the child and family. If the child or family cannot be immediately lo cated, investigative efforts must be elevated and the following steps taken concurrently with a sense of urgency to thoroughly exhaust all avenues for locating the child and/or family: \u009a A minimum of three (3) unannounced home visits at different times within a 48 hour timeframe with at least one visit between the hours of 8pm - 8am \u009a Use of Internet search engines such as http://www.whitepages.com/, \u009a http://www.zabasearch.com, an d http://www.freeality.com/ \u009a Mailing of a certified letter, in the family's primary language, to the last known address, referral address, or address listed on the ACEDS and/or SPIS report \u009a Contact with the reporter to obtain additional information on locating the child and family \u009a Visit to the child/ren's neighborhood school or sch ool if enrollment is known (or a request should be made to the DCPS Penn Attendance Intervention Center (202-541-6411) or Douglass Attendance Intervention Center (202-698-2461) if enrollment is unknown); efforts should also be made to reach the emergency contact person on file with the school \u009a Contact with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Truancy Officers to request assistance in gaining access to family (when allegations warrant and there has been involvement with the family) \u009a Request that MPD check their database for any involvement with the particular family or address \u009a Criminal background search of any known family members for access to addresses or other contact information \u009a Referral to the Diligent Search Unit within 1 week if family has not responded and follow-up on the results of diligent search; No report shall be closed without receipt and follow-up on diligent search results \u009a Interview neighbors, relatives, and other collateral resources \u009a Confirm that the family is no longer residing in the re sidence (via landlord, property records or verified alternative residence) \u009a Contact the Healthy Family Thriving Communities Co llaboratives to determine whether the family is known to them or has received services from them (see attachment) \u009a Consult with Assistant Attorney Ge neral (AAG) staff to determine if Pre-Petition Custody Order is warranted \u009a Check with other governmental agencies for possible involvement, including the Department of Mental Health, the Department of Human Services, Income Maintenance Administration, etc. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 48 FAILED ATTEMPTS FOR INITIAL CONTACT An investigation is considered initiated when the alleged victim child (ren) have been seen and assessed and appropriate safety planning has occurred with the caregiver. At times there will be credible locating information for the family (address, school, etc.) but successful contact does not occur for any number of reasons. Per Administrative Issuance CFSA-08-2 \"Immediate Requirements for All CPS Investigations\" If the family is not at home, the following steps must be completed by the CPS worker: \u009a Leave a notification letter in the family's primary language (if known) at the home, requesting contact within 24 hours. (only for neglect reports ) \u009a If the child is school age, make contact within 24 hours to interview the child at the neighborhood school or the school listed in the referral \u009a If the child is not school age, make contact within 24 hours to interview the child at the daycare center listed in the referral \u009a Interview neighbors, resident managers, or landlords to confirm the address or determine the whereabouts of the family. If family is no longer residing at the address, obtain a forwarding address when possible \u009a Conduct at least 2 additional home visits at different times with one of these visits taking place between the hours of 8pm - 8am \u009a Send a certified letter CLIENT REFUSAL TO ACCESS A CHILD, FAMILY, OR HOME You will encounter occasions when you are aware of the location of a child or family but cannot access aspects of the family situation typically required for a complete CPS investigation (including interviews of the alleged victim, siblings, household members, caregivers, or li ving spaces). Listed below are strategies for common scenarios. In addition, these matters should be discussed in with your management team and during the 18-day review process to ensure that all possible steps are taken and to make joint decisions, at times, that a typically required investigation component will not be required. You should complete the steps discussed above for unable to locate clients, if applicable, in addition to the following required steps from Administrative Issuance CFSA-08-2. If the family refuses to cooperate , the CPS worker must complete all of the following as appropriate: \u009a Contact CPS Management team immediately \u009a Contact MPD for assistance Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 49\u009a Contact the OAG - CPS section attorneys (the AAGs) to determine whether a Pre-Petition Custody Order is appropriate \u009a Convene a case staffing to determine plan of action \u009a Complete Pre-Petition Custody Order, if appropriate Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 50 CPS AND THE LAW Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 51INTRODUCTION The purpose of any state or local CPS administ ration is to protect children from being abused and neglected, as well as to help families access services to acquire the skills and knowledge to prevent further abuse and neglect. As a CPS investigative social worker, your intervention into the lives of families being served by CFSA is guided by federal legislation, in addition to the District of Columbia's Code an d its Municipal Regulations (DCMR). In particular, federal legislation sets all national CPS practice standards by definin g uniform goals for CPS cases across the country. CFSA's practice standards, in addition to its policies and procedures, are in full compliance with both federal and District rule s and regulations. As a CPS social worker, it is important that you understand the current laws pertaining to child abus e and neglect in the District. The Code and DCMR are internet-accessible at http://government.westlaw.com/li nkedslice/default.asp?SP=DCC-1000 and atwww.dcregs.dc.gov respectively. Finally, you are obliged to have a working knowledge of the District's Family Court system, and of course, CFSA's Policy Manual which is accessible on the Agency's website under \"Information\" on the main page atwww.cfsa.dc.gov . THE ESTABLISHMENT ACT The Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) Establishment Act of April 2001 (DC Code \u00a7 4-1303.01a) confirms CFSA's authority as a separate cabinet-level agency responsible for the care of child welfare services in the District. As a result, the Agency through its director reports directly to the Mayor. The Establishment Act specifically gives legal authority for CFSA to do what appropriately needs to be done in order to protect children's well-being and to keep them safe either in or out of their homes. This authority is granted through the following sections of the DC Code: 1. \u00a74-1303.01a (b)(3) - CFSA has the responsibility to receive and to respond to reports of child abuse and neglect. 2. \u00a74-1303.01a (b)(3A) - in response to reports of abuse and neglect, CFSA shall assess the strengths and needs of those children and families involved with the reported allegations. 3. \u00a74-1303.01a (b)(6) - the Agency is responsible for safeguarding the rights and protecting the welfare of children when their parents, guardians, and/or custodians are unable to do so. 4. \u00a74-1303.01a (b)(4) - when necessary for their safety and well-being, CFSA may remove children from their homes or other places. In addition to the above authorities, \u00a7 4-1301.06 entrusts CFSA with certain obligations regarding the investigation of child abuse and neglect reports. The Agency must complete all investigations within 30 days of the first notice, with an additional 5 days to complete a final report. Documentation of each investigation shall Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 52include at a minimum the following information: (1) The nature, extent, and cause of the abuse or neglect, if any; (2) If a mental injury is suspected, an assessment of the suspected mental injury by a physician, a psychologist, or a licensed clinical social worker; (3) If the suspected abuse or neglect is determined to be substantiated: (A) The identity of the person responsible for the abuse or neglect; (B) The name, age, sex, and condition of the abused or neglected child and all other children in the home; (C) The conditions in the home at the time of the alleged abuse or neglect; (D) Whether there is any child in the home whose health, safety, or welfare is at risk; and (E) Whether any child who is at risk should be removed from the home or can be protected by the provision of resources.... Special Note: CFSA policy requires more extensive information than is required by DC law to be included in your case documentation, as well as information entered into FACES.net. TEN TYPES OF NEGLECT: DC CODE \u00a7 16-2301(9)(A) ( i-x) The DC Code contains 10 legal definitions of a neglected child that are important for every CPS social worker to know and understand. It is important to understand that \"abuse\" is a subset of \"neglect\" as an abused child is the first of the ten definitions. Unfortunately, the DC Co de is not written as clear as it could be and a specific example of that is in the first definition of a neglected ch ild which includes both an \"abandoned or abuse\" child. In addition, parents, guardians or custodians are not \"cha rged with\" or \"responsible for\" neglect, but rather, the child is found to be a \"neglected child\". You should familiarize yourself with each of the follo wing legal definitions for the ten types of neglect. Be mindful of these legal definitions at the beginning, middle, and end of each of your investigations . The beginning because every investigation must begin with an in vestigation to determine if a child meets at least one of the definitions of neglect; the middle because during th e investigation, all ten definitions must be considered, and the end because your finding(s) as to whether the child is a neglected child must be directly linked to one or more of the ten DC Code Citations. REMEMBER: these cases are about the status of the child and not about Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 53placing blame on a parent, guardian or custodian. If there are questions that arise during an investigation as to whether the circumstances, as you see them, rise to the level of neglect, please consult your management team. Should you need legal advice, please consult the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) for non-court involved cases and the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) for court involved cases. ONE - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) i who has been abandoned or abused by his or her parent, guardian, or custodian, or whose parent, guardian, or custodian has failed to make reasonable efforts to prev ent the infliction of abuse upon the child. The term \"reasonable efforts\" includes filing a petition for civil protection from intrafamily violence. \"Abandoned \" is defined in DC Code \u00a716-2316(d) (1) in four parts: I. The child is a foundling (i.e., a child found alone or abandoned and whose parent can not be located) and whose parent has made no effort to maintain a parental relationship with the child and reasonable efforts have been made to identify the child and to locate the parents for a period of four (4) weeks since the child disappeared. II. The child's parent gave a false identity at the time of the child's birth, and has then made no effort to maintain a parental relationship for at least four (4) weeks. III. The child's parent, guardian or custodian is known but has abandoned the child by making no reasonable efforts to maintain a parental relationship with the child for at least four (4) months. IV. The child is a boarder baby (i.e., the child was abandoned at the hospital upon birth). \"Abuse \" is defined in DC Code \u00a716-2301(23)(A) in three parts: i. the infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child ii. sexual abuse or exploitation of a child iii. negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child \"Unexplained injury\" is defined in DC Code \u00a716-2316(c) and states \"where the petition alleges a neglected child by reason of abuse, evidence of illness or injury to a child who was in the custody of his or her parent, guardian, or custodian for which the parent, guardian or custodian can give no satisfactory explanation shall be sufficient to justify an inference of neglect.\" Therefore, if there is an unexplained injury the child may be found to be an abused child under DC Code \u00a71602301(9)(A)(i). Note: when determining whether a child is a neglected chil d due to abuse, the CPS worker must use their clinical judgment. If necessary, any concerns or questions can be discussed with your CPS management team or one of the OAG attorneys. Special Note : according to DC Code \u00a716-2301(23)(B), abuse does not include discipline administered to a child Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 54by a parent, guardian or custodian provided that the discipline is reasonable in manner and moderate in degree and otherwise does not constitute cruelty. When determining abuse based on a caregiver's claim that he or she was disciplining the child, clinical judgment must be carefully applied. In accordance with the above section, discipline does not include any of the following acts: (i) burning, biting, or cutting a child (ii) striking a child with a close fist (iii) inflicting injury to a child by shaking, kicking, or throwing the child (iv) non-accidental injury to a child under the age of 18 months (v) interfering with a child's breathing (vi) threatening a child with a dangerous weapon or using such a weapon on a child Finally, the Code notes that the above listing is only illu strative of unacceptable acts of discipline and is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive. In other words, clinical judgment shall be the determining factor when other types of acts are involved in the alleged discipline of a child. TWO - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) ii who is without proper parental care or control, subsiste nce, education as required by law, or other care or control necessary for his or her physical, mental, or emotional health, and the deprivation is not due to the lack of financial means of his or her parent, guardian, or custodian. This Code section encompasses many types of neglect. Some examples are a dirty ho use, educational neglect, improper supervision, unmet medical or mental health needs of a child, inappropriate living environment, and/or ongoing exposure to domestic violence. These ar e only a few examples of what falls under this section of the Code. Note that in order to demonstrate neglect based on this definition, the neglect must be unrelated to financial means. Sources of income and public benefits must be assessed. Usually, if the parent is receiving some form of public benefits or could be receiving some form of public benefits, this requirement is not an issue. Also, if the neglect is unrelated to finances, this is not an issue. If the sole reason for the neglect is lack of money, the child may not fit this definition. That does not mean that the neglect would not fall under some other provision of the Code. If you have concerns regarding this, consult your management team. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 55 THREE - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) iii whose parent, guardian, or custodian is unable to disc harge his or her responsibilities to and for the child because of incarceration, hospitalization, or other physical or mental incapacity. This Code section clearly demonstrates that child neglect is a \"no fault\" process in that it does not look to the parent, guardian or custodian to \"blame\" for their beha vior, but looks instead to the child - and how the child is affected. This section applies to a child when a parent, guardian or custodian is not able to care for the child due to being in jail, in the hospital or having a physical or mental incapacity. Substance abuse and mental health of a parent will fit this definition only when that problem impacts the care of the child. The fact that a parent abuses drugs or has a mental health issue does not alone eq ual neglect. Under this provision, it is essential to consider how the problem impacts the child, i.e. there is a nexus (a connection) between the parent, guardian or custodian's substance abuse and/or mental health and the child. It is also important to consider whether the parent with the problem made a plan for the care of the ch ild. For example, if a parent is incarcerated or goes into drug treatment and plans for another parent, grandparent or friend to care for the child, then there is likely no neglect. These situations must be considered on a ca se-by-case basis in conjunction with your supervisor. You should also consider the section of this guide that discusses Safety Planning. FOUR - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) iv whose parent, guardian, or custodian refuses or is unab le to assume the responsibility for the child's care, control, or subsistence and the person or institution wh ich is providing for the child states an intention to discontinue such care. This Code section is a two-prong test. The first part requires a parent, guardian, or custodian to refuse or be unable to assume care for the child. The second part is that the person or institution who is caring for the child states that they (the person or instit ution) will no longer care for the child. This situation often arises when a parent leaves a child with someone else, does not return for some period of time, and the caretaker becomes unwilling to continue to care for the child. In some ca ses, the unwilling caretaker might be a hospital who has a child ready for discharge and no parent is available to take the child home. FIVE - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) v who is in imminent danger of being abused and another child living in the same household or under the care of the same parent, guardian, or custodian has been abused. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 56 This Code section applies when one child in a home has been abused and there are other children in the home determined by the social worker to be at serious risk. You must have one child who has been abused for this Code section to apply. You must also keep in mind that just because one child was abused does NOT automatically mean that the other children in the home are in imminent danger. You must make an independent clinical assessment of every other child to determine risk. You should look at factors such as, age of the child, history of the family, severity of the abuse, special needs of the child, and whether the other children are similarly situated to the abused child. Reminder: if you have any questions, you may always seek legal advice from the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) and/or the Office of the Attorney General (OAG-CPS). SIX - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) vi who has received negligent treatment or maltreatment from his or her parent, guardian, or custodian. This section generally applies when a child has not received doctor -recommended medical treatment. SEVEN - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) vii who has resided in a hospital located in the District of Columbia for at least 10 calendar days after being born, despite a medical determination that the child is ready fo r discharge from the hospital, and the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child has not taken any action or ma de any effort to maintain a parental, guardianship, or custodial relationship or contact with the child. This applies to \"boarder baby\" cases. Current case law permits the newborn to not necessarily be ready for discharge for ten (10) days, but 10 days must have passed since the child's birth. Reminder: if necessary, seek legal advice from the OGC and/or the OAG when encountering this scenario. EIGHT - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) viii Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 57who is born addicted or dependent on a controlled substance or has a significant presence of a controlled substance in his or her system at birth. This section is used when a medical professional has determined that the child is born addicted or dependent on a controlled substance or has a significant presence of a controlled substance in his or her system at birth. Hospitals are required by law to call the Hotline when a child's system reveals the presence of a controlled substance. Seek legal guidance when necessary. Special Note: DC Code limits the judge (but not necessarily CFSA) from making a finding of neglect if the finding is \"based solely on a finding of the drugs in the child's system\". In order to do so, the judge must find that the child has been negatively affected because of the drugs ( see DC Code \u00a716-2317b ) or find that the child is a neglected child based on another DC Code section. NINE - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) ix in whose body there is a controlled substance as a direct and foreseeable consequence of the acts or omissions of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian. This section is used when a child has a drug in her system that was not prescribed to the child, and their parent, guardian or custodian could or should have prevented the child from ingesting the drug. TEN - The term \"neglected child\" means a child: DC Code \u00a716-2301(9)(A) x who is regularly exposed to illegal drug-related activity in the home. This Code section is used when a child is living in a ho me where illegal drug-related activity takes place (e.g., selling, purchasing, using, manufacturing, etc.) and the chil d is a witness to the activity or is otherwise exposed to the activity. PAPERING A CASE If you have made a clinical determination that a child's sa fety is at risk and removal from the home is required, or if you are seeking the Court's intervention (and power) to assist the Agency in alleviating an allegation of neglect without necessarily removing a child, there are se veral mandatory steps that you must take in order for the OAG to bring a case to the Court. These steps will lead to the start of a Family Matter - Neglect - Court Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 58Case. This \"papering\" process, in effect, petitions the Co urt to enforce the legal rights of the Agency to protect a child in its care. You must inform the OAG of the specific facts to support an allegation of neglect (i.e., one or more of the ten Code sections listed above) before the OAG can file it with the Court. You must also state the general reason(s) CFSA believes the child is a neglecte d child. The OAG will determine which of the Code sections is applicable to the clinical and factual reasons you give that the child is a neglected child. As the CPS investigative social worker, it is your responsibility to meet with the AAG to discuss, review and sign the neglect petition. Please note that additional procedures regarding manage ment of removals are addressed in chapter 10 of this guide. Please refer to this section for additional aspects of removal. Procedures If you and your supervisor, in conjunction with one of the CPS program managers or program administrator, have concluded that a child must be removed for his or her safety, you must realize that the AAG has to be able to prove to the judge that there is probable cause* that the allegations in the petition are true. Without such a determination, the child (if removed) will have to be re turned. (The case will still proceed in Court - but the child may remain in the home.) *For purposes of this practice guide, probable cause is a legal term meaning that there are sufficient facts for the Court to conclude that the allegations in the petition are true. If the Agency is unable to prove probable cause during the hearing, the child will not be able to be, or remain, removed. The child will have to be returned home immediately. S/he cannot remain out of the caregiver's custody. Under certain circumstances, you may not be clear as to whether to remove the child or not and in those circumstances should consult your supervisory chain. In non-removal cases, you should feel free to contact any assistant attorney general (AAG) to make an appointment, or even just to \"walk in\" to discuss whether there is sufficient information to petition a case in court. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 59However, if you are on scene where a child may be in immediate danger, you should first consult your supervisor or management team prior to leaving the child(ren) in a potentially dangerous situation. This is critical because by leaving the child you may be inadvert ently expressing that the child is safe; making a future removal more complicated to pursue in court. If a child is removed, you must immediately generate a co mplaint form as a first step in the process of protecting the child's safety and well-being. Complaint forms are accessible through the FACES re ferral screen using the \"Court\" drop down box. Note: in the event that an on-going social worker initiates a complaint from an existing case, the complaint forms are also accessible through the FACES case screen. Please see the Complaint data flow chart in the appendix. In addition to all demographics, the completed compla int form shall justify the removal and include (at a minimum) the following information: Hotline report (excluding any identifying information on the reporter) FACES search Contact with the reporter (but not identified as the reporter) Contact with parents, caregivers, alleged perpetrators Contact with all children and/or siblings Description of injuries, if applicable Contact with all collaterals, if applicable Results of medical testing, if applicable and available Detective's information, if applicable Criminal history, if applicable Concluding paragraph summarizing the specific reasons for removal and any other information relevant to the child's safety and well-being Once the form is completed, you should submit it via FACES to your management team for approval. Note: prior to your management team's approval, the form will carry a \"DRAFT\" watermark. Only after your management team has approved the fo rm in FACES will the watermark disappear . Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 60Your management team will review the form, confirm that the date and time of removal is accurate, and check that the geographic location, i.e., the Distri ct Ward where the allegation is supposed to have occurred, is accurately identified as Ward 4, or Ward 5, etc. Effective July 19, 2010, complaints will be submitted el ectronically to the Court and you will only need to print a copy for the hard file for the family. Complaint forms received by the OAG are distributed to the AAG scheduled to paper cases for that week. o You should contact the papering AAG on the day the complaint form is delivered to court and request a scheduled interview. o Once the interview is scheduled, you must ensure your availability for the appointed time. If that does not happen, you should appear at the AAG's office at 8am the day of the initial hearing. o During the papering interview, you might feel as if th e AAG is questioning your clinical decisions. To the contrary, your clear and concise answers to their questions will help them present accurate information before the Court. It is the AAG's responsibility to turn your clinical decisions into legal decisions . o If the papering AAG notifies you of an intention no t to paper the case, you must immediately notify your management team of the decision. If you have concerns about that decision you should immediately bring your supervisor into the discussion. What Legally Occurs after CFSA Takes Custody of a Child? (A) A guardian ad litem (GAL) shall be appointed within 24 hours (excluding Sundays) of the child having been taken into custody. The GAL is an attorney who represents the best interests of the child , not just the child's wishes in general. For example, if the child wants to go home, the GAL must believe that this natural desire to return home is also in the best interest of the child's safety and well-being. Th e GAL will not necessarily advocate for the child's return merely based on the child's natural desire. (B) An initial hearing will take place within 72 hours (e xcluding Sundays) of the child being taken into custody. An initial hearing is a court proceeding where the judge is asked to order the child into foster care. If the court disagrees, the child must be returned home, even though both the court case and the case with CFSA remain open. (C) A petition must be filed by the AAG on behalf of CFSA (see \"Papering a Case\" above) at or prior to the shelter care hearing. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 61 During the 72-hour period before appearing in court, CFSA may convene a family team meeting (FTM) to develop a safety plan approved by the Agency with th e input of family members, relatives, and/or others concerned with the welfare of the child. At a minimum, the FTM participants should include the birth parents, relatives, caregivers, community representatives, servic e providers, and the guardian ad litem appointed to represent the child's best interest. Special Note: you are responsible for all court-related activities prior to the transfer of the case to ongoing services as well as two specific matters that typically o ccur after case transfer. These include but are not limited to the following activities: o participation in initial and further initial court proceedings o participation in mediation o participation in trial o completion of complaint and mediation report o completion of interim and disposition reports if they are required during your case responsibility, but typically these are the responsibility of ongoing REMINDER : All documentation must be entered into FACES and hard copies submitted prior to the initial court hearing which is mandated to occur within 72 hours of removal. Special Note : neither hearings nor complaint filings occur on Sundays. Removals that take place on a Thursday or a Saturday will have their respective scheduled hearing or complaint filing on the following Monday. Please see the court schedule in the appendix because this depends on the time of the removal on a Thursday or Saturday. Community Papering When CFSA has been working with a family through an in-home case, there may come a time where the social worker thinks court intervention is needed to ensure that the family complies with the recommendations of the agency. These cases are no longer in CPS and the family is receiving services from an \"in home\" social worker. \"Community papering\" is the process that must be followed. Community papering is appropriate when CFSA (or one of the contract agencies) has an open case with the family and there has not yet been a removal. If ther e has already been a removal, community papering is not appropriate and the process for removal papering (72 hour papering) should be followed. Community papering occurs every Friday (except holi days) on the 5th floor at CFSA with the OAG/CPS attorneys. There is a clipboard at the OAG/CPS receptioni st's desk detailing the availability for appointments. Social workers seeking to community paper a case should sign up for an appointment by either coming to the Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 625th floor or by contacting the OAG/CPS receptionist at 727-3839. When meeting with an AAG, bring a complaint form as well as any supporting documentation (i.e. school, medical or mental health records) that show that the family has not been complying with the law or professional recommendations to show that this la ck of compliance rises to the level of neglect. Social workers should complete a complaint form and bring it with them to his/her appointment. The complaint form should not be filed with the court in advance of the appointment. Once an AAG indicates a decision to petition the case has been made, the social worker can then complete the complaint process. The complaint form should detail the reason(s) for agency in volvement, the efforts made by the agency to address the neglect, and the reasons why those efforts have not su cceeded in ameliorating the neglect. In short, why is the social worker recommending court involvement at this time? During the social worker's appointment, the AAG will re ad the complaint and then will proceed to conduct a papering interview with the social worker. The purpose of the papering interview is to ascertain more information so as to determine whether or not a legal basis exists to paper the case. Additionally, the AAG may inquire, if it appears that there is a safety or risk issue, why a removal has not occurred. Removal decisions, however, are clinical decisions and the social worker shou ld have already discussed that with his/her supervisor and/or program manager in advance of meeting with the AAG. If the AAG determines that a legal basis exists, the AA G will prepare the petition and then request an initial hearing with the court. Initial hearings are to occur wi thin 5 days of the filing of the petition, so the social worker and AAG should discuss availability of both the social worker and the parent(s). Once the AAG is notified of a date and time for the initial hearing, the AAG will notify the social worker who will then notify the parent(s). If the AAG determines that a legal basis to paper the case does not exist, the AAG will complete the community papering no paper form, obtain his or her section chief's signature, and then provide the form to the social worker. If the AAG determines that a legal basis exists , but supporting documentation is needed prior to going forward, the AAG will delineate the type of informatio n needed. The social worker should gather that information no longer than 5 days from the meeting and return to the same AAG. If longer time is needed, the social worker should sign-up again when the information is obtained. Pre-Petition Custody Order In the event that you are unable to locate a child who is involved in your investigation, and you've determined that the child is, or may be, in immediate danger from his or her surroundings, or you have established reasonable grounds to believe that the child is suffering from an illness or injury or is otherwise endangered such that removal from the child's surroundings is necessary, then you must complete both an affidavit and a request Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 63for a pre-petition custody order . The affidavit and request for custody order forms are templates that you can request from your management team. Contact an OAG section chief for review and to determine whether the custody order can be filed. The section chief can also provide advice regarding completion of forms, if necessary. The following information shall be included in the completed affidavit and request for custody order: \u009a respondent's (i.e., the respondent's address \u009a respondent's description (gender, race, height, weight, scars or distinguishing marks, youth division number, child's case number, poli ce department identification number) \u009a nature of the complaint, i.e., description of allegations and detailed grounds for removal \u009a your name and title \u009a your signature (in the presence of the AAG who will swear you to the information) If the AAG determines that all facts meet the legal st andard for obtaining a custody order, he or she will sign off on the custody order and direct you to take the documents to the Central Intake Center in Room JM-520 at 500 Indiana Avenue, NW. You should wait for the custody order to be issued there. Once you receive the official custody order, please make sure you document the information in FACES as well as file the hard copy in the record. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 64INITIAL HEARING If a child has been removed from the home, or CFSA is requesting that a child be removed from the home, the parent has the right to a probable cause hearing . Be prepared! You will testify at this hearing. Do not be nervous; simply answer the questions that are asked of you truthfully. You are allowed to testify what you have learned through \"hearsay\" , i.e., what another person has told you. For example, if you receive information from a doctor, you may simply state what the doctor said to you. This is different than at the trial phase where the doctor would have to give direct testimony. A probable cause hearing is held to determine whether there is credible reason to believe that the allegations in the petition are true. This is separate and apart from a shelter care hearing which is held to determine whether the child or children should remain in shelter care (i.e. CFSA custody). These two hearings are generally combined for expedience. The AAG will prepare you for this hearing during the \"papering\" meeting and again before the hearing itself. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge shall make one of two decisions: (A) Order shelter care, setting forth in writing his or he r reasons for why the child's shelter care is required. (B) Order the child to be released if shelter care is not required under such criteria. If a child is ordered released, the judge may impose one or more of the following conditions: (A) Placement of the child in the custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian, or under supervision of a person or organization agreeing to supervise the child or youth. (B) Placement of restrictions on the child's travel, acti vities, or place of abode during the period of release. You should be prepared to suggest services for the child an d for the family to reduce the risk of further abuse or neglect. You should also prepare a proposed visitati on schedule (with conditions, if necessary) before the hearing. It is important to include sibling visitation and how it will occur. If the child is to remain at home, be prepared to suggest conditions for the Court to order th e parent, guardian or custodian to follow in order to ensure child safety. You should work expeditiously to get emergency licensing information to interested relatives. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 65When removal is necessary, the Agency will always require that a child is placed with a licensed foster parent. This includes placement with a relative. Consult your management team and CFSA Policy on how to request emergency licensing information but remember: the gove rnment will always object to a placement if the emergency license has not yet been granted. Also, keep in mind that CFSA depends upon Title IV-E funding (a percentage of the money CFSA spends may be reimbursed by the Federal government if proper documentation is maintained) for the life a case. This funding is contingent to the court's findings. Your testimony to the court must support either one of the following two findings in order for Title IVE funding to be approved: (1) Reasonable efforts were made by the Agency to prevent removal of the child. (2) The risk of harm to the child was so serious that the failure of the Agency to make reasonable efforts was a proper choice under the circumstances. Initial Hearings - Schedule For initial hearings scheduled Monday through Friday, court begins at 11am. To ensure timely attendance, CFSA notifies parents to appear at 10am . This allows sufficient opportunity for parents to go to the Center for Child Abuse and Neglect (CCAN), to participate in an eligibil ity interview, and to meet with their attorneys. There are two magistrate judges assigned to hear initia l hearings each week. In this manner, both CFSA's AAG divisions can be accommodated. The papering AAG will ha ve the information for the appropriate division and can provide it to you when you meet to paper the case. You must notify the parent of date and time of hearing at the time of the child's removal. For Saturday and holidays , there is only one AAG papering for both divisions. Court is held at 10am in JM-15 . A schedule for these times is kept on the desk of the OAG receptionist with the name of the AAG papering for each division and for Saturdays. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 66CFSA CUSTODY OF THE CHILD CFSA has the legal authority to place a child in any on e of the following appropriate foster care options (DC Code \u00a716-2313): (1) a family-based or therapeutic foster home (2) a group home, youth shelter, or other appropriate facility for non-delinquent children (3) a facility for specialized shelter care designated by the Placement Services Administration, including an appropriate facility operated by the District of Columbia Special Considerations Visitation DC Code \u00a716-2310(d) requires weekly (at a minimum) visi tation by a child's parent, guardian or custodian when the child has been placed in shelter care, unless it appears to the judge that such visitation rights would create an imminent danger to or be detrimental to the well-being of the child. In which case, the judge shall either establish special conditions for visitation or order that visitation rights not be allowed. Orders for Physical and/or Mental Examinations Once the AAG has filed the neglect petition, a Court Order may require a child to be examined to aid in determining his or her physical or mental condition. DC Code \u00a716-2315 permits physical and mental examinations of a child. Orders might also be given fo r mental health examinations of a parent, guardian or custodian. You should discuss the need for such examinations with your management team as well as the AAG, either before, during, or shortly after the papering session. General Legal Considerations As is the case with each procedural step involving a ch ild's entry into care, all relevant facts and information must be entered accurately into FACES. The importance of accurate documentation in FACES cannot be underestimated! Not only does it protect the rights of the child, accurate documentation protects the integrity of data that the Agency must maintain in the event of local and/or federal reviews and audits. All documentation must be entered into FACES and hard copies submitted prior to the initial court hearing which is mandated to occur within 72 hours of removal . Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 67HOLDS Hospital Hold -This term is only used internally by CFSA when a child is currently hospitalized and you have reason to believe it is not in the child's best interest to be released to the child's parent (or guardian or custodian). You may then request that the hospital \"hold\" the child until a court order grants custody to CFSA. You still need to file a complaint and you should advise the hospital that the process to file a complaint has begun or will soon begin accordingly . Under these circumstances, the hospital may agree to \"hold\" the child but this agreement between the hospital and CFSA has no real legal effect. Please see appendix ... for an example of such paperwork. It should be noted that the police are able to complete holds as well that do not require a complaint to be filed. At times this strategy may be beneficial in ensuring the safety of a child during a joint investigation without having to immediately bring a case into court. You must remain in close communication with the detective; however, as you need to be aware when the hold is lifted so that you can take any needed safety measures on behalf of the child; potentially including removal. Administrative Hold - Although not a legal term, it is sometimes used interchangeably with \"hospital hold\". In your FACES documentation, a child who is removed is under and \"administrative hold\" until the matter is taken into court and the child is either returned to the caregiver or a shelter care order is instituted. 72-hour hold - This term is used to describe the legal time period within which CFSA may remove a child from the parent, guardian or caretaker before being entitled to a court hearing and filing a petition alleging neglect. 5-day hold - When a complaint has been filed after the removal of a child, OAG may request that the court permit up to 5 additional days for CFSA to continue th e investigation before returning to court for the initial hearing, at which time a petition must be filed, or the child can no longer remain in care. If the Court finds that there is \"good cause\", OAG will be granted the \"5-day hold\" but again, by the end of those 5 days OAG must file a petition for neglect or return the child. The pare nt or legal caregiver still has a right to request a shelter care hearing to determine whether the child should remain in CFSA custody during this time. 90-day hold - This term is actually out of date. It was formerly used to describe the 90-day period of time that CFSA permitted parents, guardians or custodians to volunt arily place their child into CFSA care. CFSA no longer utilizes this process. Unaccompanied Refugee Minors This is a legal term used to describe children who have been brought to the United States from another county and who come into the care of CFSA based on federal law. In general, CFSA is not involved and such cases do Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 68not start with an allegation or a report to the 24-ho ur Hotline system. The term is used when the US Department of State identifies refugee children overseas who are eligible for resettlement in the U.S. but do not have a parent or a relative available, and the US is committed to providing for their long term care. Upon arrival in the US, these refugee children are placed into the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program to receive refugee foster care services and benefits. The URM Program helps these children and/or youth develop appropriate skills to enter adulthood and to achieve social self-sufficiency. Procedures \u009a Lutheran Social Services (LSS) will usually bring these ca ses to CFSA's attention based on LSS' ongoing contract with the District for this purpose. \u009a The LSS social worker prepares a complaint form an d signs up for community papering. Remember that community papering requires only a conversation with the attorney to determine if a neglect petition is appropriate. In order to proceed to papering on this ty pe of case, the child has to be classified as a URM by the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The LSS social worker should have this documentation. On occasion, a child might be an asylee who was reclassified as URM by HHS. \u009a Once the child is brought to CFSA's attention, the AAG prepares a petition alleging a Subsection IV allegation for an unwilling caretaker ( see attached petition example ). \u009a The petition with an attached complaint is filed in the DC Superior Clerk's office (as in a community case) and a date is subsequently set for an initial hearing; the Clerk's office should be notified that the case is an unaccompanied refugee minor case. \u009a The AAG prepares findings of fact and conclusions of law. \u009a The AAG also prepares a disposition order (instead of an initial hearing order). If you have a case involving a minor alleged to be an \"unaccompanied minor\", contact your program administrator and the OGC. DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY The District of Columbia is uniquely situated as both a residential area and the nation's capital city where foreign dignitaries hold resident in the embassy or consulate repr esenting their native countries. As a result, there may be times when a Hotline report involves someone (the parent, guardian or custodian or often the child) who has diplomatic immunity. Children who have diplomatic immunity or children of parents, guardians or custodians who have diplomatic immunity are not su bject to United States or local laws . The moment you have reason to suspect that the parent, guardian or custodian is a diplomat, or that the child has diplomatic immunity , your investigation must cease until further instructions are given by the OGC. In collaboration with the US Department of State, the OGC will determine whether in fact a diplomat is the subject of a neglect investigation. Special Note: not all non-citizens claiming to have diplomatic immunity do in fact have diplomatic immunity. Further, if it comes to your attention that the life of a child is at risk, you are Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 69obligated to act appropriately to imme diately protect the child. Contact your management team as soon as possible, and/or contact the OGC for further instructions. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 70 THE CPS INVESTIGATION Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 71THE CPS INVESTIGATION All CPS reports are first screened by Hotline workers who utilize clinical judgment and a standardized \"decision tree\" in FACES to determine whether or not an investigation is warranted. Based on this determination, the Hotline worker will assign a response time that tells the CPS investigative worker whether to make an initial face-to-face contact with the child victim within 2 hours (\"immediate response time \") or within 24 hours (\"regular response time\") . The Hotline worker will then submit the referral to the assigned Hotline supervisor for approval. If approved, the Hotline supervisor will forward the referral to the CPS supervisor who shall ultimately assign the referral to an investigative social worker. INITIAL FAMILY BACKGROUND RESEARCH Even when an immediate response time is assigned, the investigative social worker and/or the management team must still follow certain pre-investigation steps when ever possible prior to initial contact, or as soon as possible after the initial contact with the child victim. This includes a review of all available information or records on the child and/or family to help you identify if any of the following situations may need to be addressed: \u009a Possible safety threats \u009a History of, or a pattern of, abuse or neglect \u009a Child and family support syst ems and protective capacity \u009a Specialized needs of the children or caregivers \u009a Any possible worker safety issues \u009a Additional demographic information on a family There are a number of things you will want to look for and think about the minute you receive a new referral. You must first thoroughly review the referra l snapshot, recognizing that it is not typically or necessarily reflective of all family members or prio r involvement with the Agency. Due to this reason, you will want always to conduct thorough searches for each referral that you receive. Several resources are available. \u00be FACES.Net Search \u00be The Automated Client Eligibilit y (ACEDS) \u00be The Student Transmittal and Atte ndance Record System (STARS) Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 72FACES Search for Prior CFSA History Thorough review of prior referrals and case history can be very useful in assessing chronic problems as well as strengths within the family. It can also reveal risk elem ents and prepare you for the home visit, in addition to assisting you with assessing child safety. You should consider the family's prior involvement with CFSA throughout your assessment of the family. The IMPORTANCE of Reviewing PRIOR HISTORY Why know history? o It is critical to assess the new alle gations in the context of all previous reports/allegations. o Families may not openly reveal critical elements of their situation that would be helpful in your assessments, in cluding the followi ng information: (a) Other children in the home or other children who may reside outside of the home (b) Persons who are not allowed contact with the family through a protection order or visitation order Knowledge of prior history ca n reveal important facts: o Whether the current alleged child vict im is the same as in prior reports o The number of prior substantiated, inconclusive or unfounded reports o Severity and type of current allegations compared to those in prior reports o Results of previous safety interventions and services o Written and verbal findings of staff wh o previously worked with the family o Possible locations or living situations for families Consider the following: o Child's present condition, family fu nctioning and household conditions as compared to prior reports. o What does the pattern, and/or frequency of past reports tell us? o The source of prior reports, i.e. Are there multiple reports with similar allegations called in by the sa me or different reporters? Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 73ACEDS - Automated Client Eligib ility Determinat ion System Many families who come to the attention of the District's child welfare system are recipi ents of public assistance from the District's Income Maintenance Administration (IMA). Such assistance may come in the form of food stamps, medical assistance benefits, and/or Temporary A ssistance for Needy Families (TANF). Information on all recipients is entered into the ACEDS database and accessi ble to CPS investigative social workers for background information and family history. Please see your CPS management team for additional information on reading an ACEDS report. o At the very beginning of your investigation activities, it is especially useful to search ACEDS for information regarding additional siblings and/or other household members. o Keep in mind that the ACEDS database is shut down by 8pm on weekdays and has sporadic accessibility during the weekend. o The ACEDS system is searched by NAME ONLY, not by address. If you have only an address and not a family name, ACEDS will not prov ide information on the family. o NOTE: families receiving assistance from IMA often fail to update their demographic information in a timely fashion with the IMA worker. As a result, such information in the ACEDS system may not always be current. STARS - Student Transmittal an d Attendance Record System The STARS database tracks attendance records for students currently enrolled in DC Public Schools. At times, the database will also include some hist orical attendance records. Transcri pts and class schedules are typically available for high school students. For grades K-8, howeve r, progress reports must be obtained directly from the school of attendance. Unlike ACEDS, the STARS database does have the capability for \"reverse searches\", i.e., the CPS investigative social worker can search for a family or child using only an address. As a result, STARS is a useful and complementary tool for locating and/or identifying a family when no other demographic information is available. o The STARS database is generally accessible 24-hours a day. o STARS information separates partial absences (e.g., from class) versus full absences (i.e., an entire day or more) for both middle and high school student attendance reports. Please note that absences recorded in the database do not necessarily reflect whether the absence was excused or not. o Keep in mind that attendance information may not always be accurate. When utilizing this information to substantiate a neglect allegation, you should definitely have a conversation with the school official for confirmation. Be sure to carefully document this information in your investigation notes. o Pulling the student information card may also have helpful information, such as the listed address for the family, caregivers' names, and emergency contacts. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 74PRE-INVESTIGATION CONSULTATIONS Contacting the Reporting Source You are required to contact the source of the report immediately to obtain further clarification and information about the allegations. This is one of the core contacts. This initial contact may also lead to other persons who can provide information as to whether safety factors ar e present that may place the child in immediate danger or impending danger of harm. If the source is not immediate available, continue to contact the source until you are able to make contact. Be prepared to explain to all reporting sources th at the investigation is confidential and that you cannot share information without the proper releases . This can be difficult for individuals who are genuinely concerned about children so acknowledge this when you speak with the reporting source. Remember that individuals who report may not have the first hand information about which they are reporting. You must then also reach out the original reporting source to clarify the allegations and any other investigation concerns. For example, a report ing source may share information that they have received second hand from another family memb er, professional, or concerned citizen. Without revealing the reporting source, you should make efforts to confer with the person(s) who have direct information about the allegations. Contacting the On-going Social Worker When an investigation is received on an open case, the Hotline worker will notify both the on-going social worker and the management team. With this in mind, you should communicate with the on-going social worker prior to initiating the investigation. He or she will be able to provide you with key information about a family's functioning that will support your investigation and asse ssment activities. Whenever possible, you should jointly assess the allegations with the on-going social worker, ev en though you will still be taking the lead due to the specialty of your investigation skill set. If you are not able to quickly make contact with the ongoing team, this must not delay the initiation of your investigation. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 75Contacting the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) (if applicable) All reports involving allegations of child physical ab use and sexual abuse are forwarded to the MPD Youth Investigations Division (YID). From that point onwa rd, an assessment is made by the MPD and the United States Attorneys Office as to whether the report meets the criteria for a criminal investigation. If your investigation requires an immediate response, or what MPD might classify as a \"hot case\" (serious physical or sexual abuse), contact must be made with YID which will determine whether the investigation should be assigned immediately to them. Contact should be made at the main number (202/576-6768) with the detective or sergeant on duty who is assigning cases that day. If your investigation is not assigned immediately at YID, but is determined to warrant a criminal investigation, it will be assigned according to a timeframe determined at YID. When assignments are made, YID notifies the CPS Special Abuse Supervisor; generally a few times a week. The supervisor in turn distributes this information via e- mail to the assigned investigator and supervisor. If a report does not meet the criteria for a criminal investigation it will be turned over to (TOT) CFSA. Information regarding TOT investigations is sent to th e CPS Special Abuse Supervisor, generally on a weekly basis. Again, the supervisor distributes this informatio n via e-mail to the assigned investigator and supervisor. Note : the acronym TOT is frequently used by MPD to identi fy the investigations that are turned over to CFSA. We include it here so you will recognize it in the future. It is pronounced \"tee oh tee\" and the past tense, TOT'd is pronounced \"tee oh teed\". If you have not received communication from MP D regarding your investigation within 7 business days, please consult with your supervisor prior to contacting YID directly (via telephone or e-mail) to request information on the assigned detective or to determine whether the referral has been TOT'd to CFSA. It should be noted that reports involving physical abuse or sexual abuse that resulted in an arrest being made by a District officer (as opposed to an investigator or dete ctive from YID) are not assigned at YID, as the matter is considered to be closed with the arrest. In the event that you are involved in a child fatality in vestigation you will still likely have contact with YID but the lead in these investigations is the MPD Special Victims Unit (SVU). Please refer to the child fatality section of this guide for additional detail. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 76CPS INTERVIEWS General Guidelines Under the \"Establishment Act\" of 2005, the Agency is mandated to conduct a thorough investigation into reports of suspected abuse or neglect to protect the health and safety of the children involved. The CPS interview is a fundamental component of this mandate. Id eally, the interviews with children will take place at a neutral setting, for example, the child's school. Interviews with caregivers are likely to occur at home but may occur in other environments (schools, hospitals, etc.). Either way, you must make a home visit. Remember also that the information you get from one interview will likely be used to gather information from the next. To maintain the integrity of all gathered information, each person should be interviewed separately, typically starting with the alleged victim and other childr en. At times you will want to gain information from collateral sources of information (emergency physicians, teachers who witnessed alleged abuse, etc.) that have direct information on the facts of the assessment that will be needed when conducting the family interviews. The following interviews will be discussed in this section: \u009a Alleged victim and other children \u009a Non-offending caregivers \u009a Alleged perpetrator \u009a Other household members \u009a Collaterals Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 77 GUIDELINES FOR INTERVIEWING CHILDREN According to DC Code \u00a74-1301.04(c)(3)(A), CFSA , in order to protect the health and safety of children is to interview children without the presence of their caregiver(s). Specifically, \"the initial phase of the investigation shall incl ude seeing a child and all other children in the household outside of the presence of the caregiver or caregivers.\" REMINDER: You are required to interview and assess ALL children in the home. Each child should be afforded the opportunity to share individual accounts and to gi ve individual explanations of the allegations on the referral. If a child is too young to be interviewed, he or she must be observed awake , and be assessed in reference to the caregiver or parent. ( See the Required Tasks for Interviewing Children below. ) You must ensure that all of the children involved with the family have b een accounted for, including children living outside of the home, in other residences, and/or states. You must note the time, date, and place of each interview, and you must enter this information in FACES . REQUIRED TASKS FOR INTERVIEWING CHILDREN Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Assess the physical appearance of the child. \u009a Observe the child. \u009a Take a photograph of the child (when applicable or appropriate). \u009a Determine if the child's clothing is appropriate for size and weather conditions. \u009a Determine if the child is appropriately groomed (cleanliness, hair, odor, and so forth). Assess whether the child has any physical injuries. \u009a Determine if the child needs immediate medical care. \u009a Determine if the child has physical injures. \u009a Photograph any injuries. \u009a Describe the size, shape, type and location of injury. \u009a Describe whether the injuries appear acute, healing, or healed. Note: for further details on injuries, see section below on Guidelines for Observing Child Injuries (Normally Clothed Areas) . Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 78 Assess the child's affect, body language, behavior, and special needs Describe the following affects: \u009a Child's mood during the interview; note whether the mood changes related to subject matter. \u009a Child's ability and/or desire to engage in conversation. \u009a Any obvious challenging behavioral issues. \u009a Any behavior or attitude that appears developmentally out of the norm. \u009a Any known or suspected special needs. Discuss the interview ground rules directly with the child The following information must be documented to attest to the child's legitimate participation in the interviewing process: \u009a Is the child aware of the difference between the truth and lying, and does the child agree to tell the truth? \u009a Can the child state when s/he does or does not understand a question, and does the child agree to ask questions when s/he does not understand? \u009a Does the child agree not to guess if they don't know an answer? \u009a Has the child agreed to correct you if you say things that are incorrect? Family and household composition \u009a Describe the members of the child's household and their relationship to the child. \u009a Note whether there is more than one household involved. \u009a Describe other significant persons in the child's life (extended family, godparents, other meaningful caregivers, etc.) \u009a Specifically discuss the child's biological parents and grandparents or other meaningful caregivers, even if they are currently absent from the child's life .

Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 81Special Guidelines for Observing Child Injuries (Normally Clothed Areas) When allegations include an injury (or injuries) on th ose parts of the body that are normally covered by clothing, you must consider how best to visually observe the injuries. Depending upon the allegations (or any additional information you've received during the course of your investigation), you may wish to consult with the CPS management team to determine what action is necessary for you to reach a conclusion regarding the child's immediate safety. When visual inspection is deemed appropriate, it is generally considered good practice to seek the parents' or caregivers' consent. You should use discretion, however, when deciding whether to examine the child in the presence of the caregiver. Under certain circumstances, it may not be in the child's best interest to request consent or to inspect a child in the caregiver's presence. The following examples are not exhaustive but, in general, these are situations where it is likely not appropriate to seek the caregiver's consent or to examine the child in the caregiver's presence: \u009a At the onset of a joint investigation with the MPD Youth Investigations Division (YID). \u009a When there are concerns that a caregiver may impact the outcome of the investigation by coaching other children or collaterals. \u009a When the child's safety is at risk, or other children's safety is at risk. \u009a When a caregiver is a possible flight risk. \u009a When the location of all children has not been ascertained. \u009a When the caregiver is a threat to the well-being of the social worker. The following examples are situations where it is likely to be appropriate to seek consent and to examine the child in the presence of the caregiver: \u009a To rule out physical abuse by documenting a lack of marks or injuries. \u009a When observing accidental injuries. \u009a If the caregiver present is the non-offending caregiver. \u009a Minor physical abuse. \u009a During a joint investigation in consultation with the YID detective. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 82Minimizing Impact on the Child During Visual Observations To minimize the potential for negative impact on the child, you should consider the following factors: \u009a Always conduct the visual observation in a place that supports the child's privacy and dignity . If possible, use a medical professional's office space, e.g., a school nurse's office. \u009a Always ensure that more than one person is present, preferably a caregiver and/or a professional other than yourself. \u009a If the child is age 4 or over, one of the persons present must be of the same gender. \u009a Carefully explain to the child, using simple language, exactly what is happening and why. \u009a Reinforce the nature of the inspection as being conducted for the child's safety. \u009a Clarify with the child his or her right to personal boundaries, if age appropriate. \u009a Whenever possible, present the child with an option fo r a professional (e.g., social worker, school nurse, or pediatrician) to perform the visual inspection. Be sure that the child expresses comfort with the decision. \u009a If the child is not comfortable with the procedure, be sure to make every effort to allay any fears. Do not force the inspection! \u009a If the caregiver is present, and the child is unable to undress him/herself, ask the caregiver to undress the child. \u009a If the caregiver is not present, someone familiar to the child should assist. You must photograph and document any observed injuries, including size, location on the body, shape and configuration. If the injuries are severe, or potentially serious, or if medical attention is needed, the child should be seen by a physician immediately. The results of the examination should be thoroughly documented. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 83GUIDELINES FOR INTERVIEWING NON-OFFENDING CAREGIVERS As with all interviews, you are responsible for conduc ting a comprehensive assessment of the immediate safety and risk of future harm for each child in the family, in cluding but not limited to the direct allegations in the Hotline report. Although this section specifies tasks for interviewing th e non-offending parents or caregivers residing in the home, the basic tasks are the same for interviewing the alleged maltreater. You should follow the required tasks for both parties, particularly as the maltreaters are freq uently the primary caregiver. If the maltreator is not a primary caregiver (such as an absent or infrequent pare nt), consideration may be given to what aspects of the caregiver interview are not applicable. REQUIRED TASKS FOR INTERVIEWING CAREGIVERS RESIDING IN THE HOME Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Face-to-face interview with parents and/or caregivers \u009a Gather basic demographic information for all parties. \u009a Obtain proper releases of information to be able to speak with collateral sources of information.

Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 86 THE HOME VISIT Even if you do not interview in the home, you must still make a home visit and conduct a thorough assessment of the immediate living environment. This assessment will help you to determine whether there are any unsafe conditions that place the child in immediate or imminent danger. ASSESSING THE HOME Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Visit and assess the home environment for the presence of safety factors. Document whether any of those factors pose immediate danger or imminent danger for the children. All family living areas must be examined. Living area means any area of a home or residence that is utilized by a family to include, basement, garage, attic, etc. Determine sleeping arrangements for all household members.

Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 88GUIDELINES FOR INTERVIEWING COLLATERAL CONTACTS Collateral contacts are sources of information that are knowl edgeable about the client's situation and serve to support or corroborate information. Collate ral contacts include mandated reporters such as teachers and medical personnel, as well as other pe ople in the community who may be relevant to the investigation. Remember to familiarize yourself with Ag ency standards on confidentiality when conducting collateral interviews. Collateral contacts often provide a good deal of information that is helpful in determining the disposition (see p. 143 for informati on on the disposition decision). These interviews help you obtain additional information about the children and fami ly that will help determine whether or not the children are in immediate danger or if there is risk for future abuse/maltreatment. Key information to gather from collateral contacts includes: \u009a How long each collateral has known the child and/or family \u009a Collateral's assessment of the child's condition \u009a Collateral's assessment of family functioning, in cluding their knowledge of any safety factors or risk elements that may be operating in the family \u009a Collateral's knowledge of the incident/allegations, and any other signs of abuse or maltreatment All interviews with collateral contacts must be documented . All CPS investigations require a minimum standard for obtaining information from collateral sources prior to the investigation's closure: \u009a You must make at least one attempt to obtain detailed information from medical providers, daycare providers, and educational providers. If this information is not pertinent to the disposition, the investigation may be closed without it after discussion with your management team . \u009a At a minimum, you must obtain the most recent available information on the child's immunizations and school attendance records if school age, both of which help to establish at least a minimal level of medical and educational care. \u009a You are required to attempt to obtain collateral information within one week of gaining knowledge of the identity of the collateral sources of information. You must not wait until the end of the investigation to request information from collateral sources. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 89REQUIRED TASKS FOR INTERVIEWING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Immunizations \u009a Request immunization records from a credible source (e.g., school records, medical provider, CFSA's Office of Clinical Practice, DC Department of Health, etc.). \u009a Review the immunization records to determine if the child is current, due, or overdue for immunizations. \u009a If the record indicates that the child is overdue for immunizations by one month or more, the worker should confirm any discrepancies with the medical provider and/or another credible source of information. Note: the Department of Health does not update the system on a monthly basis. \u009a If the caregiver has indicated that they have chosen to withhold immunizations, you should confirm that the appropriate paperwork has been submitted to the school, e.g., the caregiver has opted out for philosophical or religious reasons. Note: documentation of this sort must be annually updated. Special Note: it is not against the law to withhold immunizations from a child, nor is it automatically considered medical neglect.

Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 95 ALLEGATION-SPECIFIC INVESTIGATION STEPS Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 96 NEGLECT RELATED SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR DRUG ACTIVITY EXPOSURE TO ILLEGAL DRUG ACTIVITY General considerations Illegal \"drug-related activity\" includes use, sale, distribution or manufacturing of a drug or drug paraphernalia without a legally valid license or me dical prescription. Please familiarize yourself with Drugs and their Effects in section II of the appendix which discusses common aspects of drug manufacturing. You should also be aware that legal allegations regarding drug activity require \"regular\" exposure. This factor must be included in the assessment. Most of our investigations of illegal drug activity result from police drug raids on residences or other locations. You should approach these investigations with the kno wledge that there can be a complicated relationship between the CPS investigation and the ongoing MPD criminal case. At times MPD personnel may not want to give you full information for fear that it might be disclosed in the neglect case prior to MPD completing their own investigation. Because of this, two things are important: \u009a You need to be able to articulate specific need s for information pertaining to the CPS assessment; specifically information that substantiates the child is regularly being exposed to illegal drug activity. If you are not successful in your communication, contact may need to be made with the sergeant involved in the case or with your management team to determine next steps. \u009a At times, MPD personnel may be able to share info rmation \"off the record\" that will help inform the CPS investigation. When there are difficulties eliciting information from MPD, you should consider whether there is \"off the record\" information that can be shared. You can then determine if/when the information will be useful to the CPS investigation. \"Off the record\" information should not be documented in FACES but can be used toward an overall understanding of the family situation during the investigation . Assessment details The following checklist is useful for ensuring that appr opriate information is obtained during a drug raid investigation: \u009a How did the raid occur? (e.g., search warrant from undercover buy, search warrant from other information source, etc.) \u009a Who is the affiant or officer who signed off on the search warrant? \u009a What were the police specifically looking for? Who was the suspect? \u009a What, if any, drug(s) were found? Specify types, amounts, location. \u009a Could the children reasonably access the drugs? \u009a Photograph the drugs and/or locations where they were found. \u009a Was drug paraphernalia found? Specify types and location. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 97\u009a Was the paraphernalia a danger to the children (such as chemicals)? \u009a Were weapons/ammunition found? Specify types and location. \u009a If a gun was found, was it loaded? \u009a Were the weapons accessible by the children? \u009a Photograph the guns and/or locations they were found. \u009a Often a drug raid results in physical upheaval of the home - you should ask the officers what condition the home was in prior to the raid. This information may be of concern. \u009a If there is discrepancy about the living situation of the suspect(s), determine if there are indicators to suggest that the suspect lives in the home (e.g., mail with the suspect's name and the address of the home, clothing of the suspect in the home, etc.) \u009a Be sure that you obtain the names and DOBs of all arrestees/persons involved in the raid whether they are family members or not. This will ensure that these individuals do not impede the investigation. If they present themselves as resources for the care of the children, their involvement will be factored into this decision. Required tasks \u009a Drug testing for any child who was visiting or living in the raided environment. The child should have both urine and hair sample tests conducted. These te sts can be completed at Children's National Medical Center upon your request. \u009a Pull the complete criminal history on the individuals involved in the investigation to determine any prior involvement with illegal drug activity. \u009a Speak to the affiant or the sergeant on the scene to determine if there is a history of other children frequenting the location of the drug activity or if there were other children at the scene at the time of the raid. Obtain the demographic information for these children/caregivers and create companion investigations. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 98SUBSTANCE-EXPOSED NEWBORNS General considerations Babies who are born exposed to illegal or non-prescribed prescription medication are some of the most at-risk children who come into contact with the child welfare system. Nationwide there are a variety of responses to these situations, including automatic removal by some st ate agencies due to the baby's inherent vulnerability combined with the obvious impairments of the caregiver who is struggling with substance abuse. In the District, we do not hold a policy of immediate removal of these children or immediate open cases. In cases of newborn exposure to illegal drugs an allegation of substance abuse impacting parenting is entered at the CPS hotline. You, the CPS social worker, will conduct a thorough investigation and determine whether there is evidence that the substance use impacts the mother's parenting. In the event that you do not have sufficient evidence to suggest this you will still offer the family supportive services (see details below). At times, removal may also be warranted given the severity of the situat ion, which will be discussed in more detail below. Remember that your approach to the caregiver involved is critical in obtaining accurate information for the purpose of planning for the safety of the child and assi sting the caregiver. Remember, too, that despite the effects of, and behaviors related to, substance abuse, this habit or addiction often grows out of significant pain and trauma. Therefore, the engagement of the caregiver should not only involve acknowledgement of the facts but also the opportunities that the situation may present for positive change. Assessment details When completing an assessment regarding allegations of positive toxicology for newborns, one must consider several areas. The overall mosaic of the family should be considered, including the information below, to determine if it is reasonable to believe that the mother is and will be a sufficiently safe caregiver for a child. Removal should only be considered when a minimum basic level of care cannot be assured by the mother. You should make note of the following information: \u009a Type of drug used (please refer to the appendix Drugs and Their Effects for more detail) You must determine the possible side effects that the drug may have on the mother. Consider that some drugs can have longstanding effects on functioning (e .g., the negative side effects of \"flashbacks\" can impair decision-making). Based on the type of drug used, you should also weigh the possible dangers of a relapse for the caregiver and the newborn. \u009a Frequency of use Discuss with the mother the frequency and/or patterns of her drug use. Remember: whenever possible, statements made by caregivers need to be compared with other sources of information (CFSA/service Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 99provider history, drug testing records, accounts of family members, etc.). \u009a History of use Discuss also the mother's history of use and any periods of sobriety. Again, whenever possible, remember that statements made by caregivers need to be compared with other sources of information (CFSA/service provider history, drug testing re cords, accounts of family members, etc.). \u009a Caregiver behavior related to use You need to understand that substance abuse does not happen in a vacuum. You must assess where and when the behavior occurs, where any children may be when this happens, and what other activity may be involved (prostitution, drug trafficking, etc.). All of these factors must be included in the overall assessment of, and planning for, the safety of the child. \u009a Caregiver attitude toward use Begin to determine whether the caregiver acknowledges her use. This is often the first barrier to moving forward with an assessment. Given the positive toxicology screen this can be an easier discussion than in some other substance abuse investigations. Further, talk with the mother about her willingness to participate in a drug test and substance abuse assessment. These are significant indicators of the Agency's ability to work with a caregiver around the serious issue at hand. Determine whether the mother acknowledges that she has a problem. This, as the saying goes, is \"the first step\" to teaming with the mother to address the substance abuse issue. Some mothers may not be immediately ready to admit th eir use so you should be prepared to take time to explain the options that exist for her should she elect to seek treatment. When faced with a mother who does not acknowledge her substance use, explain the significance of this and the difficulty that you face in even considering her child safe to go home without an acknowledgment that the use is occurring. You should also explain to the mother the potential consequences of not cooperating with both the assessment and the drug testing. \u009a Caregiver preparation for, and attitude toward, having a baby Determine what planning and preparation the mother made for her child's birth. Some mothers may not have intended to keep the baby so conversation ma y need to be held about the mother's thoughts and feelings about the reality of the birth of the child. You also need to determine at what point the mother became aware of her pregnancy and compare this with the accounts and timeline of drug use. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 100 Talk with the mother about whether she had prenat al care and find out the specifics details (e.g., provider location, frequency of visits, etc.). This information should be confirmed with the provider. Determine what other preparations the mother may have made for the birth of the child (e.g., obtaining appropriate supplies like a crib, diapers, etc.) and scheduling for services such as medical insurance or the District's Special Supplemental Nu trition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). \u009a Support network Father Every child has a biological father and this should no t be overlooked in your assessment. Talk with the mother about the identity of the father. At times th e specific individual may not be known so as much paternal information should be gathered as possible, including any portion of a name or nickname, physical attributes, relatives of the father, last kno wn whereabouts, places of employment, history of military duty, history of incarceration, etc. Note : a father needs to be identified officially through a birth certificate, paternity testing, legal affidavit of paternity, or other method as noted in the General Considerations section of this guide. You should never allow a child to be released to a fath er without legal identification of the father . Once properly identified, a father may be a considered as a care giving option after a thorough assessment regarding his desire and ability to care for the child, his support network, and whether there is any concern regarding substance abuse. Extended family Extended family support can be a key component to the overall safety of a child who might remain in the care of a mother who engages in substance abuse. Talk with the mother about her support network and any resources to assist her should she relapse. Contact needs to be made directly with these individuals to assess their ability to act as a viable support to the mother. Required Tasks 1. Conversation with Hospital Staff and Review of Records The hospital staff often has valuable information abou t family history as well as the current progress of the mother and child. You should review the family record to obtain a copy of the toxicology reports and pull other demographic information that may be useful during the course of the investigation, such as the mother's reported address, father's name, an d so forth. Oftentimes mothers may have frequented the hospital during the pregnancy and there may be additional information regarding any substance Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 101abuse history, the mother's planning for the pregnanc y, or other helpful information. Ensure that you speak with hospital staff about this. Also, confer with the hospital staff about the mother's current bonding with the child and any concerns they may ha ve about the family. Staff may not always seek out the CPS social worker so you must go to them. 2. Substance Abuse Assessment Referral You must complete a substance abuse assessment referral for all investigations involving a positive toxicology screening for a newborn. 3. CFSA Nurse Referral (Office of Clinical Practice) You must also complete a referral to the CFSA nursi ng staff for all investigations involving a positive toxicology screening for a newborn. 4. Zero-to-Three Early Intervention Referral in accordance with federal law, all newborns with a positive toxicology must be referred to the 0-3 Early Intervention Program. 5. Safe Home Assessment Ensure that the mother has a crib or safe sleeping arrangement for the baby. Ensure as well that the mother has supplies and a plan to have resources to feed, clothe, and shelter the baby. 6. Service Provision If an allegation of substance abuse impacting parenti ng is substantiated you will consider the risk factors and determine whether an open agency or a colla borative referral would best serve this family; remember that collaborative services are always voluntary. If an allegation of substance abuse impacting parenti ng is not substantiated, you will still offer ongoing supportive services to the family, either in the form of a voluntary CFSA case or a collaborative referral. Be Prepared for any of the Following Possible Common Scenarios \u009a Mother reports that she is living out of the jurisdiction. CPS social workers should never give consent for a discharge of a child without confirmation of the living plan and a full assessment that the child will be safe in a new jurisdiction. Unfortunately, not assessing this fully often leads to gaps in services that could have life-changing consequences for the Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 102newborn. You must make a referral to the proposed jurisdiction and follow through to ensure that this is actually the planned living environment. \u009a Mother tests positive but newborn does not. At times the Agency will be contacted by hospitals if a mother tests positive but the newborn does not. In these situations, if an investigation is assigned, the social worker should request that the hospital complete all possible tests for substances. One very useful test that is not always administered is testing of the meconium, the first stool sample of the newborn. It can be tested for exposure in utero to drugs and alcohol. This test can show information that is not always seen in standard urine testing. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 103 MEDICAL NEGLECT INVESTIGATIONS In addition to the steps you normally take during regular investigations, there a few extra steps required when investigating reports of medical neglect. For an adequate medical neglect investigation, you must indicate that you have made contact and completed an in-person or telephone interview with one or more of the child's medical providers . These notes are important for the following reasons: Information and facts from interviews with medical professionals will help inform your disposition decision. A substantiated medical neglect allegation requires a medical opinion justifying the disposition The disposition decision must be made in conjun ction with one or more of the following medical professionals: CFSA nurse in the Office of Clinical Practice (OCP) Primary care physician Other physician(s) responsible for the well-being of the child Dentist Mental health professional Occupational or physical therapist Referrals You must make a referral to the CFSA nurses in OCP for every medical neglect investigation. The nurse referral form is located at the nurse's station in OC P . At a minimum, the referral should request a consultation, in addition to immunization and medical records. Such records may also be obtained from other sources of information as well (e .g., a school, private physician, etc.). Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 104 Domestic violence is known to increase the threat of abuse to children. To protect child safety, you must carefully assess any incidents of domestic violence. Timely intervention is of the utmost IDENTIFYING AND RESPONSING TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (DV) What is Domestic Violence? District law incorporates several phrases to describe domestic violence, including \"interpersonal DC Code \u00a716-1001(9) as \"an act punishable as a criminal offense that is committed or threatened to be committed by an offender upon a person to whom the offender is related by blood, adoption, legal custody, marriage, or domestic partnership, or with whom the offender has a child in common. \" The DC Code \u00a716-1001(6a-b) definition of \"interpersonal violence\" includes those \" with whom the offender shares or has shared a mutual residence; or who is or was married to, in a domestic partnership with, divorced or separated from, or in a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship with another person who is or was married to, in a domestic partnership with, divorced or separated from, or in a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship with the offender .\" For purposes of this practice guide, the definitions above collectively describe domestic violence (DV). As noted, it is not limited to marital relations. It can be specif ic to partnerships of varying types, including relations between former spouses, boyfriends and girlfriends, love rs, or those involved in emotional relationships without sexual involvement, e.g., violence among blood relations, e.g., adult siblings, or between an adult and an aging mother. Domestic Violence Includes the Threat as Well as Actual Use of Violence. Domestic violence is a social problem that affects every segment of the population. It crosses lines between race, socioeconomic status, religion, education, and gender.*It tends to be repeated with more frequency and more severity over time. The presence of domestic violence in the home is known to pose significant risks to children! *Although the statistical majority of DV victims are women , there are cases of DV where the victims are men. Additionally, perpetrators of domestic violence can be women or men. As noted, research reveals that exposure to domestic violence in the home impacts child safety and well-being. Beyond watching or hearing the violent incident(s), exposure may include one or more of the following experiences: Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 105 z Direct involvement of the child (such as the child trying to intervene) z Experiencing the build-up of tension prior to the violence z Experiencing the aftermath of an assault (the child seeing bruises or observing parental depression) Exposure to the negative, aggressive behaviors and atti tudes that accompany domestic violence also increases the probability that children will copy those behaviors and attitudes. In other words, children who repeatedly witness domestic violence are more likely to use violence themselves to cope with or to resolve conflict. NOTE: Exposure to domestic violence does not, in and of itself, constitute abuse or neglect. Rather, CPS must assess and document whether domestic violence in the home has resulted in actual physical or mental injury or specific risk of harm to the children. Although CFSA will investigate domestic violence, its primary responsibility is to protect children and to conduct investigations that affect child safety. At times, removal of the children from a domestic violence situation is the only method to ensuring their safety after careful consideration of all family dynamics. Assessment You should make every effort to gather the following information: \u009a Any knowledge of child(ren) intervening in DV incidents. \u009a Children showing signs of serious emotional dist ress that appear to be connected to domestic violence. For example, did symptoms such as bedwetting or behavioral problems begin or escalate following a violent incident? \u009a Influencing neglect of the child by either caregive r (e.g., the child is missing school, has lack of supervision, inadequate food or clothing, etc.). \u009a What is the nature of the current violent incident? \u009a Who is the primary aggressor or abuser? \u009a History, severity and frequency of violence in the home. \u009a History of police involvement. \u009a History of weapons in the home. \u009a Abuser's threats of death or bodily harm to self or others. \u009a Orders of protection or prior DV allegations in previous reports. \u009a Any past follow through on prior safety interventions. As always, documentation is necessary , not only for proving allegations of child abuse or neglect, but for securing needed interventions, such as court-ordered services. Record the abusive partner's words and actions in detail. Note in the case record any of the following coercive or controlling behaviors: \u009a Does the abuser become agitated, threatening or loud? \u009a Does the abuser interrupt or insult you? \u009a Does the abuser use threatening remarks, gestures or body language? \u009a Does the abuser interrupt constantly? \u009a Does the abuser blame or demean the survivor? Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 106\u009a Has the abuser directly or indirectly admitted any abusive or threatening actions and/or behaviors? \u009a How is the abusive partner's behavior harming the children? Full documentation of domestic violence dynamics shou ld include such additional elements as detailed information about the batterer's parenting, the full spectrum of the non-offending parent's efforts to provide for the safety and well-being of the children, and any other relevant information, e.g., finances, culture, substance abuse and/or mental health issues. Unless there is evidence of child abuse and neglect on the part of the survivor, it is imperative that the case notes avoid language that in any manner judges, and/or states or implies blame on the part of the survivor. Avoid using language such as \"dysfunctional family or mother \"allows\" or \"enables\" the violence, or mother\" failed to protect\" the children. Focus your case notes on facts specific to the abuser's actions, particularly in relationship to the harm and/or risk of harm to the children. Required Tasks In the event of a credible safety concern related to domestic violence, you must complete and attach an e- referral form for Innovative Family Support Services (IFSS) via email to the FTM unit in OCP within 24 hours of the report . a. You will be contacted by the CFSA DV specialist via email or telephone as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours upon the specialist's receipt of the IFSS form. b. If the client refuses services, the DV specialist will make a note of this fact and enter the information in the FACES contact screen. Domestic Violence Safety Planning Although the CFSA DV specialist may consult on a DV case , you play the vital role of working with the survivor and children to develop an immediate safety plan. For a safety plan to work, you will need to engage, involve, and collaborate with the survivor. Keep in mind that it may be unsafe for the survivor to write down the safety plan if the abuser is still living in the household. In su ch cases, the survivor should be encouraged to memorize the plan. As the investigator, you should document the plan in FACES and highlight the information as sensitive. Important Factors that Impa ct DV Safety Planning \u009a Circumstances that have precipitated past DV incidents (alcohol, drugs, stress, arguments, weekends, etc.). \u009a Past history of domestic violence incidents an d the victim's response to those incidents. \u009a The abusive partner's work schedule, location, and patterns. \u009a Safest way to contact the family for future visits. \u009a Identifying persons whom the victim can call or go to for help in an emergency (including 911). \u009a Legal actions, such as a criminal protection order (CPO). Note : if a current CPO exists, copies Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 107should be distributed to the child(ren)'s sch ool, day care center, and/or babysitter(s), after receiving written consent from the parent. \u009a Access to important items (car and/or house keys , birth certificates, social security cards, medications, cash, etc.). \u009a Available services - survivor should be given contact information to the DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence: 5 Thomas Circle, NW, 202-299-1181, www.dccadv.org \u009a Placement options for survivor and children - immediate shelter or a safe placement with friends or family. Don't forget to follow the guidelines for safety planning with parents. \u009a Police involvement (e.g., removal of all weapons from the house). Note: Please see the DV CPS Practice Points in the Appendix for additional guidance and a list of service providers (including assistance for other language spea kers). You will also find the MOU between CFSA and Survivors and Advocates for Empowerment, Inc. (SAFE) that notes the agreement for the provision of DV services in the appendix. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 108 INVESTIGATIONS OF CHILD PHYSICAL ABUSE The District of Columbia's 2003 Memorandum of Understanding on Child Physical Abuse Investigation, Prosecution and Prevention (2003 MOU) established a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of professionals to \"work in concert\" to address the needs of child victims of sexual abuse. Secondly, the team is required to focus on \"law enforcement, prosecution and related civil proceedings, and third, \"on the needs of the family members who support the best interests of the child.\" The MDT includes but is not limited to representatives from CFSA, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC), and the Ch ildren's Advocacy Center (CAC). In addition, there is a 2003 District of Columbia Memorandum of Understanding and Inter-Agency Agreement on Child Maltreatment and Joint Investigations (2003 IAA) that has helped to inform this section of the Practice Guide. The following procedures are in compliance with the prot ocols listed in both the 2003 MOU and the 2003 IAA. In addition, you are expected to be familiar with and fully comprehend each of the following definitions and concepts: The term \" physical injury \" means bodily harm greater than transient pain or minor temporary marks. The term \" mental injury \" means harm to a child's psychological or intellect ual functioning, which may be exhibited by severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or outwardly aggressive behavior, or a combination of those behaviors, and which may be demonstrated by a change in behavior, emotional response, or cognition. The term \" abused ,\" when used with reference to a child, means \"infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child.\" Note : the meaning of the term \"abused\" does not inclu de discipline administered by a caregiver to his or her child, provided that the discipline is reasonable in manner, moderate in degree and otherwise does not constitute cruelty. REMINDER : the term \"discipline\" does not include: - burning, biting, or cutting a child - striking a child with a closed fist - inflicting injury to a child by shaking, kicking, or throwing the child - non-accidental injury to a child under the age of 18 months - interfering with a child's breathing - threatening a child with or using a dangerous we apon on a child (e.g. a firearm, knife, or any other prohibited weapon as identified in DC Code\u00a722-4514 The above list is illustrati ve of unacceptable discipline but is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive . Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 109 The term \" physical punishment \" is discussed in the 2003 IAA (b ased on case law). It notes: In order for physical discipline to be acceptabl e, it must be administered by a parent as a considered response to misconduct and be ap plied in a tempered, controlled manner with as little violence and consequent po ssibility for actual physical injury as possible, given the age of the child and the attendant circumstances . The 2003 IAA also discusses cult ural differences in disciplining (b ased on case law) and notes: Differences in disciplining children that are ba sed on varying cultural or ethnic standards have no legitimate substantive role in determination of whether corporal punishment of children is reasonable or excessive. Finally, the 2003 IAA discusses scenarios where physic al abuse is suspected but physical evidence is lacking (based on case law): A history of increasingly violent, almost reflexive parental reaction may well support a finding of abuse. Even where th e specific incident, which brought the case before the court, did not result in an observably serious injury to the child, as the court must seek to protect the child from further risk of harm. SCOPE You are expected to work jointly with the MPD Youth Inve stigations Division (YID) to investigate allegations of child physical abuse where the alleged perpetrator is the ch ild's caregiver. You should also investigate caregivers who fail to protect a child in their care from child physic al abuse or physical assault, even if the perpetrator is not acting in loco parentis . These investigations encompass allegations that occur in the District of Columbia, regardless of the location of the child's primary residence. INVESTIGATION LEAD As a general rule, the assigned YID detective takes the lead for investigating and assessing serious physical injury/abuse allegations involving children. CFSA maintains primary responsibility only in matters that are not designated as immediate or serious physical injury/abuse. It is important for you to remember that response times for YID investigations and CFSA investigations do not always coincide. Since the MOU indicates that YID takes the lead on some physical abuse investigations, you must make contact with YID prior to initiating an investigation of a serious or immediate allegation. When you do make contact, you will want to discuss whether YID is responding, and your plan for ensuring the children's safety without compromising the criminal investigation. The interview with child(ren) who may have been physically abused should follow the same components discussed in general child interviewing requirements . You will also want to gather the following information to Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 110assess the entirety of the child's situation: \u009a The nature, extent, and cause of the abuse or neglect \u009a The identity of the person respon sible for the abuse or neglect \u009a The name, age, social security number and a ddress of all parents of vi ctim(s) and/or sibling(s) \u009a The name, age, sex and condition of the abused or neglected child and all other children in the home \u009a The conditions of the home at the time of the incident \u009a Whether there is any child in the home whose heal th, safety, or welfare is in jeopardy because of his or her treatment in the home or his or her home environment \u009a Whether any child who is in jeopardy because of treatment in the home or his or her home environment should be removed from the home or can be protected by the provision of resources If the child makes a disclosure during this interview that impacts their immediate safety, you should contact YID to determine what, if any, immediate role they may need to play. Special Note: care should always be taken to minimize the number of times a child is interviewed so as not to exacerbate the child's trauma. YID may at times determine that the reported allegation does not meet their standard for an investigation, and will therefore it will be turned over to CFSA. In those situations, you are the lead and sole investigator of the allegations. If, however, during the CPS investigation, a dditional detail or allegati ons are discovered that may suggest the need for a criminal investigation, these should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to YID for assessment. PRIMARY ASSESSMENT OF PHYSICAL SAFETY AND MEDICAL EXAMS Special Note : a child should never be transported for a medical examination by the alleged perpetrator of physical abuse. When assessing a physical abuse allegation, you must firs t begin by ensuring that the child is not in need of immediate medical treatment. If a child is complaining of significant pain or has other visible indicators of immediate injury, you must contact 911. Purpose There are a number of reasons that medical examin ations occur in physical abuse investigations: Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 111 \u009a To assess the physical well-being of the child(ren). \u009a To gather any physical evidence of a crime of physical abuse. \u009a To provide the child(ren) with an opportunity to disclose during the examination. Note: disclosure to the medical provider may be able to be used in court. \u009a To reassure the child(ren) about his or her body. Location Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) houses the Freddie Mac Child and Adolescent Protection Center (CAPC) , which specializes in assessing and treating victims of child maltreatment. CNMC, and specif ically the CAPC, is the preferred provider for these evaluations. Families may elect, however, to have the ch ild(ren) seen at another provider. You and the detective are obliged to explain to family members the benefits of having the child seen by a specialist at CAPC. You and the detective are also expected to facilitate the process, ensuring to the best of your ability that professional evaluations have taken place. REMINDER: in instances of immediate medical evaluation or follow-up medical evaluation, CAPC is the preferred provider. PHYSICAL OBSERVATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF INJURIES In many instances of physical abuse allegations, the ma tter will not require a medical evaluation by CAPC or other medical professional. In instances of minor or no injuries, you may be able to adequately record the injuries (or lack thereof) without the need of a medical professional. In the event that the injuries are not visible, your assessment must consider one or more of the following potential reasons that injuries are not present: \u009a No injury ever occurred. \u009a An injury occurred but bruising is not yet manifest on the child's body. \u009a An injury occurred but is no longer visible. \u009a An internal injury occurred that is not visible to the eye. When an injury does not appear to have ever occurred related to physical abuse, you must document this in FACES. Ideally, you will be able to demonstrate that no injury exists by photographing the area of the body where the alleged injury occurred. You should also be mindful that depending on how quickly you respond to a notification of alleged abuse, bruising and swelling may not always occur immediately. Follow up may be needed to determine whether visible injuries develop. (This is also true in situations where a child may have some injuries immediately present but others develop in the coming days.) In instances where an injury may have faded or healed, you must, whenever possible, converse with the child Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 112 about this injury, and describe in your FACES documentat ion how the injury appeared at the time of the event as well as any related pain or impairment in functioning that was a result of the injury. If there is any concern for an internal injury, a medica l examination should occur. For example, a child who is punched with force in the abdomen may be suffering from damage to the organs, or other internal injuries even though there is no visible, external injury. In the event that there are observable injuries, you must take care to describe each injury in detail (size, shape, color, etc. ) in FACES. You should also photograph each injury. In doing so, it may be helpful to have a measuring tape or so me other standard (dollar bill, coin, etc.) to hold next to the injury to demonstrate the nature and extent of the injury. NOTE: CFSA Has Legal Authority to Take Photographs and To Require Radiological Examinations (DC Code \u00a7 4-1301.08) Any person responsible for the investigation may take or have someone take photographs of each area of possible trauma on the child or of the conditions surroun ding the suspected abuse or neglect of the child. If medically indicated, you may also request that the child have a radiological examination, including full skeletal x-rays. CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER (CAC) INTERVIEW Criteria for CAC Interviews Whenever there is an allegation of child physical abus e, the following categories of children are required be interviewed at the CAC, unless the prosecutor and de tective have determined that a CAC interview is unwarranted: \u009a Any child aged 5 years or younger who has any of the following injuries: \u009a Suspicious burns \u009a Suspicious head injuries \u009a Injuries with an implausible explanation \u009a Injuries of different ages which are indicative of a pattern of abuse \u009a Suspected Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 113\u009a Adult-sized bites \u009a Other serious injuries that involve hospitalization or surgery \u009a All other children aged 12 or younge r who may be a witness to the physical abuse of a child victim or to a child fatality caused by abuse. \u009a All other children aged 12 or younger who live in the same household as a child victim discussed above, if the lead detective believes a criminal prosecution is likely to occur. Note: while a forensic interview at the CAC may not be requir ed in all cases, detectives and CFSA investigative social workers are encouraged to utilize the CAC whenever it may assist the investigation or help to better serve the needs of child victims or witnesses. Scheduling Any MDT member may schedule a CAC interview but the primary responsibility for scheduling is that of the assigned detective . Note: since all MDT members are committed to coordinating the scheduling of these interviews to accommodate one another, all parties wh o are directly involved with the investigation are expected to be present for the interview. \u009a CAC interviews should be scheduled, whenever po ssible, on the same business day as the report. \u009a When the initial CPS assessment suggests that a CAC interview is immediately warranted, this should be elevated and addressed through your chain of command. \u009a At times, a CAC interview may be required after the close of standard business hours due to emergency circumstances. In such instances, the assigned detective may contact the on-call interviewer from the CAC to conduct the interview. \u009a If the initial CPS assessment suggests that a CAC interview is immediately warranted and there are concerns regarding scheduling, this should be elevated and addressed through your chain of command. Counsel Notification of a CAC Interview \u009a When a child is represented by counsel (aka a guardian ad litem), this counsel must give consent for the interview and has a right to be present. \u009a If you have knowledge of counsel for a child or if a child has been removed please ensure that this information is shared during the scheduling. Transportation \u009a Coordination of transportation is the responsibili ty of the MDT member scheduling the interview. In general, this will be the assigned YID detective. \u009a The MDT members should always endeavor to work together to address transportation. Decision Not to Hold an Interview Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 114\u009a The MDT may determine in any given matter that a CAC interview is not necessary or warranted. \u009a At times, an interview may not be held due to unaddressed mental health needs of the child. If the child is currently receiving therapeutic services, coordination is required to occur between you, the CAC, and the service provider to determine if an interview is a ppropriate. If no services are in place, the CAC may be scheduled at a later date, after therapeutic services are in place. \u009a The average age for CAC interviews is 3-12 years old. There are times, however, when the MDT will determine that a detective can successfully interview a teenager in an environment outside of the CAC. If you believe that the environment at the CAC would be most appropriate to ensure the teenager's well- being, you should advocate for the teen and request that the interview take place in the CAC environment. Keep in mind that the MDT has no other child-friendly location for the purposes of recording an interview. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 115Unexplained or Inconsistent Injuries General considerations A CPS investigation is warranted when a child has a seri ous injury and one of the following circumstances exists: \u009a No explanation is provided but an explanation should be available, given the type of injury (e.g., serious bruising, lacerations/abrasions, burns, bite marks, fractures, etc.) \u009a An explanation is provided but it is inconsistent with the injury, \u009a Multiple explanations are provided but statements are inconsistent. Assessment Details \u009a Detailed Timeline In collaboration with the MPD detective, the social worker should obtain a detailed timeline (whenever possible) of any events precipitating and/or surrounding the child's injury, including the following information: physical location(s) of the child feeding/sleeping patterns (if a small child) persons responsible for the care of the child persons with access to the child demeanor/behavior of the child, including anything out of the ordinary any history of falls, injury, or other unusual incidents \u009a Assessment for neglect If an unexplained injury is ultimately determined to be accidental, assessment should still occur to ensure that there are not any neglect factors, such as supervision concerns. \u009a Removal Discussion Removal of a child should be considered under the following circumstances: A child has an unexplained injury that is indicative of abuse. A child has an unexplained injury that could be accidental but, if accidental, would have been memorable enough to be able to relate the circumstances around the injury. If it can be determined that the injury occurred outside of the responsibility of the primary caregiver, removal may not be necessary. You must still make a very thorough assessment to ensure that the primary caregiver used/uses appropriate judgment in the care of the child and is able to protect the child in the future. Required tasks Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 116 \u009a Medical Examination/Medico-Legal In matters involving unexplained injuries that are suggestive of possible child abuse, you must ensure that a medical examination takes place. Depending on the severity of the injury, this examination may need to occur immediately to ensure safe planning for the care of the child. Ideally, these examinations will occur at the CNMC Child and Adolescent Protection Center. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 117CHILD FATALITY INVESTIGATIONS General considerations Child fatality investigations and \"near-fatality\" investigat ions are, by nature, high-profile and sensitive. The CPS Special Abuse Unit will usually investigate these matters in collaboration with the MPD Special Victims Unit (SVU). It is important to realize that many child deaths are officially found to be of natural or undetermined causes. Be very mindful that even accidental or undeterm ined deaths can be associated with neglect factors (e.g., poor supervision, inadequate sleeping arrangements, care giver substance abuse, etc.). At other times, you will find yourself working with the police on abusive deaths due to homicide. Be mindful as well that a specific allegation of abuse or neglect is not required for CPS investigations into child fatality matters. The following scenarios are possible: \u009a Hotline call reflects allegations of neglect or abus e that must be dispositioned through investigation. \u009a Hotline call does not reflect allegations of neglect or abuse but due to the uncertain nature of the child's death a CPS assessment is warranted. o Allegations may be discovered during the course of the assessment, be added to the investigation, and be dispositioned prior to closure of the investigation. o No abuse or neglect concerns surface during the investigation and the investigation is closed without needing entry or disposition of allega tions after appropriate assessment and service provision. Assessment details \u009a Observation of the Decedent In most child fatality investigations, you will be responding to the location of the decedent to observe the child and gain an initial understanding around the child's death. You should observe the child, in collaboration with hospital staff or police to determin e if there are injuries or other notable factors (such as the child's hygiene, physical appearance, etc.). \u009a Interview with Emergency/Hospital Personnel You should speak with hospital personnel regarding th e child's method of transport to the hospital, the initial impressions of the parent/caregiver, the histor y taken by hospital staff around the child's death, and any other pertinent information. Remember to make note of and record the initial impressions of the hospital staff regarding the child's death an d use this as a foundation for the assessment. \u009a Detailed Time Frame around Death Request a detailed timeline of events around the ch ild's death and any precipitating events. You should team with the MPD detective to gather the following information: Physical location(s) of the child Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 118 Feeding/sleeping patterns (if a small child) Persons responsible for the care of the child Persons with access to the child Demeanor/behavior of the child, including anything out of the ordinary Any history of falls, injury, or other unusual incidents \u009a Details of the Mother's Pregnancy and the Child's Birth An interview should be held with the mother and/or other caregiver around the pregnancy and birth of the child to gather the following information: Prenatal care Pregnancy complications Type of delivery and any complications Pre or full-term birth and birth weight \u009a Details of the Health, Development and Basic Care of the Child (including sleeping and feeding of young children) Your assessment should include details of the child's he alth history (or if a \"near fatality\", then current health), including any diagnosed conditions, medica tions, the child's primary doctor, and any medical examinations. You should also discuss with the caregiver whether the child was (or is) meeting the standard developmental milestones. Further, the basic ca re of the child should be discussed, including the feeding/sleeping patterns of young children. \u009a Family Health History Determine if there is any pertinent family history of disease or illness that could be related to the child's death. \u009a Details of Autopsy Findings An autopsy is conducted for most child fatality investigations. The SVU detective, and often a detective from YID, will attend the autopsy. Typically the autopsy is conducted within a few days of the death and the detective will share with you the initial autopsy findings. These details can be vital to your overall investigation. They may, for example, reveal additional bruising or internal injuries not observable at the time of the child's death. \u009a Cause of Death vs. Manner of Death \"Cause of death\" is the chain of events that led up to the death (such as cardiac arrest, complications of disease, etc.). The \"manner of death\" falls into on e of five categories: natural, suicide, homicide, accidental, or undetermined. Due to the length of time required for a full autopsy report, the cause and manner of death may not be officially determined when you are in the process of determining whether or not to close the investigation. If this takes place with your investigation, you should consult with you management team to decide whether there is sufficient information for a safe closure of the investigation Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 119without the official report. It may be that the initia l autopsy findings will be sufficient to make your determination for a safe closure. Required Tasks \u009a 0-3 Early Intervention Referral In the event of a child fatality where there are su rviving children (age 0-3) in the family, you are required to refer these infants/toddlers for a preventive early intervention screening. \u009a Medical Assessment of Siblings When a child dies in unknown or suspicious circumstances, any surviving siblings should be medically assessed. In investigations involving unexplained injuries or abusive death, a medico- legal screening should be obtained. It is preferred that the assessment occur at the CNMC Child and Adolescent Protection Center. \u009a OCP Nurse Referral A referral to CFSA's OCP nurses is mandatory in any child fatality investigation. \u009a Assistance for Death Notification You should offer assistance to families for the notifica tion of death in all child fatality investigations. The clinical coordinator at the CAC and staff at the Wendt Center are excellent resources. Make certain that the family members are emotionally ready and equipped to have this conversation. In matters involving abuse/neglect, you should ensure that professionals take the lead in such discussions so there is no additional trauma to the child(ren). \u009a Offer of Grief Counseling It is your responsibility to offer referrals for grief/loss counseling to family members involved in child fatality investigations. \u009a Offer Funeral Assistance If a family has open involvement with CFSA, the Agen cy may assist financially with funeral arrangements for the decedent. Please check with your supervisor rega rding this process and the availability of funds. If the family has no involvement with CFSA, you should meet with the family to assist them in accessing public services for funeral arrangements. This can be done through their neighborhood collaborative or Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 120the Department of Human Services. \u009a Critical Event Meeting You and your management team will work together with other Agency staff during a critical event meeting to discuss the status and next steps of this investigation. This meeting will be coordinated and facilitated by Quality Assurance personnel from CFSA . This meeting is typically held within 24 business hours of the critical event. \u009a CFSA Internal Child Fatality Review This meeting typically occurs several weeks after a child fatality investigation is completed. Your participation is required along with members of the CPS management team. At this time agency history with the family will be reviewed as well as deta ils around the child fatality. The following areas are topics of discussion: o Did CFSA take every action and make every reasonable effort to ensure the safety of the child and other children in the household? o Are there any practice, training or policy issues that need to be resolved as it relates to the respective child fatality? What are other systemic issues such as supervision, staffing, access to records etc.? o Knowing what we know now, what would we do differently? o What are the interagency issues to present to City-Wide Child Fatali ty Review Committee? o Were there parental or familial behavior factors that contributed to the fatality? Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 121SEXUAL ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS AND EVALUATIONS OVERVIEW As noted in the section on Physical Abuse , the 2003 MOU established a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of professionals to \"work in concert\" to address the needs of child victims of sexual abuse. Secondly, the team is required to focus on \"law enforcement, prosecution and related civil proceedings, and third, on the needs of the family members who support the best interests of the child.\" Reminder : The MDT includes but is not limited to representatives from CFSA, MPD, the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC), and the Children's Advocacy Center (CAC). The following procedures comply with all protocols li sted in the 2003 MOU regarding child sexual abuse investigations and evaluations. It is further useful and expected that you become familiar with and fully comprehend each of the following definitions: \"Sexual Abuse\" DC Code \u00a7 16-2301(32) (A) Engaging in, or attempting to engage in, a sexual act or sexual contact with a child (see definitions of \"sexual act\" and \"sexual contact\"); (B) Causing or attempting to cause a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct (see definition of \"sexually explicit conduct\"); or (C) Exposing a child to sexually explicit conduct (see definition of \"sexually explicit conduct\"). \"Intra-familial\" Offense DC Code \u00a7 16-1001 An act punishable as a criminal offense committed by an offender upon a person: (A) to whom the offender is related by blood, legal cu stody, marriage, having a child in common, or with the offender shares or has shared a mutual residence; or (B) with whom the offender maintains or maintained a ro mantic relationship not necessarily including a sexual relationship. \"Sexual Act\" DC Code Section 16-230 1 (34) and 22-3001 (8) Penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulv a of another by a penis; (b) contact between the mouth and the penis, the mouth and the vulva, or the mouth and the anus; or (c) the penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva by a hand or by any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual de sire of any person. The emission of semen is not required for the purposes of subparag raphs (a) - (c) of this paragraph. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 122\"Sexual Contact\" DC Code Section 16-2301 (35) and 22-3001 (9) The touching with any clothed or unclothed body part or object, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. For the purpose of CPS investigations, child sexual activity is defined as sexual behavior that is considered developmentally precocious or inappropriate and/or pote ntially symptomatic of a child who has been sexually abused. In addition to being familiar with the relevant termin ology, you must also be familiar with the following components of investigation and the evaluation procedures: \u009a The overall scope of investigations and evaluations \u009a Individual roles and responsibilities for different members of the MDT \u009a Conversations with non-offending caregivers \u009a Medical examinations (purpose, location, etc.) \u009a CAC interviews (including the decision not to hold an interview) \u009a Handling of historical allegations \u009a Required investigation tasks and FACES documentation It is also important to recognize the legal limitations of CFSA's responsibility, i.e., you may only investigate allegations against a caregiver acting in loco parentis. Notwithstanding this limitation, the Agency is still responsible legally and professionally for ensuring the safe ty of children in the District of Columbia. Therefore you must still conduct safety evaluations involving intra-familial sexual abuse and/or reports of child sexual activity. If, however, allegations against a caregiver are identified during the course of an evaluation, the matter should then be converted into an investigation. The overall section on sexual abuse is divided into the following categories: \u009a Investigations of Child Sexual Abuse These are matters involving allegations of child se xual abuse of a minor victim (at the time of offense) by a parent or caregiver acting in loco parentis. An example of this is a child who wa s sexually abused by her father. Another example would be a child who was sexually abused by an aunt who is the child's primary caregiver and acting in loco parentis. \u009a Safety Evaluations of Intra-Fa milial Child Sexual Assault Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 123These are matters involving sexual abuse of a minor victim (at the time of offense) by a family member who is not a parent or a caregiver acting in loco parentis. This includes offenses on children by adult family members who are not parents or who do not play a caregiving role for the child. An example of this might be an uncle who resides in the home but is not acting in loco parentis. This also includes offenses on children by relatives who are minors. If there is force involved in the assault there is no required age differenc e between the children. If the activity was \"consensual\" there is a four year age difference required between the victim and perpetrator to consider this an assault investigation. An exampl e of this would be a 13 year old who forcibly rapes his 12 year old cousin. Another example of this would be a 17 year old who is having \"consensual\" sex with her 12 year old brother. \u009a Safety Evaluations of Child Sexual Activity These matters include behaviors, statements, or other indications of developmentally inappropriate sexual knowledge suggestive of potential child sexual abuse. If more than one child is involved, such activity must have occurred between children with less than a four-year age difference (unless force is involved- see above). Evaluations of such matters do not require an intr a-familial relationship between the children, nor do the children involved need to live in the District. If the report alleges that the child sexual activity occurred in the District, CFSA will evalua te for the safety and well-being of the child. If concerns develop during the course of the evaluation regarding any failure to protect or any other maltreatment by a caregiver acting in loco parentis , the evaluation must be converted to an investigation and the appropriate allegations added to FACES. When working with a \"child on child\" sexual activity evaluation, a primary evaluation is taken regarding the family of origin of the alleged perpetrating child (if one can be determined). It is your responsibility to carefully assess whether the perpetrating child has suffered sexual abuse and/or whether there are any children at risk for being exposed to the perpetrating child. \u009a Under such circumstances, the alleged victim child is assessed as a collateral source of information to the evaluation. \u009a You and your management team have the discretion to determine whether the situation warrants further intervention, and/or whether to enter a companion evaluation or investigation regarding the victim child's family of origin. \u009a Safety Evaluations of Suggested Sexual Abuse These matters include circumstances which are only suggestive of sexual abuse that may have Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 124occurred or potentially will occur . Children living under the following situations may be victims of sexual abuse and/or vulnerable to potential sexual abuse: \u009a Exposure to adult sexuality (for the sexual gratification of the perpetrator) \u009a Residing with a sexual offender \u009a Sexual exploitation of the child (pornography, prostitution, etc.) \u009a Other risk factors related to sexual abuse Reports on any of the above situations may be accepted on a case-by-case basis and should be discussed amongst the CPS management prior to acceptance for evaluation. Note: Allegations that a child is exposed to sexual activity (live or simulated) by a caregiver are only taken as sexual abuse safety evaluation s IF the alleged perpetrator was intentionally exposing the child for their own sexual gratification. All other matters may be investigated as general neglect and are handled by traditional units. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 125INVESTIGATIONS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE Scope In accordance with the 2003 MOU, you are expected to work jointly with the MPD Youth Investigations Division (YID) to investigate allegations of child sexu al abuse where the alleged perpetrator is the child's caregiver. You will also investigate caregivers who fail to protect a child in their care from child sexual abuse or sexual assault, even if the perpetrator is not acting in loco parentis . These investigations encompass allegations that occur in the District of Columbia, regardless of the location of the child's primary residence. Investigation Lead As a general rule, the assigned YID detective takes th e lead for investigating and assessing sexual abuse allegations involving children. There is, however, a st anding agreement that an immediate joint investigation shall occur when a report includes information that an a lleged perpetrator lives in the same home of the alleged victim, or has regular access to the child victim, which subsequently indicates a potential immediate danger to the child. In such instances, you should communicate as soon as possible with YID for commencing the joint investigation accordingly. SPECIAL NOTE : alleged perpetrators may also be minors who live in the same home and may pose an equal level of danger . If information about access between a perpetrator and a child is discovered during the investigation, this should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to YID for intervention. It is important for you to remember that response times for YID investigations and CFSA investigations do not always coincide. Since the 2003 MOU indicates that YID takes the lead on sexual abuse investigations, you must make contact with YID prior to initialing your report to discuss whether they are responding and to discuss your plan for ensuring the children's safety with out compromising the criminal investigation. When you are not able to conduct a joint investigation because a detective has not been assigned, you should not directly discuss the sexual abuse allegations with th e caregivers or child(ren). Doing so may compromise the future police investigation by prematurely disclosing sensit ive information. In these cases, ideally, the child(ren) should be interviewed at school or in another neutral environment. If the children must be interviewed at home, which obviously informs the caregiver of the investigation, you should explain that the Agency has received a complaint regarding the safety and well-being of the child(ren) and that you are there to assess the safety and well-being of the family. In some situations, you may need to provide some information to the caregiver in order for the caregiver to protect the child (e .g., if the uncle is the alleged perpetrator and he visits the home sometimes, the caregiver can be put on alert). The interview of the child(ren) should follow the components discussed in the general child interview , including a preventive assessment for sexual abuse. If the child makes a disclosure during the interview that impacts Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 126their immediate safety, you should contact YID to determ ine what, if any, immediate role they may need to play. Special Note : care should always be taken to minimize trauma by limiting the number of times a child must be interviewed. YID may at times determine that the reported allegation does not meet their standard for an investigation. In these types of situations, you are the lead and sole invest igator of the TOT'd allegations. If, however, during the CPS investigation, additional detail or allegations ar e discovered that may suggest the need for a criminal investigation, you should consult with your management team and forward the information to YID for assessment. Conversation with Non-Offending Caregiver When a child has been sexually abused, there may be a non-offending and/or protecting caregiver involved. You must take care to thoroughly assess the non-offendi ng caregiver's ability and willingness to ensure the safety of the child and to follow through on needed services for the child. Written safety planning is a crucial component for maintaining stability for a child victim in these situations. Safety planning should be used anytime that a child remains with a non-offending caregiver. All details of the plans should be written down. You, the caregiver, and your supervisor should all sign the safety plan. In addition, please consider the following factors when assessing the caregiver's ability to protect the child both physically and emotionally: \u009a Prior knowledge of the sexual abuse and the possibili ty of a lack of protection by the non-offending caregiver \u009a Non-offending caregiver's knowledge of previous devi ant sexual behavior by the alleged perpetrator, which may present a danger to a child(ren) \u009a Attitude of the caregiver toward the victim child, alleged perpetrator, and allegations \u009a Willingness of the caregiver to ensure that the perpet rator does not have access to the child, including obtaining a protective order \u009a Willingness of the caregiver to participate in ongoing services for the child, including the CAC interview, medical examination, and therapeutic services When discussing the investigation with a non-offending caregi ver, care should be taken to instruct this individual on appropriate interaction with the child and alleged perpetrator. The caregiver should not unduly discuss the investigation with the child. The alleged perpetrator should not be informed of the investigation, nor should the caregiver confront the alleged perpetrator about the allegations. In situations where the alleged perpetrator is an adult, the non-offending caregiver must agree in writing that the alleged perpetrator will leave the home (if applicable) and further, that the alleged perpetrator will not have any access to the alleged victim or other at-risk children in the family. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 127 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 128 Medical Examination Purpose There are a number of reasons that medical exam inations occur in sexual abuse investigations: \u009a To assess the physical wellbeing of the child(ren). \u009a To gather any physical evidence of a crime of sexual abuse. \u009a To provide the child(ren) with an opportunity to disclose during the examination. Note : disclosures to the medical provider may be able to be used in court! \u009a To reassure the child(ren) about his or her body. Special Note : a child should never be transported for a medical examination by the alleged perpetrator of sexual abuse. Location The Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) houses the Freddie Mac Child and Adolescent Protection Center (CAPC) , which specializes in assessing and treating victims of child maltreatment. CNMC, and specifically the CAPC , is the preferred provider for these evaluations. Families may elect, however, to have the child(ren) seen at another provider. You and the detective are obliged to explain to family members the benefits of having the child seen by a specialist at CAPC. You and the detective are also expected to facilitate the process, ensuring to the best of the family members' ability that professional evaluations have taken place. When Sexual Abuse is Reported to have Occurred Within the Last 72 hours or When the Child is Unable to Articulate a Time Frame Children who have suffered sexual abuse or assault within the last 72 hours should be seen for immediate medical attention. \u009a You and the YID detective should assist any non-offending caregiver with this process. \u009a The YID detective will take responsibility for coor dination of an exam by a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) and will be responsible for the \"sex kit\" (if one is to be completed.) Special Note : the sex kit is considered legal evidence and is subject to chain of custody rules involving the police department and the hospital. You should never take possession of a sex kit (including transport to the hospital). \u009a Similarly, you should never take possession of th e original \"medico-legal\" form that has been completed by a physician in sexual assault examinations. This, too, is considered a legal document and is subject to chain of custody regulations. However, you must obtain a copy of the \"medico-legal\" document for use in the CPS investigation and any family court proceedings in which CFSA is involved. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 129 Working with the Caregiver \u009a If a caregiver is unwilling to take steps to ha ve the child(ren) examined, you and the detective must make every effort to explore and alleviate any of the caregiver's concerns. It is a good idea to reiterate the important reasons for this immediate examination. \u009a Reminder : sexual abuse and sexual assault disclosures are typically traumatic, not only for the child but also for the non-offending caregiver. It is important that you allow the caregiver an appropriate measure of time to process the information while simultaneously striving to empower the caregiver to make the best decisions for the well-being of the child. You should assist the caregiver in managing their emotions and composing themselves so as to minimize trauma to the child and to allow the parent to provide appropriate support to the child. \u009a If a caregiver remains unwilling to allow for the medical examination, then you must inform the caregiver (without coercion) that this may be grounds for a finding that the child is without proper parental care and/or without the control needed to ensure the child's safety. If concern persists regarding completion of the medical examination, this should be discussed with the caregiver and your management team as there may be a need to take custody of this child to ensure that this examination occurs and the child's well-being is addressed. \u009a When an initial examination has successfully take n place, you and the YID detective should also assist the family with any follow-up care that may be needed, such as further testing and/or therapeutic services and determine the outcome. When Sexual Abuse is Reported More than 72 Hours After the Alleged Occurrence The following shall occur within 48 hours of the report : \u009a All children 12 years of age or younger alleging any type of sexual abuse or contact must be taken for an examination. YID will use its discretion as to whether a sex kit is required. \u009a All children between the ages of 13 and 17 who allege any penetration, attempted penetration, oral-genital or anal offense shall be taken for a sexual assault examination. YID will provide sex kits in all of these cases. \u009a When a child over age 12 alleges sexual abuse by fondling, YID will use its discretion as to whether a medical examination is warranted. When there is No Disclosure When an investigation alleges sexual abuse, but there is no disclosure by the child at any time, there is still a possibility that sexual abuse occurred, even without evidence. It is the Agency's practice to recommend that a child who does not disclose still be taken for a medical examination. If you are unsure whether or not to recommend a medical examination, please consult with your supervisor for immediate guidance. CAC Interview Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 130 Criteria for CAC Interviews Unless the prosecutor and YID detective have determined that a CAC interview is unwarranted, the following categories of children should be interviewed at the CAC when there is an allegation of child sexual abuse: \u009a Any child under age 12,or \u009a Any child over age 12 with the following qualifiers: - an intra-family relationship with the offender - emotional, developmental, learning or other disabilities - alleged victim is non-communicative on the scene Scheduling Any MDT member may schedule a CAC interview but it is the primary responsibility of the assigned detective . Note : since all MDT members are committed to coordinating schedules with one another for the interviews, all parties who are directly involved with the investigation are expected to be present. \u009a CAC interviews should be scheduled, whenever po ssible, on the same business day as the report. \u009a When the initial CPS assessment suggests that a CAC interview is immediately warranted, this should be elevated and addressed through your chain of command. \u009a At times, a CAC interview may be required after the close of standard business hours due to emergency circumstances. In such instances, the assigned detective may contact the on-call interviewer from the CAC to conduct the interview. \u009a If the initial CPS assessment suggests that a CAC interview is immediately warranted and there are concerns regarding scheduling, this should be elevated and addressed through your chain of command. Counsel Notification of a CAC Interview \u009a When a child is represented by counsel (aka a guardian ad litem), this counsel must give consent for the interview. He or she has a right to be present. \u009a If you have knowledge of counsel for a child or if a child has been removed, please ensure that this information is shared during the scheduling. Transportation Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 131\u009a Coordination of transportation is the resp onsibility of the MDT member scheduling the interview. In general, this will be the assigned YID detective. \u009a The MDT members should always endeavor to work together to address transportation. Decision Not to Hold an Interview \u009a The MDT may determine in any given matter that a CAC interview is not necessary or warranted. \u009a If the MDT determines that a CAC interview is not needed in a sexual abuse matter, notification should still be made to the CAC to ensure coordination of services, follow-up with the child and family, and systems record maintenance. \u009a At times, an interview will not be held due to a child's unaddressed mental health needs. If the child is currently receiving therapeutic services, co ordination may be necessary. It will be up to you, the CAC, and the service provider to determine if an interview is appropriate. If no services are in place, the CAC may be scheduled at a late r date, after therapeutic services are in place. \u009a Remember: the CAC usually interviews children under age 13. There are times, however, when the MDT will determine that a YID detective can successfully interview a teenager. If you believe that the environment at the CAC would be the mo st appropriate to ensure the teenager's well- being, you should advocate for the interview to be held there. Keep in mind that the MDT has no other child-friendly location for the purposes of recording an interview. Historical Allegations \u009a CFSA does not have a statute of limitations for repo rts of sexual abuse. Nonetheless, there are such limitations within the criminal system. You need to be prepared in such instances to investigate historical situations without police assistance. \u009a When considering historical allegations, you must not only consider the current allegation but also whether the alleged perpetrator has access to other children. \u009a If there is credible justification to determine that the historical sexual abuse occurred, then steps should be taken to conduct safety evaluations on any ch ildren with whom the perpetrator could have had inappropriate contact. These tasks should be coordinated with MPD whenever possible. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 132SAFETY EVALUATIONS: INTRA-FA MILIAL CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT Scope Intra-familial child sexual assault evaluations occur in matters involving a perpetrator fitting the definition of an intra-familial relationship (see Overview section above) but the perpetrator IS NOT a parent or caregiver acting in loco parentis . These evaluations encompass allegations that occu r in the District of Columbia, regardless of the location of the child's primary residence. Reminder : the perpetrator in these matters may be a minor or an adult. Note: In order for a minor to be considered a perpetrator, there must be a four-year age difference between the perpetrator and victim, except in cases of forcible sex, in which case there is no required age difference. In the situations where the alleged perpetrator is a minor, there are no allegations per se to be investigated by CPS. You must still evaluate, however, the safety and well-being of the child. If concerns develop during the course of the evaluation regarding any failure to protect or ot her maltreatment by a caregiver or caregiver acting in loco parentis , the evaluation must be converted to an investigation and the appropriate allegations added to FACES. \u009a For reports of a \"child on child\" sexual assault, the social worker sha ll evaluate the family of origin of the alleged perpetrating child and assess whether the perpetrating child has suffered sexual abuse. In addition, the social worker shall assess whether there are any other children at risk of being exposed to the perpetrating child. \u009a In such matters, the alleged victim child is assessed as a collateral source of information to the evaluation. \u009a You and your management team will have the discretion to decide whether the situation warrants further intervention, or whether to enter a companion evaluation/investigation of the victim child's family of origin. Evaluation Lead As a general rule, the assigned YID detective takes the le ad for evaluating sexual assault allegations involving children. There is, however, a standing agreement that an immediate joint evaluation shall occur when a report includes information that an alleged perpetrator lives in the same home of the alleged victim, or has regular access to the child victim, and/or there is obvious or immi nent danger to the child. In such instances, you should communicate as soon as possible with YID to begin the joint investigation as appropriate. Reminder : alleged perpetrators may also be minors who live in the same home and may pose an equal level of danger . If information about unsafe access between a perpetrator and a child is discovered during the evaluation, this should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to YID for intervention. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 133It is important for you to remember that response times for YID evaluations and CFSA evaluations do not always coincide. As a result, it may be challenging in some instances for your evaluation to begin without an assigned detective. NOTE: When you are not able to conduct a joint evaluation due to a detective not being assigned, you should not directly discuss the allegations with the caregivers or child (ren). Doing so may compromise a future police investigation by prematurely disclosing sensitive informat ion. Ideally, the child (ren) should be interviewed at school or other neutral environment. If the children cannot be interviewed in a neutral environment and must be interviewed at home, the specific allegations should not be directly discussed with the caregiver but you should explain that the Agency has received a complain t regarding the safety and well-being of the child (ren) and you need to assess the safety and well-being of the family. The interview of the child (ren) should follow the components discussed in the general child interview , including a preventive assessment for sexual abuse. If the child makes a disclosure during this interview, the po lice should be contacted to determine what, if any, immediate role they may need to play. Special Note : care should always be taken to minimize trauma by limiting the number of times a child needs to be interviewed. MPD may at times determine that the reported allegation does not meet their standard for an evaluation. In those situations, you will be the lead and sole evaluator of the TOT'd allegations. If, however, additional details or allegations are discovered during the CPS evaluation, and you determine there is a need for a criminal investigation, you should consult with your management team and forward the information to MPD for assessment. Conversation with Non-offending Caregiver When a child has been sexually assaulted, there may still be a non-offending and/or protecting caregiver involved. You must take care to thoroughly assess the situation and, if necessary, to follow through on needed services for the child. Safety planning is also a crucia l component for maintaining stability for a child victim in these situations. You should consider the following factors when assessing the caregiver's ability to protect the child both physically and emotionally: \u009a Attitude of the caregiver toward the victim child and perpetrator \u009a Willingness of the caregiver to ensure that the perpet rator does not have access to the child, including obtaining a protective order \u009a Willingness of the caregiver to participate in ongoing services for the child, including the CAC interview, medical examination, and therapeutic services When discussing the evaluation with a non-offending caregive r, care should be taken to instruct this individual on appropriate interaction with the child: \u009a The caregiver should not unduly discuss the evaluation with the child. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 134\u009a The alleged perpetrator should not be informed of the evaluation or any pending investigation, nor should the caregiver confront the alleged perpetrator about the allegations. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 135 Safety Planning after Se xual Abuse Allegations \u009a Safety plans should be detailed and written. \u009a They must be signed by the social worker, caregiver, and supervisor. \u009a Under no circumstance should CPS personnel be party to a safety plan that does not include removal of the offender from the family home. \u009a When the offender is an adult, the safety plan must include a strategy to prevent the offender from having access to the victim(s). \u009a When the offending child is a minor and a lack of resources prevents the family from planning for separate living situations for the perpetrator and victim, a very specific and careful safety planning must occur. \u009a The preferred safety plan involves both discontinued contact and separate living situations for the perpetrating youth and victim. REMEMBER! YOU ARE REQUIRED TO MONITOR SAFETY PLANS UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE CASE IS TRANSFERRED. Medical Examination Please see the discussion regarding medical examinations above under the Sexual Abuse Investigations section and follow the guidelines outlined there. Special Note : a child should never be transported for a medical examination by the alleged perpetrator of sexual abuse. CAC Interview Please see the discussion regarding medical examinations above under the Sexual Abuse Investigations section and follow the guidelines outlined there. Historical Allegations CFSA does not have a statute of limitations for reports of sexual abuse. There are, however, such limitations within the criminal system. The CFSA social worker n eeds to be prepared in such instances to investigate historical situations without police assistance. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 136\u009a When considering historical allegations, you must co nsider current circumstances, including whether the alleged perpetrator has access to other children. \u009a If there is credible evidence for determining that the historical sexual abuse occurred, then steps should be taken to conduct safety evaluations on any ch ildren with whom the perpetrator could have had inappropriate contact. These tasks should be coordinated with MPD whenever possible. When evaluating historical allegations that do not involve a caregiver acting in loco parentis , you should carefully consider what purpose CPS involvement will serve, particularly when the Agency will have no authority to substantiate an allegation, even if it is true. Factors for Consideration: \u009a Where does the family currently reside? If the family resides outside of the District, consider a referral to the CPS unit of the appropriate jurisdiction. In such situations, the evaluation will be closed with CFSA although further MPD investigation may occur. \u009a Does any child need supportive services? If the child is stable and there are no other safety fa ctors, an evaluation from CPS may not be warranted. \u009a Does the perpetrator have access to the victim? If the perpetrator does not have access to the victim and there are no other safety factors, an evaluation may not be warranted. \u009a If the perpetrator was a minor at the time of the offense, is the perpetrator still a minor? If the perpetrator is now an adult and there are no other safety factors, an evaluation may not be warranted. FACES Core Contacts and Assessments Because there are no allegations in safety evaluations, the standard medical and educational core contacts are not required. The non-offending caregiver is expected to be appropriately caring for the child, including being aware of the child's medical and educational needs. The family's privacy will not be invaded further by investigating these areas. If there is cause to suspect a problem, you should follow-up on a case-by-case basis as needed with the child's medical and educational providers to ensure the child's safety and well-being. The safety assessment shall be completed for all safety evaluations. The risk assessment is not required as it involves investigation of the non-offending caregiver. An example of such a scenario is: Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 137A 10 year old female lives with her biological parents. The mother's brother is in town visiting and provided child care for the 10 year old on one occasion while the parents went to the movies. The uncle has no prior sexual abuse history and there were no indicators to sugge st that he is an inappropriate caregiver for children. However, during this child care situation, the uncle fo ndled the 10 year old and told the child that if she disclosed he would do the same thing to her 5 year old sister. When the parents returned home, the 10 year old was able to speak to her parents privately and disclosed what happened. The parents responded by believing the child, calling the police, and ensuring that the uncle did not have access to the children until the police arrived. In this scenario, the parents are not under investigation. C PS is only involved as it relates to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the children. This is done in teamwork with the parents. Collateral contacts with primary medical doctors, educators, and so forth for the family ch ildren will not be completed as there is no reason to suspect concerns in these areas. However, if school pe rsonnel or medical providers may have knowledge of the sexual assault allegations they should still be contacted. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 138SAFETY EVALUATIONS: CHILD SEXUAL ACTIVITY Scope As noted in the Overview of this section, reports of child sexual activity include behaviors, statements, or other indications of developmentally inappropriate sexual knowl edge suggestive of potential child sexual abuse. If more than one child is involved, such activity must have occurred between children with less than a four-year age difference (unless force is involved). Evaluations of such matters do not require an intra-fa milial relationship between the children, nor do the children involved need to live in the District. If the re port alleges that the child sexual activity occurred in the District, CFSA will evaluate for the safety and well-being of the child. If concerns develop during the course of the evaluation regarding any failure to protect or any other maltreatment by a caregiver acting in loco parentis , the evaluation must be converted to an investigation and the appropriate allegations added to FACES. \u008b When working with a \"child on child\" sexual assault evaluation, a prim ary evaluation is taken regarding the family of origin of the alleged perpetrating child (i f one can be determined). It is your responsibility to carefully assess whether the perpetrating child has suffered sexual abuse and/or whether there are any children at risk for being exposed to the perpetrating child. \u008b Under such circumstances, the alleged victim child is assessed as a collateral source of information to the evaluation. \u008b Both you and your management team have the discretion to determine whether the situation warrants further intervention, and/or whether to enter a companion evaluation or investigation regarding the victim child's family of origin. Evaluation Lead As a general rule, the MPD Youth Investigations Division detective who is assigned to a sexual abuse evaluation also takes the lead in assessing the reported child sexual activity. \u009a As discussed earlier, there is a standing agreement be tween CFSA and MPD that if an alleged perpetrator lives in the home with an alleged victim, or has regular access to the child, that they will immediately conduct joint evaluations, particularly if there is immediate or potential danger to the child. \u009a Upon assignment of an evaluation related to child sexual activity, you should determine if there is immediate danger to the child and/or whether it is necessary to contact YID for a joint evaluation. \u009a Reminder : alleged perpetrators may also be minors who live in the same home and may pose an equal level of danger. \u009a Since the response times for CPS evaluations and MPD evaluations do not always coincide, it may be challenging to begin a child sexual activity evaluation without an assigned detective. \u009a When you are not able to conduct a joint evaluation because a detective has not been assigned, you should avoid direct discussion about the allegations with the caregivers or child (ren). Doing so may compromise a future police investigation by prematurely disclosing sensitive information. \u009a Ideally, the child (ren) should be interviewed at school or at any other neutral environment. Special note: if the children cannot be interviewed in a neutral environment and must be interviewed at home, Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 139the specific allegations should not be immediately discussed with the caregiver . Explain simply that the Agency has received a complaint regarding the safety and well-being of the child (ren) and you are obliged to assess the safety and well-being of the family in general. \u009a The interview of the child (ren) should follow the components discussed on in the general child interview , including a preventive assessment for sexual abuse. \u009a If the child makes a disclosure during this interview, the police should be contacted to determine what, if any, immediate role they may need to play. \u009a If information about unsafe access between a perpetra tor and a child is discovered during the evaluation, this should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to YID for intervention. MPD may at times determine that the reported allegation does not meet their standard for an investigation. Under these circumstances, you are considered the lead and sole evaluator of the TOT'd allegations. If, however, during the evaluation additional details or alle gations are discovered that may suggest the need for a criminal investigation, these should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to MPD for assessment. Medical Examination A forensic medical examination is not required in child sexual activity evaluations but is recommended. You should ensure that the caregiver for each child is given information on CAPC and you should recommend that the child have a medical examination. Since there are no direct allegations of sexual abuse during a child sexual activity evaluation, you may not necessarily be able to require a caregiver to comply with the request for a medical examination. CAC Interview As noted above, there are no direct allegations of se xual abuse during a child sexual activity evaluation. Therefore a CAC interview may not be required in ever y instance. Nevertheless, the CAC will participate in \"precautionary\" interviews of children in this category if a detective is assigned. Unless there are specific reasons why a CAC interview is not necessary, the CPS worker should arrange for a CAC interview for child sexual activity evaluations. If there is a determination that a fo rensic interview is not necessary this should be discussed with your management team and the assigned detective (if applicable). Historical Allegations When evaluating historical child sexual activity allegati ons, the CFSA social worker should carefully consider what purpose CPS involvement will serve, particularly wh en there is no formal allegation and the Agency will have no authority to substantiate an allegation, even if it is true. Factors for Consideration: o Where does the family currently reside? If the family resides outside of the District, consider a referral to the CPS unit in the appropriate jurisdiction. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 140In such instances, the evaluation will be closed with CFSA although further MPD investigation may occur. o Does any child need supportive services? If the child is stable and there are no other safety fa ctors, an evaluation from CPS may not be warranted. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 141FACES Core Contacts and Assessments Because there are no allegations involved with safety evaluations, the standard medical and educational core contacts are not required. The non-offending parent or ca regiver is expected to be appropriately care for the child, including being aware of the child's medical an d educational needs. The family's privacy will not be invaded further by investigating these areas. If there is cause to suspect a problem, the social worker should follow-up on a case-by-case basis as needed with the child's medical and educational providers to ensure the child's safety and well-being. The safety assessment sha ll be completed for all safety evaluations. The risk assessment is not required as it involves investigation of the non-offending caregiver. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 142SAFETY EVALUATIONS: SUGGESTED SEXUAL ABUSE Scope As a CPS social worker, you are responsible for conducting evaluations even when circumstances are only suggestive of sexual abuse that may have occurred or potentially will occur . Children living under the following situations may be victims of sexual abuse and/or vulnerable to potential sexual abuse: \u009a Exposure to adult sexuality (for the sexual gratification of the perpetrator) \u009a Residing with a sexual offender \u009a Sexual exploitation of the child (pornography, prostitution, etc.) \u009a Other risk factors related to sexual abuse Reports on any of the above situations may be accepted on a case-by-case basis and should be discussed amongst the CPS management prior to acceptance for evaluation. Note: Allegations that a child is exposed to sexual activity (live or simulated) by a caregiver are only taken as sexual abuse safety evaluations IF the alleged perpet rator was intentionally exposing the child for their own sexual gratification. All other matters may be investig ated as general neglect and are handled by traditional units. Evaluation Lead If there is a YID detective assigned to a report that fits the above criterion, the detective will maintain lead responsibility for the evaluation or, if warranted, invest igation. In many instances, such matters are initially evaluated by CPS alone. Medical Examination A medical examination should occur when there is credible reason to believe that a child has been sexually abused or assaulted. Even in instances such as exposure to pornography or a child displaying risk factors related to sexual abuse, a medical examination should still be re commended to the caregiver, even if there is no direct information of sexual abuse or sexual assault. If there are any questions with regard to whether a medical examination is warranted based on the evaluation of this criterion, you should consult with your management team. Special Note : a child should never be transported for a medical examination by the alleged perpetrator of sexual abuse. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 143CAC Interview When there are no direct allegations of sexual abuse or sexual assault, a CAC interview may not be required in every instance where there is a concern for possible or po tential abuse. Nevertheless, the CAC will participate in \"precautionary\" interviews of children in this category when a detective is assigned. Unless there are specific reasons why a CAC interview is not necessary, you should plan to arrange for a CAC interview when evaluating possible sexual abuse reports. If there is a determination that a forensic interview is not necessary, but there are other concerns, these should be discussed with your mana gement team and the assigned detective (if applicable). Historical Allegations Historical concerns of possible child sexual abuse or sexu al assault shall be handled on a case-by-case basis and assessed by CPS management, prior to assignment for evaluation. FACES Core Contacts and Assessments Because there are no allegations associated with safety evaluations, the standard medical and educational core contacts are not required. The non-offending parent or caregiver is expected to be an appropriate caregiver for the child, including being aware of the child's medical and educational needs. The fa mily privacy will not be invaded further by investigating these areas. If there is any cause to suspect a problem, you should fo llow-up on a case-by-case basi s as needed with a child's medical and educational providers to ensu re the child's safety and well-being. The safety assessment shall be completed for all safety ev aluations. The risk assessment is not required as it involves investigation of the non-offending caregiver. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 144INSTITUTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS Abuse and neglect are traumatizing to children at all times but when it happens to a child who has been placed in out-of-home care, it is an egregious violation that deserves serious attention. All Hotline reports that allege abuse or ne glect at facilities that are licensed or certified by the District of Columbia are \"institutional abuse\" referrals and will be investigated by CFSA's Institutional Investigations unit. When investigating institutional abuse, you will conduct the investigation in one or more of the following settings: \u009a Emergency care facilities \u009a Licensed or temporarily-licensed resource homes in the District \u009a Independent living programs \u009a Runaway shelters \u009a Youth group homes \u009a Youth shelters \u009a Any other out-of-home facility that provides custodial care, including daycare centers, before and after-care programs, hospitals, residential faci lities, acute psychiatric care facilities, and/or all other licensed facilities that provide direct care and/or supervision of children and youth REMEMBER: institutional abuse includes physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent or maltreatment of a child by any individual at the facility or resource home who is responsible for a child's out- of-home care, including one or more of the following providers: \u009a The child's foster parent \u009a An employee or staff person of a public or private residential home or facility \u009a Other persons legally responsible for the child's welfare in a residential setting \u009a Any CFSA staff person providing out-of-home care General Guidelines An investigation of institutional abuse requires the same cooperation, teaming, and sharing of accessible information as that which occurs betwee n CPS and all other CFSA administrations during any other investigation, including but not limited to team ing with contracted-agency staff and CFSA staff responsible for licensing, monitoring, placement, and program operations. Whenever a Hotline report meets any of the following criteria, the institutional investigation must be initiated immediately : \u009a A child is left alone. \u009a A child is left with inadequate supervision. \u009a A child is in immediate danger. \u009a Priority Level I report ( see Procedure F: Priority Criteria of Hotline Policy ). Note: for all Priority I reports, the CPS institutional inves tigator must contact the Metropolitan Police Department's Youth Investigations Division (Y ID) to coordinate a joint investigation. When you receive an assignment to investigate an institutional abuse report, you must immediately notify the CFSA staff member responsible for monit oring the private agency, or licensing the facility Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 145(including youth shelters, runaway shelters, emerge ncy care facilities, and youth group homes). You must team and coordinate the investigation (to the be st of your ability) with that assigned monitor or licensing specialist. Note: If the facility is not licensed by CFSA, you should contact and notify the appropriate licensing agency of the report and concerns related to the safety of children in placement. When appropriate and practical, yo u can arrange a joint investigation. REMINDER: if any report of abuse or neglect is identified as having a Priority Level I response, you may proceed independently of the monitor or licensing specialist (if they are unavailable) but you must contact YID . Procedures \u009a When investigating foster homes, notify the Contract Monitoring and Performance Improvement Administration (CMPIA) and inform the appropriate monitor of the investigation, sharing all necessary information, and jointly coor dinating the investigation. If the monitor is unavailable for a joint investigation, you must inform the assigned supervisor and request follow-up from the monitor within 24 hours. \u009a When investigating facilities, noti fy the Facilities Licensing Unit in the Office of Planning, Policy, and Program Support and follow the same procedures as #1 above. The li censing specialist, if unavailable, must confer with you within 24 hours. \u009a For all Priority I investigations that were not held jointly, you must schedule and convene a meeting within 48 hours of the investigation to sh are information with either CMPIA staff or the Facilities Licensing Unit. \u009a If there are no removals during investigations of institutional abuse, the assigned monitor or licensing specialist shall make weekly visits to the home or facility where allegations are reported. \u009a During the course of the investigation, as the institutional investigative social worker, you should continually team with the monitor or licensing specialist to review case notes, interviews, and other records to jointly assess the information. \u009a When you have made your disposition decision after in vestigating a facility, the licensing specialist will have 5 days to issue a separate report with recommendations for any proposed licensing actions. SPECIAL NOTE : during an investigation, the resource home or facility will be placed on hold for receipt of any additional children. Removals If you have been unable to jointly inv estigate an instituti onal abuse report, and you have decided to remove a child or youth from the home or facility , you must notify the ass igned monitor or licensing specialist of the removal, and th e basis for the decision as well as any additional concerns regarding the safety and well being of the other children placed with the provider. When applicable, the monitor or licensing specialist shall be inv olved in the development of a safety plan. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 146 If the child(ren) are removed from a foster home, th e ongoing social worker must notify the resource parents of their right to a fair hearing. Notification may be oral or in writing and take place within 24 hours of the emergency removal. Prior to an adju dication of neglect, non- emergency removals can not take place until there has been at least 48 hour s of notice. After an adjudication of neglect, non- emergency removals can not take plac e prior to 10 days of notice and if the foster parent requests a Fair Hearing, the removal may not take place until after the Fair Hearing. Written Reports of Institutio nal Investigation Findings \u009a You must complete a written report within 30 days detailing the invest igation findings. \u009a Notification of Disposition and Fair hearings must be sent to the alleged perpetrator(s) within seven (7) calendar days ( see CFSA Fair Hearings Policy ). \u009a The monitor or licensing specialist shall discuss the investigation findings with the foster parent(s) or facility administrator, as appropriate, wi thin 5 business days of the notification of the investigation findings. \u009a You should send a copy of the written report with the disposition to the ongoing social worker and the child-placing agency or facility administrator. \u009a The ongoing worker will be responsible for notify ing the caregiver and the guardian ad litem, including where the incident occurred and those who were involved. \u009a If any licensing action was taken, the licensing specialist will be responsible for forwarding this information to the ongoing worker, the caregiver, and the guardian ad litem. Disposition Staffings Disposition staffings are convened at the end of the institutional investigation in order to share the findings of the investigation and discuss any lingering concerns rega rding the child who was the subject of the report or any other children placed within that placement resource. The staffing provides a forum for shared decision-making and serves as a ve hicle for developing a corrective and/or safety plan. When the facility or resource home is licensed by CFSA, a disposition staffing will be held within thirty (30) days of acceptance of the report in or der to review the findings of the investigation. The Institutional Investigations supervisor is re sponsible for chairing the disposition staffing and notifying the following individuals of the staffing date and location: \u009a Institutional Investigations worker \u009a Licensing specialist \u009a Monitor \u009a CFSA General Counsel and/or OAG attorney designee(s), if appropriate \u009a On-going supervisor \u009a On-going social worker Attendees at the disposition staffing wi ll participate in the following activities: a. Discuss the results of the investigation. b. Review the child(ren)'s current placement(s) and determine whether any change in placement is required to protect the ch ild(ren)'s safety and health. c. Review the contract status and id entify any additional steps to be taken to protect the child or other children placed in the same setting. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 147d. Discuss the facility's compliance with applicable District of Columbia Municipal Regulations. e. Determine whether and when to take action concerning the license or the contract. POPULATION SPECIFIC INVESTIGATION CONSIDERATIONS Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 148ASSESSING CHILDREN AGES 0-3 Infants and very young children (ages 0-3) are at the hi ghest risk for life-long emot ional, mental, and physical problems when they are victims of abuse or neglect, homelessness, domestic violence, and/or prenatal exposure to drugs or alcohol. Given their high vulnerability, it is imperative that you conduct a thorough assessment of their safety and well-being. As a required practice, comprehensive assessments must take place, and must include direct observation of the child. You should take a close look at their medical history as well as any other additional needs. CFSA's Administrative Issuance, CFSA-05-5Referral of Supported Child Ab use/Neglect Cases to the Early Care and Education Administration , offers the following guidance: \u009a Refer each child (who is under 3 years of age and re siding in the household) for a 0-3 screening within 72 hours of a substantiated investigation. \u009a Complete the 0-3 Early Intervention Screening Referral Form and manually forward the form to OCP with a hard copy maintained in the child's case record. The following steps will guide your assessments of safety and risk for children 0-3 and help you to determine appropriate interventions and service needs: \u009a Gather the child's birth information. \u009a Caregivers Information o Assess the role of the mother/other female adults relating to the child. o Determine if mother received prenatal care and whether the child was exposed to drugs, alcohol or medication during pregnancy. (Seek a substanc e abuse consult if the mother has used or you suspect she continues to use drugs or alcohol. Assess the role of the father/other male adults relating to the child. \u009a Assess the caregiver capacity to care for the infant. \u009a Gather information about the child's general care and development: o Primary caregiver o Size & development o Feeding o Sleeping arrangements (Inform the caregiver that \"c o-sleeping\" with the baby is very dangerous and that a baby can be hurt or suffoca ted if an adult rolls over the child.) Remember: Babies must sleep on their backs on a firm mattress without pillows or stuffed toys or blankets near the babies face! (Please see the section that follows on The Dangers of Co-sleeping .) o Child care/supports Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 149How to \"Interview\" a Baby Source: the City of New York \"The Babies Can't Wait\" Advisory Committee (2005) Special Considerations in Interviewing an Infant What to look for when Providing a Quality Assessment of an Infant 1. The infant must be observed AWAKE, without any external distractions. It is NEVER sufficient to observe a sleeping infant. 2. Developmental Milestones \u009a Is the infant on target with his/her developmental milestones? 3. Physical Appearance a. Physical condition of the baby: skin, eyes, etc. b. Breathing: does it appear normal or labored? c. Is the infant average in size for his/her age? d. Does the baby move all four limbs? e. How alert is the baby? f. Any obvious disabilities? g. How does the baby smell? h. Are his/her clothes clean? i. Is the sleeping area clean and safe? j. Does the baby have a crib? 4. Interaction between infant, caregiver(s), and others in the home \u009a Do they respond to the babies interactions? How? \u009a How does the baby respond to the caregiver? \u009a Do the caregiver and baby look at each other? \u009a Does the baby appear comforted when the caregiver picks him/her up? \u009a Do the caregiver/others make positive statements about the baby? \u009a Does the caregiver smile when talking about the baby? \u009a Does the baby cry, smile or laugh? \u009a How does the caregiver respond to the cries? \u009a Can the caregiver differentiate between the types of cries and recognize what each cry expresses? \u009a Does the baby react to toys and other objects? \u009a Is he/she socially responsive? \u009a Does the baby have a regular eating and sleeping schedule? Early Intervention Red Flags for Children 0-3: 1. Physical \u009a Child does not use both sides of body equally or favors one side \u009a Child is awkward and trips a lot \u009a Child 12 months and older seems unable to hold onto things \u009a Child 18 months and older is not walking confidently 2. Speech \u009a By 7 months , no signs of cooing or babbling \u009a By 12 months , doesn't have a few single words \u009a By 2 years , not verbalizing \"dat\" or pointing to what he/she wants \u009a By 2 years , doesn't have any short sentences or word combinations \u009a By 2 years , can say word, but doesn't use them to talk to people 3. Adaptive \u009a Difficulty eating: Losing fluid when sucking, gagging, refusing certain textures \u009a Difficulty sleeping (excessive sleeping, lethargy, night terrors, rigidity, tenseness) \u009a Extreme sensitivity to certain experiences, like bathing, dressing (sensory integration problems) 4. Cognitive \u009a By 6 months , does not shake, bang, drop, and/or mouth objects \u009a By 9 months , does not turn when name is called or to locate a sound \u009a By 12 months , does not containerize or put 2 things together \u009a By 24 months , does not use 2 word phrases \u009a By 24-30 months , no simple pretend play \u009a By 30 months , not able to match shapes: circle, triangle, etc. \u009a By 36 months , not able to feed him/her self 5. Social/Emotional \u009a Cannot be consoled \u009a Does not make eye contact Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 150 The American Academy of pediatrics does not recommend co- sleeping with an infant in the first year of life. \u009a Appears expressionless, or is inappropriately friendly \u009a Injures self (scratching/biting/head banging) The Dangers of Co-sleeping Co-sleeping with an infant is very dangerous! It puts the infant at high risk of accidental death due to suffocation. This may happen when caregivers accidentally roll over onto their infant or the infants suffocate in the bedding or pillows. We understand that caregivers ma y want to keep their babies close to them at night to make it easier for them to access their infants quickly for night feedings. We also know that some caregivers may not have a separate bassinet or crib for their infant. Even still, we strongly recommend that caregivers NEVER sleep in the same beds as their baby! As an alterative, caregivers may place the infant in a traditional bassinet or portable crib that is placed right next to the caregiver's bed. This way, the ba by is in a safe sleeping place yet close enough for bonding and monitoring. For those families who do not have a safe sleeping space for their baby, please consult with your management team for guidance. NOTE: Given the number of infant related fatalities as a result of co-sleeping this point cannot be emphasized enough!Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 151ASSESSING CHILDREN WITH KNOWN/POTENTIAL EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS Child Development and Special Service Needs As a CPS social worker, you MUST understand child development milestones in order to recognize what may be missing in the development of the children during your a ssessments. You are not expected to conclude that a child's developmental lag is serious but you must recognize when the child needs further evaluation or specialized treatment. Assessing Children with Exceptional Needs Children with exceptional needs include those with physical, emotional and/or mental disabilities. Some of these disabilities may present as physical or mental delays, blindness, hearing impairments, mobility challenges, dependency, be havior management problems, emotio nal difficulties, etc. Children with exceptional needs are also vulnerable children, more so than a wholly healthy child. Specifically, child vulnerability refers to a child's capacity for self-pro tection. If the child has a diagnosis or condition, you must describe it in detail in your notes. Children with Exceptional Needs: Special Areas of Consideration Communication - How does the child best communicate? Verbally? Visually? Through a communication board? Drawing? Frequently, receptive skills are higher than expressive skills, therefore it is important speak with someone who knows the child's skill levels. Mobility - What are the child's mobility capabilities? Can th e child get around on his or her own? What is the level of freedom of movement? Dependency - Is the child solely dependent on the care of someone else? Lifelong dependency may cause a child to be trusting and less likely to question care or requests. The child may have become accustomed to others providing personal care, therapy or some other type of assistance and being in a position of authority. As a result, the child may confuse exploitation with appropriate care. Compliance- Children who require specialized care or supervision are sometimes rewarded for being compliant. Assertiveness or self-advocacy may not be encouraged. Be aware that sexual interest and development for children in the mild and moderate range s of developmental disabilities occurs at about the same time it occurs in typical peers. Lack of skills in protecting oneself from sexual abuse may place the child at risk. Cognition- Sometimes it may be difficult for a child to identify or understand a situation in a way that represents what actually happened. The challenge may involve process or language, or the child may not understand the nature of the situation (e.g., a child re quiring personal care may have difficulty identifying exploitive touch). Isolation- The circle of friends and outside acquaintances may be limited and activity-driven, thus limiting the opportunity for the child to have people in whom to confide. If a child has been the victim of someone who is familiar, there may be fear of retaliation. If the child has few contacts, even the loss of someone who may have harmed him/her can be frightening. Behavior Control- Behavior is a means of communication. Some behavior controls are psychotropic medication, isolation from others, or the use of other types of restraints. If there are concerns or doubts Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 152 Engaging Caregivers who have Developmental Delays As a CPS social worker, you may receive a referral for a caregiver who has developmental disabilities. Do not be misguided into thinking or assuming that people with cognitive disabilities cannot be adequate parents. This is not the case. Research studies indicate that most parents with cognitive disabilities have unique combinations of strengths and support needs but they still establish loving bonds with their childr en. It is important to realize that parents with cognitive disabilities share many common problems: \u009a The day-to-day demands of care giving are a commo n challenge for the parent with disabilities. \u009a Parents with cognitive disabilities tend to have some difficulty retaining and correctly applying the information and skills needed for adequate parenting. \u009a Many lack social and play skills and have difficulty with managing money. \u009a For parents who have difficulty in communication and soci al relationships, the effect is seen not only in the parent-child relationships but also in the family's ability to relate to others within the community, including the service systems that become involved in their lives. You must be sure to continue to use your core helping skills and maintain your objectivity when assessing these types of families and the children in the home. Conduct your investigation as you would with other families. The practice guidance below will help you interview caregivers/parents with learning disabilities: \u009a Keep interviews as short as possible. Take a break if the caregiver/parent seems to be losing concentration. \u009a Keep your questions simple and be prep ared to probe the responses given. \u009a Avoid close-ended questions (e.g., ask the parent to describe a situation versus asking the parent a \"yes\" or \"no\" question). Note: many people with a learning disability are eager to please, so be careful not to prompt them with a suggestion or they may agree with what you have said. \u009a Be very patient with the process and allow time for repetition. The D.C. Department of Disability Services (DDS) can he lp with the coordination of all services and supports provided to all qualified persons with intellectual disabilities in the District of Columbia. Please see the appendix for the DDS intake application. You can refer any of the following clients for services: \u009a Any individual who has a diagnosis of mental retardation. \u009a Any individual who has a diagnosis of Down syndrome. about behavioral controls, please consult your supervisor. Credibility- There may be times when some of the indicators of abuse are overlooked because they overlap with the child's disability. For example, a child may be on medication that impacts their affect, resulting in communication challenges that may inad vertently \"cover up\" an indicator.

Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 159 DECISION MAKING AND PLANNING Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 160GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FO R ASSESSING SAFEY & RISK SAFETY VERSUS RISK SAFETY RISK Safety deals with present or imminent danger. Risk is the likelihood that a child may be abused or maltreated in the future. Safety factors pose a threat of immediate or imminent harm. Risk elements identify significant behaviors and circumstances within a family unit that create different levels of risk to the child. Safety factors pose a threat of serious harm. Risk may be very high even if the report is unfounded; conversely, risk may be low even if the report is substantiated. In order to control for safety , there must be an assessment of the need for immediate interventions, the vulnerabilities of the child(ren), as well as strengths, resources or protective capacities present in the family. Risk may be reduced with appropriate services, changes in the caregiver's behavior, and family/community support. To support the Agency's goal of safety, permanency and well-being for children and their families, two assessments are completed during the course of every CPS investigation: (1) SAFETY and (2) RISK . SAFETY, which deals with present or imminent danger, is assessed every time you interact with a child or family throughout the investigation. The safety assessment process is documented in FACES and will be detailed in your contacts and/or assessment notes. RISK is the likelihood that a child may be abused or maltreated in the future. The Structured Decision Making (SDM) risk assessment tool assesses families for low, mode rate, high, or intensive probabilities of future abuse and/or neglect. These risk levels, along your clinical judgment, guide the decision whether or not to open a case, whether to refer the family to a collaborative, or whether to close an investigation with no further services. THE SAFETY ASSESSMENT You are required to complete the safety assessment at the onset of an investigation in order to determine the immediate threat or danger of harm to the child. In addition to the signs of present danger, the safety assessment will identify the caregiver's protecti ve capacities and the child vulnerabilities. The initial Safety Assessment must be completed within 24 hours of the time of intake at hotline. Please reference the documentation section for additional details on completing this assessment in FACES. Remember: \u0083 Safety decisions must be made for each child participating in the household. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 161\u0083 Decisions may differ for each child depending on the allegations and circumstances. \u0083 A safety decision should be completed within 24 hours of the report EVEN if no contact has been established. \u0083 Keep in mind that you can submit a referral to th e Healthy Families Thriving Communities Collaborative (HFTCC) referrals at any point during the course of the investigation. These referrals can be made regardless of whether the allegations are Unfounded or Substantiated. Note : The HFTCC are now accepting referrals in which the allegations are unfounded yet the SDM Level is high or intensive . Note: The provision of services or other assistance to the child's family takes place throughout all child welfare intervention, including CPS. Please do not delay any needed referrals for services or support to the family to the HFTCC or other government agencies or community based service providers. Safety is assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the life of an investigation or Agency case. Since you are assessing safety every time you see a child or family, the FACES safety assessment allows for updates. Every safety assessment update should be documented in FACES within 24 hours of the change in assessment. Signs of Present Danger In consideration of safety you must assess for signs of present danger. Remember that a sign of present danger is defined as a reasonable cause to believe that a child is, has recently, or could be in the near future in immediate danger of serious harm. The sign of present danger does not need to be occurring in your immediate presence but when considering it, you should keep in mind the incident(s) or concern(s) that prompted your involvement with the family. Remember that signs of present danger ar e not always fault-based; th ey are simply a reflection of the level of danger posed to a child. ( For additional information on signs of present danger, see Safety Planning & Interventions ). EXAMPLE #1 A 2-year-old child is found wandering in the street without supervision. Neighbors contact the police, who respond and call for CPS assistance. By the time the CPS worker responded the mother was located and able to provide care. In this instance, there was a sign of present danger in that the young, vulnerable child was without appropriate adult supervision. Remember that the safety decision will always be based on your assessment of a number of factors, including th e parent's protective capacities and the child vulnerabilities. (See signs of present danger under the Safety Assessment Criteria in the appendices). The caretaker appears to be unable to provide proper care or control of the child's immediate needs for sufficient supervision... to protect the chil d from immediate danger of serious harm.) EXAMPLE #2 A 4-year-old arrives at school with a black eye. The sc hool fails to report this information to CFSA until two weeks later. The child then discloses that her mother had punched her in the eye because she Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 162spilled her milk. The school staff confirms witnessing the injury and when you interview the child, she also confirms that she was injured. By the time you observe the child, however, the injury is no longer visible because of the delay in reporting. Here you have a credible reason to believe that the child suffered from an injury inflicted by his parent. (See sign of present danger #1- a child has received se rious physical harm or injury that appears to be inflicted.) The safety decision will, again, be based on your overall assessment of a number of factors, including the parent's protective capacities and the child vulnerabilities. If you have any concerns regarding the potential level of danger and/or you are not certain whether it is imminent, you should consult with your management team. Protective Capacities Protective capacities are the ability and willingness to utilize internal and external resources to mitigate or ameliorate the identified safety and risk concerns and to support the ongoing safety of the child. A protective capacity is a specific quality that can be observed and understood to be part of the way a caregiver thinks and feels that makes him or her protective. For example, ther e may be a non-offending caregiver in the home who is able to supervise interaction with the offending caregiver, provided that the offending caregiver does not pose a danger by his/her mere presence. Protective capacities are distinguished from controlling or supplementing safety interventions by the fact that interventions suggest a specific action or actions that were taken to protect the child. For example, if a non-offending caregiver chooses to protect their child by removing the offending caregiver from the home, s/he would have exercised a safety intervention. While it is tr ue that this caregiver likely has significant protective capacities, it was actually the safety intervention that protected the child. Safety Decisions A safety decision is ultimately your conclusion as to whether the child is in immediate danger of serious harm and what is protecting the child, either through mi tigating factors and family strengths, or by prompt interventions put in place by CPS to control safety threats. All of the information you gather during the safety assessment will be used to support this decision. Keep the following decision options in mind as you plan your investigation and assessment: \u009a No signs of present danger were identified at this time. Based on currently available information, the child(ren) is/are not likely to be in immediate danger of serious harm. \u009a One or more signs of present danger were iden tified, however, the child(ren) is/are not in immediate danger of serious harm and/or the existe nce of protective capacities offset the threat of serious harm for the child(ren). \u009a One or more signs of present danger were iden tified, which place the child(ren) in immediate danger of serious harm, and controlling and/or supplementing safety interventions have Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 163been initiated. With these controlling or suppleme nting safety interventions, the child(ren) will remain in the home at this time. \u009a One or more signs of present danger were iden tified, which place the child(ren) in immediate danger of serious harm and removal to foster care or an alternative placement (or continued placement) is the only controlling safety intervention possible for the child(ren). \u009a One or more signs of present danger were iden tified, which place the child(ren) in immediate danger of serious harm, but caregiver(s) has refu sed access to the child(ren) or fled, or child(ren)'s whereabouts are unknown. Appropri ate legal/investigative actions are being taken. Thorough documentation of your safety decision is key . The safety decision must specifically document WHY there is or is not imminent danger (based partly on allegations) or how the immediate danger has been ameliorated. You must explain what information you considered in coming to your decision and, if applicable, indicate any next steps related to safety. Pointers for Safety Decisions At times there will be no immediate sign of present danger (such as when it is clear that the allegation is untrue or when a child is safely hospitalized but could be in danger when discharged). You must select the safety decision that is appropriate at the time you are comp leting the assessment and then update the decision as needed. Remember that many of the safety factors have a caveat that indicates that a certain condition or behavior (substance abuse, violence, etc.) suggests that the child is in immediate danger of serious harm. In most situations, you need to associate the concern that caus ed or could cause serious harm with the impact or potential impact on the child. When a child is removed, documentation of the safety deci sion is critical. The Agency must provide a legal basis for this decision and therefore, it is your responsibili ty to delineate why removal was the best possible option. As noted above, even when you have not located some or all of the family, the safety assessment must be completed within 24 hours of receipt of the Hotline call. At times, the safety decision will indicate that there are potentially immediate safety factors and that a child or children has not been able to be accessed. You must clearly indicate additional next steps to locate an d assess the child, including possible legal action. SAFETY PLANNING AND INTERVENTIONS Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 164At times during the course of investigating allegations of abuse and neglect, you will find safety concerns for a child. The information presented below will assist you in determining when and how you can create a safety plan. Within a safety plan, specific ac tions will be outlined, and the parent or caregiver will be held accountable for the fulfillment of those actions to protect the child in the home. In the event that a \"sign of present danger\" puts the child at risk for imminent harm by a caregiver, this section will discuss all of your options for safety planning. As the CPS investigator, you must always address immediate concerns of serious harm to a child. But since no case circumstance is exactly alike, it is critical for the well-being of the child and the family that you tailor the intervention and the safety plan to the individual circumstances. Safety decisions must always be discussed with your dire ct supervisor or member of your management team. If you become involved in a situation in which a child or children may be in immediate danger you must contact your management team for consultation prior to leavi ng the scene, unless your own physical safety is in jeopardy. When a child is left in a potentially unsafe situ ation, even for a short period of time, most importantly it does not protect the child. It also sends a mixed me ssage about the exact severity of the safety concern and may allow for the child's whereabouts to become unknown or be taken out of the jurisdiction. REMINDER: All safety interventions must be clearly document ed in FACES on the safety assessment screen and in the contact notes. Please remember that a \"sign of present danger\" does not automatically mean that a child must be removed from the home. It does mean that you must ensure that the sign of present danger is mitigated, and thus that the child is safe. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 165 CFSA has specific practice guidelines regarding safety pla nning with caregivers. The first consideration is to ensure the safety of the children and the second is to protect th e rights of the child's parents or caregivers. If CFSA has determined that a caregiver is \"unsafe\", the caregiver cannot make a safety plan for the child. One or more of the following several reasons may also prevent participation of the parent: \u009a Lack of court involvement may prevent safety planning because without it, the Agency cannot exert legal authority for telling a caregiver where their child must live or stay. Part of safety planning is the ability to dictate certain restrictions for the child's living environment. \u009a Once a caregiver has already created an unsafe situation for the child, it is presumed that the caregiver will not, cannot, or may not make a safe and appropriate decision for the child's care. \u009a If the Agency cannot for whatever reason ensure long- term follow-up to the plan, services to support the plan, and/or the future safety of the child, it will not include the caregiver in safety planning. Determinations of an \"Unsafe\" Parent or Caregiver The first decision you must make when determining whether the parent is \"safe\" or \"unsafe\" for involvement in the safety planning process is whether or not the child is or would be in danger while under the direct care of the parent. Please refer to the safety planning flow char t in the appendix. When you make such determinations, you must be aware that there are certain situations in which a parent may be a safe caregiver for one child but for not another (e.g., when one child has been physically abused but other children are not similarly situated and therefore not in danger). The following examples appl y to caregivers who have been deemed as \"unsafe\" and are therefore not considered appropriate for involvemen t in the safety planning process (i.e., the child may be removed from the home): \u009a The child's caregiver is determined to be the direct cause of imminent danger to that child. In this situation, the caregiver shall not be allowed to create a safety plan that avoids removal. \u009a There is a lack of lucid reasoning on the part of the caregiver. Causes may include drug use, alcohol use, and/or mental health concerns. In those situations, if there are imminent safety concerns, a removal must occur. \u009a The parent has been arrested and is therefore \"unabl e\" to care for their child, thus creating a sign of present danger. If a caregiver is arrested for any crime related to child safety or crimes against children, they are not considered a safe caregiver. These crimes may include (but are not limited to) any of the following charges: \u009a Child cruelty charge (e.g., First, Second or Third-Degree charges, Attempted Assault, etc.) \u009a Simple assault on the child \u009a Domestic dispute in which the child is injured or exposed \u009a Any other arrest related to child abuse or negl ect (such as driving a car with a child who is Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 166not placed in a proper safety seat) Other crimes that would not inherently constitute a th reat to a child's safety may cause a safety concern due to the situation. For example, driving under the influence would not immediately warrant safety concern for children but it would constitute a safety concern if the children were in the car. Another example would be possession with intent to distribute drugs in the presence of the children or in the home where the children normally reside. There may be exceptions to this general rule, such as when the arrest is related to only one child and the other children are therefore not considered to be in danger. In these situations, you should consult with your management team and CFSA's legal department regarding whether safety plans can be put into place with the parent's participation. \u009a There will also be situations during your investigatio ns when a parent is not arrested but you believe, based on your assessment that the child would not be sa fe to remain with the caregiver. This might be a situation where the caregiver has physically or sexua lly abused the child, or the parent has failed to protect the child, or a neglect concern has put the child in immediate danger of serious harm. In any of these situations, if the child is believed to be unsafe and no safety plan can be put into place, then the child should be removed . Your decision regarding safety planning may be different when there is another parent and/or legal caretaker for that child, who may or may not live in the home. When assessing whether the other parent or legal guardian can provide care, one of the determinations that should be made is whether that parent is a legal parent, i.e., their parental rights are intact, and their names are on the child's birth certificate, and/or they have been legally determined in court. You must fully assess the individual to determine if the children would be safe in their care. This assessment must include all aspects of child safety. This MUST also include an assessment of their knowledge of the abuse and/or neglect allegation that was reported to have occurred in the home of the other caregiver. Note : a caregiver who has knowledge of abuse or neglect but who does not take action to remediate the abuse or neglect is not an appropriate caregiver for safety pla nning purposes. If you determine that the other parent or legal guardian is not a safe and appropriate caregiver, you should explain to them that they will be assigned an attorney at the initial hearing, that they should attend, and that they can discuss custody with their attorney. REMINDER: If you decide that a child must be removed, you cannot place a child with an unlicensed caregiver . If there is a friend or family member who is a licensed foster caregiver, you may consider placing a child with them provided that the foster placement is available an d the Placement Services Administration has authorized the placement. Sometimes, during the Family Team Meeting (FTM) after th e removal, the family will attempt to create a plan for the child to reside with another individual. Again, no child can be placed with an unlicensed caregiver . The Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 167proposed caregiver must apply for licensing as a tempor ary foster care provider. The caregiver from whom the child has been removed can no longer make a plan. Determinations of a \"Safe\" Parent or Caregiver Even when arrests are involved, a caregiver may be considered safe if the crimes are non-violent and are not related to child safety (e.g., driving with a suspended li cense, use of drugs outside of the home, failure to pay moving violations or parking tickets, etc.). Thus, generally , these caregivers can plan for their child(ren)'s safety at the time of their arrest. If, however, the Agency has open involvement with the family (either an investigation or a case), then CFSA must ensure that the home environm ent where the child is staying is appropriate. If it is not, the child can and should be removed. If there is a secondary caregiver in the home, you must assess that person's role in caring for the children PRIOR to the event that resulted in the arrest or unsafe situation. If that person is found to be acting in loco parentis, it is possible that the secondary caregiver can take responsi bility for the children. You must assess to see if the secondary caregiver is appropriate. Both the primary and secondary caregivers MUST be in agreement with the secondary caregiver caring for the children. You must also consider the length of time that the secondary caregiver would conceivably be assuming parental resp onsibilities and determine whether this affects the appropriateness of the plan. In order to participate in the safety planning process, the caregiver must not be subject to any of the \"unsafe\" descriptions listed earlier in this section. For example, if the primary or secondary caregiver is not lucid and therefore unable to agree to the plan, the plan cannot be made. The exception is if the secondary caregiver is the biological or legal caregiver. Then, if that person is an appropriate and willing caregiver, the children may be left in their home. You must still assess whether the primary caregiver will return to the home, and whether the plan is appropriate. At times, you may assess a child to be safe with their parent but both the parent and you believe that an intervention for the child will improve their well-being. At those times, the parent may want to safety plan for the child to stay with a relative or at a community ag ency. These situations allow for the parent and child to \"take a break\" from internal family stressors. Because yo u believe that the child is safe to remain with their parent, the parent is allowed to plan, and you can assist with the planning. At other times, you may assess that a child is not safe in their home environment, but would be safe with their caregiver outside of the home environment. Examples of this might be a home that is in a deplorable condition or does not have utilities. Even though there may be ne glect occurring because a parent has failed to pay utilities or failed to ensure a clean home environment, the child is not in danger with their parent. The parent can plan for themselves and their children to move to a safe location. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 168Other Factors to Consider When determining if a safety plan can be created with a family, there are other factors to consider: \u009a Does the family have a prior history with CFSA or another jurisdiction's child welfare agency? o If the family does have prior history, and safety plans and/or interventions have been put into place in the past, you need to determine if it is appropriate to continue safety planning or if the child needs to be removed. \u009a Is the parent cooperative? \u009a Does the parent acknowledge the safety concerns and/or admit responsibility? \u009a Is the child fearful of remaining in the home? \u009a Is the parent capable of following the safety plan? o For example, if the parent is a chronic substance abuser or has significant mental health concerns, even if they are lucid at the time you create the safety plan with them, they may not be able to follow the plan for any period of time. \u009a Is there a reason to believe that due to Agency involvement, the child would be in danger if left in the home? o For instance, in some cases, parents become angry because their child has disclosed information related to abuse or neglect. Even with a safety plan, when CFSA has left the home, the parent might be very angry and harm the child. Remediating Neglect with Safety Plans In many cases, neglect concerns can be remediated by the provision of resources and services. The following list offers ways in which causes of neglect can be remedied through a safety plan with the family to avoid removal and protect the child. This list is not exhaustive and should be used only as a guide. Special Note: there may be times when the following interventions are not appropriate. For example, an intervention may have been put into place in the past but was not effective on a long-term basis. You must use your clinical judgment along with input from your management team to determine if these interventions should be implemented. Such determinations are not to conclude the disposition of the allegation. Neglect Allegation Possible Plans or Service Provision Other Considerations Inadequate Food Grocery Vouchers, Food Bank Information, BudgetingHow often does this happen? Is it due to poor budgeting? Do the parents have limited income and are not receiving assistance? Is the parent using their money or food stamps to buy alcohol, drugs or other non-necessity items? Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 169Inadequate Shelter (e.g., deplorable housing) Homemaker services, family will stay in a shelter or hotel Is the poor housing condition the fault of the parent or the landlord? Does the parent make efforts to ensure appropriate housing? SMedical Neglect Immediate Medical Care What is the reason for the neglect? Exposure to Criminal Activity Notify law enforcement Is the parent committing the crime? Is there someone else in the home? Does the home belong to someone else? Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 170WRITTEN SAFETY PLANNING A safety plan must be written and consist of the following sections: \u009a The name(s) of the child(ren) who are at risk due to the unsafe situation. \u009a Description of the unsafe situation - please note - some caregivers will have difficulty signing a document that indicates they may have caused thei r child to be unsafe. You should write in this section that there are allegations that are in the process of being investigated. \u009a List of responsibilities for the caregiver, for ex ample, \"refrain from using physical discipline\", \"clean up the home within 3 days\", \"move clea ning products to a shelf out of a child's reach\", etc. \u009a List of responsibilities for CFSA, e.g ., provide parenting classes, therapy services, etc. \u009a Consequences for failure to follow the safety plan, e.g., possible removal of the child(ren). \u009a An agreement from any person involved in the child's care regarding the plan. \u009a Signatures: CPS investigator, all caregivers, and the assigned CPS supervisor (upon return to the office). \u009a Overall time frame for the safety plan, e.g., a lleged perpetrator must leave the home until the investigation is complete, etc. Please see the appendix for the general safety plan template. Previous created forms must be discarded and each written safety plan must be customized to the family at hand. Supervisory Approval of the Safety Plan Once you have developed the written safety plan with th e parent's or caregiver's full participation, you should meet with your supervisor to review the plan. Upon appr oval, the supervisor shall sign the plan and the original will be placed in the official hard copy case file . A copy of the plan should be given to the family. Reminder: you are required to receive supervisory approval. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 171THE DISPOSITION DECISION One of the most important decisions you will ever make as a CPS social worker is the disposition decision regarding the reported allegation and any other allega tions uncovered during your investigation. The following information will inform the basis of your determination and MUST be documented clearly in FACES in order to justify your disposition: o child's statements o maltreater's statements o collateral statements o physical evidence o medical findings o records or reports After the completion of a thorough investigation that includes the assessment procedures, you must then determine only one of three possible disposition decisions fo r each allegation and for each child, individually: o substantiated o inconclusive o unfounded Substantiated - You must substantiate an allegation if there is evidence to believe it occurred. The DC Official Code 4-1301.02 indicates that a substantiated report is \"A report made which is supported by credible evidence and is not against the weight of the evidence.\" The decision to substantiate allegation s depends on the answer to this main question: Is there sufficient credible evidence to support the disposition of child maltreatment? N Cd i b lE i d \"i d h i d i h h i l d iChild Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 172Reminder: You may use credible information obtained during the investigation even if you yourself do not observe the maltreatment, e.g., a credible mandated report er informed you that the child had an injury, that the parent was observed punching the child, etc. Inconclusive - The disposition of an allegation should be Inconclusive if there is insufficient credible evidence to substantiate, however, there is some or conflicting info rmation to indicate that the abuse or neglect may have occurred. The DC Official Code defines an Inconclusive re port as a report \"which cannot be proven to be either Substantiated or Unfounded.\" Unfounded - An allegation should be Unfounded if there is insufficient credible evidence to believe that abuse or neglect has occurred. The DC Official Code define s an unfounded report \"as a report which is made maliciously or in bad faith or which has no basis in fact.\" Considerations At times, situations may be resolved during the course of an investigation, either due to the parent making changes or CFSA's interventions. You must determine whether the allegation that was reported should be substantiated based on the evidence of whether the neglect or abuse occurred or was occurring prior to CFSA involvement. Just because the neglect or abuse has been remediated, it does not mean that the disposition should be Unfounded. Special Note: the disposition is ultimately considered an Agency decision, not an individual social worker's decision. Your management team must approve the disposition decision. You may also seek CFSA - OGC assistance after conferring with your management team. You must practice with consistency. As noted above disposition decisions are based on facts and not your emotional response to the situation. There was a historic al option within CPS to \"warn and counsel\" a caregiver who had abused or neglected a child but the matter appear ed to be isolated or the caregiver was remorseful or the finding would impact the caregiver's employment. This option does not exist any longer; specifically for the concern of consistency and fairness in practice. If the fact s of a case warrant substantiation then your decision must be consistent with this. Remember that all caregivers who are subject to an inco nclusive or substantiated finding against them have the option of requesting a Fair Hearing. You must send the st andard paperwork for this process at the conclusion of your investigation, place a copy of the notice letter in th e file and document in contacts that this paperwork has Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 173been sent to the caregiver. Failure to do so may resu lt in the caregivers name being removed from the CPR do to lack of notice. All disposition decisions must be entered into FACES under the Assessment Findings screen. The Results tab is used to note any changes made to dispositions and the re sults of a fair hearing. The Results tab should only be used by social workers to document (via check box) if the investigation was a joint investigation and/or whether criminal proceedings have been initiated. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 174STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING (SDM) RISK ASSESSMENT Risk is the likelihood that a child may be abused or maltreated in the future. The SDM risk assessment tool assesses families for low, moderate, high, or intensive prob abilities of future abuse and/or neglect. These risk levels, along with your clinical judgment and the disposition decision, will guide your decision whether or not to open a case, whether to refer the family to a collaborative, or whether to close an investigation with no further services. The risk assessment must be completed toward the end of the investigation and within 30 days. It is based upon a full assessment of the family and thorough knowledge of the strengths and challenges therein. Note: The risk assessment must be completed on the household that is the primary residence of the child. If the alleged maltreater resides in a different household but continues to function as a caregiver and is entitled and obligated to provide for the safety and well being of a child, a risk assessment on that household should also be completed. If the child is a member of two ho useholds, and both caregivers are identified as alleged perpetrators, a separate family risk assessment must be completed for each household. The risk assessment must be clearly documented in FACES in the risk assessment screens. Your overall documentation should address the prominent risk concerns and any needed services. There are three distinct parts of the risk assessment. All of them must be completed. Remember : You must create your household(s) in order to be able to complete the risk assessment. Risk Assessment Screen \u009a Document all answers to all questions utilizing the he lp tool to clarify definitions in each category \u009a You should be very familiar with the definitions for ea ch multiple choice question in order to accurately assess the risk level. Assessment Narrative \u009a Document Risk Factors in a list format, including those identified on the risk assessment screen and others. \u009a Document family strengths, as appropriate. \u009a Document the family's support system, including father s, relatives, and \"kin.\" This should include what type of support they provide. \u009a Document the overall level of risk. Conclusion \u009a Not accessible until all questions on the risk assessm ent have been answered and the narrative assessment completed. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 175\u009a Document whether or not overrides are applicable. \u009a If a discretionary override is selected, the final risk level will change to one level higher than the scored risk level. Note : if a discretionary override is selected, you must explain why the discretionary override is appropriate. \u009a Request Approval from your Supervisor.

These services may include rehabilitative services, referrals to the Collaboratives, or other communi ty-based services. In some cases, the service may be foster care, if the children are found to be in imminent danger and cannot remain safely in their homes. The information that you obtain in your investigation will guide your decision-making for service provision for the child(ren) and family. Remember: CPS provides services to protect children from the immediate danger of serious harm, and to reduce risk and resolve identified problems and underlying conditions that create risk. The risk level and disposition of allegations determines how and where families can and do receive services. You should make every effort to initiate services that will help protect the children as soon as possible or at least within the 30-day investigation timeframe. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, you or the FSW or the on-going worker must follow up on all service referrals . You must ensure that the referrals were received by the appropriate agency and that there has been outreach to the families. If your clinical judgment determines that additional or different services would benefit the family, you should explore those services with the family and with your management team. If the family chooses not to accept services (assuming that they have that option - see below) , then you do not have to provide additional services. Referrals to the Collaboratives are encouraged as appropri ate to meet the needs of the child and family, and to maintain safety while reducing risk. Note: the federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (C APTA) requires that we refer children ages 0 to 3 for early intervention screening if they have been subjec ts of a substantiated investigation. Within 72 hours of the disposition, you must refer such children to OCP for this referral to Child Find under the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) - Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Division. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 179 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 180 Case Management Health Families Thriving Communities Collaborative Referrals You can submit a referral to the HFTC Collaboratives at any point during the course of the investigation. These referrals can be made regardless of whether the allegations are Unfounded or Substantiated. To refer a client to the Collaborative, please have the family sign a Release of Information form, then fill out the Collaborative Referral form, complete the risk assessmen t and submit this as a packet to the Collaborative Liaison. Agency Cases When you have a risk level that is high and the case is substantiated, you need to generate an open case with CFSA. If the risk is high and the allegations are unfounded, you must offer supportive services to the family but know that these services are voluntary. Document the offer of services and the family response in writing. If you still believe that the family could benefit from th e Collaboratives' services, you may also advise the family that they can seek help from the Collaborative on a walk-in basis. Emergency Services Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 181Collaborative Referrals You can submit a referral to the Collaboratives at any point during the course of the investigation. These referrals can be made regardless of whether the allegations are Unfounded or Substantiated. Note : you cannot refer a case to the Collaborative if the SDM Level is high . To refer a client to the Collaborative, please have the family sign a Release of Information form, then fill out the Collaborative Referral form, complete the risk assessmen t and submit this as a packet to the Collaborative Liaison. At Risk FTM The At Risk FTM is designed to assist the family in maki ng a family plan that will resolve crises and/or prevent the removal of the children. The At Risk FTM allows vari ous family members to express their concerns and with the help of the facilitator and CFSA social worker, come up with a plan to ensure the safety of the children and the stabilization of the family. A referral for an At Risk FTM can be made at any point during the investigation. You must submit the referral on-line. General Referrals While conducting an investigation, you may encounter situations where the family is in need of emergency services and cannot wait until the case is re-assigned to an on-going unit. It is your responsibility to immediately address these needs through a referral of services. These may include, clothing vouchers, food vouchers, mental health services for people in crisis, furniture vouchers, etc. Services referred by the on-going worker may include psychotherapy, housing assistance, mentoring, homemaker services, etc. Remember : these are general considerations that may need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 182 MANAGING REMOVALS Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 183 Reasonable Efforts - any activity that purposefully attempts to protect and preserve the in-home status of a child or a child's goal of reunification. Such efforts may include (but are not limited to) assessing imminent threats to the child's safety, developing alternative methods for in-home safety plans, and/or identifying people and resources to help prevent child placement. REASONABLE EFFORTS As a first course of action, you are required to make reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of children from their families. If there is an immediate threat to the child's safety and well-being, however, CPS works closely with the Office of Placement Services to provide the most suitable and nurturing foster care environment available. Achieving safety, well-being, and perm anency is the final goal for all children. Please refer to the CPS Investigations Policy for more information on reasonable efforts. When conducting an investigation of child abuse or neglect, you must assess whether any child who is at risk should be removed from the home or can be protected by the provision of resources (e.g., making a referral or putting in services to ameliorate the abuse or neglect, etc.). It is important at this point to realize that District law does not specifically define reasonable efforts in regard to the prevention of a child's removal. DC Code \u00a7 4-1301.09a does, however, require the following particulars to be considered (under the section on Reporting Child Abuse and Neglect ): \u009a In determining and making reasonable efforts under this section, the child's safety and health shall be the paramount concern. \u009a Reasonable efforts shall be made to preserve and reunify the family by the Agency, although there are a few exceptions. \u009a These reasonable efforts shall be made prior to the removal of a child from the home in order to prevent or eliminate the need for removing the child, unless the provision of services would put the child in danger. REMOVAL DECISIONS The decision to remove a child from a caregiver is a profound change for a family. This decision must only occur after reasonable efforts have been made to keep the family intact, unless the exigent circumstances negate the need to make such efforts, and a subsequent determination has been made that child vulnerabilities and safety concerns outweigh the protective capacities of the caregiver(s). All decisions to remove a child must be made in consultation with your supervisor, who will also confer with their respective program manager, or the program manager on duty . In the likelihood that the removal decision is being made while you are in the physical presence of the child or children, you should not leave the scene . The very nature of a removal is stressful to all parties and certain potential exists for escalating tensions that may result in additional harm to the child. In many situations, it may be necessary to involve the police. An officer can serve as a witness to the circumstances of the removal as well as provide a level of stabilization. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 184WORKING WITH CAREGIVERS DURING REMOVAL Engagement Treating clients with respect is particularly vital during the removal process. Even under the best of circumstances, a removal will undoubtedly be emotiona lly charged. As the CPS social worker, you are in a unique position for setting the tone for future cooperation between the caregiver and a team of other child welfare professionals. If the caregiver is physically pr esent during the removal, it is important that you use engagement skills, and take appropriate opportunities to highlight the strengths of the family, in spite of the safety concerns. It is equally important that you clea rly identify the reasons for removal and that you make efforts to explain the removal process to the caregiver(s) as much as possible. (If the caregiver is too tense for communication at the time of removal, information should be left with them and follow-up should occur in a timely manner to help the caregiver understand this critic al process.) Throughout the process, continue to build the foundation for a positive working relationship and when appropriate, reaffirm your ultimate goal to reunite the family. Remember: the primary goal in the removal process is always to secure the immediate safety of children and then, as soon as feasible, safely reunite the family. Only in the most severe situations, such as an intra-family homicide or in some cases incest, would a CPS social wo rker not strive initially to ultimately reunite family members. Legal Notification and Discussion All caregivers should be provided with a written Notice to Appear in Family Court . This is a standard form (see appendix X) that should be completed and signed by the CPS social worker. If a caregiver cannot be accessed (due to arrest, unknown whereabouts, etc.) this form should be left at the caregiver's residence. If the situation allows, you should make every effort to begin a discussion with the caregiver regarding the court process. In so doing, you must play the role of advocate to help the caregiver fully comprehend the importance of attending the initial hearing, paying attention, an d understanding their legal rights. At a minimum, the following procedures should be described: \u009a An attorney will be provided to the caregiver or, if they are able, they can hire their own. \u009a The caregiver will have an opportunity to request that the presiding judge hear their side of the events. \u009a Services are available to help their family, but the services are optional. \u009a The judge will make a decision about whether the removal was justified and whether the child(ren) should remain in shelter care. Family Team Meetings All caregivers must receive the standard brochure on the Family Team Meeting process. When explaining or discussing the brochure with the caregiver(s), ask them if there are any potential relatives who may serve as support. Relate any names and contact information to the FTM unit via the FTM referral ( see section on Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 185FACES documentation below ). Be prepared to explain CFSA policy ab out placement with relatives, including the temporary licensing process if applicable. The caregiver must fully understand that placement with relatives cannot occur immediately upon removal unless they are already a licensed foster care provider and must be cleared through CFSA's Placement Services Administration. Talking with the Caregiver about the Children and Obtaining Important Items The caregiver is always considered the expert on the child, even if he or she is facing child maltreatment allegations. If the caregiver is physically present duri ng the removal process, try to learn as much as possible about the child's basic care: \u009a Name and contact information for the child's primar y physician, including status of immunizations, specific health issues, and/or general health care. \u009a Determine if the child has special needs (physical or emotional) and what implications these may have for the child's placement. Depending on the level of special need (wheelchair bound, medically fragile, etc.), you may need to make arrangements for approp riate transportation and care of the child. Confer with your management team in these situations. \u009a Obtain medication (if applicable) from the caregiver and give these to the medical professional who examines the child at the time of removal (see section below on Medical Screening under Taking Children into Protective Custody). If the caregive r refuses to provide medications, this should be documented. \u009a Obtain important paperwork (if possible) regarding the child, including the birth certificate, social security card, and health insurance card. \u009a Obtain information about the child's education, e.g., school enrollment, specialized services or programs (such as tutoring). Special Note: keeping a child's routine in place is one very specific way to reduce additional trauma as the child adjusts to the removal. \u009a Obtain appropriate clothing for the child, if availa ble. (If clothing is significantly deteriorated or otherwise uninhabitable, it should be left behind.) Find out if the school age child(ren) wear uniforms and what the expected attire is for the child(ren). Endeavor to transport the clothing in an appropriate suitcase or other carrier. If clothing cannot be obta ined at home, determine if any emergency clothing can be obtained through CFSA's Partners for Kids in Care (formerly Office of Volunteer Services) or through requesting a CFSA clothing voucher. If the child was interviewed at the Children's Advocacy Center, the child may qualify for a few sets of clothing from that organization. \u009a Determine if the child has any special habits (e.g., a particular bedtime routine) or items (e.g., favorite toy or stuffed animal) that would help ease this transition. Legal Rights of Additional Caregivers If there are legal caregivers for a child from whom the child is not being removed, efforts should be made to locate these caregivers and assess their willingness and capa city to serve as advocates and/or nurturing caregiver figures. This may include absent caregivers or caregivers with limited involvement. All biological parents and/or legal caregivers should be given notice to appear in court if their whereabouts can be determined. When possible, this notification should be given prior to the initial hearing. After the initial hearing, the assigned Assistant Attorney General (AAG) will make arrangements to conduct a diligent search for parties of interest who will need notice of the court proceedings. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 186 Communications between the Caregiver and Child during the Removal Clinical judgment should be used when determining to what extent there should be communication (either in person or via telephone) during the removal process. Special Note : unsupervised contact is to be avoided both for the best interests of the child and to protect the invest igation process. This should be explained to all parties. Any discussion of the investigation at hand should also be avoided. Visitation At the initial court hearing, the presiding judge will de termine whether visitation between the caregiver(s) and child(ren) is appropriate and/or should be supervised. As the CPS social worker who first assessed the family situation and engaged with the child(ren) and caregiver, you should be prepared to make a recommendation on this issue and to provide a supporting rationale. Note: Plea se refer to the visitation Policy for more information. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 187TAKING CHILDREN INTO PROTECTIVE CUSTODY 1. Communicating with Children during Removal \u009a Use a soothing/appropriate voice to put the children at ease. Be genuine. \u009a Use vocabulary that is easy for the children to understand and define words, such as \"placement\", in simple terms. \u009a Help the children understand what is happening and why they are leaving the home, including the reason for placement (as appropriate). Recognize that some information is too complicated for younger children. \u009a Make sure the children understand that emergency placement is not their fault and they are not being punished for anything. \u009a Describe step-by-step events that will take place throughout the placement process. \u009a Use engagement skills to encourage the children to express fears and concerns about placement, and then address them. \u009a Identify the names of the staff the children will enco unter, their job functions, and possible questions the staff may ask children. \u009a Assure the children that their desire or lack thereof, to contact family during the removal will be considered. \u009a Encourage children to bring personal belongings that can be helpful during the transition into care. 2. Medical Screening and/or Medico-Legal Examinations All children entering shelter care must receive a medi cal screening prior to placement. This screening is coordinated through the Healthy Horizons clinic located in the CFSA main office. Some children will need to have a \"m edico-legal\" examination, which is an examination specific to physical and sexual abuse. As noted throughout this document, CFSA's provider of choice for these examinations is the Child and Adolescent Protection Center (CAPC) within th e Children's National Medical Center (CNMC). The Emergency Department at CNMC is also an option. Th e physician completing this examination should make a written notation that the child is \"medically cleared fo r placement.\" The paperwork should then be taken to the Healthy Horizons clinic to ensure that the child is enrolled. 3. Ongoing Medical Care Healthy Horizons will ensure that all children entering care are set up for their standard medical, dental, and vision appointments. As noted above, if a child is not me dically screened at Healthy Horizons (e.g., in the case of medico-legals or children entering care directly from a hospital facility), they must still be enrolled in the Healthy Horizons program afterwards to ensure that they are set up for their ongoing medical care. 4. Mental Health If a child presents any current mental health distress (e.g ., the child is suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, etc.) an Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 188immediate mental health assessment is required. Additionally, all children entering care, age 8 and over, must receive a mental health assessment from the CFSA Office of Clinical Practice within ten days of remova l. A consult between OCP and the child's caregiver must occur for any child under age 8. 5. Children ages 0-3 Children ages 0-3 are in a state of high vulnerability in general but particularly during a removal process. Most of these children are not verbal and may not understand the removal process. For infants, critical bonding experiences can be disrupted during removal. Special assistance may be required. It is important that you make concerted efforts to determine the basic care needs of in fants (feeding method, allergies or special care needs, etc.). Remember, CFSA is mandated to refer all children in this age range through CFSA's Office of Clinical Practice (OCP) to the District's 0-3 Early Intervention Program. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 189TEAMING WITH EXTENDED FAMILY AND SUPPORTS 1. Confidentiality Remember: all CPS investigations are confidential. Conversations with the caregiver can help identify relatives or close friends who may be supportive, including profession als. It is important, however, that communications with these supports occur only with the proper releases of information or consent of the caregiver . Be prepared to explain the constraints of confidentiality to these suppo rts so that they understand the role you play and they understand how to best interface with the Agency. 2. Placement with Relatives Be prepared to explain to families that you do not ha ve the immediate ability to place children with family members. Children may only be placed in licensed plac ements. However, family members interested in kinship care will be provided with the kinship care licensi ng packet. Remember that extended family must be thoroughly assessed regarding their attitude toward the ch ildren, the caregiver, and the removal in general. In addition, their overall fitness to provide care must be a ssessed, including suitable housing, and the ability to pass criminal or child welfare background clearances. Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 This federal law requires that child welfare agencies exer cise due diligence to identify and provide notice to all adult grandparents and other adult relatives of a child within 30 days after the child is removed from his or her home. \u009a CFSA requires that within 30 days of a child's or youth's entry into foster care, the investigator/social worker must use reasonable efforts to identify and locate any absent parent(s), all maternal and paternal grandparents, other relatives and signi ficant non-relatives of the child or youth. \u009a The investigator/social worker will notify these ad ult relatives and significant non-relatives of the removal and provide them with information regard ing their custodial options. (Exceptions may be made due to family or domestic violence.) As the CPS social worker, it is critical that you gath er information as to adult relatives and significant non- relatives and thoroughly document this information in FACES. This will allow CPS or the on-going social worker to notify relatives and explore them as placement resources when children enter foster care. This information should be obtained from the parent as soon as possible. 3. Family Team Meeting The Family Team Meeting (FTM ) process is a formalized practice for involving family supports in the planning of the children's care. This is a collaborative effort and it is important that their opinions, concerns, Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 190recommendations, and suggestions are heard. As the CPS social worker, you need to be prepared to discuss the family's safety and risk factors that you identified, and to ensure that these factors, both negative and positive, are addressed in the FTM process. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 191THE PLACEMENT PROCESS: Coordination with CFSA's Plac ement Services Administration 1. Call to, or conversation with, Placement Services Administration (AKA \"Placement\") Once a final determination has been made to remove a child from the home, you or your management team should contact the Placement Services Administration to discuss the child's specific placement needs. Ideally you should have every child's full name, DOB, health needs, school information, and the reason for removal. This information will be included in the child's Placement Packet ( see #2 below ). Even if all of this information is not immediately available, you must still contact Placement so that they can begin searching best placement options. You can follow-up with the additional information as soon as you receive it. Special Note : there will be times when you must conduct a re moval (i.e., a legal removal for a child who needs to remain in a hospital setting). In these situations, you sh ould still notify Placement so that they can prepare for the child's release from the facility and subsequent entry into their best placement option. 2. Placement Packet All placement providers (or resource caregivers) receive a green \"placement packet\" for every child in care. The packet includes the child's medical screening and demogr aphic information. Additional packets can be obtained from the Placement Services Administration. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 192TEAMING WITH PLACEMENT PROVIDERS 1. Discussion of Reason for Removal Resource caregivers (i.e., foster parents) should be given as much pertinent information as possible about the child in their care, including the reason for removal. Relevant and detailed information, such as any known previous behavioral issues or current concerns, helps the provider to address the child's individual situation and creates a good foundation for quality care. In the event that there are sensitive aspects of the investigation (e.g., criminal components that require increased levels of co nfidentiality), discretion should be used regarding the extent of information shared. 2. Discussions Regarding Individual Children Since each child may naturally respond differently to pl acement, it is important that each child, including siblings, be discussed individually. Discussions with a placement provider should include distinguishing information about the individual child's concerns or fears, routines, comforts, etc. 3. Medical Care Medical care for each child should be established through the initial placement screening process. It is essential that any concerns resulting from that evaluation be shar ed with the placement provider so that the best care possible is available to the child. The placement provider should also be given any information related to special medical needs, upcoming appointments, and over the co unter medications that the child may take such as vitamins. Special Note : if the child takes prescription medications, you need to ensure that the prescriptions are filled prior to placement of the child. If a child is being discharged from a hospital or has specialized medical needs the placement provider must be included in conversations with medical professionals to ensure adequate preparation for the care of the child. 4. Transportation and Education As stated earlier, maintaining a child in his or her school placement is a priority during removal. This is an aspect of normalcy for the child and can mitigate the profound adjustments that must be made after removal and placement. Special Note: you should consult with your management team in the event that the child's normal school placement is determined to be detrimental to the child's best interests (e.g., if the child reports being uncomfortable at his/her school as a result of the removal and placement, or if there is a potential danger to the child due to caregiver access, etc.). Although placement providers are charged with ensuring th at children are transported to school, this may not always be practical or possible. During the initial plac ement process, you should make every effort to explore Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 193and facilitate other transportation options. For childr en who have special needs and already receive school busing, transportation arrangements can be transferred dire ctly to the placement provider. For other children in need of transportation services, please contac t the OCP educational specialist for assistance. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 194 FACES DOCUMENTATION AND GENERAL PAPERWORK 1. Safety Assessment and Case Connect in FACES Your determination for removal must be entered into FACES under \"safety decision #4\" on the safety assessment screen. Once this decision is selected and approved, you will be allowed to complete the case connect and formally open the Agency case. 2. Removal Screen and Legal Status On the date of removal, you must complete both the re moval and legal status screens in FACES. Completion of these screens triggers your ability to co mplete the mandatory online complaint. 3. Complaints For every child who is removed, a complaint must be completed in FACES. The complaints are submitted electronically and distributed to DC Superior Court and the Office of the Attorney General (Neglect Section). For further instructions on how to properly file a complaint, please see CPS & the Law section. 4. FTM Referrals The FTM referral must be completed using the online Universal Referral tool ( see the CFSA intranet ). Please include a brief description of the removal as well as demographic information about the children, caregivers, and support resources. This will be emailed by your management team, along with your approved complaint, to a number of parties in CFSA and in the Office of the Attorney General. 5. School Notification For children who are enrolled in school and/or child care, notification should be given to the appropriate institution explaining the change in the child's legal custody. 6. 30-A and CAD Forms The 30-A and CAD (Citizen Alienation Declaration) forms are completed for each child who enters care. This is done after there is a legal Shelter Care finding for a chil d (which typically occurs at the initial court hearing). These forms can be printed from the 'Reports' section in FACES. The forms need to be signed by your supervisor and then submitted to the CFSA Eligibility Department. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 195 FACES DOCUMENTATION OF INVESTIGATIONS Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 196DOCUMENTATION FOR INVESTIGATIONS The integrity of the investigative process is preserved only by thorough, accurate, and clear documentation of every pertinent social work activity that directly impacts the investigation assigned to you. Your documentation must also include the rationale behind each activity. These wri tten notations protect the safety and well- being of the children being served by the Agency, and they also protect you as an agent of the Agency, as well as the Agency itself. When you hold yourself professionally and personally accountable for proper documentation, you not only fulfill your obligations to the children and families of the District of Columbia, you also get the credit you deserve for your hard work. The guidelines highlighted below will help you achieve the level of quality documentation that is expected of all CPS social workers. MANDATES \u009a ALL investigation activities must be accurately and clearly documented in FACES within 24 hours of their occurrence. \u009a It is especially critical to document initial contacts with the family and the safety assessment within 24 hours of receipt of the investigation. \u009a \"Dead ends\" must also be included in the documentation. \u009a It is NEVER acceptable for there to be more than one week that passes without updated investigation activity and documentation. REMEMBER: if it is not entered in FACES, it didn't happen! This includes documentation that may be in some other form (Microsoft word, email, etc.). Without entry into the appropriate FACES screen you will not re ceive credit for the good work you have done! PURPOSE \u009a Documentation guides the CPS process. \u009a Provides a detailed account of the allegations and the investigation outcome. \u009a Demonstrates accountability on th e part of CFSA and the worker. \u009a Guarantees facts to support any legal action that might be necessary. \u009a Provides an efficient means for supervisory review and statistical reporting. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 197KEY DATA ENTRY CLIENT DEMOGRAPHICS \u009a Full Name, Date of Birth, Social Security Number, Medicaid Number \u009a Address and Telephone Number for Caregiver \u009a Educational Information (Name of School, Attendance Record, etc.) \u009a Medical Information (Childhood Dise ases, Name of Physician, etc.) COLLATERALS \u009a Attorneys \u009a Foster Caregivers \u009a Relative Providers (note: do not include these in the Client List) \u009a Service Providers \u009a Relatives \u009a Private Agencies \u009a Other Related Individuals CONTACTS z As noted under \" Mandates \" above, contacts must be entered into FACES within 24 hours of the interviews. z The contact screen should correctly reflect either \"attempted\" or \"completed\" so that FACES can appropriately track statistics. z For reporting purposes, workers should be mindful of the difference between the fields of \"clients discussed\" and \"client participants\". z Initial contacts with caregivers and/or children should be individually entered and the worker should clearly indicate that each individual was interviewe d outside the presence of other individuals. z Descriptions should be explicit and concise . They should clearly indicate the date of the contact, the location, who was interviewed, the response to th e allegations and the responses to the general interview questions. ( Please refer to the IPG section on inte rviewing for more detailed guidance. ) The initial contact with the alleged perpetrator or caregiver should also reflect the following: On (date), this worker conducted a (home, school, office, or other location) visit to the (address of residence, shelter, location of the investigation, etc) . This worker introduced (himself or herself) to the (identify subject of the interview), and explained the role of CFSA and the purpose of the District of Columbia child abuse and neglect law, and provided details of the specific allegations contained in the report. z Core contacts should include the reporting source, FA CES search, alleged victim and other children, alleged perpetrator and caretaker, collaterals, and househol d members. (See individual sample narratives for reporter, caregiver, and child interviews under Assessment Notes below.) z The contact with the reporter MUST include the word \"r eporter\" in the non-client/non-collateral screen in order for FACES to recognize it.

Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 205 CONFERENCES AND CONSULTATIONS Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 206 OFFICE OF CLINICAL PRACTICE (OCP) Specialists within the CFSA Office of Clinical Practice (OCP) are a resource for consultation on common family dynamics involved in CPS investigations including subs tance abuse, domestic violence, medical care, mental health, and education. In many instances referrals to the various specialists in this administration are required (see Allegation Specific Investigation Steps) but in many more situations, the personnel in OCP are available to provide counsel and guidance in the above mentioned areas. LEGAL During the course of an investigation, consultation betw een CPS staff and CFSA's legal team safely ensures that CPS dispositions and actions are within the guidelines of federal and District rules and regulations. Consultations may include (but are not limited to) advice on testimony fr om CPS staff, opinions on certain steps to achieve the successful closure of a referral, and/or the propriety of requests for information and/or documentation from caregivers, lawyers and/or judges. A consultation may occu r with co-located attorneys from either the Office of the Attorney General or the Office of the General Counsel. DILIGENT SEARCH When you have made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to locate family members during the CPS investigation, a diligent search referral may be submitted to CFSA's Diligent Search Unit (DSU). ( For more detailed information on the DSU referral, please see the CFSA Diligent Search Policy, located on both the internet and intranet.) In order to comply with DSU requirements, you must follow the procedures outlined below: o Ensure that you have documented all efforts to locate the person(s) being sought and that you have entered the results of the search in FACES, including when, where and how attempts were made to identify and/or locate the missing person(s). o If you are still unable to locate the person being sought, consult with your supervisor to determine whether the search is complete. Yo ur supervisor will determine whether further action is required, or whether you need to refer the case to the DSU. If your supervisor determines that the case should be referred to the DSU, complete a Diligent Search Locator Referral Form ( see Appendix... ), and submit it to your supervisor for review and signature. Once your supervisor has approved and signed the form, hand-deliver the Referral Form to the DSU supervisor or fax it to 202-727-8884. o DSU investigations are completed within five (5 ) business days of receipt of the referral. At that time, you will receive a Diligent Search Referral Investigation Report that summarizes the results of the search. The Investigation Repo rt will identify all potential leads that may assist you in locating the person being sought. o You are expected to follow up on any leads provided by the DSU investigator. o Once you have exhausted all leads provided by the DSU investigator, consult with your supervisor to determine whether further acti on is required or whether the search is complete. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 207 OUTSIDE JURISDICTIONS Any allegation of abuse or neglect occurring in the Distri ct must be investigated, even if the family lives in another jurisdiction. Under such circumstances, you will need to confer with the other jurisdiction's CPS unit in order to conduct a full investigation and/or complete a safety check. You may need to request a history of the family's involvement with that jurisdiction, or schedule interviews with various family members or make a home visit to the jurisdiction. At times, other jurisdictions wi ll request information from CFSA or interviews may be conducted that the CFSA Hotline reporter will record in the form of an I&R (Information and Referral Report). If confirmation is received that the family in question does not live in the District and the allegations did not occur in the District , then you should place a call to the appropriate jurisdiction and refer the allegations for investigation accordingly. Please make sure that you document such information and referrals thoroughly. MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM MEETINGS As an employee of the Child and Family Services Agency , you are a part of the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) charged with the responsibility of investigating and pros ecuting child maltreatment in the District of Columbia. You may be expected to participate in joint tr aining with MDT members.

As the CPS social worker, please expect to attend this transfer staffing . Additional participants will include your CPS supervisor, the assigned on-going supervisor, and the assigned on-going social worker. (With the exception of positive tox cases, cases with a low to moderate risk level are referred to one of the six He althy Families Thriving Communities Collaborative offices provided the caregiver consents to this referral.) The 7-day visit CPS workers are required to see the caregiver and children within 7 business days prior to the posting of a case. The purpose of this visit is to ensure that the family re mains stable and that the family be informed of the case transfer/expectations/reason for substantiation.

Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 210 SUPERVISORY AND MANAGERIAL OVERSIGHT Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 211ACCOUNTABILITY CPS investigators rely upon supportive and accessible supe rvision to positively impact their productivity and engagement. If you have any questions regarding an investigation, including whether or not the facts presented in the investigation constitute abuse or neglect, you must seek guidance from your immediate or covering supervisor or program manager. Supervisors shall be held accountable for the following activities: 1. Weekly review of unit data, including the number of ca se assignments per worker and class of cases, all of which need to be scheduled in consideration of time management for both the supervisor and the CPS social worker. 2. Review of investigations, content of FACES documentation, case planning, and assessments for safety and risk. 3. Weekly individual supervision. 4. Conferring (either via telephone or in person) with investigative staff on the same day as all initial assignments (whether immediate or regular response) to ensure that thorough and appropriate initial safety decisions have occurred and to discuss next steps. 5. Within 48 hours the following tasks must have been completed: \u009a Review of FACES contacts, notes, documentation, and approval of initial safety assessment. \u009a Supervision notes and further directives entered into FACES. Program managers shall be held acco untable for the fo llowing activities: 1. Weekly review of division data. 2. Case reviews, specifically trends, external issu es, documentation provided by the supervisors. 3. Division planning, schedules, overtime, workforce vacancies and other personnel issues. 4. From day eighteen (18) through day thirty (30), the program manager will track the investigation daily to ensure that the case is closed on time and with the safe ty of the child or children intact. If there are barriers to timely closure, the program manager will immediatel y inform the CPS administrator in writing, including reasons for the delay and the anticipated date of closure. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 212WEEKLY SUPERVISION Weekly supervision is required for each investigation . Supervision notes must be entered in FACES after each supervision meeting. The following may be reviewed, and additional direction provided if necessary: \u009a interviews of victims and other children \u009a interviews of perpetrators \u009a interview with reporting source \u009a diligent search request and results \u009a records request and results \u009a evaluations \u009a safety of the child \u009a family risk \u009a appropriate service levels \u009a progress of investigation and report \u009a disposition Weekly supervision may also address: \u009a Professional development \u009a Training \u009a Corrective counsel 18 DAY REVIEW The \"18-Day Review\" process is a teaming opportunity held once a week for each CPS division to assist in identifying barriers and/or issues that prevent proper closur e of an investigations that are 18 days or older. Team participants include CPS management (i.e., administra tor, program managers, and supervisors), other CFSA management, and personnel from the CFSA General Counsel's Office. Special Note : it is the responsibility of the assigned supervisor to present every referral that has been open in their unit for 18 days or more . Social workers may also be requested to provide updates for this meeting or, at times, to attend this meeting. During the review meetings, team participants will first ma ke certain that the safety of every alleged child victim has been secured, and that every child has been individually seen and interviewed. The team will further discuss additional phases of the CPS investigation process, includ ing documentation of contacts, referrals that have been or need to be made, and/or any other issues or barriers that impact the investigation. The review shall not be concluded without identification of the proper step s needed to complete the investigation process. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 213 Documentation in FACES should reflect the Agency's quality improvement efforts; therefore you MUST document the 18-day review, along with whatever recommendations were made and any follow-up that you completed. \"FOUR PLUS\" STAFFINGS The supervisor should take care to assess whether there is recidivism within families that are under investigation. Specifically, attention will be paid to families who have had four or more investigations. Conversation about this issue should be discussed with the program manager and determined whether any further staffing should occur regarding this family, possibly including other agency counterparts or professional stakeholders. MANAGEMENT OF INVESTIGATION TIMEFRAMES DC Code \u00a74-1301.06 allows CFSA to complete a CPS investigation no more than 30 days after receipt of the first notice of suspected abuse or neglect. The initial contacts and safety assessment are due within 24 hours of the referral coming into the Hotline. Supervisors are charged with monitoring the progress of investigations through the above mentioned techniques (weekly supervision, 18-Day Review, etc.). Investigations are expected to have timely initial contact, regular follow up documentation, and timely submission for closure (at least two full business days prior to the investigation reaching the 30 day mark). In the event that there are justifiable reasons for an investigation to exceed the 30 day time frame the following procedures are to be adhered to using the \"Extension Screen\" in FACES. Extension Screen Protocol Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 214Request for the investigation extension will be used in conjunction with the 72-hour notice now provided by Supervisors (SSW) to Program Managers (PM) and the Pr ogram Administrator (PA) when referrals must exceed the 30-day time frame for closure. The Supervisor wi ll verbally alert the Program Manager at minimum 72 hours prior to the referral going past 30 days and request approval for extension in FACES.Net. Upon authorization from the Program Manager, the Supervisor will enter the reason code for extension with supporting information into the extension comment screen . The Extension Screen will provide justification and statistical data capturing the circumstan ces associated with the extension. The Extension Screen is not to be used without discussion and prior approval from a Program Manager or assigned designee and can only be requested in FACES.net at the 72 hour or 27th day of the life span of the investigation. Important Notes: \u009a The Comments section is mandatory and must provide a description based upon Reason Code pick-list, to include the date and time of the Contact note authorizing the extension request and identifying next steps. \u009a The required field \"Days of Extension\" must be completed with a dummy number, which is 30, and the timeframe for the extension will be reevaluated every week to determine if more time is required for safe closure. \u009a Due to limited characters in the Comment section, written documentation within the Contact screens identifying the reason code, next steps, and proposed timeframes for when the referral can be completed for closure as it pertains to the extension request is required. It is understood that there are circumstances in which this cannot be determined; however, all pertinent information regarding next steps must be provided. \u009a It is important for ongoing documentation to be entered into the Contact screen denoting steps taken to move the referral to closure and/or the identification of new system barriers. The documentation can reflect supervision directives, 18-day review guid ance, completed steps done by the Social Worker, outstanding actions, etc. The contact notes should be current and detailed with all action steps taken by the assigned Social Worker and/or staff members. \u009a Supervisors must be mindful that even when there is justification for an invest igation to exceed the 30- day period, additional corrective action may be approp riate if the Social Worker's documentation is not current or does not reflect the need for the investigation to exceed the 30-day timeframe. \u009a Investigations with an approved extension will still require regular weekly review via the 18-Day Review process as well as follow up on appropriate investig ation steps. Documentation will be entered weekly, at a minimum, in FACES.net regarding the progress toward safe and timely closure. \u009a Only under extenuating circumstances and approval from the CPS Administrator can a 30-Day Extension be requested and approved in FACES.net after the 30-day timeframe. All requirements for documentation as referenced above must occur and be entered in the Contact screen. Legitimate Reasons for Extension: Unable to Identify or Locate The Social Worker is in the process of completing all steps of Administrative Issuance CFSA-08-2, \"Immediate Requirements for All CPS Investigations\", which discuss mandatory measures to identify Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 215and locate children and families. The Social Worker may also be following other \"leads\" not mentioned in the above referenced AI. However, not all steps have been completed and/or the results of the investigative steps have not yet been received. Out of Jurisdiction A child or family currently resides or is located, due to other circumstances (visitation with family, extended vacation, etc.), outside of the DC jurisdic tion. The return of the child or family and/or a response to an out of jurisdiction courtesy interview request will not occur within the 30-day period, or there is insufficient time upon their return or receip t of the requested courtesy interview assessment, to complete a safe closure. For this reason code, it is important to include all attempts made to confirm the family's location and/or any verification that we are currently pending in the Contact section. Uncooperative Client The Social Worker has made reasonable efforts to engage a client who refuses access to a child, individual, home, or information pertinent to the investig ation. This information is critical to child safety or the disposition of the investigation. Reasonable efforts may include police involvement, assistance of co-workers, visits on varied shifts, pre-petition custody order, etc. Delay in Receipt of Critical Information The Social Worker has attempted to obtain information critical to child safety and/or the disposition of the investigation. However, the receipt of this information is pending. Links New allegations have been linked to the invest igation during the last 10 days of the 30-day timeframe and there is insufficient time to reassess child safety and appropriately disposition the new allegations of the investigation. Law Enforcement Aspects of joint investigations (detective assignmen t, CAC interview, perpetrator interview, etc.) are pending and dependent on outside sources (MPD, Safe Shores, CAPC, etc.). The pending information has a direct impact on child safety and/or disposition of the investigation. Child Fatality Multi-Disciplinary Team investigat ion information (autopsy findings, perpetrator interviews, etc.) is pending and dependent on outside sources (MPD, OCME, etc.). The pending information has a direct impact on child safety and/or disposition of the investigation. Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 216 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 217 ENHANCED GRAND ROUNDS Grand Rounds is a monthly quality assurance meet ing held by the CPS Administration to review open investigations that have been randomly selected from each CPS unit. The teaming panel for a Ground Rounds meeting includes various members of the Quality Assuranc e administration in addition to the representatives from CPS management (i.e., the administrator, program managers, and a rotating selection of two supervisors per month) as well as other agency stakeholders. Meetings begin with a presentation by the supervisor who uses a quality assurance tool to review the status of the open referral. The panel team then provides the supervisor with feedback focused on the caliber of ongoing procedures necessary to ensure a complete and thorough investigation prior to closure. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that any recommended actions ha ve been taken prior to closing the investigation. Documentation in FACES should reflect the Agency's quality improvement efforts. You MUST document the CPS Grand Rounds, along with whatever recommendations were made and any follow-up that you completed. SUPERVISORY REVIEW FOR INVESTIGATION CLOSURE In order to ensure that the investigation may be safely closed, a thorough review of the investigation activities, as well as the social work er's documentation of such in FACES, along with the safety and risk assessments is essential. \u009a Review the original referral and any linked referrals to refresh the concerns that brought the family to the agency's attention o Ensure that all concerns have been addressed in the investigation \u009a Review client demographics o Ensure that all clients have correct and consistent spelling of names and dates of birth or make notation of the reason why the spelling changed throughout the course of the investigation (new information, etc.) \u009a Ensure that contact screens are updated o Attempted or completed contacts with reporting source(s) o Completed and thorough FACES search o Completed contacts for all active clients o Completed medical collateral contacts o Completed educational and/or daycare collateral contacts \u009a Review of the previously completed safety assessment. o Determine whether any update is needed prior to closure o If safety concerns will persist after the invest igation closure, ensure that the documentation reflects ongoing safety planning \u009a Review the risk assessment and approve o Ensure that the risk assessment accurately reflects the overall family risk Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 218o Ensure that any necessary overrides are completed \u009a Review the assessment notes \u009a Review the disposition o Ensure that the documentation in the contacts and assessment notes supports the overall disposition \u009a Complete the case connect and approve o Any substantiated allegation MUST have a CFSA case attached to the investigation, even if it is only to support and close based on the risk level o Ensure that the social worker has completed the hard record, either for transfer to ongoing or for submission to closed files o Depending on the recommending case connect decision, justify whether a case is being opened or closed and/or whether the family is being referred to the collaborative o Remember that collaborative services are voluntary (even in substantiated investigations) and if a family refuses these services, an override of the overall risk level may be warranted to ensure appropriate service provision through the agency o Remember that without a substantiation, involvement in an agency case is voluntary for a family, regardless of risk level \u0083 Appropriate forms must be completed if a family consents to services (see Attachment D of the Investigations Policy) \u009a Review the recommendations and closure and approve Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 219 APPENDICES I.

Resi dents can include teen mothers and their children. Impending Danger: threats to child safety that is not obvious or occurring at the onset of CPS intervention or in a present context. Such danger is identified and understood after full evaluation and understanding of the individual and/or family conditions and/or family functioning. In other words impending danger refers to a family situation in which a child is not in immediate da nger but there yet exists a general state of danger because of what is understood to be happening within his or her family. Without a safety intervention, there is reasonable cause to believe the impending danger will lead to severe harm of the child. Licensed or temporarily licensed Foster homes/kinship homes \u009a \"Temporary licensed\" -- Permission has been gr anted to operate a foster home for a temporary period via the issuance of a licens e that is granted for no more than 120 days upon interest of a kin member regarding a related child in placement in order to complete training and other licensing requirements. \u009a \"Licensed\" -- Permission has been granted to an applicant to operate a foster home via the issuance of a license. Protective Capacities: personal and behavioral, cognitive and emotional characteristics of care giving that specifically and directly can be associated with being protective of one's young. These protective capacities contribute to vigilant child protection an d apply specifically to the adult who lives with the child and is responsible for the primary care of the child. Reasonable Efforts: activities and attempts to assess and analyze impending danger and to seek people, resources and alternative methods for in home safety plans that pr event child placement or that allow for a child to be reunified with his or her family. Risk: the likelihood of maltreatment in the future. Runaway shelters: short-term facilities that house minor children who have absconded or otherwise departed the parental or legal guardian home, cont rary to the wishes of the parent or guardian.

Safety Plan: a written arrangement between caregivers and CPS that establishes how impending danger threats will be managed. The safety plan is implemented and active as long as impending danger threats exist and caregiver protective capacities are insufficient to assure a child is protected. The safety plan specifies what impending dangers exist, how the impending danger will be managed using identified safety services; who will participate in those safety services; under what circum stances and agreements and in accordance with what specification of time requirements, availability, accessibility and suitability of those involved. The safety plan is designed along a continuum of least-to-most intrusive inte rvention: in-home safety options, a combination of in- home and out-of-home safety options, and out-of-home safety options. A \"vulnerable child\" means a child who is unable to protect hi m or herself. This includes a child who is dependent on others for sustenance an d protection. Evaluating information about child vulnerability is crucial when trying to determine if a child is vulner able to an identified safety threat. Vulnerability is judged according to the child's physical and emot ional development, ability to communicate needs, mobility, size and level of dependence.

Go to dccadv.org April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 235 Drugs and Their Effects According to the First Citywide Comprehensive Substance Abuse Strategy for the District of Columbia ,3 which was published in 2003, the use of illicit drugs in the District was 52% higher than that of the nation . Equally disturbing was the rate of drug addiction (8.9%), which was almost double the national rate (4.7%). This perv asive use of drugs in the District continues to influence and be influenced by homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime. (Almost 60% of male teenagers who are arrested in the District are tested positive for illegal drug use.) Misuse/abuse of drugs is an issu e that immediately impacts children, youth, and families served by CFSA. Research studies confirm that childre n whose parents or caregivers are misusing drugs (or are addicted to drugs) perform poorly in school, often suffer from emotional and/or psychological problems, present with behavioral problems (e.g., truancy, delinquency, etc.), and most importantly for the CPS investigator, are mo re likely to suffer child abuse and neglect at the hands of the drug-using caregiver. When you assess a family and/or the home for safety and risk, it is important that you are familiar with the names, effects, paraphernalia, and even withdrawal sy mptoms related to the use of the ten most common illicit drugs: \u009a cocaine (coke, snow, blow) \u009a crack cocaine (crack, rock, freebase) \u009a ecstasy (clarity, lover's speed) \u009a heroin (smack, junk, brown sugar, horse) \u009a LSD (acid, white lightening, blue heaven, sugar) \u009a marijuana (pot, weed, mary jane, dope, ganja) \u009a powder) \u009a PCP (angel dust, hog, loveboat) 3 Available on the District's Addiction Prevention and Recovery Administration (APRA) website at http://doh.dc.gov/doh/frames.asp?doc=/doh/ lib/doh/services/administration_offices/apr/pdf/dcstrategy2003_10_15_03.pdf&group=178 7&o pen April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 236\u009a psilocybin (magic mushrooms, 'shrooms) While the above-cited drugs may be the \"most po pular\", there are still many others that are commonly used and equally as dangerous to the users and to any children who are exposed to their use, particularly in utero. Additional abuse might include ov er-the-counter drugs, including cough syrups and inhalants, or more se rious prescription drugs such as oxycontin or oxycodone ( see Prescription Drug Abuse section below ). The following table gives a general description of the top ten drugs, their clinical names, effects, associated paraphernalia, and withdrawal symptoms. Note: this list is not exhaustive!

PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE In general, prescription drugs are legally obta ined by adults for legitimate reasons but a growing number of teens are frequently abusing these otherwise legal drugs. According April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 244to the federal Office of National Drug Cont rol Policy, abuse of prescription drugs (i.e., tranquilizers, sedatives, pain relievers, stim ulants) is only second to the abuse of marijuana in the United States. All CPS inve stigators should be familiar with different types of prescription drugs, their effe cts, and possible withdrawal symptoms. There are three basic types of prescription drugs: z opioids z central nervous system (CNS) depressants z stimulants COMMONLY ABUSED PR ESCRIPTION DRUGS Name Type Possible Effects (\"positive\" & negative) Withdrawal coordination \u009a Release of inhibition \u009a Slurred speech Effects may last 4 to 16 \u0083 Irritability \u0083 Fainting \u0083 Nervousness \u0083 Convulsions table Xanax (alprazolam) Valium (diazepam) Ativan CNS depressant - Benzodiazepi ne z Reduces anxiety z Anti-depressant z Muscle relaxants z Reduction of irritability and/or excitement z Induces sleep z Anti-convulsants Effects may last 6 to 12 hours. z Anxiety z Irritability z Insomnia z Muscle spasms z Dizziness z Paranoia z Tremor z Dis- association z Suicide Schedule IV i.e., drug has low potential for abuse, is or can be used medically, and is minimally addictive April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Euphoria z Relief of pain (severe and/or chronic) z Cough suppressant z Constipation z Loss of appetite z Fatigue z Nausea Effects may last 6 to 12 hours. z Watery eyes z Diarrhea z Insomnia z Headaches z Involuntary leg kicking z Depression z Paranoia z Back pain Schedule II (see table above) Dexedrine (dextro- amphetamine sulfate) Adderall XR (amphetamin e) Stimulant - Dextro- amphetamine z Relief of narcolepsy z Relief of attention deficit disorder (with hyperactivity) z Increased blood pressure z Tremor z Headache Effects last 24 hours. z Fatigue z Irritability z Depression z Violence z Disturbed sleep Schedule II (see table above) ALCOHOL ABUSE April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 246Although research supports moderate use of al cohol for some health benefits, alcohol abuse or dependence is fraught with medical complications. Since it is legal and readily accessible, it is one of the most dangerously addictive available drugs in society. In fact, dependence on alcohol is the primary source of addiction in the District of Columbia.4 It also has a much higher percentage of abuse in the District than the national average (14% compared to 9.2%). Again, like other drugs, use of alcohol during pregnancy is particularly dangerous and one of the most preventable causes of birth defects. As a CPS investigator, it is important that yo u not only know the signs of alcohol abuse, but that you also recognize that there are no w psychiatric implications of alcohol abuse currently listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) under Substance Abuse Disorders. Lastly, it is important that you recognize the dramatic influence of alcohol abuse on youth. As re ported in 2009 by the District's Addiction Prevention and Rehabilitation Administration (APRA), \"approximately one in four high school students took their first drink of alcohol before age 13.\" 5 These youth will likely continue drinking despite formidable consequences, including fatal automobile accidents. 4 First Citywide Comprehensive Substance Abuse Strategy for the District of Columbia; see Footnote #1 above. 5 Youth and Drugs: The Case for Infrastructure an d Targeted Strategies in the Nation's Capitol ( APRA, 2009) April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 247 ALCOHOL (ethanol C 2H5OH) Basic Types Source Alcohol % Possible Effects (\"positive\" & negative) Withdrawal Symptoms Federal Class Beer Fermented grains 3-6 % Wine Fermented fruits 11-14% Note: dessert wines or itif Liquor (e.g., whiskey, vodka, rum, tequila, gin, etc.) Distillation of fermented grains (wheat, barley, rye), corn, potatoes, agave, sugarcane, juniper berries 40-50 % \u0010 Mild euphoria \u0010 Increased longevity (for older, moderate drinkers - ages 48+) \u0010 Lowered coronary heart disease (35% in moderate drinkers) \u0010 Lowered inhibitions \u0010 Loss of balance and/or coordination \u0010 Impaired judgment (inappropriate behavior) \u0010 Slurred speech heart rate Convulsions \u0010 Seizures \u0010 Death (if untreated ) Non-applicable Only drugs that are not openly legal for purchase by adults are classified. TOBACCO USE Addiction to nicotine (the active ingredient in tobacco) is now a widely-recognized problem for smokers, in addition to the he alth warnings that smoking causes cancer. This information appears to have impacted District teens who markedly decreased their use of tobacco between 2003 and 2009.6 Nonetheless, District t eens continue to buy and smoke cigarettes. Research does indicate that nicotine has some relaxation effects on the body, including mild pain relief and increasing positive emot ions. Nicotine stays in the body for about two hours, if only one cigarette is smoked. The cumulative effect, however, will last for six 6 Youth and Drugs: The Case for Infrastructure and Targeted Strategies in the Nation's Capitol ( APRA, 2009) April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 248to eight hours, and will increase the desire for more. When withdrawing from nicotine addiction, the American Heart Association reports that one or more the following symptoms will occur: z irritability z impatience z hostility z anxiety z depressed mood z difficulty concentrating z restlessness z decreased heart rate z Increased appetite or weight gain April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 249 April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 250How Long Do Drugs Stay in Your System?

Guidelines for Interviewing Abusive Partners April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 257 CPS PRACTICE POINTS Minimal Basic Needs of Children adapted from the Research Foundation of SUNY- Center for Development of Human Services The minimal basic needs of children are very much the same as the minimal basic needs of an adult, some of which may seem to be plain \"c ommon sense\". Nonetheless, as the CPS social worker, you should familiarize yourself with the list below, and recognize that these standards are provided as guidance only. Every standar d DOES NOT have to be met for you to have concerns about a child's safety or for you to provide support and/or intervention. You will have to make assessments on a case-by-case basis fo r whether families are pr omoting their children's safety and healthy development through provision of minimal basic needs: food and nutrition, clothing, shelter, hygiene and cleanliness, medi cal care, supervision, and/or discipline. MEDICAL CARE Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Adequate treatment sought for serious/acute illnesses or injuries. Standardized routine health care provided, including dental, psychiatric and optometric. Attention to recommended follow-up medical and dental appointments. Required medications and other treatments Child May: Suffer acute or chronic illness/injury ; Experience long-term disability or loss of function due to untreated or improperly treated illness or injury; Be unable to attend school regularly, impairing social, emotional, mental April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 258provided. development; Die. SUPERVISION Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Supervision will be adequate for the child based on age and developmental level. Infants and toddlers will be supervised at all times by someone capable of meeting their needs and keeping them safe. Older children will be supervised at a level commensurate with their age, developmental level, behavior, and temperament to make sure they are not engaging in hazardous behavior or are in a hazardous situation. Children will not supervise other children they are developmentally incapable of caring for or keeping safe; supervision will be structured in that the children will be expected to be in school when required and not roaming the streets unsupervised late at night. Supervision will be provided by someone capable of providing the level of care required (for example, not under the influence of drugs or alcohol to the extent that they are incapable of providing the level of supervision required, not physically or mentally infirm to the point that they are incapable of providing the level of supervision required.) Child May Experience acute or chronic illness or injury; Engage in truancy or delinquent behavior; Sexually exploited, abducted, abandoned; Die. April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 259DISCIPLINE Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Caretakers will discipline their children commensurate with he child's age. Developmental level, physical and mental condition and capacity to understand the intent of the discipline. Discipline should not go beyond what is objectively reasonable. Discipline may include corporal punishment; however, the corporal punishment should not be excessive. The following questions can help to determine the appropriateness of discipline: Does the child understand why he or she is being punished? Is the level of punishment commensurate with the misbehavior? Is the means of punishment appropriate to correct the behavior? Are less severe alternatives available? What is the nature of the punishment? (It should not be brutal, degrading, and sexual in nature or beyond the child's level of endurance; nor should the discipline seriously injure the child or put the child at risk of serious injury.) Child May Suffer serious physical injury or risk of serious physical injury; Become disabled long-term or permanently lose functioning or risk loss thereof; Become mentally impaired or risk impairment; Die; Suffer long-term emotional trauma, poor self- concept.

Suffer acute or chronic illness/injury (scabies, frostbite); Be ostracized by peers, resulting in damaged self-concept; Avoid school or be suspended; Adopt delinquent behaviors (shoplifting) to obtain other clothing Be sexually exploited. FOOD & NUTRITION Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Provision of food that meets established nutritional requirements for physical and mental development and basic energy needs. Sufficient quantity to regularly meet nutritional needs, including fluid intake. Feeding assistance based on developmental or other needs as appropriate. Hygienically safe preparation and storage of foods. Child may \u00be Experience acute or chronic illness, weight loss, vitamin deficiency, disease, injury, developmental delays, loss of function or disability; \u00be Die; \u00be Feel unloved due to unmet needs; \u00be Adopt delinquent behaviors (stealing food) in order to get needs met.

Protection from the elements Child May Die; Experience acute or chronic disease/illness/injury, social ostracism, and poor self-concept. April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 262 CPS PRACTICE POINTS Interviewing Children Each child that you encounter throug h your work at CFSA is unique, reflecting the progress of his or her internal developmental clock and the influences of his or her family, environmen t, and resources. As part of your CPS response, you need to be skillful at interviewi ng children in a manner that is sensitive to their developmental stage, in order to de velop an accurate understanding of their situation and their needs. \u009a Interview children in a safe, comfortable and neutral environment. Ensure you are at eye level with the child. \u009a Explain to the child why you are there. Ex plain in general terms the purpose of the interview. \u009a Smile a lot and affirm the child's contribution (e.g., \"that's very important information\" or \"you are very helpful\"). \u009a Never rush an interview with a child. You sh ould build rapport with the child before launching into the interview. \u009a Take as much time as the child needs to share information comfortably. \u009a Questions should progress from open-ended to specific. \u009a Use age appropriate language. Ask the child to explain what they mean by any word used that you do not understand. \u009a Discuss the importance of telling the truth in a way that is developmentally appropriate for the child's level. \u009a Gently explore discrepancies by asking for additional information. \u009a Always thank the child for taking time to speak with you. When concluding the interview: \u009a Ask the child if there is anything else you need to know. \u009a Ask the child if they have questions for you. \u009a Explain to the child what will happen next in the investigation. April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 263 CPS PRACTICE POINTS INTERVIEWING THE SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE The following guidelines can help you obtain information that may help assess concerns related to child safety and domestic violence. Keep in mind what the victim may be experiencing and how difficult it is to share and seek help. \u009a Always conduct the interview privately. \u009a Determine the survivor's relation ship with the abusive partner. \u009a Never share the survivor's responses with anyone, including close family members and especially not with the suspected batterer! \u009a Be mindful that domestic viol ence survivors frequently fear disclosure based on past experiences with retaliation. They may also fear removal of their children as a result of the risk factors associated with domestic violence. \u009a Reinforce the survivor's right to pr otect themselves and their children. \u009a Reassure the survivor that they are no t alone in their struggle for safety and protection but they must be strong enough to work with you, and the DV specialist, to develop a safety plan, to follow it, and to take advantage of available services. \u009a Redirect any tendency on the part of the survivor to take blame for the violence. ASK: \u009a Has your partner prevented you from going to work, school and/or place of worship? \u009a Has your partner acted jealously, or accu sed you of being unfaithful, or followed (stalked) you? \u009a Has your partner ever made you feel unsafe or afraid? \u009a Has your partner threatened self-injury if you didn't comply with a request? Threaten to injure or kill you, or other family members? \u009a Has your partner ever physically hurt you, leaving marks, bruises, welts, bleeding, fractures, etc.? (If necessary, use concrete acti on verbs, e.g., hit, slap, kick, punch, choke, burn, forced sex, etc.) \u009a Has your partner threatened to hurt, k ill or remove the children from the home? \u009a Have your children witnessed your partner hurting you? April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 264\u009a Has your partner hit your child(ren) with belt s, straps, hand or other objects that have resulted in marks, bruises, welt s, or other serious injuries? \u009a Has your partner assaulted you while you were holding your child? \u009a Have you ever left home to protect yourself and your children? \u009a Have you ever asked the abuser to leave home? \u009a Have you asked anyone for help (e.g., family , friends, police, social worker, court, clergy, or other individuals)? \u009a Do you have a plan in place for your safety right now? \u009a What do you believe will keep you and your children safe? April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 265 CPS PRACTICE POINTS INTERVIEWING CHILDREN EXPOSED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE The following questions will help you gain relevant information during an interview with children. As noted in the detailed section on domestic violence, many types of relationships can be involved in domestic violence. It is up to you as the CPS investigator to phrase the question accord ing to the known relationship between the abuser, the survivor, and the child (e.g., mother and father, mother and mother's boyfriend, other adult relatives in the home, etc.). Assess the pattern and extent of domestic violence. \u009a How often do the adults fight? \u009a What happens when they fight? \u009a Does anyone hit, shove, or push the other? \u009a Does anyone yell? \u009a Does anyone throw or break things? \u009a Has anyone ever used a gun or a knife? (Include k nives that might not be used in the kitchen, e.g., a switchbl ade,) \u009a Have the police ever come to your home because of a fight? \u009a Tell me about the last big fight between the adults?

Remember that domestic violence occurs betw een many varied relationships. The alleged abuser is not always the husband or the father, or the boyfriend. You must use the information you have in front of you as a result of your in vestigation to phrase the questions according to the actual relationship between the abuser and the survivor of abuse. 1. Conduct the interview privately. 2. Do not share any information with the abusive partner regarding other interviews, i.e., the survivor's responses to interview questions or descriptions from the children in the home, etc. 3. If the abusive partner poses an immediat e danger to the survivor or to any child(ren), delay the interview until you have determined through an adequate assessment process that it is safe to do so. 4. If you have any reason whatsoever to suspect that the abusive partner poses a potential danger to you as the CPS work er, do not conduct the interview without first consulting the CPS management team and the DV specialist for strategies to protect your safety, e.g., arranging to interview at CFSA and/or requesting that a Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of ficer be present at an MPD precinct. 5. During the interview, take the following precautions: \u009a Trust your first inst incts: if you feel afraid, you may be unsafe. Postpone the interview until your safe ty needs can be met. \u009a Maintain a calm and professional atti tude: the abusive partner may try to test your limits. \u009a Do not engage in confrontational behavi or with the abusive partner, or use language that might be judgmental. \u009a Use empathetic statements, e.g., \"I unde rstand this is a difficult time for you\", or \"I'm here to help you and your family\", etc. April 2011 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 268\u009a If the abuser does become provocat ive or intimidating, use empathetic statements to end interview, e.g.,\" Would you feel better if I call you tomorrow and we can set up another time to continue our conversation?\" 6. Always notify the survivor if you become aware of threats to the survivor or to the children's safety, or if you experience any escalating behavior or anger on the part of the abusive partner. 7. Clarify any vague, non-specific language by asking concrete questions, or asking for more details: e.g., if the abusive partner speaks about \"getting angry,\" or \"losing my temper,\" follow-up with clarifying ques tions, such as \"And what happens when you lose your temper?\" If the abusive partner states, \"I get physical,\" you may ask, \"Do you shake or grab your partner?\" 8. Become familiar with excuses for violence: \u009a Minimizing, e.g., \"It's only happened on ce or twice\" or \"I t was just a push.\" \u009a Citing good intentions, e.g., \"I just want ed to be heard\" or \"I didn't mean to hurt anyone.\" \u009a Blaming the violence on drugs or alcoho l, e.g., \"I only get upset when I've been drinking, \" \u009a Blaming the violence on the partner or the children, e.g., \"If my partner had only done what I asked, I wouldn't have had to strike out\" or \"Those kids make me so angry, if they would just stop in terfering in our rela tionship, I wouldn't have to show them who's boss.\" 9. Discuss the District's definiti on of interpersonal violence , and explain that violence is any behavior that either forces the part ner to do something they do not want to do or something that makes them afraid\u2014in cluding verbal threats, throwing things, etc. 10. Find out when the violence occurred and if possible, why it was directed at the partner. 11. Ask detailed questions about the last, first, and most serious incident. Use questions like, \"Have there been other time s when you have slapped your partner? How about the kids? How do you punish or discipline them? Have you had violent conflicts with co-workers or friends?\" 12. Be direct and candid: often workers sh ow their own discomfort with domestic violence and child abuse issues. It is import ant for you to be direct\u2014it signals that it is okay for the abusive partner to talk to you about the violence. It helps the abusive partner see that there is a pattern that coul d possibly be changed. It also helps place responsibility for the violence on the ab user. Abusers frequently focus on the behavior of the person they're abusing. You can help shift the focus from the partner's behavior back onto the abuser's behavior, and help the abusive partner realize the harm that is being done by the violence.
