When and How to Mask Wearing a well-fitting mask minimizes your likelihood of contracting and spreading the virus. BPHC strongly recommends wearing a mask: - When you are indoors, including when using public transportation, in government buildings, and in crowded outdoor venues. - If you are at higher risk for severe illness, such as people who are not fully vaccinated, seniors, and those who are immunocompromised. - If you are around those who may be at high risk for severe COVID-19, especially if you may have been exposed to COVID-19 recently. Choose a mask that fits snugly against your nose and chin with no large gaps around the sides of the face. Due to the more transmissible omicron variant, consider wearing a disposable surgical mask, or if you will be in close contact with the public, a KN95 mask. Follow BPHC's guide on [how to put on a mask](/sites/default/files/file/2022/06/COVID-19%20PPE%20Mask%20Sequence.pdf).
