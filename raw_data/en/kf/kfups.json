Media and social media content analysis of the H1N1 pandemic Celine Klemm a, Enny Das b, Tilo Hartmann a aDepartment of Communication Science, VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands bDepartment of Communication and Information Science, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherland Content analysis Content Sources Threat/coping info Emotionalization Experiments Effects Fear Risk perceptions Coping intentions Intended and unintended effects Journalists Professional roles Production routines Time pressure Interviews Understanding mass media systems in an outbreak situation Findings: News content Klemm, C., Das, E., & Hartmann, T. (2014). Swine Fl u and Hype: A Systematic Review of Media Dramatization of the H1N1 Influenza Pandemic. Journal of Risk Research. doi:10.1080/13669877.2014.923029 No clear evidence that media as a whole intentional ly dramatize epidemics Emphasis risk over prevention Dramatization seems mostly driven by the pure amoun t of coverage Mobilizing health prevention \"You need to give people right information that the y can take precautions, they know if they need to take a vacci ne or anything. You have a big role there. [...] So it's ma ybe compared to many of our stories , it's more of a news story where really what we tell affects people's actions.\" (medical re porter) Informing the public \"New information, all the information you can gathe r in let's say, eight hours, twelve hours, what it usually takes in one day. [...] That is what counts.\" (editor) Contextual analysis \"it's not always enough just to give the facts because people also need explanation and analysis 'what should I think about that?'\" (science reporter ) Emotion management \"It's a national task of the authorities to calm the big audience. But in a way, we are in the same boat, I think (laughing)\" (general reporter ) Findings: Journalists' Roles Klemm, C., Das, E., & Hartmann, T. (in preparation) . Self-perceptions of journalists in times of an epidemic: How journalistic consider their role and practices and use of emotionality in reporting. Findings: News effects Klemm, C., Hartmann, T., & Das, E. (in preparation) . Reactant to emotionalized reporting? An experimental examination of the impact of emotional ized reporting about an epidemic on people's risk perception and reactance. Emotionalizing reporting may increase risk perceptio n, and fear But emotionalizing coverage (or coverage of pandemi c per se) may also trigger reactance = perception of \"dramatization\", which diminishes this effect Implications Use the media spotlight to establish channels inde pendent of the mainstream media to reach audiences when attention has moved on Maintain good contacts with specialist reporters, who are better equipped for reporting and have leverage within new s organisations, but also build trusting relations to general reporters before crises times Sensationalism or dramatization necessary/unnecess ary concern!? It increases risk perceptions to an extent but audi ences' may also 'correct' for it if too dramatic To vaccinate or not to vaccinate; that is the question WP4: Vaccination knowledge, attitudes, risk perception & vaccination non-response H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Voeten 1 Marloes Bults 1 Jan Hendrik Richardus 1,2 1. Municipal Public Health Service Rotterdam-Rijnmond, the Netherlands 2. Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, th e Netherlands Aims 1. To systematically review studies into risk perception and vaccination accept ance among the general population during the H1N1 pandemic 2. To review studies on vaccination acceptance of H1N1 and seaso nal flu, and reasons for (non) compliance, among health care workers 3. To identify knowledge, attitudes, risk perception , information needs, and reasons for (non) compliance for seasonal/pande mic influenza in 4 European countries 4. To develop and evaluate a protocol for outbreak managers to identify the urgency and level of risk communication ( tool demonstration) Methods I Systematic review risk perception studies H1N1 gen eral population Compilation of 8 reviews on health care workers va ccination for seasonal/ pandemic flu, covering 118 different studies Findings I Review risk perception General population, H1N1: Perceived vulnerability increased over time, whereas perceived severity, anxiety, self-efficacy, and vaccination intention decreased Improved hygienic practice and social distancing were practiced mostly High vaccination willingness, low actual rates => Bults et al. Disaster Med Public Health Preparednes s. 2015 Apr;9(2):207-19 Review Health care workers: determinants vaccinatio n non-compliance: not feeling at risk (healthy, professional exposure, not a high risk gr oup) low perceived severity; concerns safety/side effec ts; doubts efficacy inconvenient vaccination delivery / not getting around to it being a nurse, female, young, lower salary, single, healthyMethods II Internet survey among representative internet pane ls in UK, Sweden, Poland, Spain (500 respondents per coun try) Mild vs. medium vs. severe pandemic influenza scenario: - illness: 1% - 10% - 30% - deaths inhabitants: 40 - 1.000 - 25.000 => ESCAIDE at 17.15, Parellel session 14: Vaccine Preventable Diseases I I Findings II General population UK, Sweden, Spain, Poland; 3 pan demic flu scenarios Good hygiene and social distancing are considered more effective than vaccination => lower intention for vaccination than hygiene/distancing 59% willing to be vaccinated in worst pandemic scenario (UK highest 71%, Spain 64%, Poland 58%, Sweden lowest 43%) Sweden: lowest risk perception, perceived efficacy of preventive m easures, and intention to perform these measures Mild vs. intermediate vs. severe pandemic scenario: hardly any influence on risk perception and intention Confidence in government actions during flu pandemic: No/little confidence: Sweden 21%, UK 28%, Spain 50% 60% 70% I am never sick Little/no confidence in government Benefits do not outweigh advantages Afraid of serious side-effects Doubt that vaccine protects Little is known about side-effects UK Sweden Spain Poland Implications Monitor public perceptions and misconceptions continuously Educate health care workers on their role in influenza transmission and prevention Combine it with strategies like improved access to vaccination, the use of incentives/disincentives, use of role-models Educate the public that influenza vaccination by is far more effective than good hygiene / social distancing Countries differ much in risk perception, so tailor risk communication to the specific circumstances/experience of each country WP5. Acceptance of Vaccinations in Pandemic Outbreaks across Europe: a Discrete Choice Experiment Esther W. de Bekker-Grob, PhD 1 Ida J. Korfage, PhD 1 Domino Determann, MD, PhD-candidate 1,2 1. Department of Public Health Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, the Netherlands 2. Department of Quality of Care and Health Economics National Institute for Public Health and the Environ ment, the Netherlands Aims To obtain insights in the attributes that influence pandemic vaccination preferences of the general population of four different European countries; To assess which trade-offs are made between these a ttributes by means of a discrete choice experiment; To investigate whether trade-offs differ within and between the populations of different countries; To calculate the expected uptake of several vaccination programmes for several pandemic scenarios; and To develop tools: 1) How to design your own discrete choice experimen t on pandemic vaccinations, and 2) Calculator to esti mate vaccination uptake. Findings I: focus group study Both disease characteristics and vaccination progra mme characteristics influence willingness to get vaccinated in case of a new pandemic; Except for those who belong to a risk group, the lev el of susceptibility was low; Previous vaccination experiences play a key role in willingness to get vaccinated in case of a new pandemic; The general public does not think it is possible th at a vaccine against a new pandemic can ever be totally safe. Findings II: discrete choice experiment Severe pandemic: vaccine effectiveness key characte ristic in all countries; Respondents were more sensitive to advice against c ompared to advice in favour of vaccination; The advice of physicians strongly affects vaccine p references in Sweden, in contrast to Poland and Spain, where the advice of ( international) health authorities was more important; Seriousness of a pandemic influences vaccination up take dramatically; Irrespective of pandemic scenario or vaccination pr ogramme characteristics, expected vaccine uptake was lowest in Swedish sampl e. Attributes Alternative s Attribute levels Pandemic scenario Implications Our findings may facilitate responses to future inf luenza pandemics with different levels of seriousness; The availability of an effective pandemic vaccine i s of paramount importance to reach certain coverage levels; Responsible authorities should align with other imp ortant stakeholders in the country and communicate in a co ordinated manner.

Methods Method 1. Literature search for -outbreak reports among UVG - vaccination uptake, participation, and serprevale nce studies among UVG - perception and belief studies among UVG Method 2. After selecting three EUcountries (Romania, Portuga l, Netherlands) -identification of existing research groups studying UVGs -bringing them together to collect and combine findings -analyse and report on findings for groups and determinants Method 3. -Selection of determinants for (non)vaccination -Defining Performance objectives -Drafting Potential Communication and Behavioural Influence T actics Findings I In three countries we identified 6 groups: 1. Anthroposophists, 2. Orthodox Protestant Denomin ations, 3. Anti-Vaccination Societies, 4. Roma community, 5. The 'Macrobiotics' and 6. The 'Critical citizens' UVG's - determinants UVG's share determinants for (non)vaccination with the general public Findings II Determinants and Performance Objectives Matrix Findings II \"SMART\"Determinants and Performance Objectives Matrix Findings III Example tactics Cell 1 Performance objective: Ensure parents have all the information they need Perceived severity of the disease and its possible complications Communication tactics: - Use traditional mass media to explain to the public: Symptoms Severity, Transmission -Have senior scientists ready to answer questions and provide guidance. -Use digital media to both provide official information and to act as a method of tracking online concerns and issues that may need a response. -Set up press and web-based communication channels . - Develop and promote, using all forms of media, a national Q&A service for people with concerns about severity and risks. Implications \"be happy with the rose provided\" UVG's can act as sentinel for early warning of circulation of VPD UVG's can act as sentinel for early warning of determinants for non- vaccination THUS ..... in interpandemic periods .... - get in contact with your under vaccinated groups - liaise with key persons from these groups - set up communication channels Influencing behaviour is not for dummiesWP(3) Social Marketing analysis of vaccination behaviour, audience segmentation, and service delivery Team: Prefessor Jeff French Anne Willis BA Dr peter Duncan Adam Crosier Msc BSC Dominick McVey. Msc BA Dr Thomas French Andrew Willis BA, MA Dr Alison Thorpe Aims 1. Guidance on using behavioural influencing approac hes including incentives and disincentives 2. Analyse current vaccination promotion service de livery in different European countries from a customer perspe ctive. 3. Prototype audience segmentation model. 4. Assess and develop behavioural goals that can ac t provide impact metrics for different phases of a pandemic i nfluence programmes. Output: 6 Reports and 23 tools and checklists Using incentives and disincentives to influence health behaviour. Jan 2016. Findings I 1. The behaviour challenges associated with pandemi c events highlight the limits of conventional communication approaches 2. Multiple systemic interventions are more successful at influencing be haviour 3. Humans are not entirely rationa l when making health choices and this understanding needs to be reflected in pandemic pro grammes 4. Behavioural models & theory together with plannin g models strengthen pandemic communication and behavioural programmes 5. It is not sufficient to consider an individual's voluntary behaviour change in isolation from social and environmental factors. Findings II 1. Poor and confused objective setting 2. Lack of audience research to inform communications strategies. 3. Limited understanding & use of segmentation . No use and little understanding of customer journey mapping. 4. Limited use of behaviour theory and health promotion planning models. 5. Internet-based communication perceived to be pro blematic and under-developed, but Oppositional/anti-vaccine groups much more effectiv e in using social media/blogosphere. 6. Limited evaluation of communication intervention s and preplanning. Methods 1. Systematic literature reviews 2. Interviews with key practicioner, policy and poli tical informants 3. Policy reviews 4. Case study vusists ad meetings in three European contries, Italy, Hungary and the UK. Implications 1. Existing programmes focus on rational decision m aking and the transmission of scientific advice. Implication: Develop interventions that also focus on non-rati onal decision making and behavioural influence factors. 2. There is poor programme planning , objective set ting and evaluation Implication: Develop pandemic preparation planning guidance and t ools that promote 'Comprehensive' strategic planning driven by SMART behavioural objec tives. 3. Health communication & marketing is seen as a se cond order activity delivered by staff without sufficient authority to influence the total response effort. Implication Strengthen the resource base and organisational pos itioning of health communication and marketing staf f. WP 8: Testing effective behavioural intervention and communication strategies Angie Fagerlin, University of Michigan and VA Ann A rbor Aaron Scherer, University of Michigan Enny Das, Radboud University Nijmegen Megan Knaus, University of Michigan Brian Zikmund-Fisher, University of Michigan Aims Aim 1: To determine effective communication strategies across European countries. Aim 2: To determine whether effective communication strategies differs across participant characteristics across European countries. Countries surveyed Netherlands Germany UK Countries to be surveyed Poland, Hungary or Czech Republic Spain, Italy Sweden, Denmark Methods: 5 Internet Based Studies Study 1: What factors of a pandemic most influence participants' knowledge, risk perceptions, and behavioral intentions? (Conducted in Netherlands) Study 2: What is the best way to graphically communicate numerical information ? (Conducted in UK) Study 3: Can including stories about affected patients influence participants' know ledge, risk perceptions, and behavioral intentions? (Condu cted in Germany) Study 4: How does the language used to describe influenza and vaccines influence participants' knowledge, risk perceptions, and behav ioral intentions? (Conducted in UK) Flu label (H11N3 influenza vs. Horse flu vs. Yarra man flu) Vaccine: Technological vs. Natural, vs. None Vaccine mechanism: Nasal spray vs Shot Study 5: Can the use of metaphors influence participants' knowledge, risk perceptions, and behavioral intentions? (Conducted in UK) Weed vs. Army vs. No metaphor Findings: Studies 1-2 Study 1 (Factors of virus): To encourage vaccinations , the most important piece of information to emphas ize (of those we tested) is the severity of the average case of influenza . Neither quickness of spread nor severity of the mo st severe case influenced vaccinations. Similar findings for other health behavior intentio ns. Risk perceptions were most influenced by spread o f disease , followed by severity of the average case of influenza. Study 2 (Graphical communication of risk): The best graphical representation of risk is heat map , worst graphic is dot map. Responsibility for the information in this presenta tion lies entirely with the authors. The European Commission is not responsible for any use that may be made of the information contained h erein. Best and Worst Graphical Representation of Risk xx Findings Studies 3 Study 3 (Use of stories): People were less worried about getting sick if tol d other people were vaccinated. Belief in herd immunity to protect them Findings Studies 4-5 Study 4 (Language) Flu label: People in the horse flu condition perceived the flu as less of a threat, less likely to spread, and less severe than participants in the H11N3 and/or Yarraman flu conditions. H11N3 had least impact on people's likelihood to read about the pandemic, t hink about or talk to others about the pandemic in order to protect one self. No effect on preference for vaccination use. No effects of natural vs. technological language o r vaccine mechanism Study 5 (Metaphors) No main effect of metaphor use or type The weed metaphor works best for people high in naturalist orientatio n Army metaphor works best for people high in aversion to war and f or people high in naturalist orientation Individual Characteristics Measures typically included in all studies Literacy Trust Minimizer/maximizer Be-the-one Results No consistent finding across every study. Study 1 (severity of cases): Higher literacy indiv iduals were more influenced by the average case information. Study 4 (language study): Those higher in literacy were more likely to get v accinated when called H11N3 influenza and when natural language is used. Study 5 (metaphor study): Those higher in literacy were more likely to get va ccinated when received weed metaphor. Implications Information to focus on in communicating to the pub lic: Severity of AVERAGE case (not most severe case) Need to better communicate about herd immunity Even though dot maps look cool, they are the least t rusted and least effective methods to communicate risk information. Heat maps were more effective. More technical language (e.g., H1N1) may not be the most effective method of communicating about a infectious disease to the pub lic. The risk message we tested seem to work equally wel l (or equally poorly) across audiences (but many more analyses need to be done b efore can say with certainty) It takes two to tangoThe current reality Public health institutes and officials: /head2rightbombard health care workers with an overload of inf ormation /head2rightignore feedback from local health care staff /head2rightprovide inconsistent messages in the media /head2rightuse the media insufficiently /head2rightmaintain a non-transparent decision process for con trol measures Consequence: Decreased population acceptance of proposed measure s It takes two to tango Public health authorities have a tendency to rely o n one-way communication. Our advice: 1. Local and national public health authorities shou ld prepare for meaningful communication with front line health car e staff and the media, and adjust the communication messages, strat egies and policies accordingly. 2. Invest in new and effective communication systems and technologies, which help minimising information overload and burd en on the limited time in crisis situations. A new reality /head2rightAction is taken ahead of time through the development and maintenance of productive communication channels and partnershi ps. Thus optimal use is made of the spotlight moment when media attention f or threatening outbreaks is at its height. /head2rightThere will be ongoing and evolving knowledge on sen timents regarding vaccination in the population and divergent opinion s would not be seen as threats but as opportunities for timely strengthening of public health responses during pandemics. /head2rightCommunication of interventions requiring behavioura l changes are handled at the highest policy level with sufficient means to convey coordinated, trustworthy and consistent messages an d plans of action. /head2rightFull use is made of a modern system of online and interactive communication channels to support professionals at all levels to do their job effectively and help them through the forest of inf ormation overload.
