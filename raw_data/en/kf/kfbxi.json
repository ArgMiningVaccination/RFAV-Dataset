Getting COVID-19 If you choose to get vaccinated Getting vaccinated is not a guarantee you will not get COVID-19, but vaccinated people are 91% less likely to get COVID-19. Those who do get COVID-19 (a breakthrough infection) experience mild symptoms, if any at all. If you choose not to get vaccinated True, you may not get COVID-19, but unvaccinated people are 5 times more likely to get COVID-19 than vaccinated people. Severe Illness If you choose to get vaccinated Your chance of getting seriously ill from the vaccine is about 0.012%. Vaccinated people who do get COVID-19 experience mild symptoms\u2014only 0.003% of breakthrough cases require hospitalization. If you choose not to get vaccinated Unvaccinated people are 29 times more likely to be hospitalized for their infections. Most people in the hospital also have underlying conditions (such as diabetes and heart or liver conditions), which help the disease progress more easily. Illness from the Vaccine If you choose to get vaccinated The vaccines are extremely safe. Worldwide more than 3.5 billion people have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccines continue to undergo the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. If you choose not to get vaccinated COVID-19 is highly contagious, and since many people infected with COVID-19 may not show symptoms, you risk passing the virus on to vulnerable friends and family members. Allergic Reactions If you choose to get vaccinated Allergic reactions are rare and usually mild. According to the national Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), fewer than 5 people per million have a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. The rate is fewer than 3 people per million for Moderna. If you choose not to get vaccinated You will avoid the chance of an allergic reaction, but your body will not have help in developing immunity to COVID-19. There is no way to predict how successful or unsuccessful your body's immune response will be without the vaccine's help. Side Effects If you choose to get vaccinated Most people have only minor side effects, like fatigue, headache, and pain at the injection site. These usually go away within a few days. Some people have no side effects at all. If you choose not to get vaccinated You will avoid the chance of temporary side effects, but your body will not have help developing immunity to COVID-19. 1 in 6 people who get the disease will have severe problems, such as trouble breathing. Long COVID-19 If you choose to get vaccinated Fully vaccinated people are 47% less likely to get Long COVID, if they get a breakthrough infection. If you choose not to get vaccinated 10% of people who have COVID-19 experience lingering symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, \"brain fog\" and trouble sleeping. It is unknown who will get these symptoms, how long they'll last or the best way to treat them. Protecting You and Your Baby If you choose to get vaccinated Ongoing research shows that the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy for mother or child. If you choose not to get vaccinated The physical demands of pregnancy put women without the COVID-19 vaccine at a higher risk of pregnancy loss, delivering early, or dying.
