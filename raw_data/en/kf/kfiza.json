Patch Tests If you are booking a facial with me, I will ask you about the condition of your skin, and then send you a list of ingredients I intend on using, It is probable that you will not know whether or not you are allergic to these, if you have never come in to contact, or used them before. There is less chance of you having an allergic reaction to these ingredients as they are natural, however, it is possible to arrange a patch test with me. If you would like to do so, I will prepare a small sample pot for you that you will be able to collect from me, and do a skin patch test in the inside of your elbow prior to your full facial booking. Patch tests are non essential, but you will be required to sign a disclaimer for all sessions. (I can not be held accountable to any reactions you may have during or after the facial) "}
