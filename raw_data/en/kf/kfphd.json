Key Facts [According to](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-takeda-says-human-error-caused-contamination-moderna-vaccines-2021-10-01/) Reuters, Takeda said in a new report that the Spanish factory where the vaccine was manufactured had discovered contaminants in some vials, but doses from the same production batch were allowed to be shipped to Japan. An investigation carried out by Moderna and the Spanish manufacturer Rovi found that the issue was caused by incorrect assembly due to a visual misjudgment of the required 1mm gap between the stopper lids on the vials and the machinery that is used to insert them. A total of five lots of the vaccines were affected by the manufacturing issue, three of which were shipped to Japan after passing inspection, before later being recalled. The fourth and fifth lots were held back by Rovi after failing inspection on July 2 and Takeda and the Japanese health ministry were informed about the issue. However, contaminants were later found inside at least 39 vials in Japan in late August and testing showed that the particles were stainless steel. Key Background In August, the Japanese government [suspended](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/08/26/japan-halts-use-of-163-million-moderna-doses-over-contamination-concerns/?sh=5aaa1ad37603) the distribution of around 1.63 million doses of the Moderna vaccine after the contaminants were discovered in some vials. At the time Moderna said that only 565,400 doses were part of the same production line where the issue was reported, but it had also pulled two adjacent lots \"out of an abundance of caution.\" After the suspension, Japanese health officials are [investigating](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/newpage_20757.html) the deaths of at least two men who had been inoculated with doses from the suspended lot. While experts were [skeptical](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/08/30/national/contaminated-moderna-vaccine-explainer/) about the possibility of the contaminants causing the two deaths, there were fears it could help fan vaccine hesitancy in the country. According to a study [published](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31558-0/fulltext) by the medical journal Lancet last year, Japan has one of the lowest rates of confidence in vaccine safety and effectiveness in the world. Big Number 59.5%. That's the percentage of Japan's population that has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to Bloomberg's [tracker](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/?sref=CSMHWBLp). After initially being criticized for a slow start, Japan's vaccine rollout quickly gathered pace over the last few months. The country has also seen a steep decline in the total number of new infections which has prompted the government to [lift](https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2021/09/28/after-five-months-of-restrictions-japan-will-lift-covid-19-state-of-emergency-nationwide/?sh=2c67d9cd65ca) all pandemic emergency measures.
