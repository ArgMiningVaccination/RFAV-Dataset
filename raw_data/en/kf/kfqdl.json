The workshop was hosted by Ms Soledad CABEZ \u00d3N RUIZ (MEP) and Mr Alojz PETERLE (MEP) , Co-Chairs of the Health Working Group within the ENVI Committee. The Chair, Mr Peterle, opened the workshop by highlighting that the acceptance of complementary and alternative therapies (CAMs) varies across the EU Member States (MS). This creates barriers which reduce the accessibility of patients to CAMs. Mr Peterle stated that if a level playing field can be achieved betwee n MS, then the freedom of movement of drugs, practitioners and patients will be faci litated. The Co - Chair, Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz, stated that three issues should be discussed during the workshop: the requirements that should be prioritised when considering CAMs; scientific evidence regarding their effects; and how they should be regulated. The first part of the workshop focused on the current state of play of complementary and alternative therapies in Europe. Dr NICOLAI, EUROCAM Spokesperson, opened the session b y providing an overview of CAMs in Europe. He started his presentation by describing the increasing demand for CAMs in Europe, with one out of two European citizens using CAMs either by consulting CAM professional s or purchasing CAMs -related products. Furt hermore, he explained that a growing number of conventional doctors are referring patients to CAM professionals. Hospitals are also offering integrated solutions with CAM options. Further, Dr Nicolai remarked the fragmentation within the EU as regards CAM recognition and regulation. He finalised his presentation by emphasising the fundamental differences between conventional and CAM therapies. Dr Nicolai highlighted that the two systems should be interwoven, bearing in mind the crucial role played by conven tional medicine when it comes to treating life -threatening diseases. Dr WEID ENHAMMER, Coordinator of the CAM brella project, focused his presentation on the status of research on CAM across the EU. He began his presentation with an overview of the status of CAM research in terms of quantity and quality. With regard to quantity, he observed that there have been many improvements in the past 25 years as regards the amount of research carried out on CAM therapies. As regards the quality, he noted that studies must include a range of factors, such as the success rate of a particular therapy for different health conditions in order to be successful. Moreover, he described the complexity of study finding s, with many producing inconclusiv e results that are subject to discussion. Lastly, he briefly presented the CAMbrella report, which was supported by the European Commission, and whose main aim was to assess the CAM field for future research at European level. He concluded his presentation by highlighting the importance of public funding for CAM research and by underscoring that research should also focus on medical practitioners' experiences with CAM therapies. The second part of the workshop focused on the policy and public health perspectives of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine. Ms MATHIEU -MENDES, Deputy Head of Unit of Unit B.4. Medical products: quality, safety and innovation at the European Commission (DG SANTE), gave a presentation on the legal and policy framework of CAMs in Europe. She outlined the legislative framework of herbal and homeopathic medicines. She remarked that in 2004, new laws were drafted for the authorisation of these products that did not require clinical trials but instead proof of Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 6 PE614.180 use for 30 years and evidence of the medicine's benefits. However, she noted that companies find this system burdensome and continue to use the normal system of authorisation requiring clinical trials. She also stressed that companies choosing to register product s as food additives further complicates the regulation of such products. The European Commission's aim for the coming years is to facilitate the implementation of the rules rather than to change them in order to ensure the safety of CAM products and their free movement in the EU . The final speaker of the afternoon was Dr ESPINOSA, Consultant in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCI) Unit, at the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s Department of Service Delivery and Safety (SDS). He spok e about the integration of CAMs into EU healthcare systems. He emphasised the importance of integrating the benefits of the conventional and CAM medical approaches in the interest of patients, as well as the need for a dialogue between both sides. He also observed that alternative practice in one country may be considered as conventional in another country. However, all countries are united in their need for further research and guidance as to how CAM should be regulated and monitored. The WHO is therefore developing several guidance documents, some of which Dr Espinosa described, on how WHO MS can successfully introduce CAM into their healthcare services by ensuring the quality, safety and effectiveness of services. In his closing remarks, the Chair Mr Pete rle thanked the speakers and stressed the importance of the benefits that CAM therapies will bring to patients in the EU, namely a more varied choice of therapies. The discussion should not be dominated by setting the two ideologies, conventional and CAM, against each other, but rather by integrating them for the benefit of the patients. Complementary and alternative therapies for patients today and tomorrow PE 614.180 7 EU POLICY CONTEXT Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) cover a variety of medical systems, products and practices that are usually not part of conventional health care1. While grouped under the same definition, complementary and alternative medicines represent two different practices. Complementary medicine r efers to all treatments used alongside conventional medical treatments. For instance, acupuncture can support cancer treatment or yoga can reduce anxiety. Alternative medicine, on the other hand, comprises treatments that are used instead of standard medic al treatments. One example is using a special diet to treat cancer instead of undergoing surgery prescribed by an oncologist2. In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued the Global Atlas of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a re view-based overview of the status of CAM across the world. According to the study, chiropractic manipulation, homeopathy, phytotherapy/herbal medicine, and massage are among the most used CAM therapies3. In Europe, an increasing number of EU citizens are o pting for CAM therapies to complement or treat their diseases4. The European Commission estimates that consumers' spending on CAM is almost EUR 100 million5. The number of CAM -trained practitioners is also growing. In Europe, CAM is practiced by approxim ately 145.000 physicians (trained in both conventional medicine and CAM therapies), as well as more than 160.000 non -medical practitioners. These figures show that in Europe there are almost 65 CAM providers per 100.000 inhabitants6. The growing use of CAM among European citizens and practitioners creates a regulatory challenge for the European Union. The regulation of CAM varies between MS with regards to its definition, the person entitled to practice it, the system of authorisations and reimbursement, an d the resources to finance it. For example, in some countries, alternative therapies are provided outside conventional health care institutions, whereas in others they are provided as part of conventional health care services. Moreover, in some MS, CAM can only be provided by medical practitioners, whereas in others, non -medical practitioners may also provide certain alternative therapies. In additional some CAM health -related topics fall under the exclusive competences of the MS , which makes a harmonised a pproach even more difficult7. Together these factors create barriers which hamper the creation of a pan -European 1 While CAM has been defined by the CAMbrella project, there is currently no globally accepted definition. 2 Tabish, S.

Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 8 PE614.180 Regulation of CAM professions, i nhibit the development of cross -border research, and ultimately reduce accessibility of CAM to patients. The Eu ropean Union has taken several steps towards an EU -wide harmonisation of CAM therapies. In 1992, the EU issued Directive 92/73/EEC, the first legal instrument regulating CAM8, which was repealed in 2001 by the \"[Homeopathic] Medicinal Products Directive\" 9. This Directive, together with the Herbal Medicine Directive10, aims to provide patients with enough information so as to ensure the safety and good quality of traditional medicinal products on the market. To this end, the Directives have introduced specia l authorisation and registration procedures for CAM products. Furthermore, both the European Parliament11 and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe12 have recommended a stronger harmonization of non -conventional medicine in Europe and have called upon MS to support comparative studies and research programmes on this matter. In 2010 the CAM Interest Group was founded as an informal group of members of the European Parliament with a special interest in Complementary and Alternative Medicine. T his Interest Group aims to put and keep CAM on the EU policy agenda, generate discussions and actions in that area, as well as to promote awareness about CAM and other holistic approaches13. The EU has also provided funding opportunities to CAM research pr ogrammes. In 2012 the European Commission's Directorate -General f or Research and Innovation founded the CAM brella project: a three year survey of the status of CAM in Europe between 2010 and 201214. The goal of the project was to develop a roadmap for futur e European research in CAM appropriate for the health care needs of EU citizen. The findings of the project were published in April 2013, and showed a lack of data concerning the efficacy of CAM treatments, as well as a lack of commonly agreed standards co ncerning definition, legal status, and provisions of CAM. The project also concluded that there is a lack of integration of CAM into national public health systems, as well as an inadequate availability of research facilities. 8 Council Directive 92/73/EEC of 22 September 1992 widening the scope of Directives 65/65/EEC a nd 75/319/EEC on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to medicinal products and laying down additional provisions on homeopathic medicinal products, OJ L 297, 13.10.1992, p. 8 -11, available at: http://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31992L0073 (accessed August 2017). 9 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 Nov ember 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, OJ L 311, 28.11.2001, p. 67 -128, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol - 1/dir_2001_83_cons2009/2001_83_cons2009_en.pdf (accessed August 2017). 10 Directive 2004/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending, as regards tradition al herbal medicinal products, Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, OJ L 136, 30.4.2004, p. 85 -90, available at: https://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol -1/dir_2004_24/dir_2004_24_en.pdf (accessed August 2017). 11 European Parli ament, 1997, Resolution on the status non -conventional available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef= -//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A4 -1997- 0075+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN (accessed August 2017). 12 Council of Europe, Parliamentary Assembly of the, Resolution 1206(1999), A European approach to non - conventional medicines, available at: http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref -XML2HTML - en.asp?fileid=16727&lang=en (accessed August 2017). 13 Cam Interest Group, available at: http://www.cam -europe.eu/cam -interest - group -meetings.php (accessed CAMbrella project, official webpage, available at: http://www.cambrella.eu/home.php ?

Complementary and alternative therapies for patients today and tomorrow PE 614.180 9 Internationally, the WHO's W orld Health Assembly adopted two resolutions in 2009 and 2014 respectively, urging countries to: i) integrate CAMs in national public health systems; ii) to promote the safety and quality of CAM; iii) to establish a system of qualification for CAM professi onals; and iv) to increase the availability and affordability of CAM15. Coordinated actions are thus critical to regulate CAM professions throughout the EU. The role of CAM should be taken into account throughout the entire health spectrum: from a general holistic perspective to CAM specific treatments. The process, in particular, should aim at fostering high quality research to obtain reliable information on CAM costs, safety and effectiveness, and supply the evidenc e base which would enables European citizens and policymakers to make informed decisions about CAM and ultimately integrate it in to the EU and MS health policy agenda s. 15 WHO's World Health Assembly, 2009, Resolution WHA 62.13 on Traditional Medicine, available at: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js21477en/ (accessed August 20 17); WHO's World Health Assembly, 2014, Resolution WHA 67.18 on Traditional Medicine, available at: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js21462en/ (accessed August 2017); Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 10 PE614.180 PROCEE DINGS OF THE WORKSHOP 1.1. Introduction 1.1.1. opening MEP Mr Alojz PETERLE , Co-Chair, ENVI Health Working Group Mr Alojz PETERLE, MEP, opened the workshop by welcoming those in attendance . He stressed the importance of considering the perspective of the patient, dra wing on his own experiences as a cancer patient . He said that pa tients do not discuss the ideologies or differences behind treatments, but are merely interested in what treatments work best for them. He noted, however, that attitudes to complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) vary greatly between Member States (M S) in Europe. Patients and practitioners alike lament these differences, and this has led to calls for help from the EU institutions regarding the best therapies, products, and knowledge. MEP Ms Soledad CABEZ\u00d3N RUIZ, Co -Chair, ENVI Health Working Group Ms Soledad CABEZ \u00d3N RUIZ began her statement by recognising that the issue of CAM can be considered from two different perspectives. She noted that there are three basic issues that need consideration: the definition of CAM, especially given that there are more than 100 different types of CAM; the scientific evidence and how CAM can be regulated. Mr Peterle then gave the floor to the first speaker. 1.2. Part I: The current state of play of complementary and alternative therapies (cam) in E urope 1.2.1. Overview of CAM therapies in Europe Dr Ton NICOLAI, EUROCAM Spokesperson Dr Ton NICOLAI began his presentation by addressing the question of what CAM is, and the benefits and limitations. He noted that CAM is a societal phenomenon throughou t the western world, and its use has sharply increased in the last two decades. He attributed this to the increasing number of people who feel personally responsible for their own health, and who have holistic views. Such people, according to Dr Nicolai, are dissatisfied with conventional medicine and its unpleasant side effects and the (life)long regimes, opting instead for more gentle therapies. Dr Nicolai stated that half of all European citizens use CAM either by seeing a professional, or using over-the-counter remedies. Dr Nicolai noted that this figure is higher among those citizens suffering from chronic disease. Despite this, a CAMbrella survey of EU citizens showed that the majority of patients want conventional doctors to have more knowledge and advice regarding CAM. Dr Nicolai then presented some figures - noting th at in Europe there are 150,000 medical doctors with additional CAM qualification, and more than 180,000 CAM practitioners that do not have a full medical education. The most common treatments practiced by medical doctors are acupuncture, homeopathy, naturopathy, anthroposophic medicine, and neural theory. Those practicing without a full medical training provide mostly herbalism, manu al therapies (osteopathy, chiropractic), reflexology, shiatsu, yoga, tai chi and qigong. Complementary and alternative therapies for patients today and tomorrow PE 614.180 11 In Europe, Dr Nicolai mentioned, an increasing number of doctors are referring patients to CAM professionals, more hospitals provide integrated solutions with CAM , and CAM is playing a larger role in universities and education . Despite this, less than one third of EU MS have legislation on CAM in general . It must be noted that in some MS, CAM is included in health laws, and in some countries, no medicines are registere d. This disparity is also reflected in the regulation of professionals. In some countries only doctors with CAM qualifications can provide such services, i n others, anyone can practice. Dr Nicolai then introduced several examples. He gave the context of a patient affected by highly virulent bacteria. In such a case, antibiotics will save his life. However, if a patient has recurrent but less serious infections, repeated antibiotic use will lead to antimicrobial resistance. Instead, the susceptibility of pa tients needs to be considered, as well as the role of CAM in diminishing susceptibility and enhance the patient's level of health and resilience. In Dr Nicolai's second example, a patient suffering from asthma or migraines or hypertension may be prescri bed the long -term use of convention prescription drugs, which are not an effective final solution. However, a CAM practitioner would look for whatever makes the patient susceptible to these illnesses. Dr Nicolai then explained the difference between con ventional and CAM approaches. The essential difference, according to Dr Nicolai, lies in the basic concepts of health and disease. In western biomedical science, the mind and body are separated, with the body considered a complex machine. Diseases therefor e results from tissue or biochemical disruption , and treatment is a matter of combatting disease by intervening in the pathological process, using prescription drugs or surgery etc. Treatments are standardised, following protocols and guidelines, and docto rs are primarily responsible for the patient, who passively receives treatment. Dr Nicolai noted that this approach has many benefits, from blood transfusions to vaccinations to the use of antibiotics and chemotherapy, but it also has disadvantages and lim itations. Biomedicine usually manages symptoms of chronic diseases, rather than restoring patients. Prescription drugs are costly and many patients die from effects of them , or develop a life -long dependency. On the other hand, the CAM model sees humans as adaptable, self -regulating, creative biological systems. Patients themselves take responsibility for their health, and care is individualised, with responsibility shared between physician and patient. Treatme nt includes mobilising and stimulating the self -regulating capacity, restoring the balance in the psychosomatic system with the eventual aim of creating and maintaining the health and wellbeing, and reinforcing the autonomy and resilience of the patient. Benefits of the CAM model include supporting and inducing cell -regenerating processes of the patient, which reduces the need for high -cost interventions. In addition, CAM is safe with hardly any effects, and a reduction in prescription drugs reduces the problems of dependency and antimicrobial resistance. CAM also has high patient satisfaction, increased quality of life and reduced cost. Yet, as Dr Nicolai pointed out, CAM is not without limitations. In the case of serious diseases like cancer, sepsis, etc. , protection of life must always have priority over CAM. In addition, in a number of EU MS, CAM practices and medicinal products are unregulated and may pose risks to the health and safety of patients. Dr Nicolai stressed that CAM professionals should therefore be regulated, based on clearly defined qualifications and competences, as should CAM products. Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 12 PE614.180 Dr Nicolai concluded by saying that both models are needed to both fight and destroy the enemy and strengthen the home forces. There is a definite need fo r a balanced and collaborative approach. This approach has been growing in the US Academic Consortium for Integrative M edicine & Health in the US, which is made up of 70 highlight esteemed academic centres, including Harvard Medical School, Yale University , Stanford University, Mayo Clinic, etc. Dr Nicolai noted that CAM should be included in all EU policies, and CAM products and services should be accessible and affordable for all EU citizens who wish to make use of it. Dr Nicolai finished with a quote fr om Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director -General 2006 - 2017. \"The two systems of traditional and Western medicine need not clash. Within the context of primary health care, they can blend together in a beneficial harmony, using the best features of each system and compensating for certain weaknesses in each. This is not something that will happen all by itself. Deliberate policy decisions have to be made...The time has never been better, and the reasons never greater, for giving traditional medicine its proper place in addressing the many ills that face all our modern - and our traditional - societies\". 1.2.2. The status of research on CAM across the EU Dr Wolfgang WEIDENHAMMER, Coordinator of the CAMBRELLA project Dr Wolfgang WEIDENHAMMER began his presentation by stating that the status of CAM research, in terms of both quality and quantity, started off poor, but has gotten much better in the last 25 years. Despite this, there is still a need for improvement. Dr Weidenhamme r presented a graph showing the number of publica tions in scienti fic medical pap ers in the past 25 years has increased at a satisfying rate. Despite this, this does not show the full picture. The question \"does CAM work\" cannot be answered - there are many different CAM mo dels and hundreds of medical con ditions where CAM methods claim to be beneficial, and all combinations should be explored in research. The field of research is large and complex, and made up of many elements , not least because patients may be using a combination of CAM . Dr Weidenhammer took acupuncture as an example. He referenced a recent review of acupuncture16, which screened a total of 136 systematic reviews, covering more than 122 different medical conditions . This review included po oled data fro m more than 1,000 randomised controlled trials. The study built categories based on evidence levels. Out of 122 conditions, eight showed strong evidence of effect from acupuncture , 38 found moderate evidence. 71 showed unclear/mixed evidence. This last category is subject to scientifi c discussion. Some say this is proof of evidence, others say it is not. Dr Weidenhammer referred the audience to his slides (see Annex 3) for a list of the diseases affected (or not) by acupuncture. Dr Weidenhammer then turned to the example of homeopathy17, which was subject to a similar study , looking at over 200 different trials . 41 trials found homeopathy was effective, however, the largest share of the results were inconclusive. Dr Weidenhammer noted that the situation can be seen either optimistically or pessimistically, however, it shows there is a need to review and process all the evidence . 16 McDonald J, Janz S. The Acupuncture Evidence Project: A Comparative Literature Review (Revised edition). Brisbane: Australian Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine Association Ltd; 2017. 17 http://faculty ofhomeopathy.org/research/ Complementary and alternative therapies for patients today and tomorrow PE 614.180 13 Dr Weidenhammer then focused his presentation on the CAMbrella project . It was originally started in 2010 as a three -year project with financial support from the 7th Framework Programme. It was set up as a coordination action, rather than an official research collaborative project, designed to prepare the field for future CAM research. The work programme can be split into three broad tasks: the mapping of the curr ent situation of CAM in the EU (by comping existing information), developing a proposal for future CAM research (roadmap for future activities), and building a sustainable network of European CAM institutions relevant for research (coordination action). Dr Weidenhammer explained it was made up of a consortium of 16 beneficiaries from 12 different European countries, covering about three quarters of the European population. It also consisted of an advisory board consisting of many organisations for different CAM modalities. Dr Weidenhammer referred the audience to his presentation slides again (see Annex 3) for an overview of the seven work programmes. He noted, however, that there was a lack of data for many, but did not e that the results of Work Programme 6 show that there is more and higher quality research done in US and Asia than in Europe. H e also noted that research needs to be more focused towards comparative effectiveness research, rather than focusing solely on randomised trials. The studies need to reflect daily practice rather than artificial studies carried out in controlled environments. In addition, Dr Weidenhammer mentioned that there is a need for funding research in the field, as there is little public funding national and EU -wide, aside from Horizon 2020. Dr Weidenhammer finished his presentation by presenting a graph showing the gap between research and medical practice, examining the impact of research on family medical practice. A survey18 asked 100 General Practitioners (GPs) how importan t different aspects are for daily work. The most important aspect was own experience, less important is meta analyses - showing that evidence based medicine is perceived as more useful. Dr Weidenhammer concluded that there is a need to push CAM research in to the field of public health, and political and scientific intent are needed. Ultimately, De Weidenhammer noted, nothing would be considered CAM, rather all possible contributions to help would be evaluated. 1.2.3. Questions & Answers After the conclusion of Dr Weidenhammer's presentation, Mr Peterle shared an anecdote about how he had met a lady in Ljublij ana who had to go to Austria to provide treatment to Slovenians . In Slovenia, a homeopathic practitioner by law needs a medical education, but, paradoxically, practicing homeopathy will result in losing medical licence. Mr Peterle stated that he could not understand that some patients have to travel long distances abroad , just for treatment that is provided ultimately by specialists of their home country. He then opened the floor for questions, and the first came from his co -chair Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz. She stated that there are some misconceptions regarding conventional medicine, and she would not agree with the statement that conventional medicine focuses solely on the dise ase rather than the patient. She also noted that psychosomatic elements affect many illnesses, leading to treatments beyond conventional medicine. For example, high blood pressure can certainly be caused by stress, and cannot be cured simply be ea ting a low -salt diet. 18 Icezser & Linde, FoKom 2 008 Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 14 PE614.180 Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz asked if the speakers recognise that alternatives to conventional medicines should not be recommended for serious conditions. She presented two points, in one, a family in Italy refused antibiotics resulting in the d eath of a child, and the second, she noted that in 1970 in China, the average life expectancy was 43 years. When western medicine was introduced, this rose to 76 years . For these reasons, she cautioned against relying solely on alternative or complementary medicines. Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz also spoke about the amount of research i n the field. She noted that scientific method s exist to test the effectiveness of medicine, including studies which can be replicated , and it should therefore be there for CAM as well. Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz stated that there is a need for patient security, and knowledge of what is best of the patient. Dr Nicolai took the floor first to respond to the comments. He stated that he fully agreed with Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz, that the focus should indeed be what is best for the patient. In the example Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz gave, it would a case of malpractice, rather than a case of homeopathy gone badly. He noted that if a doctor is well trained, he will know wh en to give antibiotics, and when to prescribe CAM therapies. He took cancer as an example - in such cases, conventional medicine is imperative. However, CAM therapies can lessen the side effects of chemotherapy and can help with the psychological stress. Dr Weidenhammer took the floor to add that there is a need for research on CAM - rather than blind advocacy. He stated that there is a need to know what kind of CAM works, and what kinds do not, and these studies must be carefully explored, especially with regard to the problem with placebo comparison. If a group of subjects who receive CAM treatments do better than a test group who receive conventional treatment, this must be recognised, even if it cannot be explained why it works. H owever, the topic is very complex, and thus further detail is beyond the scope of this workshop. Dr Nicolai added that there is a wealth of information on the effectiveness of CAM widely available, for example, online, however, also within the field of conventional medicine the re are many treatments which have not been proven by clinical evidence using a randomised clinical trial. For example, only about 10% of the guidelines of the US Clinical Heart Association is based on hard clinical evidence . Therefore, Dr Nicolai concluded , most evidence in both CAM and conventional medicine has to be based on clinical experience. 1.3. Part II: Traditional, complemen tary and alternative medicine: P olicy and public health perspectives 1.3.1. The legal and policy framework of CAM in Europe Ms Agnes MATHIEU -MENDES, European Commission, DG SANTE, Deputy Head of Unit, Medical products: quality, safety, innovation Ms MATHIEU -MENDES started off her presentation by stating the definition of a 'medicinal product', as understood under EU law, which is a product presented to treat disease that is produced by industrial processes. A medicinal product has to comply with rules in order to ensure that it is safe, of good quality, and efficient for the patient. These rules were introduced not only to protect public health but also to ensure the free movement of goods within the EU. Some time ago, the European Commission realised that they were not adapted to products including herbal medicines and homeopathic products. The rules proved to Complementary and alternative therapies for patients today and tomorrow PE 614.180 15 be too burdensome an d not suitable for the free circulation of products. It was then decided to adopt specific rules to ensure a regulatory framework for these products, as well as public health protection. Directive 2004/24/EC was adopted in 2004 for traditional herbal medicinal products. Nowadays the Directive's rules are well known to economic operators. It introduced a completely different system from that applicable to traditional medicines, where clinical trials (i.e. tests on animal and humans) are the norm. For tr aditional herbal medicinal products, only a plausible level of evidence of their medicinal use throughout a period of at least 30 years, including 15 years in EU, is necessary. This does not prevent companies from using other routes of authorisation, such as the 'well - established use' system where a company submits a dossier containing bibliographical information, or the normal procedure for medicinal products. Ms Mathieu -Mendes indicated that the regulatory framework for traditional herbal medicinal produc ts is unique and complex, since certain products can be marketed either as food or pharmaceutical products. Products treating diseases should in principle fall under pharmaceutical legislation. Nevertheless, over the years a number of economic operators ha ve used food supplement legislation to seek authorisations, since no indication of disease treatment is needed. Therefore, there is an alternative regulatory framework to the pharmaceutical legislation, and it is up to MS to classify products on a case by case basis, depending on their presentation and claimed effects. When the Directive was introduced, companies showed a lack of interest in the simplified registration procedure. However, over the years, companies have understood the process and submitted a pplications. Since December 2015, more than 2629 applications have been received, and at least 1577 traditional use registrations were granted by MS. It can therefore be said today that the Directive works, although some MS are using the simplified framewo rk more than others, due to the presence of food legislation. There is a notable difference in the implementation and uptake of the Directive between MS. Ms Mathieu -Mendes then went on to talk about the work done within the EU on the subject. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) carries out scientific work on herbal medicines, while the Council of Europe establishes standards of quality. Meanwhile, the European Commission drafts decisions as regards the list of entry of herbal substances (i.e. for use in tra ditional herbal medicinal products). The list is currently limited to 10 herbal substances, such as melaleuca alternifolia. At the end of the day it is up to MS competent authorities to grant the marketing authorisations to herbal medicine producers. A cha llenge experienced by the European Commission as regards the Directive is the fact that it has received complaints from economic operators in the past years as regards the Directive's complexity. Consequently, a REFIT platform consisting of government play ers and other stakeholders analysed the complaints and issued an Opinion on the submission by businesses on the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive on 7 June 2017. The question of whether the legislation should be changed, at the risk of compro mising the protection of public health, is not being considered by the European Commission. It is currently waiting for the results of the REFIT evaluation of the regulation on health claims, since it is aware of companies' complaints as regards the imposs ibility to grant health claims for botanicals. Once it is published, it will be clearer whether the main problem lies with the Directive or the health claims. For the moment, the EC is of the opinion that legislation is relatively predictable for economic operators, and is focusing on making its implementation less burdensome. Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 16 PE614.180 Ms Mathieu -Mendes finished her presentation by briefly talking about the framework on homeopathic medicinal products (Directive 92/73/EC). The Directive introduced a simplified regist ration procedure only for homeopathic products administered orally or externally (i.e. not by injection), that have no specific indication on the labelling (i.e. cannot claim to treat diseases), and are enough diluted to guarantee the safety of the patient . Instead of demonstrating quality, safety and efficacy, as in the normal procedure for medicinal products, the quality of the homeopathic medicinal product is of importance here. 1.3.2. Integrating CAM into EU healthcare systems Dr St\u00e9phane ESPINOSA, World Health Organization (WHO), Consultant in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCI) Unit in the Department of Service Delivery and Safety (SDS) Dr St\u00e9phane ESPINOSA started his presentation by reading out a statement from the senior management of the World Health Organisation (WHO). The integration of traditional and complementary medicine into national health systems provides solutions for strengthening health systems in terms of service delivery, workforce, infrastructure, medical products and information exchange. An increasing number of patients want a more integrated approach to medical care, which is adapted to their individual needs and preferences. However, there exists a dichotomy in the medical world where professionals fro m the traditional and complementary medicine systems are not communicating. The WHO encourages further dialogue between them, in order to meet and better integrate the different approaches to healthcare. The inclusion of traditional and complementary medic ine in the universal health coverage umbrella should be based on indicators with the same standards as for Western medicine. This covers workforce competency and good data on the safety, quality and effectiveness of traditional and complementary medical pr oducts and practices obtained, while applying the full range of evidence instruments from randomised controlled trials to qualitative research. Dr Espinosa then gave a brief introduction on the importance of terminology, highlighting that at the WHO the fo cus lies on traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM). It is aware that a medical system perceived as traditional in one country may be seen as complementary in another. Furthermore, instead of alternative medicine, the WHO is focusing on integrative m edicine. The reason is that with integrative medicine there is an emphasis on the benefits of various medical systems at the health system level, whereas with alternative medicine there is a situation of distant or separate approaches. Examples of the succ essful integration of various medical systems are China (service delivery) and India (workforce). In China there is a State administration regulating traditional Chinese medicine, which represents 18% of medical visits (900 million visits/year) and 16% of inpatients (13 million patients/year). In India, there is a Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH). There are over 780,000 registered AYUSH practitioners, and 1 million village -based AYUSH health practitioners. In 2012 the WHO asked countries what the challenges are that they face with respect to regulatory issues in the field of traditional and complementary medicine. The majority of countri es shared the same concerns. Dr Espinosa referred to the third slide in his presentation (available in Annex 3) when presenting the survey results. The main concern is a lack of research data. In second and third place respectively are concerns over the lack of appropriate mechanisms to control and regulate traditional Complementary and alternative therapies for patients today and tomorrow PE 614.180 17 and comple mentary medicine advertising and claims, as well as herbal products. Taking this into account, and bearing in mind the importance played by traditional and complementary medicine in various aspects of health systems such as service delivery and workforce ( fourth slide of presentation), the WHO consequently set out different areas of work that are currently being developed. In 2014 the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014 -2023 was published, which has two goals. The first is to make sure that the potential contribution of T&CM to health, wellness, people -centred health care and universal health coverage is harnessed. Secondly, the safe and effective use of T&CM through the regulation, research and integration of T&CM products, practices and practitioners in to the health system should be promoted. As part of the Strategy, three strategic objectives are currently being worked on. The first is to build a knowledge base for the management of T&CM through policies. The second is to strengthen quality assurance, s afety, proper use and effectiveness by regulation. Finally, the third one is to promote universal health coverage by integrating T&CM. This comes within the context of the World Health Assembly (WHA) Resolution on Traditional Medicine (WHA67.18) adopted in May 2014. It urges MSs to adapt, adopt and implement the WHO strategy as a basis for national T&CM programmes and/or work plans. Furthermore, MS should develop and implement working plans to integrate traditional medicine into health services, particularl y at the primary healthcare level, as well as report to the WHO on progress in implementing the strategy. In return, the Resolution requests the WHO Director General to facilitate MS implementation of the WHO strategy, as well as provide policy and technic al guidance on how to integrate T&CM into healthcare systems, and help ensure the safety, quality and effectiveness of T&CM services. Of further relevance is the WHA Resolution on Strengthening Integrated, People -Centered Health Services (WHA69.24) adopted in May 2016. It urges WHO MS to integrate T&CM into modern health services, based on knowledge - based policies, while assuring the safety, quality and effectiveness of health services and taking into account a holistic approach to health. The implementatio n of the WHO's T&CM work strategy has been rolled out into five articulated work areas. Dr Espinosa referred to the slides in the second half of his presentation when talking about these work areas. The first focuses on leadership, namely in helping MS integrate T&CM into their national health systems (i.e. developing best practices), while ensuring the quality and safety of T&CM services, and facilitating the networking of T&CM professionals and regulators. Secondly, the work area on research and knowledge aims to build a large database with an access platform on T&CM clinical evidence, as well as a T&CM knowledge platform. The WHO will also coordinate and support collaborative research projects enabling stakeholders from different WHO MS to share their exp eriences. The third work area focuses on the normative aspect of regulating T&CM. This includes the developing of technical documents, including guidelines on the quality and safety of herbal medicines. Furthermore, as part of its work on improving the int ernational terminology and classification of T&CM, a Chapter on traditional medicine has been added to the international classification of diseases (currently being revised by the WHO). This further enables the use of traditional medicine in an integrative medicine context. Benchmarks for T&CM practices such as acupuncture and Ayurveda have also been developed under this third work area. Under its fourth work area, concerning the building of institutional capacity, the WHO has run a series of interregional training workshops for the capacity -building of government officials, as well as formulated capacity -building tools (i.e. benchmarks for training in T&CM practices). Lastly, under Policy Department A: Economic and Scientific Policy 18 PE614.180 its fifth work area focusing on evidence -based policy and monitoring and ass essing, the WHO supports countries to implement the WHO strategy on T&CM, as well as monitors their progress, and conducts global surveys for the building of a database to be used as a repository for WHO MS experiences. Dr Espinosa concluded his presentati on with a key message, which is that both the patients and wider public will benefit from the integration of Western medicine and T&CM into health systems, bearing in mind that quality, safety and effectiveness are ensured . 1.3.3. Questions & Answers Mr Peterle opened the floor for discussion. Mr Madan THANGAVELU (European Ayurveda Association) remarked the importance of keeping the debate alive on the ne ed for CAM therapies. Leadership is needed in order to re-examine the current legislation in order to prioritise the medical practices that are most beneficial to our society. He cited the example of the UK, which spends 22 million pounds on a daily basis in order to tackle type 2 diabetes, a preventable condition in 70 -80% of cases. He further highlighte d that experts should be consulted by policymakers, and they should first and foremost bear in mind the patients' need for CAM therapies when debating new legislation. Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz highlighted the importance of research, using rigorous scientific methodologies, in order to prove the safety and quality of CAM therapies. There is irrefutable proof that conventional medicine has improved living standards and survival rates. In light of this, CAM therapies could never be present ed as an alternative, but rather as complementary options, since they cannot substitute for conventional medicine. Mr Peterle then asked Dr Espinosa and Ms Mathieu -Mendes how the EU and WHO can further collaborate in their work on CAM. He also asked Ms Mathieu -Mendes whether the European Commission is doing anything else to facilitate the integration of CAM into MS healthcare systems. Dr Espinosa first reacted to the comme nts made by Mr Thangavelu and Ms Cabez \u00f3n Ruiz. He emphasised the fact that the importance of T&CM var ies according to the country , namely whether it is a developing country and if it offers universal health coverage. However, the integration of T&CM impro ves health systems in all countries by making them more affordable and sustainable. As regards Mr Peterle' s question, Dr Espinosa answered that the WHO would like to have more collaboration with the EU and its MS on this topic. It has had contact with Euro pean officials on a national level, and would find it interesting to speak at a group level with European countries. Ms Mathieu -Mendes answered Mr Peterle's questions by stating that in the interest of maintaining public health, the European Commission rem ains dedicated to ensuring high standards of quality, safety and efficacy in its work concerning herbal medicines. As long as a product fulfils these criteria, it can be used within European health systems. She noted that the distinction between tradition al and complementary substances is blurred, since a number of herbal chemicals are currently being used in medicines in light of their disease -fighting properties. 1.3.4. Closing remarks by the Chair Mr Peterle thanked the speakers for their contributions and for sharing their knowledge on the topic . He remarked that both the Western and CAM medicine systems are part Complementary and alternative therapies for patients today and tomorrow PE 614.180 19 of what he describes as 'medicinal pluralism', implying that in democratic societies choice is preferred over monopolies. This choice should be made available to the patients that need it, while respecting certain criteria and principles (i.e. safety). MS should overcome their differences and share good practices, with the help of the European Commission. He mentioned the example of the Italian region of Tuscany , where the integrative medicine model has been introduced, as a good practice . The majority of hospitals there offer conventional and CAM therapies, with doctors referring patients to both. Mr Peterle concluded by stating that efficacy a nd patient - centeredness are two elements that should be prioritised in the future , in order to accelerate the progress in MS uptake of CAM therapies.
