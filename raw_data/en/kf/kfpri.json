The majority of older people do not consider themselves ill and therefore do not perceive themselves to be at risk ofserious consequences of influenza. 7Not coming forward for influenza vaccination is associated with fear of adverse sideeffects 8and the perception of not being susceptible to influenza.9However, among those who hold negative beliefs about the effectiveness and adverse consequences of thevaccine, information from a health visitor may encourageolder people to receive the influenza vaccine. 8 Effective interventions designed to improve the uptake of influenza vaccination among older people have ranged fromsimple personal invitation 10and postcard reminders,11 through mailed educational brochures,12to telephone reminders by practice nurses.13More intensive methods of approach appear to have a greater impact on uptake rates. The biggest predictor of accepting influenza vaccination iscontact with a doctor or nurse. 14 In the UK, the over-75 health checks represent the most structured method of preventive health care for older peo- ple. However, there is little evidence to support the routine use of preventive home visits to older people15and the intro- duction of over-75 health checks has been met with scepti-cism by general practitioners (GPs), although it remainspopular among older people themselves. 16The aim of the present study was to examine the impact on influenza vac- cination uptake of combining two services for older peoplein primary care: the over-75 health check and the influenzaimmunisation programme.

Contact with a doctor or nurse is associat-ed with older people deciding to accept influenza vaccination.Aim: To compare different forms of approach in improving uptake of influenza vaccination among patients aged 75 yearsand over in primary care. Design of study: Randomised controlled trial. Setting: One large rural general practice serving the town and surrounding area of Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.Method: All 2052 patients aged 75 years and over, registered with the practice and not living in nursing/residential homes orsheltered accommodation, were included in the study. One-thirdof patients were randomised to receive an offer of influenza vac-cination as part of an over-75 health check administered by apractice nurse in the patient's home, and two-thirds of patientswere randomised to receive a personal letter of invitation toattend an influenza vaccination clinic held at the surgery. Themain outcome measure was uptake of influenza vaccination.Results: Six hundred and eighty patients were randomised to the health check arm of the trial and 1372 were randomised toreceive a personal letter. Of those randomised to the health checkarm, 468 received the health check from the nurse. Overall, thedifference in influenza vaccination uptake was 6.4% (95% ( n= 932) of those who were sent a personal letter actually receiving thevaccine, compared with 74.3% ( n= 505) of those offered a com- bined health check and influenza vaccination ( P= 0.003). Conclusion: Combining home-based over-75 health checks with influenza vaccination can improve uptake among older patients.However, this intervention is likely to be costly and its effect oninfluenza vaccination rates is modest. The difference in uptake isgreater among those who do not routinely come forward for vac-cination and a more viable option may be to target aged; influenza vaccine; geriatric assessment; ran- domised controlled trial.Method Setting and selection criteria The study took place in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire where one large general practice (list size 34 000) is the sole provider of primary care services. Patients were eligible for the trial if they were aged 75 years and over on 22September 2000 and registered with the practice. Those who were living in residential care, nursing homes, or shel- tered accommodation were excluded from the study, asinfluenza vaccines are provided annually by a visiting prac-tice nurse for older people in these settings. The study was approved by Leicestershire Health Authority Research Ethics Committee. Interventions This study compared two forms of approach to maximiseuptake of influenza vaccination among older people. The first approach was a personal letter of invitation to attend any of the influenza vaccination clinics held at the surgery.The letter stressed the importance of preventing influenza and attempted to reassure patients that the vaccine was associated with few side effects. All letters were mailed at thebeginning of October 2000. The second approach was to combine an over-75 health check carried out by a practice nurse in the patient's home, with an offer of influenza vaccination. Patients were contact-ed by letter offering a health check that could also includean influenza vaccination if the patient wished. The letter made clear that by agreeing to the health check, the patient was under no obligation to receive the vaccination. Forthose wishing to decline the offer of a health check, a tear- off slip and pre-paid envelope were provided. Patients were also advised that they could still be vaccinated againstinfluenza at the surgery if they preferred. The health check itself involved an assessment of physical and mental health and took the same format that has been used locally since the introduction of over-75 health checksin 1990. 17After the initial assessment, patients were offered the influenza vaccine and the nurse dealt with any concerns that the patient had regarding the vaccination. If the patientagreed to be vaccinated and there were no contraindica- tions, the nurse administered the vaccine. Health checkswere carried out between 2 October 2000 and 4 December 2000, each one taking around 30 minutes to complete. Randomisation and consent All eligible patients were randomised to receive either a per-sonal letter or a health check combined with the offer of a vaccination. Resources were available to provide one-third of the eligible population with the health check. Therefore, one-third of patients were randomised to receive the healthcheck and two-thirds were randomised to receive the per- sonal letter. For practical reasons, as well as to limit conta- mination between trial arms, randomisation occurred athousehold level. To assign households to trial arms, each household was given a unique identifier. The SAS data analysis program was then used to randomly assign thecodes to each identifier, with the personal letter code being generated twice as often as the health check code. Approaching patients for informed consent prior to ran- domisation was not feasible owing to the nature of the inter- ventions themselves. Written consent was obtained for all patients prior to the administration of the vaccine regardless of where the patient was vaccinated. Sample size Based on the previous year we expected an uptake of 50%among the personal letter group, and from a non-ran- domised pilot study in a neighbouring practice in the previ-ous year we expected an uptake of 64% in the health check group. If all 2000 potentially eligible patients were ran- domised, then we calculated that we would have 99% powerat the 5% significance level to detect the above difference. Primary outcome measure The primary outcome measure was the proportion ofpatients receiving the influenza vaccine by 31 December 2000. Statistical analysis The data was analysed using an intention-to-treat approach.The 2-test was used to analyse the difference in uptake between trial arms among all eligible patients as well asamong those who did not receive an influenza vaccine in the previous year. All analyses were carried out using the soft- ware SAS version 8. Results Of the 2408 patients aged 75 years and over and registeredwith the general practice, 356 were ineligible to take part inthe trial because they were living in residential care, nursing homes or sheltered accommodation (Figure 1). A total of 1372 patients were randomised to receive the personal let- ter and 680 were offered a combined health check and influenza vaccination. Following randomisation, 66 patientsin the personal letter arm received the influenza vaccine at home when the GP was aware of medical reasons that pre- vented the patient from attending the surgery. In the healthcheck arm 468 (68.8%) actually received the nurse health 718 British Journal of General Practice, September 2002A J Arthur, R J Matthews, C Jagger, et al HOW THIS FITS IN What do we know? Although immunisation against influenza can lower the risk of hospitalisation and death among older people, the uptake of influenza vaccination is suboptimal.Observational and qualitative studies suggest that contact with a doctor or nurse is the most likely predictor for receivingthe vaccine. What does this paper add? Offering influenza vaccination as part of an over-75 healthcheck carried out by a practice nurse in the older person'shome has a moderate effect on increasing uptake of the vac-cine. The improvement in uptake is more marked for thosewho do not routinely come forward for vaccination. A J Arthur, R J Matthews, C Jagger, et al 720 British Journal of General Practice, September 2002check. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 2052 patients randomised to the two groups. A total of 972(47.4%) patients received the influenza vaccine in the previ-ous year. There appeared to be no difference in age, sex andvaccination status for the previous year between the twogroups. Of the 212 patients randomised to, but not receiving the nurse health check, 193 actively declined the offer with theremainder having died, been admitted to hospital, or notbeen traceable. These patients were less likely to havereceived the influenza vaccine in the previous year thanthose who received the nurse health check (38.7% versus53.2%) although they were similar in age and sex. Both interventions succeeded in improving uptake from the previous year. The difference in uptake of influenza vac-cination between the two study groups was 6.4% (95% CI =2.2% to 10.4%) with 67.9% (932/1372) of those who weresent a personal letter actually receiving the vaccine com-pared with 74.3% (505/680) of those offered a combined health check and influenza vaccination (Table 2). When theanalysis was restricted to those who had not been vaccinat-ed in the previous year, rates of influenza vaccination uptakewere lower in both the nurse health check group (56.2%[196/349]) and the personal letter group (44.0% [322/731]),but the difference between the groups was greater (12.1%,95% CI = 5.8% to 18.4%). Discussion Our intervention of combined health check and offer ofinfluenza vaccine produced a higher uptake than personalinvitation letter. The effect of the health check on vaccinationuptake was particularly marked for those who were eligiblefor, but did not receive, a vaccine in the previous year. Theincrease in vaccination uptake among those offered healthchecks could be attributed to the greater opportunity forpatients who have misgivings about the vaccine to discusstheir concerns with the nurse. On a more cautious note, itFigure 1.

It also remains to be seen whether in futureyears, older people are more likely to present themselves to an influenza vaccination clinic as a result of a positive expe- rience of receiving the vaccine, or less likely to do so owingto increased complacency. Originally the trial was designed to include a third group who were to receive no direct information about the influen-za vaccination programme other than through the national and local advertising campaigns. However, it soon became apparent that the national drive to increase influenza vacci-nation rates was making practices increase their efforts inencouraging older people to receive the influenza vaccine. Therefore, it was decided that all patients aged 75 years and over should at least receive a personal letter. Carrying outthe study in its revised two-arm form, where two-thirds of eli- gible patients received a personal letter and one-third were offered influenza vaccination as part of a health check hasmeant that we are unable to assess the impact of the per- sonal letter on vaccination uptake. However, there is evi- dence from other studies to suggest that personal letters aremore effective than more general forms of publicity. 10,12,18 The overall vaccination uptake was higher in 2000 than in the previous year. This is probably owing to the combinationof using a personal letter for the first time, and the national campaign to publicise the importance of getting immunised against influenza for older people. Another reason for theincrease could be that, for the first time, the method of reim- bursement for GPs to provide influenza immunisation for those aged 65 years and over gave a financial incentive forpractices to maximise their vaccination rates in this age group. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial to be carried out in the UK to evaluate the effect of dif-ferent approaches on influenza vaccination uptake among older people. Combining the over-75 health checks with the influenza immunisation programme may be a more efficientuse of practice nurse time. The results of this trial provide those in primary care with some evidence of the relative mer- its of different strategies to meet government targets forinfluenza vaccination rates. The restriction of this study to one large general practicelimits the generalisability of the results. There is wide varia- tion in the way general practices carry out their over-75health checks. 19The effect of combining influenza vaccina- tion with the over-75 health check may be weaker where health checks are carried out opportunistically and not in theolder person's home. Another limitation is that we cannotsay how uptake rates among those aged 65 to 74 years maybe maximised as there is no equivalent to the over-75 healthchecks for this age group. Health checks carried out by a nurse in the older person's home can be an effective way of increasing vaccinationuptake among older people. However, in the absence ofcost effectiveness data, it must be assumed that this is anexpensive intervention that achieves a relatively modest increase in influenza vaccination uptake. It may also be unrealistic to expect practices to carry out all their over-75health checks in a three-month period to coincide with theinfluenza vaccination season when workload is high. A moreviable option may be to use this approach for the minority ofolder patients who have not routinely taken up influenza vac-cination in the past. For others, personal letters to encour-age older people to come forward to receive the influenzavaccine is a relatively cheap alternative that, unlike postersand surgery leaflets, does not favour those already in regu-lar contact with their GP .
