What are some other ways I can protect my child against flu? In addition to getting a flu vaccine, you and your child should take everyday actions to help prevent the spread of germs. Stay away from people who are sick as much as possible. If you or your child are sick, avoid others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. Also, remember to regularly cover your coughs and sneezes, wash your hands often, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and clean surfaces that may be contaminated with flu viruses. These everyday actions can help reduce your chances of getting sick and prevent the spread of germs to others if you are sick. Is there a medicine to treat flu? Yes. Antiviral drugs are prescription medicines that can be used to treat flu illness. They can shorten your illness and make it milder, and they can prevent serious complications that could result in a hospital stay. Antivirals work best when started during the first 2 days of illness. Antiviral drugs are recommended to treat flu in people who are very sick (for example, people who are in the hospi tal) or people who are at high risk of serious flu complications who get flu symptoms. Antivirals can be given to children and pregnant women. How long can a sick person spread flu to others? People with flu may be able to infect others from 1 day before getting sick to up to 5 to 7 days after. Severely ill people or young children may be able to spread the flu longer, especially if they still have symptoms. Can my child go to school, day care, or camp if he or she is sick with the flu? No. Your child should stay home to rest and to avoid spreading flu to other children or caregivers. When can I go back to school or work after having flu? If you or your child had a positive flu test and a negative COVID -19 test, stay home for at least 24 hours after the fever is gone. (The fever should be gone without the use of a fever -reducing medicine.) A fever is defined as 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C)* or higher . If you still do not feel better after the fever is gone, continuing staying home and getting rest. "}
