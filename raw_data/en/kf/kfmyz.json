Return Address: Present Beings Ltd 126 New Kings Road London SW6 4LZ Care Instructions Care Instructions The most important rule in healing work with crystals is that they must be cleared. That means clearing them of any foreign or residual energy, before meditating with them or using them in anyway. Purifying your crystals Most crystals can be cleansed and recharged by holding them under running water for a few minutes. Natural water from a stream or the sea is best, but you can use tap water. One way of doing this is placing them on a log or a flat slab of selenite. The most important thing here is that the selenite itself is regularly charged so that it can be thoroughly effective in clearing your crystals. Placing your selenite under the full moon light overnight to charge, or setting it among healthy, broad-leafed plants for 24 hours. Quick methods Smudging with sacred smoke. You can either hold individual crystals, and pass them through the smoke or, if you have quite a few to clear, you can place them on a countertop and use a feather wand to waft the smoke over them. Crystals can also be cleansed by being placed in a bowl of salt or brown rice overnight, then brushing off the salt or rice afterwards, it is best to avoid using salt if the crystal is fragile or layered. You can also place your crystals on a large Quartz cluster or a Carnelian. Visualize a bright white light radiating down onto the crystals. Customer Reviews - Michael I ordered this box from Present beings. When it arrived I was very optimistic because I am new to this. When I opened it I was blown away as to how much thought and care had gone into my personal box. I have suffered with ptsd for many years that's how I was introduced to Sophie threw a mutual friend. The reiki sessions have changed my life for the better. I never thought it would work but how wrong was I. Thank you Sophie - Anna G I cannot emphasize enough how FANTASTIC this gift is, it is an absolute MUST buy . I bought this for my boss and she was completely overwhelmed with the detail and care put into this gift, it's incredible. The service was first class and so helpful, I cannot recommend this enough for a thoughtful, beautiful and spiritual gift. You will not be disappointed!!! Stunning! X - Charlotte. M Excellent product, really well received as a gift. Seller kept in contact and offered help throughout and delivered the gift really quickly. Would recommend to anyone buying gift sets. - Hannah Stunning! Couldn't be more happy with how this arrived. So beautiful - Tracey B I treated myself to a 'self love' box from Sophie at Present Beings, the boxes all looked so gorgeous, it was difficult to decide on a particular one. I was so excited to receive it and I wasn't disappointed. It's just so beautiful. The crystals were quite large and very pretty. They just keep finding their way into my pockets. The coconut candle smells so lush along with the oil and the incense sticks. They help to create a relaxing setting. Besides this, there was a lovely necklace, bracelets and a personal note amongst other things. I had a complimentary Reiki session with Sophie online, this was something very new to me. Sophie put me at ease and I totally trusted her experience and knowledge. I felt very relaxed during the session and could actually feel the energy at different parts of my body. I felt quite cleansed and uplifted afterwards. Sophie's communication throughout has been fantastic. I will definitely order a second box. I wish Sophie all the best with her Present Beings journey. - Emily V I subscribed to the wellness box from Present Beings recently, after a friend of mine thought it would be something I'd like. I received email contact from Sophie about booking in for a Reiki session which I was excited to try. My box arrived and I loved it. It was packed full of the most amazing goodies, as well as a couple of little extra gifts, which was such a special touch. I especially liked the personalised letter and could really feel the love that Sophie had put into creating the box for me. That same day I had my Reiki session in person with Sophie and it was magical. I felt amazing afterwards, really spiritually energetic and I am very much looking forward to my next session. I would highly recommend Present Beings, the boxes would make a great gift for someone special. - Cat Sophie's reiki and crystal work have been extremely helpful to me in addressing the stress and exhaustion I was experiencing due to my work. She always seems to key into what I need whether it's an energy boost, grounding, or an opening for creativity, and that's across an ocean and a continent! She has a gift in her ability to tap into your energy and release those issues that are keeping you from being your best. I come out of my sessions with Sophie feeling refreshed, reenergized, and able to take on anything the day may present. - Jane Bought for my best friends birthday. She was over the moon with this beautifully presented gift. Box was full of wonderful naturally resourced candles, crystals etc. Very professionally arranged. Perfumes from candles were delightful. She asked me for details to purchase a box for her mother. - Sebastian I absolutely loved my box, felt very unique and personalised according to me. The attention to detail made me feel emotional and grateful and the oils and crystals felt close to my heart. I genuinely loved receiving a hand written letter from Sophie who sent the box to me and explained what everything was used for. I will definitely buy one for my sister and who ever I love <3 - Lauren When I recieved the present-beings box I couldn't get over how much care, attention and love had been put into putting this box together. I was completely overwhelmed by the things included. It had everything you needed to get the best out of meditation and manifestations, including paolo Santo, sage and some beautiful crystals. Along with this a necklace, bracelet and other lovely things were included. It really has reignited my focus to meditate and get the best out of life bringing calm peace and focus. Thank you so much I will definitely be ordering more! - Tillie I recently recived my present beings box and was shocked at the amount of love and detail that had gone into this. The value for money is great, i recieved many crystals and a lovely peice of jewellery. The attention to detail made it very personal to me. Each item inside came with information and how to use so i had a full understanding of how to get the most from the box. I personally love using them in a ceramony along with meditation and manifesting - Hadley Received my box from Present beings and just wanted to leave a little heart felt and honest review. The box was stunning. I'll be honest with you, way better than I expected just because of how much you get for your money! The quality of the box itself is so nice and I'll be keeping it to store some of my crystals! I received some stunning sterling silver jewellery including a raw Citrine crystal necklace! I had other bits including other natural raw crystals (my favourite) sage to cleanse them, a STUNNING lavender candle, amongst lots more. I have also been given an hour Reiki session with Sophie, whom iv had a session with before and reeped the benefits ! I have subscribed to this monthly now and actually think you should offer these boxes as gifts ! I think it's such a thoughtful and well rounded gift for anyone to receive, even if it is to yourself. Very happy customer! Thank you x - Alicia Thank you so much for my personalised crystal box. It is such a perfect treat either- for yourself, and a fantastic gift too! The crystals are beautiful, and the oil smells incredible, so much I wear it daily. My journal is a perfect addition to the box and has prompted me to start journaling. Thank you! - Paul I just wanted to say I am absolutely blown away by the box you sent! I received it this morning and I almost cried with how grateful I was and the thought and sentiment behind each item. It's my birthday on Saturday and I couldn't think of a more wonderful gift to receive in the post. You really have created something so special. Please let me know when your subscription service is open I would love to sign up all my friends and family! sending lots of love and gratitude your way xx "}
