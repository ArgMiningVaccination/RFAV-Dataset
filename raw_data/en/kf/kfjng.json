That's why so much is written about it'. That is the [title of a post](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/) in which I advocate the view put by John Ioannidis that remarkably little is known about the health effects if individual nutrients. That ignorance has given rise to a vast industry selling advice that has little evidence to support it. The 2016 Conference of the so-called \"College of Medicine\" had the title \"Food, the Forgotten Medicine\". This post gives some background information about some of the speakers at this event. I'm sorry it appears to be too ad hominem, but the only way to judge the meeting is via the track record of the speakers. Quite a lot has been written here about the \"College of Medicine\". It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' late, unlamented, Foundation for Integrated Health. But unlike the latter, its name is disguises its promotion of quackery. [Originally](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) it was going to be called the \"College of Integrated Health\", but that wasn't sufficently deceptive so the name was dropped. For the history of the organisation, see [The new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) [Don't be deceived. The new \"College of Medicine\" is a fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/10/29/dont-be-deceived-the-new-college-of-medicine-is-a-fraud-and-delusion/) [The College of Medicine is in the pocket of Crapita Capita. Is Graeme Catto selling out?](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/05/03/the-college-of-medicine-is-in-the-pocket-of-crapita-capita-is-graeme-catto-selling-out/) The conference programme ( [download pdf](http://www.dcscience.net/College-of-Medicine-Food-conf-programme-2016.pdf)) is a masterpiece of [bait and switch](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Bait+and+switch). It is a mixture of very respectable people, and outright quacks. The former are invited to give legitimacy to the latter. The names may not be familiar to those who don't follow the antics of the magic medicine community, so here is a bit of information about some of them. The introduction to the meeting was by [Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon) and [Catherine Zollman](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Zollman), both veterans of the Prince of Wales Foundation, and both devoted enthusiasts for magic medicne. [Zollman even believes](http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7217/1115.1) in the battiest of all forms of magic medicine, homeopathy ( [download pdf](Vickers-Zollman-homeopathy-1999.pdf)), for which she totally misrepresents the evidence. Zollman works now at the [Penny Brohn centre](http://www.pennybrohn.org.uk/) in Bristol. She's [also linked to](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Portland-Centre-4pp-A5-Programme-68048-FINAL-4.pdf) the \" [Portland Centre for integrative medicine](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/)\" which is run by [Elizabeth Thompson](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/07/27/dr-elizabeth-thompson-of-bristol-homeopathic-hospital-finds-that-pills-that-contain-nothing-have-no-effect-not-even-placebo-effect/), another advocate of homeopathy. It came into being after NHS Bristol shut down the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, on the very good grounds that it doesn't work. Now, like most magic medicine it is privatised. The [Penny Brohn shop](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/) will sell you a wide range of expensive and useless \"supplements\". For example, [Biocare Antioxidant capsules](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/collections/supplements-1/products/biocare-antioxidant-complex-90-vegecaps) at \u00a337 for 90. Biocare make [several unjustified claims](https://www.biocare.co.uk/default.aspx?GroupGuid=1053) for their benefits. Among other unnecessary ingredients, they contain a very small amount of green tea. That's a favourite of \"health food addicts\", and it was the subject of a [recent paper](http://www.dcscience.net/delaTorre-green-tea-2016.pdf) that contains one of the daftest statistical solecisms I've ever encountered \"To protect against type II errors, no corrections were applied for multiple comparisons\". If you don't understand that, try [this paper](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216). The results are almost certainly false positives, despite the fact that it appeared in Lancet Neurology. It's yet another example of broken peer review. It's been know for decades now that [ \"antioxidant\" is no more than a marketing term](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/03/anti-oxidant-supplements-dangerous-garlic-useless-update/), There is no evidence of benefit and large doses can be harmful. This obviously doesn't worry the College of Medicine. Margaret Rayman was the next speaker. She's a real nutritionist. Mixing the real with the crackpots is a standard bait and switch tactic. Eleni Tsiompanou, came next. She runs yet another [private \"wellness\" clinic](http://healthbeing.co.uk/), which makes all the usual exaggerated claims. She seems to have an [obsession with Hippocrates](http://healthbeing.co.uk/hippocrates/) (hint: medicine has moved on since then). [Dr Eleni's Joy Biscuits](http://healthbeing.co.uk/recipes/dr-elenis-joy-biscuits/) may or may not taste good, but their health-giving properties are make-believe. Andrew Weil, from the University of Arizona gave the keynote address. He's described as \"one of the world's leading authorities on Nutrition and Health\". That description alone is sufficient to show the fantasy land in which the College of Medicine exists. He's a typical supplement salesman, presumably very rich. There is no excuse for not knowing about him. It was 1988 when [Arnold Relman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_S._Relman) (who was editor of the New England Journal of Medicine) wrote [A Trip to Stonesville: Some Notes on Andrew Weil, M.D.](http://www.quackwatch.com/11Ind/weil.html). \"Like so many of the other gurus of alternative medicine, Weil is not bothered by logical contradictions in his argument, or encumbered by a need to search for objective evidence.\" This blog has mentioned his more [recent activities](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/02/17/quackademics-in-usa-and-canada/#arizona), many times. [Alex Richardson](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=7412), of Oxford Food and Behaviour Research (a charity, not part of the university) is an enthusiast for omega-3, a favourite of the supplement industry, She has published several papers that show little evidence of effectiveness. That looks entirely honest. On the other hand, [ their News section](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=342) contains many links to the notorious supplement industry lobby site, Nutraingredients, one of the least reliable sources of information on the web (I get their newsletter, a constant source of hilarity and raised eyebrows). I find this worrying for someone who claims to be evidence-based. I'm told that her charity is funded largely by the supplement industry (though I can't find any mention of that on the web site). Stephen Devries was a new name to me. You can infer what he's like from the fact that he has been endorsed byt Andrew Weil, and that his address is \"Institute for Integrative Cardiology\" (\"Integrative\" is the latest euphemism for quackery). Never trust any talk with a title that contains \"The truth about\". His was called \"The scientific truth about fats and sugars,\" In [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24PC0zYKLkk), he claims that diet has been shown to reduce heart disease by 70%. which gives you a good idea of his ability to assess evidence. But the claim doubtless helps to sell his books. Prof Tim Spector, of Kings College London, was next. As far as I know he's a perfectly respectable scientist, albeit one with [books to sell](http://www.tim-spector.co.uk/), But his talk [ is now online](https://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/food-medicine-diet-myths-microbes/?dm_i=PC7,4DPC1,3PB5TI,G3CAO,1), and it was a bit like a born-again microbiome enthusiast. He seemed to be too impressed by the PREDIMED study, despite it's statistical unsoundness, which was [pointed out by Ioannidis](http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf). Little evidence was presented, though at least he was more sensible than the audience about the uselessness of multivitamin tablets. Simon Mills talked on \"Herbs and spices. Using Mother Nature's pharmacy to maintain health and cure illness\". He's a herbalist who has featured here [many times](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Simon+Mills%22). I can recommend especially his video about [Hot and Cold herbs](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/06/10/bait-and-switch-by-herbalists-chinese-and-western/) as a superb example of fantasy science. Annie Anderson, is [Professor of Public Health Nutrition](http://medicine.dundee.ac.uk/staff-member/professor-annie-s-anderson) and Founder of the Scottish Cancer Prevention Network. She's a respectable nutritionist and public health person, albeit with their customary disregard of [problems of causality](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/). Patrick Holden is chair of the [Sustainable Food Trust](http://www.ciwf.org.uk/about-us/high-profile-supporters/visionaries/civil-society/patrick-holden-cbe/). He promotes \"organic farming\". Much though I dislike the cruelty of factory farms, the \"organic\" industry is largely a way of making food more expensive with no health benefits. The Michael Pittilo 2016 Student Essay Prize was awarded after lunch. Pittilo has [featured frequently](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=pittilo) on this blog as a result of his execrable promotion of quackery -see, in particular, [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/06/18/a-very-bad-report-gamma-minus-for-the-vice-chancellor/). Nutritional advice for patients with cancer. This discussion involved three people. Professor Robert Thomas, Consultant Oncologist, Addenbrookes and Bedford Hospitals, Dr Clare Shaw, Consultant Dietitian, Royal Marsden Hospital and Dr Catherine Zollman, GP and Clinical Lead, Penny Brohn UK. Robert Thomas came to my attention when I noticed that he, as a regular cancer consultant had spoken at a meeting of the quack charity, \"YestoLife\". When I saw he was scheduled tp speak at another quack conference. After I'd written to him to point out the track records of some of the people at the meeting, he withdrew from one of them. See [The exploitation of cancer patients is wicked. Carrot juice for lunch, then die destitute](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/03/25/the-exploitation-of-cancer-patients-is-wicked-carrot-juice-for-lunch-then-die-destitute/). The influence seems to have been temporary though. He continues to lend respectability to many dodgy meetings. He edits the [Cancernet web site](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/index.html). This site lends credence to bizarre treatments like [homeopathy](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-homeopathy.htm) and [crystal healing](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-crystal.htm). It used to sell [hair mineral analysis](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/nutritional-reports.htm), a well-known phony diagnostic method the main purpose of which is to sell you expensive \"supplements\". They still sell the \"Cancer Risk Nutritional Profile\". for \u00a3295.00, despite the fact that it provides no proven benefits. Robert Thomas designed a food \"supplement\", Pomi-T: capsules that contain Pomegranate, Green tea, Broccoli and Curcumin. Oddly, he seems still to subscribe to the antioxidant myth. Even the supplement industry [admits that that's a lost cause](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Regulation-Policy/Why-antioxidant-claims-have-been-killed-off-in-the-EU/?utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=22-Jun-2016&c=Spm99iS8YwD3CuvOLnW9pQ%3D%3D&p2=), but that doesn't stop its use in marketing. The one [randomised trial](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/pp-pomi-t.pdf) of these pills for prostate cancer was inconclusive. [Prostate Cancer UK says](http://prostatecanceruk.org/about-us/news-and-views/2013/6/superfoods) \"We would not encourage any man with prostate cancer to start taking Pomi-T food supplements on the basis of this research\". Nevertheless it's promoted on Cancernet.co.uk and widely sold. The [Pomi-T site boasts](https://www.pomi-t.co.uk/) about the (inconclusive) trial, but says \"Pomi-T\u00ae is not a medicinal product\". There was a cookery demonstration by Dale Pinnock \"The medicinal chef\" The programme does not tell us whether he made is signature dish \"the [ Famous Flu Fighting Soup](http://www.dalepinnock.com/flu-fighting-soup-itvs-this-morning/)\". Needless to say, there isn't the slightest reason to believe that his soup has the slightest effect on flu. In summary, the whole meeting was devoted to exaggerating vastly the effect of particular foods. It also acted as advertising for people with something to sell. Much of it was outright quackery, with a leavening of more respectable people, a standard part of the bait-and-switch methods used by all quacks in their attempts to make themselves sound respectable. I find it impossible to tell how much the participants actually believe what they say, and how much it's a simple commercial drive. The thing that really worries me is why someone like Phil Hammond supports this sort of thing by chairing their meetings (as he did for the \"College of Medicine's\" direct predecessor, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. His defence of the NHS has made him something of a hero to me. He assured me that he'd asked people to stick to evidence. In that he clearly failed. I guess they must pay well. Follow-up It's hard to know what to make of David Tredinnick MP (Cons, Bosworth). He is certainly an extreme example of the scientific ignorance of our parliamentary representatives, but he isn't alone in that. Our present minister of Education, Michael Gove, memorably referred to [Newton's Laws of Thermodynamics](http://politicalscrapbook.net/2011/06/michael-gove-physics/), blissfully unaware that thermodynamics was a 19th century development. And our present Minister of Health seems to [think that magic water cures diseases](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tomchiversscience/100179258/jeremy-hunt-health-secretary-thinks-homeopathy-works/). But Mr Treddinick breaks every record for anti-scientific nonsense. That, no doubt, is why he was upset by the recent revision of come NHS Choices web pages, so that they now give a good account of the evidence (that's their job, of course). They did that despite two years of obstruction by the Department of Health. which seemed to think that it was appropriate to take advice from Michael Dixon of the Prince's Foundation for integrated Health. That shocking example of policy based evidence was [revealed on this blog](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778), and caused something of a stir. Treddinick's latest letter A copy of a letter from Mr Tredinnick to the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, has some into my possession by a tortuous route [ [download the letter](/trediinnick-letter.pdf)]. It's a corker. Here are a few quotations. \"1. UKIP moving onto our ground Attached is an extract from a recent UKIP policy statement. The position which UKIP has taken is one with which most of our Daily Mail reading supporters of complementary medicine would agree.\" It seems that Treddinick's preferred authority on medicine is now Nigel Farage, leader of the UK's far right party. UKIP's policy on health is appended to the letter, and it's as barmy as most of the other things they say. \"2. Herbal Medicine . . .there is very real concern that the Government will not regulate Herbal Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. The current situation is unacceptable, because herbal practitioners need regulation and cannot function as herbal therapists, nor can they cannot obtain stocks of their herbal remedies, without it. This refers to a saga that has been running for at least 10 years. Herbalists are desperate to get a government stamp of approval by getting statutory regulation, much like real doctors have, despite the fact that they make money by selling sick people \" [an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733)\" (as quoted recently in the [House of Lords](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130424-gc0001.htm#13042481000207)). Even the US [National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm) (NCCAM) doesn't claim that a single herbal treatment is useful. The saga of herbal regulation is long and tedious. The short version is that a [very bad report, The Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235), recommended regulation of herbalists. After years of prevarication, Andrew Lansley ignored the impartial scientific advice and yielded to the pressure from the herbal industry to [accept the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4117). But still nothing has happened. Could it be that even Jeremy Hunt realises, deep down, that the regulation of nonsense is a nonsense that would harm the public? We can only hope that a letter from Mr Tredinnick is the kiss of death. Perhaps his continuous pestering will only reinforce the doubts that seem to exist at the Department of Health. Then Tredinnick returns (yawn) to his obsession with magic water. He vents his rage at the [now excellent NHS Choices](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5778) page on homeopathy. 3. Homeopathy \"Recently this wording has been removed and instead a comment by the Chief Medical Officer that homeopathy is placebo inserted in its place, as well as links to external organisations which campaign against homeopathy. For instance, there is a link to the Sense About Science website, and Caroline Finucane, who is Editor of new content at NHS Choices, also writes for the Sense About Science website. This is an organisation which has no expertise in homeopathy and traces its roots back to the ultra-left Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP).\" \"I respectfully suggest that the original wording be reinstated and these links to external organisations be removed or changed to ensure a balanced view.\". So it seems that he prefers the medical views of Nigel Farage and the Prince of Wales to those of the Chief Medical Officer and the government's chief scientist. Disgracefully, Tredinnick picks out one particular employee of NHS Choices among many, and one who does an excellent job. And he raises the hoary old myth that Sense About Science is a communist organisation. Odd, since others accuse it of being neo-libertarian. The actual history [is here](http://www.senseaboutscience.org/blog.php/36/where-sense-about-science-comes-from). The organisation that is a bit too libertarian for my taste is Spiked Online. I haven't agreed with every word that Sense about Science has printed, but they have a totally honest belief in evidence. To drag in the name of one person out of many, and to justify it by a false history shows, once again, how very venomous and vindictive the advocates of delusional medicine can be when they feel cornered. A bit more information about Mr Treddinick This is what the [BBC News profile](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk_politics/2055369.stm) says about him. | | David Tredinnick is an old style Conservative MP, being an Eton-educated former Guards officer, who has sat in the Commons since 1987. However, his ambition for high office was thwarted by his role in one of the sleaze stories which helped to sink the Major government. He accepted \u00a31,000 from an undercover reporter to ask parliamentary questions about a fictitious drug. He was obliged to resign from his role as a PPS and was suspended from the Commons for 20 sitting days. He has not sat on the frontbench since. He is an orthodox Conservative loyalist, though he is more supportive of the European Union than many of his colleagues. He has, however, carved himself a niche as the Commons' most enthusiastic supporter of complementary medicine. He has wearied successive health secretaries with his persistent advocacy of any and all homeopathic remedies. He has also supported their use in prisons and even suggested them as an aid in alleviating the foot and mouth crisis. | | Tredinnick has also asserted that he was aware of a psychiatric hospital that doubled its staff at full moon (this is an old urban myth, and is, of course, His advocacy of homeopathic borax as a way to control the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth diease can be Picture of David Tredinnick MP from the Follow-up | | \"In causing NHS Choices to publish content that is less than completely frank about the evidence on homeopathy, the DH have compromised the editorial standards of a website that they themselves established\". . . \". . . they have failed the general public, by putting special interests, politics, and the path of least resistance (as they saw it) before the truth about health and healthcare.\" [NHS Choices](http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx) is usually a good source of information for the public. But there is one exception: the information they provide about alternative medicine is poor. A Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that the attempt of NHS Choices to rewrite their pages more accurately was censored by the Department of Health in conjunction with the late Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. The Department of Health (DH) has misled the public. The earliest version of the homeopathy information page recorded by the Wayback Machine was [November 12 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112004009/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx?url=Pages/What-is-it.aspx). It was still there on [December 5 2010](http://web.archive.org/web/20101205113830/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx). The comments were mostly critical. One said, quite correctly, | | I find it most regrettable that the way NHS has covered this subject is to give uncritical voice to the claims of homoeopathy without giving readers the information they need to evaluate those claims.

Throughout 2011, and up to [October 2012](http://web.archive.org/web/20121017183301/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx) the information page on homeopathy read | | Introduction Content on homeopathy has been removed from the website pending a review by the Department of Health policy team responsible for complementary and alternative medicines.

For more information about homeopathy see the Then, at the [end of 2012](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/homeopathy/pages/introduction.aspx), the page reappeared. It was a bit better than the original, but not much. Many of the comments criticise the misleading nature of the information (as well as the usual \"it worked for me\" comments). The \"useful links\" still has six links to flat-earth organisations like the Society of Homeopaths, and only one to a sensible source, the [excellent pamphlet](http://www.senseaboutscience.org/data/files/resources/54/Homeopathy.pdf) from Sense about Science. They do link at the end to the [2010 Science and Technology Committee Report: Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy (PDF, 1.61Mb)](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/45.pdf), and to the [Government Response to the Science and Technology Committee Report, Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy (PDF, 69kb)](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117811.pdf) but no comment is made on the findings. Policy-based evidence I wondered why the NHS Choices page, after an absence of almost two years, had returned in such an unsatisfactory form. So I asked them. After a reminder, I was told that my queries were being dealt with not by NHS Choices, but had been referred to Dr Sunjai Gupta \"the DH official with responsibility for this area\". [Dr Sunjai Gupta OBE](http://sites.idea.gov.uk/localinsight/2011/03/09/dr-sunjai-gupta-obe/) is Deputy Director of Public Health Strategy and Social Marketing, Department of Health. Dr Gupta is not obviously sympathetic to woo. It's hard to tell since he doesn't seem to have published much. But one is not reassured by an article that he wrote for the [Journal of Holistic Healthcare](http://www.bhma.org/pages/journal/6.2-detail.php?searchresult=1&sstring=Gupta#inline1). It appears straight after an article by fantasy herbalist, [Simon Mills](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5360). Despite assurances that I'd hear from Dr Gupta shortly, nothing happened. So I sent a request for the correspondence under the Freedom of Information Act (2000). Although the request was addressed to NHS Choices, a public body, strenuous efforts were made to divert it to the Department of Health. These were resisted. Nevertheless when, after a long delay, the material arrived, it came not from NHS Choices, but from DH, who had evidently vetted it,. The emails were rather shocking [ [download all](/NHS-choices-emails-AppendixA-(redacted).pdf)]. A mail dated 1 December 2009 said This is the most direct statement I've seen that, in the Department of Health, policy dictates evidence. NHS Choices is meant to provide evidence, but what they say has to be checked by DH to make sure they \"don't clash with any policy messages\". The re-written page The original version of the re-written page was sent to me by David Mattin, who worked for NHS Choices until September 2012. You can [download the whole draft](/Homeopathy-first-draft-for-upload-a.pdf) here. It is an enormous improvement on the original page. For example, it says | | \"Does it work? Many independent experts would respond to this question 'no, homeopathy does not work' There is no good quality clinical evidence to show that homeopathy is more successful than placebo in the treatment of any type of condition. Furthermore, if the principles of homeopath were true it would violate all the existing theories of science that we make use of today; not just our theory of medicine, but also chemistry, biology and physics. This original draft was sent to Mattin on 29 January 2010. After editing it for length Mattin sent it to DH for approval. Over the next two years, DH removed much of the accurate content. Mattin's own comments on this evisceration are reproduced [below](#mattin). The DH emails All the names have been redacted. Needless to say, nobody is willing to take responsibility. But the number of people who support magic medicine is really quite small so the main players were easy to identify. During the nearly 2 year absence of the homeopathy page, dozens of changes were made by DH. It seems that the policy message with which the NHS Choices draft failed to comply were those of the [Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Prince%27s+Foundation+for+Integrated+Health%22), and its [successor](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) (after April 2010), the [College of Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), now known as the [ College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). NHS Choices sought advice about their redrafted pages from the right person, [Sir Iain Chalmers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Chalmers), one of the founders of the [Cochrane Collaboration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochrane_Collaboration). On 3 Nov 2009, Chalmers advised | | The most reliable source in the country - and one of the most reliable in the world - is Professor Edzard Ernst, professor of Complementary Medicine at the Peninsular Medical School, Ernst returned his suggestions in July 2010, but it seems that few of them survived the subsequent 18 months of revisions by DH. On 2 December 2009, a mail from the NHS headquarters (Quarry House, Leeds) was sent to NHS Choices This makes it perfectly clear that DH regards the Prince's Foundation, and the equally flaky [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC: known on the web as Ofquack)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3311) as appropriate guides for public health policy. The fact of the matter is that regulation of magic medicine by the government has [been a total disaster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5562), because, it seems, DH regards the Prince of Wales as a reliable source. On 29 December 2009, the Prince's Foundation went on the attack. On 10th January 2010, two more letters were sent to DH by the Prince's Foundation. At 13.48 they wrote And at 22.14 on the same day, it was followed up with The references to Devon and to Thought Field Therapy, make it very obvious that these letters were written by [Dr Michael Dixon OBE](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#dixon), who was medical director of the Prince's Foundation, and who is now a director of the \"College of Medicine\". And the object of Dixon's bile is obviously Edzard Ernst (the quotation is from his book, [Trick or Treatment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#singh)). I find it fascinating to see just how venomous quacks become when the evidence contradicts their views. The cuddly \"holistic\" veneer quickly vanishes. It gets worse. On 21 January 2010, a mail from NHS Choices to DH said The only person in the country who fits this description is the (in)famous [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22). It is simply mind-boggling that DH regards him as an appropriate person to advise on anything. After that, NHS Choices kept asking DH to sign off the documents, and changes continued to be made. Almost two years later, DH were still stalling. The admission that \"We are a bit short of doctors within DH these days\" is interesting. A bit short of anyone capable of critical thinking would be more accurate. The most interesting document that I got from DH was an intermediate draft of the rewritten page on homeopathy (undated). [Download the document](/NHS-Choices-hoemopathy-draft.pdf). Here are a couple of extracts. It's a story of two years of meddling and procrastination. The end result misinforms the public. Right at the start, the NHS Choices draft says, reasonably enough A House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report said that homeopathic remedies perform no better than placebos and that the principles on which homeopathv is based are \"scientifically implausible\". But a comment, added apparently by DH, says Can we remove this statement? This report is really quite contentious and we may well be subject to quite a lot of challenge from the Homeopathic community if published. What on earth? The DH seems to think that that its job is not to present the evidence, but to avoid challenges from the homeopathic community! And true enough, this piece is missing from the final version. A bit later, the NHS Choices draft was censored again \"A 2010 Science and Technology Committee report said that scientific tests had shown that homeopathic treatments don't work\" But again this doesn't appear in the final version. The comment, apparently from DH, says \"The DH response to this report (point 24) doesn't support this statement though\" That's a gross distortion of [point 24](http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117811.pdf), which actually concludes \"The Government Chief Scientific Adviser cannot envisage scientifically credible proposals for funding for research into homeopathy in the future\" NHS Choices was not happy with the result Shortly before the revised page was published, Paul Nuki, Editor in Chief of NHS Choicea, sent an email to DH. | | Date: 7th September 2011 Time: 3:33:42 pm Hi I've been through the CAM articles and asked that we publish them asap as requested. For the record, we will be publishing these pieces outside of the normal editorial process. Although originally signed off by a suitably qualified clinician, the time lapse and policy changes have been so substantial as to render that null and void. We also don't have a formal It doesn't need much reading between the lines to see that he was unhappy with the result. It will be interesting to see whether the [Information Standard](http://www.rsph.org.uk/en/products-and-services/Certification/rsph-certification-and-the-information-standard/index.cfm) people at the Royal Society for Public Health do anything about it. The Department of Health has not just ignored evidence but actively opposed it. That's the only possible conclusion from the documents that I was sent. And it's pretty shocking that the DH has preferred advice from the Prince's Foundation and its handful of acolytes (in particular Michael Dixon and George Lewith) to the findings of the Science and Technology Select Committee and the views of the Chief Scientific Advisor. In January this year, the Chief medical Officer, [ Dame Sally Davies, said](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9822744/Homeopathy-is-rubbish-says-chief-medical-officer.html), in a rare outburst of candour | | 'I'm very concerned when homeopathic practitioners try to peddle this way of life to prevent malaria or other infectious disease,\" she said. \"I am perpetually surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS.\" Dame Sally, who is England's most senior doctor, concluded by remarking that homeopathy \"is rubbish\". | | So one part of DH is working to contradict another part. the Chief Medical Officer. Perhaps Sally Davies should have a word with Dr Gupta. This all predates the advent of Jeremy Hunt (and known defender of homeopathy) as health minister. But the sympathies of some DH people are made obvious by the presence on the [ DH web site of an article](http://www.personalhealthbudgets.dh.gov.uk/Topics/latest/Resource/?cid=8167&excludepageid=2289) \"Personal health budgets: A new way of accessing complementary therapies?\". This astonishing piece confirms the worst fears that quacks will see personal health budgets as a commercial opportunity to peddle their wares. The article is by Jim Rogers of Lincoln University. What his paper does not mention is Rogers' conflict of interest. He's a homeopath, and he has a paper in the International Journal of High Dilution Research (yes, there is a journal for every form of make-believe). You can [download a reprint](/Rogers-paper-IJHDR,_9,32_(_2010)_JRogers.pdf) of this paper. It advocates more research into homeopathic provings, something that even George Lewith [seems to have given up on](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695). It's about time that the DH started to listen to the Chief Medical Officer. As it is, some people at DH seem to prefer the advice of the Prince's Foundation, and to actively suppress employees who prefer evidence to anecdote. One thing is clear. The DH is an unholy mess. Parts of it are intent on producing policy-based evidence. Comment by David Mattin, who edited the first draft for NHS Choices David Mattin left NHS Choices in September, 2012. He edited the new version and lived through the two years of wrangling with DH during which much of the best content was eviscerated. He sent me this statement about the affair. | | As an editor at NHS Choices, I viewed it as my job to present evidence-based information to the public. The article we prepared on homeopathy stayed true to that central purpose: it made clear to readers that there is no good quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for any health condition, and also presented the broad scientific consensus that the supposed method of action of homeopathy is implausible. What followed was a two year story of delay, and eventual suppression, of that article. My strong impression was of DH civil servants who lacked the courage, and, frankly, the energy to stand up to the criticism from special interest groups that they anticipated would arise because of the article; and that did indeed arise when a draft of the article and other draft content on complementary and alternative medicines fell into the hands of the Prince's Foundation and other CAM groups. The attitude of DH civil servants, broadly, was simply to tell us 'we can't say this about homeopathy, people will complain'. They seemed to have no interest in making an appraisal of the evidence on homeopathy themselves to see if what we were saying was actually true or not. We repeatedly pushed back with the message: 'some people may very well complain, but if what we are saying about the evidence base is true - and it is - then we must simply weather those complaints, and stand by our content. Our duty is to supply our readers with the best information, not to please the homeopathy community.' But these arguments were disregarded. The DH civil servants were almost entirely concerned with the politics of the situation - that is, the politics as they saw them - and the possibility that this article may create new work for them, and very little concerned with the evidence itself, or the presentation of this evidence to the public. The whole episode is an insight into the way special interest groups can influence the workings of government and the public sector simply by making a lot of noise, and having a few powerful friends. In causing NHS Choices to publish content that is less than completely frank about the evidence on homeopathy, the DH have compromised the editorial standards of a website that they themselves established, and that they fund. They have sold out the NHS Choices editorial team, who work tirelessly to fulfil their remit. And, most seriously, they have failed the general public, by putting special interests, politics, and the path of least resistance (as they saw it) before the truth about health and healthcare. Follow-up 13 February 2013 The Guardian version of this story, written by Sarah Boseley, is [Prince's charity lobbied government to water down homeopathy criticism](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/feb/13/prince-charity-lobbied-government-homeopathy). It's fine as far as it goes but it doesn't name any names. There are some good comments though. 14 February 2013. The printed Guardian gave the story full 5 column-width coverage. [ [download print version](/Guardian-DeptHealth140213.pdf)] And news has reached the USA: there's an account of the affair on the Neurologica blog: [Politics trumping science at the NHS](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/politics-trumping-science-at-the-nhs/). On 14 February, the Guardian version was Editor's Choice by lunchtime, and the Guardian web version already had 414 comments, mostly sensible (though this blog got far more referrals from twitter than from the Guardian) And news has reached the USA: there's an account of the affair on the Neurologica blog: [Politics trumping science at the NHS](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/politics-trumping-science-at-the-nhs/). 15 February 2013. The Daily Mail had very fair coverage of the story. The Guardian closed the comments on the story when it had got 642 comments, most of them very sensible. And this page got almost 6000 hits in 24 hours. The majority of the referrals came from Twitter rather than from the Guardian, despite the direct link to the page from the Guardian. 18 February 2013. The affair featured in BMJ News [ [download the reprint](/DH-homeop-bmj-news-2013.pdf)]. The item featured prominently on the BMJ news page. 19 February 2013 Only six days of this post, the [NHS Choices page](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/homeopathy/Pages/Introduction.aspx?a=1) has been re-written again, in a much improved form. That looks like bloggers 1, DH 0. It is baffling that it's left to bloggers, working for nothing, to extract a bit of sense from the highly-paid civil servants at the Department of Health. But at least they listened this time, which is a lot more than happens often. Paul Nuki, who runs NHS Choices, deserves congratulations. Of course the revised page still doesn't call a spade a spade, but it gets close at times. I like the way it starts \"Homeopathy is a 'treatment' based\". Notice the quotation marks. Reputation management? Incidentally, NHS Choices is outsourced to the [(in)famous company, Capita](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295). And the moderation of the comments on their site is outsourced again to [Tempero](http://tempero.co.uk/), which describes itself as a \"reputation management\" company. Each of them creams off money meant of patient care. This discovery might explain why I and others have had comments rejected by NHS Choices several times. \"Reputation management\" is the antithesis of evidence. It is public relations, i.e. paid lying. That is quite wrong for a site that is meant to provide dispassionate information. 21 February 2013. Sadly a step backwards. Part of the improved page was removed. This bit. The Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said there is no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent or cure diseases. She has made it clear she is particularly concerned about the use of homeopathy in developing countries as a so-called cure for malaria. We can only speculate why this was removed, because it was true. In fact she accurately described homeopathy as \"rubbish\". Why she should not be quoted beats me. Much has been written on this blog about [Dr Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon%22), and about the \" [College of Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22College+of+Medicine%22)\", which is the direct inheritor of the mantle of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. At the time of the foundation of the College it was [stated that](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) \"The College represents a new strategy to take forward the vision of HRH Prince Charles\". Michael Dixon has also been chairman of the NHS Alliance since 1998. That was one of very few organisations to support Andrew Lansley's Health Bill. No doubt [he will be happy](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=5295) for Crapita Capita to supply alternative nonsense at public expense. Dr Dixon took offence to a review in The Times of Mark Henderson's new book, The Geek Manifesto. . The [review, by David Aaronovitch](http://journalisted.com/article/3olf4), said, apropos of the [1023 campaign](http://www.1023.org.uk/), \" . . .there was now, almost for the first time, a group of people who were not content to see claims made for discredited treatments without making everyone aware of the science that disproved those claims. And second, what they were doing had implications for public policy.\" and \"The geeks represent, for me, one of the most encouraging recent developments in British public life.\" This excellent review evidently upset Dr Dixon, because on 20th May, his letter appeared in the Times. | | David Aaronovitch is right to argue for a robust scientific approach in medicine. However, he is not being logical or scientific when he says that if something is suspected to be placebo then it has no benefit and the NHS should not pay for it. What about scientific research on remedies that many believe to be placebo? These frequently show that there is a benefit but this is confined to those who believe in the treatment given. Surely, in such cases, it would be logical to say that the treatment was beneficial albeit in a specific group of \"believers\". From there, it would be good science to compare the safety costs of this supposed placebo remedy with its currently given alternative before deciding whether \"believers\" should be able to receive such a remedy on the NHS. The problem here is that belief and mindset play an enormous part in healing - science needs to take account of this. Patients' symptoms are frequently metaphors and effective treatment can often be symbolic and culturally dependent. The mind, in the right circumstances, can produce its own healing chemicals often mimicking those given in conventional medicine. Until science can explain healing in psychosocial as well as biomedical language, we must be cautious about \"voting for the geeks\" as Mr Aaronovitch suggests. It is far better surely that individual treatment should be tailored, within reason, to the patient and their beliefs and perspectives. Further more, might it not be wiser to direct NHS resources according to pragmatic trials of cost effectiveness and safety rather than a limited interpretation of science that excludes the effect of the mind? Dr Michael Dixon Chair of Council College of Medicine. This letter seemed remarkable to me. It is very close to being an admission that alternative medicine is largely placebo. It called for a reply. We have been here before. Many people have discussed the dubious ethics of deceiving patients by giving placebos while pretending they are no such thing. There is wide agreement that it is not only unethical, but also unnecessary. Kevin Smith has written [a scholarly essay](http://www.dcscience.net/Smith-response.pdf) on the topic. Edzard Ernst wrote [Mind over matter?](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103080345/http://www.arc.org.uk/news/arthritistoday/131_1.asp) Margaret McCartney, the Glasgow GP, and author of The Patient Paradox, has [explained it](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=1071). Some views of Dr Dixon's approach are less flattering than mine. For example, from the USA, Steven Novella's [Dr. Michael Dixon - \"A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men\"](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/dr-michael-dixon-a-pyromaniac-in-a-field-of-integrative-straw-men/). And, Majikthyse, [Michael Dixon caught red-handed!](http://majikthyse.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/michael-dixon-caught-red-handed/), and Dr Aust's [Dr Michael Dixon is annoyed](http://draust.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/dr-michael-dixon-is-annoyed/). The list is almost endless. .Two replies were published in the Times on 26 May (and they were the lead letters -bold print). One from the excellent Evan Harris, and one from me. Here they are as text. | | Sir, Dr Michael Dixon's letter (May 21) is fascinating. He is, of course, a well-known advocate of alternative medicine. Yet he seems now to believe that much alternative medicine is just a placebo. That's something the geeks have been saying for years, and he appears, at last, to have accepted it. That being the case, it follows that we have to ask whether placebos produce useful benefits, and whether it is ethical to prescribe them. Nobody denies the existence of placebo effects. But recent research has shown that they are usually both small and transient. Often they are not big enough to provide a useful degree of relief. For example, a recent paper on acupuncture in the British Journal of General Practice showed that it had a remarkably small placebo effect. And placebos have no effect at all on the course of cancer or infectious diseases. There has been an admirable movement in medicine for doctors to be open and honest with patients. Prescribing of medicines that contain no active ingredient involves lying to patients. That is old-fashioned and unethical. It is fair to ask why so many people seem to believe in alternative medicine, if even their placebo effects are small. The answer seems to lie in the \"get better anyway\" effect (known to geeks as regression to the mean). Most of the conditions for which placebos seem to work are things that wax and wane naturally. You take the \"cure\" when you are at your worst, and next day you are better. You would have been better anyway, but it's hard to avoid attributing the improvement to whatever you took. That is why alternative medicine is advertised largely on the basis of anecdotal testimonials. And it is doubtless why Dr Dixon advocates \"pragmatic\" trials: that's a euphemism for trials without a proper control group. Psychosocial problems may indeed be very important for some patients. But deceiving such patients with dummy pills is not the proper way to deal with their problems. D. Colquhoun, FRS Professor of Pharmacology, University College London Sir, Dr Michael Dixon argues that the NHS should fund placebo treatments such as homeopathy (though he stops short of agreeing that homeopathy is a placebo) on the basis that they can offer limited help to those who \"believe\" in them. It is no part of modern ethical medical practice to deceive patients into thinking \u2014 or failing to disabuse them of the belief \u2014 that an inert substance or ineffective medicine has beneficial effects. This can not be justified by the hope \u2014 or even expectation \u2014 of deriving for that patient the limited psychologically based improvement in symptoms that may follow from the deployment of the placebo. Pedlars of homeopathy for profit in the private sector will, alas, always seek to fool people into believing the hocus pocus of \"memory of water\" and the effects of infinite dilution and a lot of bottle-shaking. But doctors have responsibilities not to deceive their patients, even out of a paternalistic wish to assist them to manage their symptoms; and public policy demands that the NHS spends its resources only on treatments that work without deception in a cost-effective way. Dr Evan Harris Oxford Follow-up The College of Medicine is [well known to be the reincarnation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) of the late unlamented Prince of Wales Foundation for Integrated Health. I labelled it as a [Fraud and Delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632), but that was perhaps over-generous. It seems to be morphing into a major operator in the destruction of the National Health Service through its close associations with the private health industry. Their [2012 Conference](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/annual-conference-2012) was held on 3rd May. It has a mixture of speakers, some quite sound, some outright quacks. It's a typical bait and switch event. You can judge its quality by the fact that the picture at the top of the page that advertises the conference shows Christine Glover, a homeopathic pharmacist who makes a living by selling sugar pills to sick people (and a Trustee of the College of Medicine). Her own [company's web site says](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/) | | The approaches are, of course, based on sugar pills. The claim is untrue and dangerous. My name for that is fraud. | | When the \"College of Medicine\" started it was a company, but on January 30th 2012, it was [converted to being a charity](http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/PrintReport.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1145676&ReportType=COLOUR). But the Trustees of the charity are the same people as the directors of the company. They are all advocates of ineffective quack medicine. The contact is named as Linda Leung, who was Operations Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed, and then became Company Secretary for the \"College of Medicine\". The trustees of the charity are the same people who were directors of the company - Dr Michael Dixon, general practitioner. Michael Dixon was Medical Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Professor George Lewith, is Professor of Health Research in the Complementary Medicine Research Unit, University of Southampton. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. Much has been [written about him here](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22&paged=2). - Professor David Peters. is Professor of Integrated Healthcare and Clinical Director at the University of Westminster's School of Integrated Health; He's famous for [allowing dowsing with a pendulum](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4541)as a method of diagnosis for treatment with unproven herbal medicines, He was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Mrs Christine Glover is a pharmacist who [sells homeopathic pills](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/range.html). She was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. The involvement of Capita According to [their web site](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/who-we-are) \"A Founder of the College of Medicine is Capita.\" Still more amazingly, the CEO of the College of Medicine is actually an employee of Capita too. \"Mark Ratnarajah is interim CEO of the College of Medicine as well as Business Director at Capita Health and Wellbeing.\" | || | That isn't the end of it. The vice-president of the College of Medicine is It has to be said that he doesn't sound like a man with much interest in the National Health Service.. Within 9 years of graduating he set up in private practice in Harley Street. Five years later he set up [Premier Medical](http://www.premiermedicalgroup.com/), which, after swallowing a couple of rivals, he sold to Capita for \u00a360 million. He is now recorded in a [Companies House document](/capita-health-holdings.pdf) as Dr Henry Otto Brunjes, a director of Capita Health Holdings Limited. This company owns all the shares in Capita Health and Wellbeing Limited, and it is, in turn, owned by Capita Business Services Limited. And they are owned by Capita Holdings Limited. I do hope that this baroquely complicated array of companies with no employees has nothing to do with tax avoidance. Capita is, of course, a company with a huge interest in the privatisation of health care. It also has a pretty appalling record for ripping off the taxpayer. It has long been known [ in Private Eye](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Eye), as \"Crapita\" and \"the world's worst outsourcing firm\". Capita were responsible for of the multimillion pound failed/delayed IT project for the NHS and HMRC. They messed up on staff administration services at Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust and the BBC where staff details were lost. They failed to provide sufficient computing systems for the Criminal Records Bureau, which caused lengthy delays. Capita were also involved in the failure of the Individual Learning Accounts following a \u00a360M over-spend. And most recently, they have caused the near collapse of court translation services after their acquisition of Applied Language Services. With allies like that, perhaps the College of Medicine hardly needs enemies. No doubt Capita will be happy to provide the public with quackery for an enormous fee from the taxpayer. | || | One shouldn't be surprised that the College is involved in Andrew Lansley's attempts to privatise healthcare. One would have thought that such a close association with a company with huge vested interests would not be compatible with charitable status. I've asked the Charity Commission about that. The Charity commission, sadly, makes no judgements about the worthiness of the objects of the charities it endorses. All sorts of dangerous quack organisations are registered charities, like, for example, [Yes to Life](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/). Secrecy at the College of Medicine One of the big problems about the privatisation of medicine and education is that you can't use the Freedom of Information Act to discover what they are up to. A few private companies try to abide by that act, despite not being obliged to do so. But the College of Medicine is not one of them. Capita They refuse to disclose anything about their relationship with Capita. I asked I asked Graeme Catto, who is a friend (despite the fact that I think he's wrong). I got nothing. \"Critical appraisal\" I also asked Catto for the teaching materials used on a course that they ran about \"critical appraisal\". Any university is obliged, by the decision of the Information Tribunal, to produce such material on request. The College of Medicine refused, point blank. What, one wonders, have they got to hide? Their refusal strikes me as deeply unethical. The course (costing \u00a3100) on Critical Appraisal, ran on February 2nd 2012. The aims are \"To develop introductory skills in the critical appraisal of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs)\". That sounds good. Have they had a change of heart about testing treatments? But, as always, you have to look at who is running the course. Is it perhaps a statistician with expertise in clinical trials? Or is it a clinician with experience in running trials? There are plenty of people with this sort of expertise. But no, It is being run by a pharmacist, [Karen Pilkington](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/directory/pilkington,-karen), from that hotbed of unscientific medicine, the University of Westminster. Pilkington originally joined the University of Westminster as manager for a 4-year project to review the evidence on complementary therapies (funded by the Department of Health). All of her current activities centre round alternative medicine and most of her publications are in journals that are dedicated to alternative medicine. She teaches \"Critical Appraisal\" at Westminster too, so I should soon have the teaching materials, despite the College's attempts to conceal them. Three people who ought to know better Ore has to admire, however grudgingly, the way that the quacks who run the College of Medicine have managed to enlist the support of several people who really should know better. I suppose they have been duped by that most irritating characteristic of quacks, the tendency to pretend they have the monopoly on empathetic treatment of patients. We all agree that empathy is good, but every good doctor has it. One problem seems to be that senior medical people are not very good at using Google. They don't do their homework. | || | Professor Sir Graeme Catto MD DSc FRCP FMedSci FRSE is FBA, FKC, FUCL, Hon.DSc(Glasgow), Hon.FRCP is vice-president of the College. Among many other things he is Emeritus Professor of Health Law, Ethics and Policy at University College London.

He's undoubtedly a well-meaning man, but so focussed on his (excellent) homelessness project that he seems immune to the company he keeps. Perhaps the clue lies in the fact that when I asked him what he thought of Lansely's health bill, he seemed to quite like it. It seems to me to be incomprehensible that these three people should be willing to sign a [letter in the British Medical Journal](/bmj-CoM-letters-2011.pdf) in defence of the College, with co-signatories George Lewith (about whom much has been written here) and the homeopath Christine Glover. In so doing, they betray medicine, they betray reason, and most important of all, they betray patients. Perhaps they have spent too much time sitting on very important committees and not enough time with patients. The stated aims of the College sound good. \"A force that combines scientific knowledge, clinical expertise and the patient's own perspective. A force that will re-define what good medicine means renewing the traditional values of service, commitment and compassion and creating a more holistic, patient-centred, preventative approach to healthcare.\" But what they propose to do about it is, with a few exceptions, bad. They try to whip up panic by exaggerating the crisis in the NHS. There are problems of course, but they result largely from under-funding (we still spend less on healthcare than most developed countries), and from the progressive involvement of for-profit commercial companies, like Capita. The College has the wrong diagnosis and the wrong solution. How do they propose to take care of an aging population? Self-care and herbal medicines seem to be their solution. | | The | | It seems that the College of Medicine are aiding and abetting the destruction of the National Health Service. That makes me angry.( [here's why](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2073)) I can end only with the most poignant tweet in the run up to the passing of the Health and Social Care Act.

[Use Firefox if embedded videos do not show in Chrome] Andrew Lansley's Health Bill (HASSB) aims to change the NHS into something more like the US system, which gives worse results at twice the cost. The only possible reason for wanting to do that is simple far-right ideology. No wonder that no hint was given of its intentions before the election. On the contrary, David Cameron stated repeatedly that there would be no top-down reorganisation of the NHS. That turned out to be a straight lie. \"First let me tell you what we are not going to do. There will be no more of those pointless reorganisations that aim for change, but instead bring chaos.\" [David Cameron speaking to Royal College of Nursing in 2009, before election]. We all know that money must be saved. But the two major disasters of the coalition government don't save any money. On the contrary, both tuition fees and NHS-wrecking will cost taxpayers' money. The tuition fees are done (for the time being) but there is still time to save the NHS. The best simple explanation that I've found is by Dr Max Pemberton in the Telegraph: [Read this - and prepare to fight for your NHS](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9106880/Read-this-and-prepare-to-fight-for-your-NHS.html). The Bill is three times longer than the 1946 Bill that brought the NHS into existence. \"The power to determine the services that make up the NHS will be transferred from the Secretary of State to newly created Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), which are unelected. Members will include GPs but also company chief executives who can, if they wish, outsource decisions about the appropriate level of services offered to companies with commercial interests. This is what the Government means when it says it is handing GPs \u00a360 billion of NHS money. \" \"Monitor. This quango is composed of unelected and unaccountable individuals. It will not have overarching responsibility - which the Government does currently - to ensure that everyone's health needs are met.\" \"It will have the power to decide, on purely financial grounds, if an area loses its existing range of hospital services, such as A&E departments, with no duty to consider alternative provision. \"With so many different providers of health care created under this Bill, those with complex health care needs may not receive the joined-up medical care that the NHS now works hard to provide.\" \"Less profitable patients - those requiring complex levels of care from multiple individuals and areas of expertise, for example - may be sidelined by these private companies. \" \"the Bill allows CCGs to contract out commissioning functions to private accountancy, health insurance and management consultant firms, which will be able to decide what care is provided free at the point of use through the NHS and what is not. This means that profit-making companies will be able to provide your clinical care and also decide what you're entitled to under the NHS and from which care providers.\" \"There is the potential for commercial conflicts when the needs of shareholders come between doctors and patients. \" \"Providers, too, can reduce levels of service provision and entitlement to NHS-funded care and there are no restrictions on charging for non-NHS care.\" \"Now, up to 49 per cent of income can be generated from private income. This means that almost half the beds currently used for NHS care could be given over to private patients.\" \"This could create a two-tier system in hospitals\" and \"create a conflict of interest, with hospitals having a clear incentive to encourage as many patients as possible to use the private half of their facilities. Moreover, hospitals can decide when to discharge patients. The requirement for coordinated discharge and aftercare of patients between health and social care is abolished in the Bill. \" Why is the bill needed at all? Most people believe that there is no need for a bill. The real aim appears to be in part 3, which proposes a vast increase in private providers. [Oliver Huitson says](http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/oliver-huitson/nhs-still-on-road-to-privatisation) \"A [US report comparing]the health services of 7 major economies ranked the NHS 1st in terms of efficiency, and 2nd overall. The US, which has vast private sector involvement and much greater use of GP commissioning, was ranked last despite spending more than twice as much per head as the UK\" \" Despite being ranked as one of the most efficient and equitable health services in the developed world, the Conservatives are determined to remodel it in the image of one of the least efficient - all in the name of \"improving efficiency\".\" Although most GPs are in favour of having more say in what happens, even the first parts of the bill are a mess. They are advertised as reducing bureaucracy and reducing costs. According to [ the Financial Times](http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2011/08/organograms-show-nhs-becoming-even-more-complex/#axzz1l1XR4ufQ), they do exactly the opposite. \"Here was the original NHS bureaucracy in graphic form\" Here is the new NHS bureaucracy in graphic form Ed Miliband [pointed out](http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2011/06/uncomfortable-pmqs-for-both-leaders-over-health-quangos-and-strikes/#axzz1U3rlO6n6) that the number of NHS statutory organisations was growing from 163 to 521 - networks\", \"clinical senates\" and so on. So much for reduced bureaucracy. Who thinks this is not a good idea? Almost everyone. Not just the BMA which Lansley dismisses as a Trade Union, despite the fact that now (unlike in 1948) the BMA is voting against the financial interests of its members. The Royal College of General Practitioners says Drop the Bill. So do Royal College of Nursing. Royal College of Midwives, Faculty of Public Health, Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, the Patients' Association, among others. Almost the only support left is from the NHS Alliance, a tiny organisation run by [Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#dixon), friend of the Prince of Wales and advocate of quack medicine. The NHS alliance ran its own poll. A total of 100 people have voted so far, 99 of them against the Alliance's policy. Some support. A rather [good infographic](http://www.nhscampaign.org/NHS-reforms/size-matters.html) shows how the balance lies. The BMA's General Practitioners Committee, which represents all GPs in the UK says [ [read full letter](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/documents/4585159/1b16446c-c194-4b99-9d57-12d8e67395b9)] \"1.

It now has over 167,000 signatories. But despite the fact that petitions with over 100,000 signatures are meant to trigger a debate in the House of Commons, the backbench business committee of MPs has decided not to debate the e-petition. So many people have rallied to oppose the daftness that it's invidious to single out names. Nonetheless special mentions must go to Clare Gerada (@clarercgp on Twitter) (chair of the Pollock](http://allysonpollock.co.uk/) and [Martin McKee](http://martinmckeesblog.blogspot.com/) have done superb work on the details. Most telling of all, some of the people who started by supporting Lansley have changed their minds. One concern about the \"any qualified provider\" idea is that it could open the door to quackery. Any \"qualified\" homeopath could bid for business at a competitive rate -sugar pills don't cost much. Michael Dixon is one such. Dr Sam Everington of Tower Hamlets is another.

If you feel reassured by Lansley's assurances that his measures aren't de facto privatisation, just watch this video. It reveals some of the network of lobby groups that are circling the NHS, eager to take your money. For example, the lobby group, Policy Exchange, \"Cameron's favourite\", co-founded by Francis Maude, a member of Cameron's cabinet, and is lobbying for more private sector provision of NHS services. One of the companies that it's taken money from is called Tribal, which wants to take over commissioning from GPs. One of the directors of Tribal has described Andrew Lansley's reforms as being \"denationalisation of health services in England\". So you don't need to listen to left-wingers. The industry itself is in no doubt that it's privatisation, and it's ready and waiting to grab our money.. And of all unlikely allies, the vice chair of the British Holistic Medical Association has written [a powerful letter](http://www.bhma.org/media/blog%20and%20news/Privatisation_of_the_NHS_Feb2012.pdf) about how the bill really would result in privatisation. The likely consequences have been put well by Ben Goldacre in his [What will happen with the NHS bill, in 5 tweets.](http://bengoldacre.posterous.com/what-will-happen-with-the-nhs-bill-in-5-tweet) The following points are based partly on this. - GPs know they're being set up to fail by being given commissioning powers, which they have neither the time nor the expertise to do properly. - After GPs fail, private commissioning expertise will be needed. Large private companies will be given the job and they will come to operate like health insurers. - These large bodies, like public/private insurance companies, will be able to pick and choose patients. They will naturally prefer the ones from whom they can make the most money (and not the sick or the old). Note that there is no geographical responsibility in the bill - Small differences will gradually emerge in what services they offer. Top up plans will become available. And that will be the end of the NHS in the form in which we know it. The only way that the proposals make any sense at all is if the underlying aim is to destroy the NHS, in anything like its present form. I believe that Lansley's aims are much more to do with his personal political ideologies than anything to do with health. Those ideologies are far to the right of anything envisaged by Margaret Thatcher. The politics. Where are the Lib Dems? I voted Lib Dem in 2010, and [I said precisely why](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3000). Of course I didn't expect they'd get a majority. They were just the party that I found least objectionable. Like so many others I watched with horror as the numbers came out. There was no other option but to form a coalition with Conservatives. Well, I'd have been happier with no coalition, but the danger of that producing an overall majority for Conservatives after a year or so made that a very risky option. When the coalition formed I was alarmed by the prospects for both education and for the NHS. I was less alarmed by the latter, because Cameron had said so many times that he had no intention of messing with the NHS. That turned out to be a direct lie. I could scarcely believe it when Lansley produced a plan after the election for the biggest reorganisation ever in the NHS, something that had not been foreshadowed in any way in the Conservative manifesto. This was one of the most dishonest bits of political manoeuvring that I've ever encountered. Clearly we were spending more than we could afford. What's unforgivable is to do things that actually cost the taxpayer more than before. Such actions are quite the opposite of cuts. Yet they are being done in the two areas, than any others, that have got Lib Dem voters angry. (a) The \u00a39k tuition fees cost the taxpayer more than the \u00a33k fees did, because of the financing arrangements. I can see no conceivable reason for spending more taxpayers' money than before apart from (Conservative) political ideology. That's done (for now) so back to the main topic of this post, the NHS. (b) It seems inevitable that Lansley's proposals will cost money, not save money. Presumably that was predicted in the risk register, the concealment of which is a disgrace. See [Liberal Conspiracy ](http://liberalconspiracy.org/2012/02/04/releasing-lansleys-risk-register-is-key-to-saving-the-nhs/)and the [Green Benches](http://eoin-clarke.blogspot.com/2012/02/andrew-lansley-covers-up-nhs-report.html) blogs. The Information Commissioner ordered the release of the risk register, but the coalition refused (so much for transparent government). They appealed so now it goes to an Information Tribunal. An [Early Day Motion](http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/2659) in the House of Commons urged release. It was signed by only 16 Lib Dems. The bill started to fall apart in a major way when, on February 6th, The Times [reported that](http://politicalscrapbook.net/2012/02/andrew-lansley-shot-rachel-sylvester/) \"Andrew Lansley should be taken out and shot,\" says a Downing Street source. \"He's messed up both the communication and the substance of the policy.\" But Cameron, instead of grasping the chance, decided to back a loser. Some Lib Dems have stuck to their principles. For example John Pugh MP, Co-Chair of the Lib Dem Parliamentary Health Committee, re-established the [Beveridge group, and ](http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/) [wrote a letter](http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/docs/letter.htm) [ to parliamentarians to explain why.](http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/) Andrew George MP wrote [Health Bill has no friends. Dignified withdrawal would be best](http://andrewgeorge.org.uk/featured-articles/health-bill-has-no-friends-dignified-withdrawal-would-be-best/). On 13 February, hearts soared when Lib Dem peer [Shirley Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Williams) spoke out at last. [She urged Lansley](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/feb/13/shirley-williams-andrew-lansley-nhs-competition-clauses) to drop part 3 of the bill, the part that deals with privatisation. The elation didn't last long though. Nick Clegg told the BBC: \"Andrew Lansley is the architect of the NHS bill. He cares passionately about the NHS. He's the right man for the job and he must see it through.\". Yes, I know about Cabinet solidarity, but it's hard to think of any surer way to lose elections than to make statements like that. Even many Conservatives don't believe it: see, for example, [Dr Rachel Joyce](http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2012/02/dr-rachel-joyce-why-are-doctors-nurses-and-midwives-so-opposed-to-the-nhs-reforms-and-what-should-be.html) on Conservative Home. On 24th February, the Lib Dem president, Tim Farron MP, [spoke up at last](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17156756). \"Mr Farron told ITV the bill should have been \"massively changed\" or dropped earlier and he wanted plans for more competition in the NHS to be dropped\". On 26 February, Nigel Crisp, described the bill as a [confusing mess that risks setting the NHS back](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17169519). Crisp was formerly NHS chief executive and the permanent secretary at the Department of Health from 2000 to 2006, and is now a crossbench peer. Like everyone else, he was ignored. The elation about Shirley Williams intervention didn't last long. On 27th February a [joint letter from Williams and Clegg](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/feb/27/letter-nick-clegg-shirley-williams) claimed that they'd fixed the bill. The letter was quickly subjected to a [bullshitometer analysis, by Health Policy Insight. ](http://www.healthpolicyinsight.com/?q=node/1350) Bafflingly, Lansley declared in public that he'd \"changed his mind\" about the privatisation, while at the same time Lansley and Cameron claimed that nothing much had changed: see [Downing Street in knots as it plays down Nick Clegg's NHS concessions](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2012/feb/27/nickclegg-davidcameron), and [Paul Corrigan's blog](http://www.pauldcorrigan.com/Blog/conservative-party/question-when-is-an-amendment-to-the-health-and-social-care-bill-both-insignificant-and-important-at-the-same-time/comment-page-1/#comment-85397).

First, as reported thus in [the Independent.](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/yellow-rebels-take-on-clegg-over-nhs-betrayal-7469060.html) \"Graham Winyard, the former deputy Chief Medical Officer, resigned from the party in protest at the leadership's backing for the Bill. Dr Winyard, who was chairman of Winchester Liberal Democrats until last year, told Mr Clegg in a letter: \"It is just not sensible to impose this top-down reorganisation on an NHS struggling to meet the biggest financial challenge in its history. To continue to do so in the face of near unanimous opposition from patient, staff and professional organisations simply invites slow motion disaster both for the NHS and for the party.\" He said that he had no option but to resign \"with great sadness\". \" Then, also on 1st March, Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA's GPs committee, wrote to 22,000 GPs.

This outfit seemed to me to be so dangerous that a word of warning is in the public interest. Their own description says \"YES TO LIFE is a new charitable initiative to open up a positive future for people with cancer in the UK by supporting an integrative* approach to cancer care\". That sounds sort of cuddly but lets look below the surface. As so often, the funding seems to have been raised as the result of the death of an unfortunate 23 year old woman. Instead of putting the money into real research, yet another small charity was formed. My correspondent pointed out that \"I came across them at St Pancras Station on Friday afternoon \u2014 they had a live DJ to draw in the crowd and were raising funds through bucket collections\". No doubt many people just see the word 'cancer' and put money in the bucket, without realising that their money will be spent on promoting nonsensical and ineffective treatments. The supporters list.

The more interesting supporters come later. [Dr Rosy Daniel](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881)of Health Creation is an old friend. After I complained about her promotion of some herbal concoction called Carctol to \"heal cancer\", she was reprimanded by Trading Standards for breaching the Cancer Act 1939, and forced to change the claims (in my view she should have neen prosecuted but, luckily of her, Trading Standards people are notoriously ineffective). There is, of course not the slightest reason to to think that Carctol works (download [Carctol: Profits before Patients?](http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf)).

The Help Centre YesToLife has a [help centre](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/y2l/helpcentre.html). But beware, There is no medical person there. Just Traditional Chinese medicine ( [rather dangerous](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923)), acupuncture, osteopath and naturopathy (which means, roughly, do nothing and hope for the best). Patrick Holford, There can be no better indication of the standard of advice to be expected from YesToLife than the fact they are advertising a lecture by Holford, with the enticing title \" [Say no to cancer](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/eents/seminars.html)\".\"Through learning about the effects of diet and nutrition, people with cancer or at risk of developing cancer can be empowered to say Yes to Life and No to Cancer\". Would that it were so easy. It will cost you \u00a315.00. Just in case there is still nobody who has heard of Holford, he is the media nutritionist who has an entire chapter devoted to him in Ben Goldacre's Bad Science book, He has a whole website that has exposed his dubious advice, the excellent [HolfordWatch](http://holfordwatch.info/). And you can find quite a lot about him [on this blog](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Patrick+Holford). Try, for example, [Patrick Holford's CV: the strange case of Dr John Marks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=44), and [Response to a threatening letter from Mr Holford](#), or [Holford's untruthful and unsubstantiated advertisement](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=163) The treatments directory Now we get to the truly scary bit of YesToLife, their [treatment directory](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/newresourcestart.php). Try searching for 'cancer type' and then \"breast (metastatic)\".. We find no mention of the advances in understanding of the genetics of breast cancer, nor ot real therapies like tamoxifen. What we find are four \"alternative treatments\". [Neuroimmunomodulation Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(35))It sounds impressive until you learn that its only proponent is a an 82 year old Venezuelan doctor with a clinic in Caracas. Even YesToLife doesn't pretend that there is any evidence that it works [Vitamin C Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(36))The old chestnut cure-all Vitamin C Again even YesToLife don't pretend there is any good evidence but it is still offered; treatment cost \u00a33140.00 (what? Vitamin C is very cheap indeed) [Dendritic Cell Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(30))Said by YesToLife to be \"well-researched\", though that isn't so for breast cancer (metastatic). Although possibly not as barmy as the other things that are recommended, it is nevertheless not shown to be effective for any sort of cancer, [Gerson Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(14))It is a sign of the extreme unreliability of advice given by YesToLife that they should still recommend anything as totally discredited as Gerson Therapy.Although YesToLife describes it as \"well-researched\" that is simply not true: there are no proper clinical trials. [Cancer Research UK say](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/gerson-therapy?script=true) \"Overall, there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer. \" \"Available scientific evidence does not support claims that Gerson therapy can treat cancer. It is not approved for use in the United States. Gerson therapy can be very harmful to your health. Coffee enemas have been linked to serious infections, dehydration, constipation, colitis (inflammation of the colon), and electrolyte imbalances. In some people, particular aspects of the diet such as coffee enemas have been thought to be responsible for their death.\" Recommended reading: [The (Not-So-)Beautiful (Un)Truth about the Gerson protocol and cancer quackery](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=291), by David Gorski (breast cancer surgeon, writing in [Science-based Medicine](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=791). Conclusion The information supplied by YesToLife is more likely to kill you than to cure you. The next time you see somebody collecting for a \"cancer charity\" be very careful before you give them money. Follow-up November 2012. It gets worse. I had an email from someone who was distressed because a friend was trying to raise \u00a315,000 to cover the cost of treatments recommended by YesToLife. The treatment is high-dose intravenous Vitamin C infusion. This is pure quackery. There isn't the slightest reason to think it will affect the course of cancer, or the wellbeing of the patient. It is exploitation of the desperate. My heart sinks at the thought that a \"charity\" can be quite so wicked. The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health [shut down amidst scandal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) in April 2010. In July, we heard that a new \"College of Medicine\" was to arise from its ashes. It seemed clear [from the people involved](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) that the name \"College of Medicine\" would be deceptive. Now the College of Medicine has materialised, and it is clear that one's worst fears were well justified. At first sight, it looks entirely plausible and well-meaning. Below the logo [one reads](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/about-college-medicine) \"There is a new force in medicine. A force that brings patients, doctors, nurses and other health professionals together, instead of separating them into tribes.\" \"That force is the new College of Medicine. Uniquely, it brings doctors and other health professionals together with patients and scientists.\" It is apparent from the outset that the well-meaning words fall into the trap described so clearly by James May (see [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095)). It fails to distinguish between curing and caring. As always, the clue lies not in the words, but in the people who are running it. Who is involved? After a bit of digging on the web site, you find the names of the people on the [Science Council of the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/science-council), The preamble says \"Good medicine must be grounded in good science as well as compassion. The College's Science Council brings a depth of knowledge from many senior figures.\" But then come the names. With the odd exception the \"science council\" is like a roll-call of quacks, the dregs left over from the Prince's Foundation.

There are a few gaps in this table, to be filled in soon. One can guarantee that a great deal more will appear about the College on the web, very soon. The [Governing Council of the College](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council) is equally replete with quacks (plus a few surprising names). It has on it, for example, a spiritual healer (Angie-Buxton King), a homeopath (Christine Glover), a herbalist (Michael McIntyre). Westminster University's king of woo (David Peters), not to mention the infamous [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Karol+Sikora%22). Buxton-King [offers a remarkable service](#abk1) to heal people or animals at a distance. Meanwhile, it seemed worthwhile to provide a warning that the title of the College is very deceptive. It hides an agenda that could do much harm. It is, quite simply, the Prince of Wales by stealth. Follow-up 28 October 2010 Professor Sir Graeme Catto, who has, disgracefully, allowed his name to be used as president of this \"College\" has said to me \"There are real problems in knowing how to care for folk with chronic conditions and the extent of the evidence base for medicine is pretty limited\". Yes of course that is quite true. There are many conditions for which medicine can still do little. There is a fascinating discussion to be had about how best to care for them. The answer to that is NOT to bring in spiritual healers and peddlers of sugar pills to deceive patients with their fairy stories. The \"College of Medicine\" will delay and pervert the sort of discussion that Catto says, rightly, is needed. 29 October 2010 I need a press card. I see that the BMJ also had a piece about the \"College of Medicine\" yesterday: [Prince's foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full), by Nigel Hawkes. He got the main point right there in the title. As was [clear since July](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), the driving force was Michael Dixon, Devon GP and ex medical director of the Prince's Foundation. Hawkes goes easy on the homeopaths and spiritual healers, but did spot something that I can't find on their web site. The \"Faculties\" will include \"in 2011, neuromusculoskeletal care. Two of the six strong faculty members for this specialty are from the British Chiropractic Association, which sued the author Simon Singh for libel for his disobliging remarks about the evidence base for their interventions.\" The College certainly picks its moment to endorse chiropractic, a subject that is in chaos and disgrace after they lost the Singh affair. One bit of good news emerges from Hawkes' piece, There is at least one high profile doubter in the medical establishment, Lord (John) Walton (his 2000 report on CAM was less than blunt, and has been widely misquoted by quacks) is reported as saying, at the opening ceremony \"I'm here as a sceptic, and I've just told my former houseman that,\" he said. The target of the remark was Donald Irvine, another former GMC president and a member of the new college's advisory council.\" 31 October 2010. I got an email that pointed out a remarkable service offered by a member of College's [Governing Council](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). Angie Buxton-King, a \"spiritual healer\" employed by UCLH seems to have another web site, [The Beacon of Healing Light](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/) that is not mentioned in [her biography](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/angie-buxton-king) on the College's site. Perhaps it should have been because it makes some remarkable claims. The [page about distant healing](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/Distant_Healing.php) is the most bizarre. Absent Healing/Distant Healing \"Absent healing is available when it is not possible to visit the patient or it is not possible for the patient to be brought to our healing room. This form of healing has proved to be very successful for humans and animals alike.\" \"We keep a healing book within our healing room and every night spend time sending healing to all those who have asked for it. We have found that if a picture of the patient is sent to us the healing is more beneficial, we also require a weekly update to monitor any progress or change in the patients situation. Donations are welcome for this service.\" I wonder what the Advertising Standards people make of the claim that it is \"very successful\"? I wonder what the president of the College makes of it? I've asked him. Other blogs about the \"College of Medicine\" 30 October 2010. Margaret McCartney is always worth reading. As a GP she is at the forefront of medicine. She's written about the College in [The Crisis in Caring and dangerous inference](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=801). She's also provided some information about a \"professional member\" of the [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/dr-sam-everington), in [..and on Dr Sam Everington, at the Bromley by Bow Centre....](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=803) It is one of the more insulting things about alternative medicine addicts that they claim to be the guardians of caring (as opposed to curing), They are not, and people like McCartney and Michael Baum are excellent examples. Prince of Wales to become honorary president of the \"College of Medicine?\" Last night I heard a rumour that the Prince of Wales is, despite all the earlier denials, to become Honorary President of the \"College\". If this is true, it completes the wholesale transformation of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Medicine into this new \"College\". Can anybody take it seriously now? Text messages to Graeme Catto and Michael Dixon, inviting them to deny the rumour, have met with silence. Herbal nonsense at the College 29 July 2011. I got an email from the College if Medicine [ [download it](http://www.dcscience.net/COM-Self-care.pdf)]. It contains a lot of fantasy about herbal medicines, sponsered by a company that manufactures them. It is dangeroous and corrupt. |The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health ( | His attempts are often successful, but they are regarded by many people as being clearly unconstitutional. The FiH's [2009 AnnualConferen ce ](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/) conference was held at The King's Fund, London 13 - 14 May 2009. It was, as always, an almost totally one-sided affair devoted to misrepresentation of evidence and the promotion of magic medicine. But according to the FiH, at least, it was [a great success](http://www.fih.org.uk/what_we_do/integrated_health_awards/integrated_health_awards_2008/success_of_our_2009.html). The opening speech by the Quacktitioner Royal [can be read here](http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_for_the_prince_s_foundat_1928839521.html). It has already been [analysed by somebody who knows rather more about medicine than HRH](http://northerndoctor.com/2009/05/13/a-royal-fisking-prince-charles-on-integrated-health/). He concludes \"It is a shocking perversion of the real issues driven by one man; unelected, unqualified and utterly misguided\". We are promised some movie clips of the meeting. They might even make a nice UK equivalent of \" [Integrative baloney @ Yale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WF8ovmyfg)\". This post is intended to provide some background information about the speakers at the symposium. But let's start with what seems to me to be the real problem. The duplicitous use of the word \"integrated\" to mean two quite different things. The problem of euphemisms: spin and obfuscation One of the problems of meetings like this is the harm done by use of euphemisms. After looking at the programme, it becomes obvious that there is a rather ingenious bit of PR trickery going on. It confuses (purposely?) the many different definitions of the word \"integrative\" [. One definition of \"Integrative medicine](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/139304.php)\" is this (my emphasis). \" . . . orienting the health care process to engage patients and caregivers in the full range of physical, psychological, social, preventive, and therapeutic factors known to be effective and necessary for the achievement of optimal health.\" That is a thoroughly admirable aim. And that, I imagine, is the sense in which several of the speakers (Marmot, Chantler etc) used the term. Of course the definition is rather too vague to be very helpful in practice, but nobody would dream of objecting to it. But another definition of the same term 'integrative medicine' is as a PR-friendly synonym for 'alternative medicine', and that is clearly the sense in which it is used by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH), as is immediately obvious from [ their web site](http://www.fih.org.uk/). The [guide to the main therapies ](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/complementary_healthcare_a_guide/guide_to_the_main.html)supports everything from homeopathy to chiropractic to naturopathy, in a totally uncritical way. Integrated service refers explicitly to integration of 'complementary' medicine, and that itself is largely a euphemism for alternative medicine. For example, the [FIH's guide to homeopathy](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/complementary_healthcare_a_guide/overview_of_the_main_complementary_therapies/homeopathy.html) says \"What is homeopathy commonly used for? Homeopathy is most often used to treat chronic conditions such as asthma; eczema; arthritis; fatigue disorders like ME; headache and menopausal problems; irritable bowel syndrome; Crohn's disease; allergies; repeated ear, nose, throat and chest infections or urine infections; depression and anxiety.\" But there is not a word about the evidence, and perhaps that isn't surprising because the evidence that it works in any of these conditions is essentially zero. The FIH document Complementary Health Care: A Guide for Patients appears to have vanished from the web after its inaccuracy received a very bad press, e.g. in [the Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article3760857.ece), and also [here](http://dcscience.net/?p=228). It is also interesting that the equally widely criticised Smallwood report (also sponsored by the Prince of Wales) seems to have vanished too). The programme for the meeting can be seen here, for [Day 1](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/programme.htm), and [Day 2 ](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/day2.htm) Conference chair Dr Phil Hammond, GP, comedian and health service writer. Hammond asked the FIH if I could speak at the meeting to provide a bit of balance. Guess what? They didn't want balance. 09:30 Opening session Dr Michael Dixon OBE 09:30 Introduction: a new direction for The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health and new opportunities in integrated health and care. Dr Michael Dixon, Medical Director, FIH Michael Dixon is devoted to just about every form of alternative medicine. As well as being medical director of the Prince's Foundation he also runs the NHS Alliance. Despite its name, the NHS Alliance is nothing to do with the NHS and acts, among other things, as an advocate of alternative medicine on the NHS, about which it [has published a lot](http://www.nhsalliance.org/documents.asp?display=docs&themeid=8). Dr Dixon is also a GP at [College Surgery](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/index.asp), Cullompton, Devon, where his \"integrated practice\" includes [dozens of alternative practitioners](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Practitioners.asp). They include not only disproven things like homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), but also even more bizarre practitioners in ' [Thought Field Therapy](http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-07/thought-field-therapy.html)' and ' [Frequencies of Brilliance](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/index.html)'. To take only one of these, 'Frequencies of Brilliance' is bizarre beyond belief. One need only quote its founder and chief salesperson. \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a unique energy healing technique that involves the activation of energetic doorways on both the front and back of the body.\" \"These doorways are opened through a series of light touches. This activation introduces high-level Frequencies into the emotional and physical bodies. It works within all the cells and with the entire nervous system which activates new areas of the brain.\" \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a 4th /5th dimensional work. The process is that of activating doorways by lightly touching the body or working just above the body.\" \"Each doorway holds the highest aspect of the human being and is complete in itself. This means that there is a perfect potential to be accessed and activated throughout the doorways in the body.\" Best of all, it can all be [done at a distance ](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/longdistancework.html)(that must help sales a lot). One is reminded of the Skills for Health \"competence\" in distant healing (inserted on a government web site at the behest (you guessed it) of the Prince's Foundation, [as related here](http://dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh)) \"The intent of a long distance Frequencies of Brilliance (FOB) session is to enable a practitioner to facilitate a session in one geographical location while the client is in another. A practitioner of FOB that has successfully completed a Stage 5 Frequency workshop has the ability to create and hold a stable energetic space in order to work with a person that is not physically present in the same room. The space that is consciously created in the Frequencies of Brilliance work is known as the \"Gap\". It is a space of nonlinear time. It contains \"no time and no space\" or respectively \"all time and all space\". Within this \"Gap\" a clear transfer of the energies takes place and is transmitted to an individual at a time and location consciously intended. Since this dimensional space is in non-linear time the work can be performed and sent backward or forward in time as well as to any location. The Frequencies of Brilliance work cuts through the limitations of our physical existence and allows us to experience ourselves in other dimensional spaces. Therefore people living in other geographic locations than a practitioner have an opportunity to receive and experience the work. The awareness of this dimensional space is spoken about in many indigenous traditions, meditation practices, and in the world of quantum physics. It is referred to by other names such as the void, or vacuum space, etc.\" This is, of course, preposterous gobbledygook. It, and other things in Dr Dixon's [treatment guide](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Treatment.asp), seem to be very curious things to impose on patients in the 21st century. Latest news. The [Mid-Devon Star announces](http://www.middevonstar.co.uk/news/4198135.Homeopathy_comes_to_Cullompton/) yet more homeopathy in Dr Dixon's Cullompton practice. This time it comes in the form of a clinic run from the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. I guess they must be suffering from reduced commissioning like all the other homeopathic hospitals, but Dr Dixon seems to have come to their rescue. The connection seems to be with Bristol's homeopathic consultant, Dr Elizabeth A Thompson. On 11 December 2007 I wrote to Dr Thompson, thus | | In March 2006, a press release This was reported also on the BBC I'd be very grateful if you could let me know when results from this trial will become available. Yours sincerely David Colquhoun The reply, dated 11 December 2007, was unsympathetic | | I have just submitted the funders report today and we have set ourselves the deadline to publish two inter-related papers by March 1st 2007. Can I ask why you are asking and what authority you have to gain this information. I shall expect a reply to my questions, I answered this question politely on the same day but nevertheless my innocent enquiry drew forth a rather vitriolic complaint from Dr Thompson to the Provost of UCL (dated 14 December 2007). In this case, the Provost came up trumps. On 14 January 2008 he replied to Thompson: \"I have looked at the email that you copied to me, and I must say that it seems an entirely proper and reasonable request. It is not clear to me why Professor Colquhoun should require some special authority to make such direct enquiries\". Dr Thompson seems to be very sensitive. We have yet to see the results of her trial in which I'm still interested. Not surprisingly, Dr Dixon has had some severe criticism for his views, not least from the UK's foremost expert on the evidence for efficacy, Prof Edzard Ernst. Accounts of this can be found in [Pulse](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&storycode=4121964&c=2), and on [Andrew Lewis's blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/graceless-dr-michael-dixon-obe.html). Dixon is now (in)famous in the USA too. The excellent Yale neurologist, Steven Novella, has written an analysis of his views on Science Based Medicine. He describes Dr. Michael Dixon as \" [A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=450)\" Peter Hain 09:40 Politics and people: can integrated health and care take centre stage in 2009/2010? Rt Hon Peter Hain MP It seems that Peter Hain was converted to alternative medicine when his first baby, Sam, was born with eczema. After (though possibly not because of) homeopathic treatment and a change in diet, the eczema got better. This caused Hain, while Northern Ireland Secretary to spend \u00a3200,000 of taxpayers' money to set up a totally uninformative customer satisfaction survey, which is being touted elsewhere in this meeting as though it were evidence (see below). I have written about this episode before: see [Peter Hain and Get Well UK: pseudoscience and privatisation in Northern Ireland](http://dcscience.net/?p=33). I find it very sad that a hero of my youth (for his work in the anti-apartheid movement) should have sunk to promoting junk science, and even sadder that he does so at my expense. There has been a report on Hain's contribution in [Wales Online](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/05/15/make-complementary-medicine-free-on-the-nhs-says-hain-91466-23628473/). 09:55 Why does the Health Service need a new perspective on health and healing? Sir Cyril Chantler, Chair, King's Fund, previous Dean, Guy's Hospital and Great Ormond Street Cyril Chantler is a distinguished medical administrator. He also likes to talk and we have discussed the quackery problem several times. He kindly sent me the slides that he used. Slide 18 says that in order to do some good we \"need to demonstrate that the treatment is clinically effective and cost effective for NHS use\". That's impeccable, but throughout the rest of the slides he talks of integrating with complementary\" therapies, the effectiveness of which is either already disproved or simply not known. I remain utterly baffled by the reluctance of some quite sensible people to grasp the nettle of deciding what works. Chantler fails to grasp the nettle, as does the Department of Health. Until they do so, I don't see how they can be taken seriously. 10.05 Panel discussion The Awards 10:20 Integrated Health Awards 2009 Introduction: a review of the short-listed applications 10:45 Presentations to the Award winners by the special guest speaker 11:00 Keynote address by special guest speaker Getting integrated Dr David Peters 12:00 Integration, long term disease and creating a sustainable NHS. Professor David Peters, Clinical Director and Professor of Integrated Healthcare, University of Westminster I first met David Peters after Nature ran my article, [Science Degrees without the Science. ](http://dcscience.net/?p=19).One of the many media follow-ups of that article was on Material World (BBC Radio 4). This [excellent science programme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/thematerialworld.shtml), presented by Quentin Cooper, had a discussion between me and David Peters ( [listen to the mp3 file).](http://dcscience.net/material-world-part2-220307.mp3) There was helpful intervention from Michael Marmot who had talked, in the first half of the programme, about his longitudinal population studies. Marmot stressed the need for proper testing. In the case of homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), that proper testing has largely been done. The tests were failed. The University of Westminster has, of course, gained [considerable notoriety](http://dcscience.net/?s=Westminster+university) as the university that runs more degree programmes in anti-scientific forms of medicine than any other. Their lecture on [vibrational medicine](http://dcscience.net/?p=227) teaches students that [amethysts \"emit high Yin energy so transmuting lower energies and clearing and aligning energy disturbances at all levels of being\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=227#slides). So far their vice-chancellor, Professor Geoffrey Petts, has declined to answer enquiries about whether he thinks such gobbledygook is appropriate for a BSc degree. But he did set up an internal enquiry into the future of their alternative activities. Sadly that enquiry seems to have come to the nonsensical conclusion that the problem can be solved by injection of good science into the courses, as [reported here](http://dcscience.net/?p=1191) and in [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/feb/24/homeopathy-science). It seems obvious that if you inject good science into their BSc in homeopathy the subject will simply vanish in a puff of smoke. In 2007, the University of Westminster did respond to earlier criticism in [Times Higher Education](http://dcscience.net/thes-060407.pdf), but [their response](http://dcscience.net/?p=83) seemed to me to serve only to dig themselves deeper into a hole. Nevertheless, Westminster has now closed down its homeopathy degree (the last in the country to go) and there is intense internal discussion going on there. I have the impression that Dr Peters' job is in danger. The [revelation of more slides](http://dcscience.net/?p=1329) from their courses on homeopathy, naturopathy and Chinese herbal medicine shows that these courses are not only barmy, but also sometimes dangerous. Professor Chris Fowler 12:10 Educating tomorrow's integrated doctors. Professor Chris Fowler, Dean for Education, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry I first came across Dr Fowler when I noticed him being praised for his teaching of alternative medicine to students at Barts and the London Medical School on the web site of the Prince's Foundation. I wrote him a polite letter to ask if he really thought that the Prince of Wales was the right person to consult about the education of medical students. The response I got was, ahem, unsympathetic. But a little while later I noticed that two different Barts students had set up public blogs that criticised strongly the nonsense that was being inflicted on them. At that point, I felt it was necessary to support the students who, it seemed to me, knew more about medical education than Professor Fowler. It didn't take long to uncover the nonsense that was being inflicted on the students: [read about it here](http://dcscience.net/?p=555). There is a [follow-up to this story here](http://dcscience.net/?p=1143). Fortunately, Barts' Director of Research, and, I'm told, the Warden of Barts, appear to agree with my view of the harm that this sort of thing can do to the reputation of Barts, so things may change soon, Dame Donna Kinnair 12:30 Educating tomorrow's integrated nurses. Dame Donna Kinnair, Director of Nursing, Southwark PCT As far as I can see, Donna Kinnair has no interest in alternative medicine. She is director of nursing at Southwark primary care trust and was an adviser to Lord Laming throughout his inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9. I suspect that her interest is in integrating child care services (they need it, judging by the recent death of 'Baby P'). Perhaps her presence shows the danger of using euphemisms like 'integrated medicine' when what you really mean is the introduction of unproven or disproved forms of medicine. Michael Dooley 12:40 Integrating the care of women: an example of the new paradigm. Michael Dooley, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist DC's rule 2. Never trust anyone who uses the word 'paradigm'. It is a sure-fire sign of pseudoscience. In this case, the 'new paradigm' seems to be the introduction of disproven treatment. Dooley is a gynaecologist and Medical Director of the [ Poundbury Clinic](http://www.thepoundburyclinic.com/). His clinic offers a [whole range of unproven](http://www.thepoundburyclinic.com/treatments.htm) and disproved treatments. These include acupuncture as an aid to conception in IVF. This is not recommended by the [ Cochrane review](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab006920.html), and one report suggests that it [hinders conception rather than helps](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/oct/17/medicalresearch). 12.40 Discussion 13.00 - 14.00 Lunch and Exhibition 15.30 Tea Boo Armstrong and Get Well UK 16.00 Integrated services in action: The Northern Ireland experience: what has it shown us and what are its implications? Boo Armstrong of Get Well UK with a team from the NI study I expect that much will be made of this \"study\", which, of course, tells you absolutely nothing whatsoever about the effectiveness of the alternative treatments that were used in it. This does not appear to be the view of Boo Armstrong, On the basis of the \"study\", her [company's web site](http://www.getwelluk.com/) proclaims boldly \"Complementary Medicine Works Get Well UK ran the first government-backed complementary therapy project in the UK, from February 2007 to February 2008 This claim appears, prima facie, to breach the [Unfair Trading Regulations](http://dcscience.net/?p=790) of May 2008. The legality of the claim is, at the moment, being judged by a Trading Standards Officer. In any case, the \"study\" was not backed by the government as a whole, but just by Peter Hain's office. It is not even clear that it had ethical approval. The study consisted merely of asking people who had seen an alternative medicine practitioner whether they felt better or worse. There was no control group; no sort of comparison was made. It is surely obvious to the most naive person that a study like this cannot even tell you if the treatment has a placebo effect, never mind that it has any genuine effects of its own. To claim that it does so seems to be simply dishonest. There is no reason at all to think that the patients would not have got better anyway. It is not only Get Well UK who misrepresent the evidence. The [Prince's Foundation itself ](http://www.fih.org.uk/media_centre/sense_at_last.html)says \"Now a new, year long trial supported by the Northern Ireland health service has . . . demonstrated that integrating complementary and conventional medicine brings measurable benefits to patients' health.\" That is simply not true. It is either dishonest or stupid. Don't ask me which, I have no idea. This study is no more informative than the [infamous Spence (2005) 'study'](http://dcscience.net/?p=198) of the same type, which seems to be the only thing that homeopaths can produce to support their case. There is an excellent analysis of the Northern Ireland 'study' by Andy Lewis, [The Northern Ireland NHS Alternative Medicine 'Trial'](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/northern-ireland-nhs-alternative.html). He explains patiently, yet again, what constitutes evidence and why studies like this are useless. His analogy starts \" . . . the Apple Marketing Board approach the NHS and ask for \u00a3200,000 to do a study to show the truth behind the statement 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away'. The Minister, being particularly fond of apples, agrees and the study begins.\" 16.30 Social enterprise and whole systems integrated care. Dee Kyne, Sandwell PCT and a GP.

Peter Mackereth, Clinical Lead, Supportive Services, Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust I had some correspondence with Mackereth when the Times (7 Feb 2007) published a picture of the Prince of Wales inspecting an \"anti-MRSA aromatherapy inhaler\" in his department at the Christie. It turned out that the trial they were doing was not blind No result has been announced anyway, and on enquiry, I find that the trial has not even started yet. Surprising, then to find that the FIH is running the [First Clinical Aromatherapy Conference at the Christie Hospital](http://www.fih.org.uk/events/events_from_other_organisations/1st_clinical.html), What will there be to talk about? Much of what they do at the Christie is straightforward massage, but [they also promote](http://www.christie.nhs.uk/press/2007/070207.aspx) the nonsensical principles of \"reflexology\" and acupuncture. The former is untested. The latter [is disproven](http://dcscience.net/?p=945). Parallel Sessions Developing a PCT funded musculoskeletal service Dr Roy Welford, Glastonbury Health Centre [Roy Welford is a Fellow](http://www.glastonburyhealthcentre.co.uk/comptherapy.html) of the Faculty of Homeopathy, and so promotes disproven therapies. The [Glastonbury practice](http://www.glastonburyhealthcentre.co.uk/comptherapy.html) also advertises acupuncture ( [disproven](http://dcscience.net/?p=945)), osteopathy and herbal medicine (largely untested so most of it consists of giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety). Making the best of herbal self-prescription in integrated practice: key remedies and principles. Simon Mills, Project Lead: Integrated Self Care in Family Practice, Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health, Devon Simon Mills is a herbalist who now [describes himself as a \"phytotherapist\"](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) (it sounds posher, but the evidence, or lack of it, is not changed by the fancy name). Mills likes to say things like \"there are herbs for heating and drying\", \"hot and cold\" remedies, and to use meaningless terms like [\"blood cleanser\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=16), but he appears to be immune to the need for good evidence that herbs work before you give them to sick people. [He says, at the end of a talk, ](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) \"The hot and the cold remain the trade secret of traditional medicine\". And this is the 21st Century. Practical ways in which complementary approaches can improve the treatment of cancer. Professor Jane Plant, Author of \"Your life in your hands\" and Chief Scientist, British Geological Society and Professor Karol Sikora, Medical Director, Cancer Partners UK Jane Plant is a geologist who, through her own unfortunate encounter with breast cancer, became obsessed with the idea that a dairy-free diet cured her. Sadly there is no good evidence for that idea, according to the [World Cancer Research Fund Report](http://dcscience.net/Marmot-Report.pdf), led by Professor Sir Michael Marmot. No doubt her book on the subject sells well, but it could be held that it is irresponsible to hold out false hopes to desperate people. She is a supporter of the very dubious [CancerActive](http://dcscience.net/?p=119) organisation (also supported by Michael Dixon OBE - [see above](#dixon)) as well as the notorious pill salesman, [Patrick Holford](http://holfordwatch.info/) (see also [here](#)). Karol Sikora, formerly an oncologist at the Hammersmith Hospital, is now [Dean of Medicine](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/medicine/) at the [University of Buckingham](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/) (the UK's only private university). He is also medical director at [CancerPartners UK](http://www.cancerpartnersuk.org/), a private cancer company. He recently shot to fame when he [appeared in a commercial](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/13/advertising-campaign-nhs-us-healthcare-reforms) in the USA sponsored by \"Conservatives for Patients' Rights\", to pour scorn on the NHS, and to act as an advocate for the USA's present health system. A very curious performance. Very curious indeed. His attitude to quackery is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. One was somewhat alarmed to see him sponsoring a course at what was, at first, called the British College of Integrated Medicine, and has now been renamed the [Faculty of Integrated Medicine](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/) That grand title makes it sound like part of a university. It isn't. The alarm was as result of the alliance with Dr Rosy Daniel (who promotes an [untested herbal conconction, Carctol](http://www.healthcreation.co.uk/node/20), for 'healing' cancer) and Dr Mark who has also [promoted the Qlink pendant](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-398105/Good-vibrations.html). The Qlink pendant is a simple [and obvious fraud](http://www.badscience.net/2007/05/the-amazing-qlink-science-pedant/) designed to exploit paranoia about WiFi killing you. The first list of speakers on the proposed diploma in Integrated Medicine was an unholy alliance of outright quacks and commercial interests. It turned out that, although Karol Sikora is sponsoring the course, he knew nothing about the speakers. I did and when I pointed this out to Terence Kealey, vice-chancellor of Buckingham, he immediately removed Rosy Daniel from directing the Diploma. At the moment the course is being revamped entirely by Andrew Miles. There is hope that he'll do a better job. It has not yet been validated by the University of Buckingham. Watch this space for developments. Stop press It is [reported in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college) that Professor Sikora has been describing his previous job at Imperial College with less than perfect accuracy.

Dr Hugh MacPherson, Senior Research Fellow in Health Sciences, York University and Dr Catherine Zollman, Bravewell Fellow [Hugh MacPherson](https://hsciweb.york.ac.uk/research/public/Staff.aspx?ID=926)'s main interest is in acupuncture and he publishes in alternative medicine journals. Since the recent analysis in the BMJ from the Nordic Cochrane Centre ( [Madsen et al., 2009](http://dcscience.net/?p=945)) it seems that acupuncture is finally dead. Even its placebo effect is too small to be useful.

Mike Cummings Chair, Medical Acupuncture Association - Manipulation for the treatment of back pain Simon Fielding, Founder Chairman of the General Osteopathic Council - Nigel Clarke, Senior Partner, Learned Lion Partners Homeopathy for long term conditions - Peter Fisher, Director, Royal Homeopathic Hospital Sadly it is not stated who the dragons are. One hopes they will be more interested in evidence than the supplicants. Mike Cummings at least doesn't believe the nonsense about meridians and Qi. It's a pity he doesn't look at the real evidence though. You can read something about him and his journal at [BMJ Group promotes acupuncture: pure greed](http://dcscience.net/?p=351). Osteopathy sounds a bit more respectable than the others, but in fact it has never shaken off its [cult-like origins.](http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/osteo.html) Still many osteopaths make absurd claims to cure all sorts of diseases. Offshoots of osteopathy like 'cranial osteopathy' are obvious nonsense. There is no reason to think that osteopathy is any better than any other manipulative therapy and it is clear that all manipulative therapies should be grouped into one. Osteopathy and chiropractic provide the best ever examples of the folly of giving official government recognition to a branch of alternative medicine before the evidence is in. Learned Lion Partners is a new one on me. It seems it is part of [Madsen Gornall Ashe Chambers ('MGA Chambers')](http://www.mgagroup.co.uk/AMWL/LL_fset.htm) \"a grouping of top level, independent specialists who provide a broad range of management consultancy advice to the marketing community\". It's a management consultant and marketing outfit. So don't expect too much when it comes to truth and evidence.

He is now a member of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence\" The [Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence](http://www.chre.org.uk/) is yet another quango that ticks boxes and fails absolutely to grasp the one important point, does it work?. I came across them [at the Westminster Forum](http://dcscience.net/?p=15#chre), and they seemed a pretty pathetic way to spend \u00a32m per year. Peter Fisher is the last supplicant to the Dragons. He is clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH), and Queen's homeopathic physician, It was through him that I got an active interest in quackery. The TV programme QED asked me to check the statistics in a paper of his that claimed that [homeopathy was good for fibrositis](http://dcscience.net/?p=201) (there was an elementary mistake and no evidence for an effect). Peter Fisher is also remarkable because he agreed with me that BSc degrees in homeopathy were not justified (on TV - [see the movie](http://dcscience.net/?p=19)). And [he condemned homeopaths](http://dcscience.net/?p=207) who were caught out recommending their sugar pills for malaria. To that extent Fisher represents the saner end of the homeopathic spectrum. Nevertheless he still maintains that sugar pills work and have effects of their own, and tries to [justify the 'memory of water'](http://dcscience.net/?p=282#hom) by making analogies with a memory stick or CD. This is so obviously silly that no more comment is needed. Given Fisher's sensible condemnation of the malaria fiasco, I was rather surprised to see that he appeared on the [programme of a conference](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/CAM/docs/CAMSTRAND%20programme%20Apr%2009%20final.pdf) at the University of Middlesex, talking about \"A Strategy To Research The Potential Of Homeopathy In Pandemic Flu\". The title of the conference was Developing Research Strategies in CAM. A colleague, after seeing the programme, thought it was more like \"a right tossers' ball\". Much of the homeopathy has now vanished from the RLHH as a result of greatly reduced commissioning by PCTs ( [read about it](http://www.zeusinfoservice.com/Health/Hospitalneedsyoursupport.html) in Fisher's own words). And the [last homeopathy degree in the UK has closed down](http://dcscience.net/?p=1329). It seems an odd moment for the FIH to be pushing it so hard.
