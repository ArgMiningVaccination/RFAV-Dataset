Advances in antibiotics decreased toxicity, and many complications, but usually have adverse drug reactions. Management of these diseases is not only important but their prevention is also of concern.| |Ayurved do believes in microorganisms and their role in disease, but emphasized more on body's response and occurrence of disease occurs only if the Bala is reduced.| |Susruta describes the communication through contacts; Charaka describes communication of disease via other factors like air, water, etc. Combating these diseases is to be done at various levels i.e. stopping the progression, building immunity against disease using various means and treating them.| |Details regarding the management including prophylactics are described in Ayurvedic texts that will be incorporated full disease; Contagious disease; Vaccine| |Introduction | |Communicable disease is amongst the important group of human diseases coming into contact. These diseases have specific etiological cause usually a microorganism. These microbial agents are usually specific in nature, lodge in particular tissues, and grow with the help of human biological system, finally precipitate as disease as a result of toxins (endotoxins or exotoxins). Development in investigative techniques increased knowledge of these infective organism, and also means for combating against them. Knowing behavior of these organisms it is easier to know the route of spreading and thus control measure of their communication can be made with ease. Ayurveda too described these agents, method of spread, methods of controlling and also curative measure of these diseases.| |Communicable disease are classified into two categories viz. 1 ) Contagious disease - spreading of these disease is usually by direct contact & the other group is 2 ) Infectious diseases - spreading of these is usually by physical, chemical and biological pathway including vector. Infectious diseases do not require direct contact of healthy person to diseased one, but patient may spread disease through many ways.| |It is important to stop the progression of disease at earliest possible stage [ |[3](#3)]. Prasnaga all forms contacts, Gatra Sansparsha direct contacts, eating together, sleeping together (including sexual contact), sharing and using of others cloths, ornaments, ointments, etc leads to diseases like Kustha, Jwara, Shosha, Netrabhishyanda (conjunctivitis), and in this manner the disease spread from person to person. This describes Aupsargic disease i.e. contagious disease or spread of disease through contacts. Charaka Samhita describes role of Vayu (air), Udak (Water), Desha (soil & area), Kala (Time) are the factors responsible for Janapadodhwansha - epidemics. Charka's description is more of the infectious disease, and narrates contamination of physical, chemical & biological factors in occurrence of disease [ [4](#4)]. [5](#5)]. [6](#6)]. Amalgamations of these three components are even described in Jwara by Achrya Charaka with specific role of debilitative strength of body [ [7](#7)]. Acharya Charaka scholarly describes in Jwara (Fever - the most common presenting clinical manifestation of any type of inflammatory process in body) that inflammatory process due to pathogen occurs only when body's defense mechanism is compromised or in other words, disease occurs only in immno-compromised subjects. [8](#8)] and for achieving these objective studies of a through knowledge of Hetu (etiological factors), Linga (clinical presentation) and Aaushadha (Drugs or medicines) [ [9](#9)] for healthy & diseased person for maintenance of health of healthy individual and treating the diseased person to obtain the status of Prakriti Satmya) stages of pathogenesis are referred as the stages of arresting the progression of disease [ [10](#10)] and hence are termed as the stage of treatment. These stages involve vitiating condition of Dosha, Dhatu and Malas. Out of those, first stages involves only Dhatus, followed by them is the stages where Dhatus & Malas and last stage is the stage of differentiation or complications. The first three stages is the time in which lodgment of infective agents, disturbing the status of Doshas. Environmental, diet, life style modifications, indulgence, etc leads to vitiation of the bodily elements. The third stage of pathogenesis is the stage of migration and circulation, which happens by the action of Vayu by the means of Rasa (blood circulation, lymphatics, interstitial fluid, etc) [ [11](#11)] these circulating Doshas settle in places of Lowered vitality [ [12](#12)- [14](#14)]. This means that, though the knowledge of infective knowledge is not poor to Ayurvedic scholars emphasized more on the status of Doshas or body's immune system in manifestation of infective diseases also. [15](#15)]. Ayurved provides three fold comprehensive management modalities for disease [ [16](#16)]. It is believed in Ayurved that infective agents producing bodily disease also effects psyche [ [17](#17), [18](#18)]. Thus even in Infective pathologies too three fold management of Ayurveda has definite role to play. Daivavyapaashrya and Satvavajaya the methods of psycho-spiritual healing practices help in correcting disturbed state of Psyche which in turn help in potentiating body's immune system. Yukti Vyapaashrya Chikitsa is the considered to be more important as certain specific measure against disease are carried out, including purifications, medications, surgical interventions etc. In Yukti Vyapaashrya Chikitsa Charaka describes unique three fold management for the disease esp. occurring due to any infections. Charaka describes in three different [ [19](#19)] modalities in management of Krimi (micro & macro organisms tend to produce disease) viz. 1) Apakarshana, 2) "}
