So, what can you do? Try simple, natural strategies to help keep your family healthy and strong. These tips can also help the body fight illness more efficiently. Eat the colors of the rainbow Fruits and vegetables get their color from naturally occurring vitamins and minerals. Eating a variety of different-colored whole foods (not artificially colored) helps increase consumption of important micronutrients, including beta carotene, lutein, lycopene, and vitamins, A, C and E. During peak cold seasons, it's especially important to avoid non-nourishing foods which can aggravate symptoms and make it harder for the immune system to respond to illness. \"Good nutrition is essential to a strong immune system, and it can offer seasonal protection from illnesses, as well as other health problems like allergies,\" says registered dietitian Joan Sechrist, PhD, Optima Health & Healthcare. Vaccinate Stay current on your child's immunizations. \"Immunizations in younger years can help prevent disease as kids grow into adults,\" Sechrist says. Visit CDC.gov to access the recommended vaccination schedule. Get adequate sleep Kids need 8-12 hours of sleep per night to maintain a strong body. Stick to a regular, calming evening routine and power down distracting electronics that can interrupt sleep. Exercise regularly Active kids are healthier kids! Experts recommend that kids get 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Take family walks or bike rides, shoot hoops, swim at your local community center, go roller skating, play hopscotch, or toss a ball in the backyard. Exercise can be fun and create bonds. Teach proper hand-washing Basic hand-washing with soap and water prevents the spread of disease. It's simple but should be practiced correctly. Have your child lather for 20 seconds or say the ABCs twice. Avoid overuse of sanitizers, which destroy both good and bad bacteria on the hands. Take probiotics \"Probiotics are fabulous in and of themselves for gut integrity,\" says naturopathic physician Shelly Clevidence. \"For increasing the immune system, they don't have to be live.\" Look for probiotics in pill form or in foods. If your child is sick, avoid dairy products, which contribute to inflammation and mucus build-up. Try castor oil Extruded from the castor bean plant, castor oil can be rubbed on your child's belly at night when the immune system is most active, says Leah Hollon, a naturopathic physician. Castor oil, she says, is both an anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory source. \"We find it helps bring more white blood cells into the bloodstream to help fight infection,\" Hollon says. \"It also helps get that histamine response down for some kids who have allergies, and it helps them have a good bowel movement.\" Constipation issues can be worse during flu and cold season. Consider elderberry syrup Both Clevidence and Hollon say elderberry syrup (also available in a tincture) can help kids fight a cold or flu. \"Elderberry syrup is one of my favorites,\" Hollon says. \"My kids love the taste of it. Probiotic elderberry syrup is antibacterial and antiviral; a general broad spectrum support.\" Elderberry has been used for centuries to treat wounds and respiratory illnesses, and is thought to reduce swelling in the mucous membranes and sinuses. *(Consult with your pediatrician before treating your youngster with elderberry.) Power up with omega-3s A study published in Journal of Leukocyte Biology suggests that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil and plant sources\u2014like flax seeds, chia seeds, Brussel sprouts and cauliflower\u2014could also help boost immune function. Most of all, model healthy living and your child is likely to follow suit\u2014naturally. BONUS: Integrate these vitamins & nutrients into your family's diet Protein boosts the body's defense system. Try lean meats, beans, nuts, eggs, soy products and seeds. Vitamin A helps keep the skin, respiratory system and tissues in your mouth, stomach and intestines healthy. Try sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, spinach and apricots. Vitamin C stimulates the formation of antibodies that fight infection. Try citrus fruits, red bell pepper, papaya and tomato juice. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals in the body. Try sunflower seeds, almonds, hazelnuts, peanut butter, sunflower/safflower oils and spinach. Zinc is a nutrient that helps wounds heal and keeps the immune system working properly. Try lean meats, poultry, seafood, milk, whole grain products, beans and nuts. "}
