The purpose of these visits is to: - Screen for medical issues - Assess your risk for future medical problems - Encourage a healthy lifestyle - Update vaccinations - Help you get to know your provider in case of an illness Information Even if you feel fine, you should still see your provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have [high blood pressure](./000468.htm) is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and [high cholesterol](./000403.htm) levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. A simple blood test can check for these conditions. There are specific times when you should see your provider or receive specific health screenings. The US Preventive Services Task Force publishes a list of recommended screenings. Below are screening guidelines for women age 65 and older. BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING Have your [blood pressure](./007490.htm) checked at least once every year. Watch for blood pressure screenings in your area. Ask your provider if you can stop in to have your blood pressure checked. You can also check your blood pressure using the automated machines at local grocery stores and pharmacies. Ask your doctor if you need your blood pressure checked more often if: - You have diabetes, [heart disease](./007115.htm), [kidney problems](./000471.htm), or are overweight or have certain other health conditions - You have a first-degree relative with high blood pressure - You are Black - Your blood pressure top number is from 120 to 129 mm Hg, or the bottom number is from 70 to 79 mm Hg BREAST CANCER SCREENING - Women may do a monthly breast self-exam. However, experts do not agree about the benefits of breast self-exams in finding [breast cancer](./000913.htm)or saving lives. Talk to your provider about what is best for you. - Your provider may do a clinical breast exam during your preventive exam. Experts do not agree on the benefit of a breast examination. - Women up to age 75 should have a [mammogram](./003380.htm)every 1 to 2 years, depending on their risk factors, to check for breast cancer. - Experts do not agree on the benefits of having a mammogram for women age 75 and older. Some do not recommend having mammograms after this age. Others recommend mammography for women in good health. Talk to your provider about what is best for you. CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING After age 65, most women who have not been diagnosed with cervical cancer or precancer can stop having screening tests, as long as: - They have had 3 consecutive negative Pap test results or 2 consecutive negative PAP and HPV tests results within 10 years - The most recent test occurred within 5 years CHOLESTEROL SCREENING If your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked at least every 5 years. You should have repeat testing sooner if: - Changes occur in your lifestyle (including weight gain and diet) - You have high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other health conditions COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING Until age 75, you should have [screening for colorectal cancer](./002071.htm) on a regular basis.

Your dentist will evaluate if you have a need for more frequent visits. DIABETES SCREENING You should be screened for [diabetes](./001214.htm) every 3 years. You may be tested more often If you have other risk factors for diabetes, such as: - A first degree relative with diabetes - You are overweight or have obesity, high blood pressure, prediabetes, or a history of heart disease EYE EXAM - Have an eye exam every 1 to 2 years.
