Walter President and CEO Steven L. Hooker ChairPresident & Chairman's Message Throughout our 60+ year history, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) has been committed to being innovative in all ways to find cures for blood cancers and improve the lives of patients and their families. Using social media is one such innovation. Its vast reach and immediacy provide a better way for people to connect and has changed the way we communicate in our daily lives. We saw its potential as a way to efficiently connect more directly with our patients, friends and supporters early on when we created the LLS blog and transferred our discussion boards to our own social network over two years ago. In the past year, we decided to more fully capitalize on this growing and effective communications venue. We realized that expanding our social media network would help us more fully engage all members of the LLS community while showcasing www.lls.org, our National website. People interact online - \"posting,\" \"tweeting,\" \"following,\" \"liking\" and \"chatting\" every day, and it made sense for us to do likewise. So we added new blogs, expanded our discussion boards, enhanced our webcast series and increased our presence on popular social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Y ouTube. We're proud to say that our efforts have paid off. As this year's Annual Report shows, our expanded social networking presence has made a difference in the key areas of Patient Services, Fundraising, Advocacy and Research. Visit our online community and you'll see cancer patients and survivors interacting on discussion boards, \"commenting\" on our Facebook Fan Pages, \"retweeting\" our Twitter posts, and blogging on a myriad of cancer-related topics. Social media lets us reach the LLS community faster and more efficiently than ever before. We are where you are. T ogether, we will continue to make progress in our fight against blood cancers. p1-13.indd 1 11/9/10 4:47 PM2 First Connection is an amazing resource. I remember last year feeling so lost and I received a call from someone who was about 52 when she got ALL. She's been cancer-free for over 12 years! I have her name and number tucked in my notebook and am so thankful for that phone call. Commenting on the LLS blog post, \"First Connection, Lasting Friendships\" Engaging the LLS Communities Melynn LLS Fan Page p1-13.indd 2 11/9/10 4:47 PM3 The Leukemia & Lymphoma SocietySocial media combines the vast reach of a massive audience with the intimacy of a personal conversation. Used extensively by our Home Office and chapters throughout the US and Canada to support the LLS community, it also provides efficient channels for our patients, fundraisers, researchers and supporters to correspond quickly and easily with each other. People with similar interests and issues can \"talk\" to each other whenever and wherever they like - whether it's galvanizing support nationwide to affect legislation, promoting a local LLS fundraiser, or discussing how to cope with treatment side effects - social media moves our mission forward. Fiscal year 2010 saw a 56% increase in the size of our social networking community, which now exceeds 1.7 million contacts. When you consider that each person, on average, is linked into several other online networks, you understand the potential of what can be accomplished by keeping our online community engaged. In addition to expanding our social media presence on the leading networks, we've enhanced our own social network (located at community.lls.org). The blogs we host there (The LLS Blog, @LLS Blog, and T eam In Training Blog) serve as the foundation for a communications program which reports on the latest research breakthroughs while it celebrates stories from our community. Just as important, social media gives everyone touched by cancer the opportunity to communicate, share and support one another, because we believe no one should have to fight this disease alone. The LLS Blog, The Blood Cancer Discussion Boards, our LLS Facebook Fan Page, and our chat series let patients interact candidly about what they're going through with others who are going, or have been, through the same experience themselves. They can ask questions about specific treatments, inspire others with words of encouragement, offer support, and share the joys as well as the \"bumps\" on the road to recovery. Our updated Blood Cancer Discussion Boards make it easier for participants to read and post messages on a wide range of issues. Several discussion threads offer peer-to-peer forums on topics such as \"Waiting for a Diagnosis,\" \"My Child Has Cancer,\" and \"Living With...\" discussions of specific blood cancers. In addition, participants can now personalize their LLS Community homepage (community.lls.org) We have expanded our social media presence to let LLS patients and their caregivers more readily connect with our many patient support resources. The Word from our Patient Services Community to display the discussions they prefer, create their own blog and tag content so that others can more readily find pertinent topics. We now have nearly 2,500 online blood cancer discussions, with more thn a 7,000 active participants helping hundreds of patients and their families get the support they need, because even a few words of encouragement can mean so much to those battling cancer. p1-13.indd 3 11/9/10 4:47 PM4What better way to spread the word about our hundreds of fundraising activities than by going directly where most of our donors can be found - ONLINE! social media network. In fact, the success of the Gap Promotion provided our first insight into the power of fully engaging our social networking communities. Since the promotion ran for a very limited time, we had to spread the word as quickly and extensively as possible. The Gap Promotion was featured on the @LLS blog and highlighted through > Gap Give and Get Promotion LLS was included in three Gap Give and Get Promotions in fiscal year 2010. For 4 days in August and November 2009, and March 2010, we were given a 30% discount coupon from Gap, with 5% of the sales from each customer using the coupon going to LLS. Each Gap Promotion featured a patient story and was promoted aggressively through our The Talk from our Fundraising Community Christen @LLS Blog With every support group meeting, with every fundraising event - I'm reminded how powerful my story is and what a source of hope and inspiration it can provide to others. People thank me all the time for sharing my story because I remind them that 'Cancer Survivors Have Miracles T oo.' The more I give back, the more I'm aware of the importance of doing so - just like Gap! Commenting on the importance of the Gap Give and Get Promotion to Benefit The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society p1-13.indd 4 11/9/10 4:47 PM5 The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Darelyne TNT Blog I just read your blog. I am so sorry for your loss. I also lost my mom to non-Hodgkin lymphoma 9 years ago. And I am doing the L.A. Rock 'n' Roll half marathon in her honor. Commenting on a Team Nancy post our social networks - our Fan Pages on Facebook, our profiles on MySpace, and among our LinkedIn Groups on both the national and local level. In fiscal 2010, our intensive online efforts for the Gap Promotion proved successful and helped generate $1.6 million in donations across the US and Canada. T o date, thanks to the focused fundraising efforts of our friends and donors, LLS has received $2.2 million from the Gap Promotion since our initial involvement in 2009, illustrating the tremendous power of our online community.> T eam Nancy Tam Driscoll of Portland, OR had raised funds for LLS's Team In Training (TNT) for several years. Then, her sister Nancy was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor linked to lymphoma and succumbed to the disease in 2009 after a brave six-year battle. \"I realized something wonderful about the power of TNT and LLS. I could see that our actions were helping people survive cancer and would someday lead to a cure. I also realized that alone you can race, but together you can really make a difference.\" Tam persuaded her five other sisters, who live in North Carolina and Virginia, to run with her in the Nike Women's Marathon to Benefit The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in San Francisco and raise $40,000 to honor their beloved sister's memory. And so Team Nancy was born.T o enhance their fundraising efforts, Tam and her sisters created a TNT Team Nancy eFundraising page where people could make donations online and offer words of encouragement. The sisters also spread the word through their own social media connections, as did other family members and friends. Their social networking efforts paid off and Team Nancy is well on its way to reaching its fundraising goal. p1-13.indd 5 11/24/10 1:38 PM6 Amanda LLS Fan Page Congrats! I'm so proud... to be associated with the Iowa Chapter :). I've been a volunteer with TNT Iowa since 2003 and continue to do events with TNT & LTN (Team Dennis). The mission of LLS hits close to home. The Iowa Chapter has been a force for good for families throughout the state. Commenting on the Victory in Iowa post on the LLS Facebook Fan Page We have used the power of social media to support several state campaigns and coalition-based efforts to pass legislation that will benefit our patients and their families. in trials, as many insurers consider these studies to be \"experimental\" and therefore won't extend coverage. This uncertainty prevents many cancer patients from participating in trials that could aid in their recovery, and makes it difficult for researchers to conduct the studies that might lead to new breakthroughs in cancer cures.> Victory in Iowa One such legislation requires health insurance plans to provide routine care coverage (doctor visits, hospital stays, x-rays and lab tests) for cancer patients participating in clinical trials. Clinical trials are a critical in the development of new cancer treatments. However, less than 5 percent of adult cancer patients participate The Dialogue from our Advocacy Community p1-13.indd 6 11/9/10 4:47 PMstep 7 The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society George LLS Fan PageIt amazes me... the possibility of cutting these funds was seriously considered. Cutting funding for cancer research & education is unfathomable. Everyone on this site has been personally affected by cancer (self-family-friend). Let's join together & wrestle this beast to improve survivorship & cure possibilities. Thanks. Post about \"Advocacy Network win the Fight to Retain Blood Cancer Education Program\" The LLS Iowa chapter sprung into action when a bill was proposed requiring insurance companies to extend routine medical coverage to patients in clinical trials (House File 2075). Using various social media outlets, the chapter got the word out to patients, family members and volunteers to e-mail their state representatives, urging them to support the bill. We're happy to report that our efforts worked. House File 2075 was passed unanimously in both the Iowa House and Senate and in February 2010, Governor Chet Culver signed the bill into law. Several volunteers from the Iowa chapter, including cancer survivors Lorna Johns and Dave Hubler, were on-hand to witness the Governor's signature. As Dave said at the ceremony: \"I am here today because of clinical trials, after other methods had failed.\" People were able to follow this historic day online in real time through updates, photos and video posted on the @LLS Blog, as well as LLS posts on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Flickr. Currently, 32 states and the District of Columbia have signed similar bills into law. p1-13.indd 7 11/9/10 4:47 PM8 Marilyn LLS Fan Page Congratulations Dr. Kwak... for your good work. Research is key - and always looking for better and newer treatments. Look forward to seeing the article and will look for it. Commenting on the LLS blog post, \"LLS-Funded Researcher is on Time Magazine's List of 100 Most Influential People\" Dr. Kwak was honored for his work in developing \"personalized\" anti-lymphoma vaccines. He and his research team recently received a five-year, $6.25 million grant from LLS to extend the promise of anti-cancer vaccines to leukemia and myeloma as well lymphoma patients. as Social media is also a great way to share the success of our researchers. For example, when LLS-funded researcher Dr. Larry Kwak was named one of the World's 100 Most Influential People by Time Magazine , we celebrated the occasion by issuing a blog post and sharing it with the LLS Community. We were also proud to spread the word when Dr. Brian Druker received the prestigious 2009 Lasker- DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award for his ground-breaking work with the drug Gleevec\u00ae, which greatly improves the survival rate for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). LLS has funded Dr. Drucker's work since 1995. Gleevec was approved by the FDA in 2001.We use social media to convey the latest news on LLS-funded research, clinical trials, and other breakthroughs in the treatment of blood cancers.Advances In Research p1-13.indd 8 11/9/10 4:47 PM9 The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society> Informational Support Nearly 78,000 inquiries were handled by Masters-level Information Specialists, helping patients navigate the various treatments, clinical trial options and support services. Over 5,060 clinical trial searches were conducted using Trial Check, a tool that lists available clinical trials by specific blood cancer. Trial Check was created in partnership with the Coalition of Cancer Cooperative Groups. > Financial Support More than $1 million 4 was awarded through the LLS Co-Pay Assistance Program to help patients with prescription drug co-pays and insurance premium obligations. > Educational Support Over 438,000 patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals attended LLS national telephone/web blood cancer education programs, and nearly 55,000 participants attended community- based LLS chapter blood cancer education programs.In addition, about 2,600 school personnel, healthcare professionals and parents attended the LLS program Welcome Back: Facilitating the School Experience for Childhood Cancer Survivors. > Community Support LLS chapters offered 531 family support groups across the US and Canada. Chapter staff and volunteers strengthened their existing relationships and established new ones with more than 636 community-based organizations serving Latino/Hispanic, African-American, rural, and other underrepresented cancer patients. In all, 32,833 cancer patients and caregivers participated in 479 activities and programs, made possible by the outreach and collaborative efforts of LLS chapters to underrepresented groups across the US and Canada. In addition, we're proud to report that 5,376 First Connection matches were made between patients, their family members and trained peer volunteers.Patient Information and Services On the following pages are examples of the progress we made in 2010 in our mission to cure blood cancers and improve the quality of life of patients and their families.Fiscal Year Highlights 2010 \" YAconnect (www.lls.org/yaconnect) is...a great service for young adults navigating the whole 'cancer thing'. So nice to see that our age group isn't forgotten. I know that I will rely on some of the resources provided...as I make the transition from full-time graduate student to jobseeker.\" YAconnect webcast participant> New Programs We launched YAconnect - Straight Talk for Y oung Adults Facing Cancer, a series of programs to help young adults age 18 to 39 deal with \"the serious and sometimes absurd\" sides of cancer. Weekly moderated online chats were designed for small groups to maximize information sharing among participants. LLS launched Navigating Employment and Insurance , the first of three YAconnect Web casts, featuring an interactive panel of professionals and young adult cancer survivors. p1-13.indd 9 11/9/10 4:47 PM10 > Grants & Awards LLS continues to support the development of breakthrough cancer therapies, committing substantial funding to researchers throughout the world. This fiscal year, we reviewed 521 grant applications and granted 99 new awards, including 66 for Career Development and 31 for Translational Research. Two grants were also given through our Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) initiative, which has provided over $210 million in grants since its inception in 2000. Both recipients have long-time connections to LLS. John C. Byrd, M.D who first received a grant from LLS in 2001, is targeting molecular processes that allow cancers to evolve and survive today's standard therapies. Our second recipient, Brian J. Druker, M.D. first received LLS funding in 1995 that was instrumental in the development of Gleevec as a frontline treatment for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The Druker team continues to develop new targeted therapies, diagnostic tests that can identify which new drug might work best for each patient, and novel clinical trial designs that allow individual patients to receive therapies that best match their disease. > Biotech Alliance Partnerships LLS partners directly with biotechnology companies to shorten the timeline for identifying potential new cancer therapies and advance them through the FDA drug approval process. This fiscal year, we forged four new biotech company alliances: Avila > LLS is providing up to $3.2 million for the clinical development of AVL-292 to treat adults with B-cell cancers. The drug entered a clinical trial in September 2010. FORMA Therapeutics > LLS is partnering with FORMA to develop small molecule compounds to inhibit Bcl-6, a key lymphoma drug target. Approximately 85 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphomas originate from B cells. ResearchFiscal Year Highlights 2010 John C. Byrd, M.D. Brian J.

Shape Pharmaceuticals > LLS is providing up to $3.3 million for the clinical development of SHP-141, a first-in-class histone lymphoma (CTCL).> Progress in Clinical Trials LLS continues to make progress in existing programs with our biotech alliance partners. Celator Pharmaceuticals reported promising results in their phase 2 clinical trial of CPX-351 for older patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), with an impressive 68 percent of patients achieving complete response. Our alliance partner, Memgen, reported complete response and durable remission for a third patient in their phase 1 clinical s of trial of ISF35 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have also helped advance the drug Ciclopirox Olamine into a phase 1 clinical trial to further its development in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Clinical Trials p1-13.indd 11 11/9/10 4:47 PM12> T eam In Training\u00ae We are proud to announce that Team In Training (TNT) has reached an amazing milestone, raising $1 billion through national and local sports events since its inception in 1988. TNT formalized it''\"s longstanding partnership with Competitor Group Inc. (CGI), organizers of the Rock 'n' Roll Series events. TNT was designated as the exclusive charity of the renamed Rock 'n' Roll San Diego Marathon & 1/2 Marathon to Benefit The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society . The half marathon was added to encourage even more participants in this premier fundraising event. TNT has taken part in the San Diego Marathon since its inception in 1998. This year, we brought over 4,000 participants who raised nearly $12 million to help find cures for blood cancers. In addition, our goal this year has been to re-engage TNT alumni as higher level volunteers, assisting them in identifying and securing corporate teams to participate with TNT at the national or local level. We also encouraged alumni to serve as fundraising coaches to help TNT participants - especially first-timers - succeed in their fundraising efforts and physical training. This proactive approach to alumni re-engagement has not only introduced new individual, group and corporate sponsors to the program, but has also helped increase overall retention. Fiscal Year Highlights 2010 Fundraising> Man & Woman of the Year www.mwoy.org This spirited campaign brings together an incredible group of dynamic community leaders with the single goal of raising as much money as possible in 10 weeks to benefit LLS's mission. This year, the campaign grew to new heights, with 650 honored candidates participating in 58 campaigns around the country - including 9 new campaigns. All candidates who confirmed their participation by February 12th were formally thanked in a full-page USA Today advertisement. As part of our fundraising strategy, we emphasized that candidates actively engage their campaign teams through all elements of their fundraising plan. Our 2010 National Man & Woman of the Y ear are a testament to this strategy. Man of the Year Bob Mills and Woman of the Year Janice Bender had their campaign teams send out letters to potential donors, make personal donation requests, plan events and much more. While Bob and Janice come from different states and professional backgrounds, they both proved the power of teamwork. T ogether, their campaign teams raised over $500,000. In fact, of the 650 participating candidates, 51 raised enough funds to qualify for the research naming rights incentive. > School & Y outh\u00ae Programs www.schoolandyouth.org Nearly a quarter of the nation's schools participated in LLS School & Y outh Programs, where students learn the value of working together to raise funds, increase awareness, and make a difference in the fight against cancer. This year, a successful strategy was the distribution of colorful collection boxes for students to take home and collect spare change - a visible reminder for family members to join in the effort and the fun. p1-13.indd 12 11/9/10 4:47 PMwww. .org teamintraining13 Society> Light The Night\u00ae Walk www.lightthenight.org Our annual Light The Night Walk raised nearly $39 million in donations, attracting more than 250,000 participants in 218 communities across the US and Canada. We continued to focus on recruiting more businesses to participate in the program.Walking side by side with our family and friends teams in 2009, more than 82 National Partners raised $6.8 million for LLS research and patient services programs. Setting the standard, once again, was Burlington Coat Factory, our top corporate partner in the Light The Night Walk. This year, they set another milestone by raising more than $2 million for LLS, breaking their previous $1 million mark established in 2007. Burlington Coat Factory has raised over $7 million since our partnership began in 2002.> Legacy & T argeted Giving This year, we received more than $ million 7 in legacy gifts from individuals. Several new members were added to The Legacy Circle by naming LLS as a beneficiary in their will, trust, life insurance policy, or retirement plan. These generous individuals have graciously given us permission to list their names so that their gifts can inspire others to do the same. In addition, we received several Targeted Giving contributions, which will provide much needed support for LLS research and patient programs. For example, when California entrepreneur Steve Kirsch was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer known as Waldentrm's macroglobulinemia (WM), so he turned to LLS to help find new treatments for this disease. Mr. Kirsch and an anonymous donor joined LLS and the International Waldenstr\u00f6m's Macroglobulinemia Foundation (IWMF) to fund four research grants to develop WM cell lines, a critical link in discovering new and more effective treatments for this currently incurable disease. The family of Mina Yanney, a 41-year old Pennsylvania investment analyst who died of lymphoma in 2004, had a different idea for their targeted donation. Mina had a strong family network to drive him to treatments at a downtown Philadelphia cancer center. Sadly, many other patients did not and had to drive themselves. In Mina's honor, his family provided funds to help local cancer patients secure round-trip transportation for their treatments. The LLS Advocates Network (www.lls.org/advocacy) grew significantly this fiscal year and now numbers nearly 50,000 volunteers. We are working to segment our volunteers for more targeted participation and effective communications. LLS joined forces with other patient advocacy groups to ensure that national health care reform includes insurance coverage of routine care costs (doctor visits, hospital stays, x-rays, and lab tests) for patients enrolled in clinical trials. This provision provides a coverage \"floor\" for state-based insurers, pre-empting state plans that provide fewer patient protections, but also allowing the states to exceed this minimum coverage. As this provision will impact every type of insurance, state-based legislation is more critical than ever for providing the best patient protections possible. Advocacy LLS volunteer advocates in our Florida, Iowa, and South Carolina chapters led coalition efforts to pass state laws ensuring full coverage of routine medical care for cancer patients participating in potentially life-saving clinical trials. This coverage is now required by 32 states and the District of Columbia. We are also advocating on the state level for laws that provide patients greater access to oral cancer treatments by requiring insurance companies to provide coverage for oral chemotherapy equal to what is covered for intravenous (IV) treatments. p1-13.indd 13 11/9/10 4:47 PM14 14The Marshall A. Lichtman Specialized Center of Research The Specialized Center for Research Program funds multi-disciplinary research by teams of leading-edge academic investigators that hastens the discovery and development of better treatments for leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma patients.

(LLS) as of June 30, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of LLS's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. The prior year summarized comparative information has been derived from LLS's 2009 consolidated financial statements and, in our report dated September 15, 2009, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of LLS's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. as of June 30, 2010, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies Organization The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. (LLS) is an international not-for-profit health agency dedicated to seeking the cause and cure of leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and myeloma and improving the quality of life of patients and their families. LLS's principal activities include: awarding research grants; facilitating psychosocial support groups; providing financial aid to patients; answering phone requests for blood cancer information made to LLS's Information Resource Center; and disseminating educational information about blood cancers in the form of publications, internet sites, conference calls, and symposia sponsorship for both the medical community and the general public. T ax-Exempt Status LLS qualifies as a charitable organization as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and, accordingly, is exempt from federal income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a). Additionally, since LLS is publicly-supported, contributions to LLS qualify for the maximum charitable contribution deduction under the Internal Revenue Code.The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, Inc. (LLSC) is registered as a charitable organization under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and, is therefore, not subject to income taxes if certain disbursement requirements are met. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LLS, which encompasses the Home Office of LLS and its fifty-five chapters in the United States, LLSC, and LLS's not-for-profit affiliates, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Programs, Inc. and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Foundation. All significant intercompany and intra-LLS accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires LLS's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include the fair value of alternative investments, the allowance for uncollectible accounts, and the allocation of expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Risks and Uncertainties LLS invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the statement of financial position. Summarized Financial Information The consolidated financial statements are presented with 2009 summarized or comparative information. With respect to the consolidated statement of activities, such prior year information is not presented by net asset class and, in the consolidated statement of functional expenses, 2009 expenses by object are presented in total rather than by functional category. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with LLS's 2009 consolidated financial statements from which the summarized information was derived. Subsequent Events LLS evaluated subsequent events after the statement of financial position date of June 30, 2010 through September 15, 2010, which was the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, and concluded that no additional disclosures are required. Net Asset Classifications T o ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to LLS, funds that have similar characteristics have been classified into three net asset categories as follows: Unrestricted net assets: Consist of funds that are fully available, at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors, for LLS to utilize in any of its programs or supporting services.Temporarily restricted net assets: Consist of funds that are restricted by donors for a specific time period or purpose.Permanently restricted net assets: Consist of funds that contain donor-imposed restrictions requiring that the principal be invested in perpetuity and that only the income be used. Income earned on these funds may be unrestricted or temporarily restricted, depending upon the donor-imposed restrictions. Foreign Currency Translation LLSC uses the Canadian dollar as its functional currency. Accordingly, the currency impact of the translation of the financial statements of LLSC to U.S. dollars is included as a translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of activities. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. LLS follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) (ASC 820), for certain alternative investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, including hedge funds, limited partnerships, and other funds. This guidance allows, as a practical expedient, for the estimation of the fair value of investments in investment companies for which the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value, using net asset value per share or its equivalent, as reported by the investment managers.Most investments classified in Levels 2 and 3 consist of shares or units in investment funds as opposed to direct interests in the funds' underlying holdings, which may be marketable. Because the net asset value reported by each fund is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value of LLS's interest therein, its classification in Level 2 or 3 is based on LLS's ability to redeem its interest at or near June 30. If the interest can be redeemed in the near term, the investment is classified as Level 2. The classification of investments in the fair value hierarchy is not necessarily an indication of the risks, liquidity, or degree of difficulty in estimating the fair value of each investment's underlying assets and liabilities. Contributions and Deferred Revenue Contributions are recorded as revenue, at their fair value, when received or promised unconditionally. Contributions received with donor restrictions that limit their use are reported as either temporarily or permanently restricted revenue. When a donor restriction is met through the passage of time or fulfillment of a purpose restriction, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the consolidated statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Conditional contributions are recognized as revenue when the conditions have been substantially met.Deferred revenue includes amounts received for special events that will be held subsequent to the fiscal year-end. Donated Services LLS has determined that certain of the donated services it receives meet the criteria for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the donated services of family support group facilitators and research grant reviewers in the amount of $6,819,000 in 2010 and $6,829,000 in 2009 have been valued and are reported as both revenue and expense. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase, except for amounts held for long-term purposes reported as investments. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. > June 30, 2010 (with comparative amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2009)33 The Leukemia & Lymphoma SocietyInvestments Investments are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices, except for the fair values of funds of hedge funds and limited partnerships, which are based on net asset values provided by the fund managers and general partners, respectively, based upon the underlying net assets of the funds consistent with the concepts of ASC 820. These values are reviewed and evaluated by management. Fixed Assets and Depreciation Fixed assets, which consist principally of equipment, software, and leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost, if purchased, or at fair value at date of donation, if contributed, and are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the leases, if shorter. Recent Accounting Standards In 2010, LLS adopted ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. LLS evaluated the impact of adopting the accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC 740 for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements, which prescribes a threshold of more-likely-than-not for recognition and de-recognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. There was no significant impact to LLS's consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of ASC 740. 2. Legacies and Contributions Receivable LLS's legacies and contributions receivable at June 30, 2010 and 2009 consist of unconditional promises to give and legacies for which the underlying wills have been declared valid by the probate court and no other conditions are required to be met. Amounts are scheduled to be received as follows (in thousands): 2010 2009 Less than one year $ 16,675 $ 21,154 1 to 5 years 3,157 2,334 After 5 years 232 208 Subtotal 20,064 23,696 Less allowance for uncollectible accounts (1,164) (749) Less discount to present value (5%) (483) (195) T otal $ 18,417 $ 22,752 Approximately, 54% and 60% of LLS's legacies and contributions receivable are from one estate at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 3. Investments The following table presents LLS's fair value hierarchy of investments measured at fair value on an annual basis as of June 30, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands). 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Money market funds and cash $ 537 $ 537 $ - $ - Fixed income: Long duration fixed income 53,153 53,153 - - Low duration fixed income 41,787 41,787 - - Other 3,498 - 3,498 - Equities: Large cap equity 14,149 14,149 - - International equity 5,572 5,572 - - Small cap equity 3,521 3,283 238 - Real return 8,175 8,175 - - Small/mid cap equity 641 - 641 - Alternative investments: Funds of hedge funds 35,004 - 19,462 15,542 Limited partnership equity indices 11,452 - 450 $ 177,489 $ 126,656 $ 34,841 $ 15,992 2009 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Money market funds and cash $ 1,514 $ 1,514 $ - $ - Fixed income: Long duration fixed income 64,162 64,162 - - Low duration fixed income 49,216 49,216 - - Other 3,490 3,490 - - Equities: Large cap equity 9,817 9,817 - - All cap equity 1,932 1,932 - - International equity 5,772 5,772 - - Small cap equity 6,394 6,394 - - Small/mid cap equity 1,023 1,023 - - Alternative investments: Funds of hedge funds 4,148 2,000 - 2,148 Limited partnership equity indices 14,155 - - 14,155 $ 161,623 $ 145,320 $ - $ 16,303 Investment expenses of $580,000 and $568,000 have been netted against interest and dividend income for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The unrealized gains and losses were $10,344,000 and $(5,923,000) for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. LLS invests in certain alternative investments, through \"funds of hedge funds\" investments, which invest in multiple strategies through a portfolio of hedge fund managers to provide diversification and reduce manager risk. These strategies create indirect exposure to LLS through short sales of securities, trading in future and forward contracts, and other derivative products. Derivatives are investment contracts used to hedge risk. While these financial instruments may contain varying degrees of risk, LLS's risk with respect to such transactions is limited to its capital balance in each investment.The underlying holdings of the limited partnership equity indices are principally domestic and international marketable securities.LLS's alternative investments contain various redemption restrictions with required written notice ranging from 70 to 90 days. As of June 30, 2010, the following table summarizes the composition of such investments at fair value by the various redemption provisions (in thousands): Redemption Period Amount Monthly $ 13,003 Quarterly 17,461 1 year lock-up 15,992 T otal $ 46,456 As of June 30, 2010 and 2009, LLS has no unfunded commitments on its alternative investments.The following table presents a reconciliation for all Level 3 assets measured at fair value as of June 30, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands).

Awards and Grants Awards and grants for research are recognized as expense in the year approved by LLS's Board of Directors. Multi-year grants, which are generally two to five years in length, are approved on an annual basis and may be terminated at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors. In addition to unconditional grants payable of $80,580,000 at June 30, 2010, LLS has grant commitments of $67,433,000 that are conditioned upon future events and, accordingly, are not recorded. 5. Co-Pay Assistance Program The Co-Pay Assistance program offers assistance to patients in meeting their insurance co-pay obligations for prescription medications or private/public health insurance premiums. Amounts awarded under the program are expensed in the year approved based on the available funding in the program. Approximately $4,374,000 and $7,448,000 were included in the grants payable balances for amounts awarded but unpaid at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 6. Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP) TAP is LLS's strategic initiative to speed the development of blood-cancer treatments and supportive diagnostics by creating business alliances with biotech-nology and pharmaceutical companies. TAP provides funding for investigational new drug-enabling studies and clinical-stage projects. TAP contracts are recognized as an expense in the year program milestones are achieved. Multi-year contracts, which are generally two to three years in length, are reviewed against milestones on a quarterly basis and may be terminated at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors. LLS has contract commitments of $22,230,000 at June 30, 2010 that are conditioned upon future events and, accordingly, are not recorded. 7. Pension Plan LLS has a defined contribution 403(b) pension plan covering all employees meeting age and service requirements. Contributions are based on a percentage of each eligible employee's salary and years of service. Expense under this plan aggregated $4,072,000 and $4,105,000 for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. LLS has a 457(b) deferred compensation plan (the 457 Plan), for its executive staff. The 457 Plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code Section 457. Expenses under the 457 Plan approximated $120,000 and $170,000 for the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The assets and liabilities of the 457 Plan are included in investments and accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position and amounted to approximately $546,000 and $437,000 at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 8. Lease Commitments The leases for premises, which LLS's Home Office and chapters occupy, expire on various dates through May 31, 2018 and provide for certain payments subject to escalation and periodic rate increases relating to real estate taxes, operating expenses, and utilities. The Home Office lease expires in March 2016.The approximate minimum aggregate future annual rental commitments are summarized as follows (in thousands): Y ear ending June 30: 2011 $ 7,502 2012 6,814 2013 5,139 T otal $ 30,549 9. T emporarily and Permanently Restricted Net Assets Temporarily restricted net assets and the income earned on permanently restricted net assets are available for the following purposes at June 30, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands): 2010 2009 Temporarily Permanently Temporarily Permanently Restricted Restricted Restricted Restricted Time restrictions $ 12,344 $ - $ 16,566 $ - Research 3,983 3,123 2,241 2,917 Patient service 4,180 516 4,658 420 Other 161 49 131 163 T otal $ 20,668 $ 3,688 $ 23,596 $ 3,500 LLS follows the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act (UMIFA). LLS has interpreted UMIFA as requiring the preservation of the original gift of the donor-restricted endowment fund absent donor stipulations to the contrary. In September 2010, New Y ork State adopted the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act. In 2011, LLS will be required to adopt the net asset classification requirements of ASC 958-205, Endowments of Not-for-Profit Organizations: Net Asset Classification of Funds Subject to an Enacted Version of the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, and Enhanced Disclosures for All Endowment Funds. The following table presents changes in the donor-restricted endowment funds for the year ended June 30, 2010 (in thousands).

Under this policy, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results consistent with LLS's overall investment strategy. 10. Joint Costs Allocation For the years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, LLS incurred joint costs for informational materials and activities that included fund raising appeals as follows (in thousands): 2010 2009 Fund raising $ 12,114 $ 12,834 Patient and community service 1,049 1,013 Public health education 10,537 10,188 T otal $ 23,700 $ 24,035 Continued The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. > June 30, 2010 (with comparative amounts as of and for the year ended June 30, 2009)35 The Leukemia & Lymphoma SocietyChairman of the Board Steven L.
