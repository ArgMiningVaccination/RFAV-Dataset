Many ancient cultures around the world held the belief that all materials- plant matter, rocks, and water, for example- had essences, or special properties that made them suitable for creating certain desired outcomes when used in specific ways (in many cases, people believed that these materials even had wills of their own). Crystals, for instance, have specific arrangements of minerals within them that practitioners believe make them useful for channeling certain frequencies energy. And ancient medical traditions, including Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine, have long held that all plants have a life force- and in the cases of specific plants, that their life forces have a specific character. This has been the basis for their use in magical rituals around the world. Let's take a closer look at some of these stones and herbs. [(Tea lovers: Check out these crystal tea infusers.
