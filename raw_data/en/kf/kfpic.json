First as an acupuncturist, and as an energy healer since 2015. I often tell people I have the best job in the world. Although I love doing acupuncture, energy healing is the job I was born to do. It fits me perfectly, and is deeply satisfying. It started when a patient with advanced brain cancer asked me to help her. We both knew acupuncture would not work in her situation, so I agreed to try energy healing. I didn't know where to start, so I simply opened myself to Higher intelligence. I was shocked that I was immediately able to see into her body and knew what to do. The work created changes that greatly enhanced her chemotherapy. We did twice weekly sessions and within 6 months she had made a remarkable recovery and remains healthy to this day. Although these were great results I felt uncertain about my approaches and knew I had to get some real training. Several months later I found The McKay Method\u00ae energy healing school and started training with one of the finest healers in America, I came out of that training confident in my skills and ability to successfully treat numerous diseases, and that proved to be absolutely true. I have worked with clients with issues ranging from acute issues to chronic, debilitating or life-threatening conditions. Examples include infections, musculoskeletal injuries, migraines, gastrointestinal issues, asthma, Covid (both acute and long-haul cases), emotional trauma, and various pain syndromes. One of the cases I am most proud of was a man in China, the son of a patient. He was deathly ill with pneumonia, unconscious and alone in his apartment. His mother texted me and begged me to help. I was able to halt the pneumonia and bring him out of a state of near-sepsis. He woke a few hours later, contacted his mother and made a complete recovery. As I worked with healing energy it became more and more obvious that the energy itself was intelligent and came from deeper levels. I really wanted to explore that and soon found the work of In a way I had come full circle. My first foray into energy healing had been based on opening myself to the Divine. Now I was able to consciously and consistently do that, with far more experience and a much wider range of abilities. Which brings me to the present... I offer real energy healing, with real results. It's not \"New Age\", vague or airy-fairy. It works. You can expect to see positive changes within the first session. Physical pains, even intense migraines are relieved by 60-80%. The pressure of emotional trauma is reduced, leading to greater freedom in your life. Breathing, digestion and endocrine functions will be improved if those are issues. Sleep and overall well-being are also enhanced. Energy healing does take time. You can expect to do at least 3 sessions with me, and certainly more for complex situations. I offer both in-person and distance sessions. More than half of the work I do is at distance, I have clients all across North America. Distance work is highly effective, many of my local patients prefer distance work over in-person sessions. The cost for either type of session is $220. I have helped many people recover from serious, even life-threatening diseases and emotional traumas. I can help you too. Call my office at 970-223-4422 to set up your initial appointment.

Several months later I found The McKay Method\u00ae energy healing school and started training with one of the finest healers in America, [Bear McKay](https://www.bearmckay.com/). Bear teaches repeatable, verifiable methods of sensing into the body and energetic structures, and approaches for dealing with every organ and system of the body. In my class we learned both hands-on and distance healing, worked with a wide variety of clients, and were held to a high standard of results.

I really wanted to explore that and soon found the work of [Kiran Trace](https://kirantrace.com/). Kiran trained me how to access Source directly and bring that energy into healing sessions. That has been a game-changer, enabling greatly increased depth of healing. In a way I had come full circle. My first foray into energy healing had been based on opening myself to the Divine.

Initially, I came to him for treatment with my respiratory issues, but I quickly saw that unlike many other medical professionals I'd met with, Scott cared about the \"whole\" me (i.e. the rest of me besides my respiratory system). This included some joint issues I had from athletic injuries, my emotional health, and my spiritual health. In my first appointment, I felt like Scott took the time to get to know me as a human being and not just a medical condition (which is such a rare thing!). Through the course of our appointments, he has continued to practice this holistic experience, ministering to my body, soul, and spirit. And while I have seen huge health gains in my physical systems (my respiratory system is doing phenomenally well), these advances seem almost secondary to the beautiful work occurring in my soul during our sessions together. I am blown away by the insights Scott has been able to speak into my emotional and spiritual journeys. He's confirmed, affirmed and strengthened the work that I've been doing in these personal/often lonely places of my life. In the midst of his perception, he is also incredibly respectful of my boundaries, abilities, and personal beliefs. I always feel completely safe with Scott. I look forward to our continued journey together in this holistic health quest. I would absolutely recommend Scott's treatments to anyone wanting to have their whole being treated.\"-K.B.

My illness resulted in a whole host of health problems that doctors dismissed and left untreated, which led me to reach out to Scott for alternative options, including energy work. At the time, I had no idea that I was suffering from long-haul Covid symptoms. The illness left me with debilitating symptoms, fatigue being one of the worst among them. Through his energy work he guided me through my health issues via in-person, as well as distance sessions. Not only have I been able to overcome health issues that I once feared could be permanent, but working with Scott and under-going his treatments helped me to gain my life back. If it were not for this work, I am confident that I would not be as far along in my recovery as I am currently. With his expertise, he has been able to help me piece together a more comprehensive and holistic approach to gaining my health back. His practice addresses the root of the issue, and has provided me with the ability to take control of my health rather than taking a conventional route of taking prescription medication or treatment that masks the symptoms of a health issue. He has taken the time to listen and care for me as a patient, and I am incredibly grateful. I hope that other long-haulers reach out to him and his work, and can know that in doing so, that they are taking the first step towards the process of healing.\" -S.S. \"Scott Blunk started using small amounts of energy work with my acupuncture treatments. I was curious about this addition because it seemed to complement it well. Since then, full energy treatments have become truly transformative to the management of my physical and emotional pain. The way Scott is able to translate a vague request on my part to an appropriate treatment is a challenge that he meets constantly. The results have been truly inspirational to me. I have been better able to control my emotional responses to stressful situations, my job related physical pain has been better managed and I am now able to speak up for myself while working through highly difficult situations. I truly recommend this type of treatment because Scott's intuitive and empathic nature is a healing force.\" -T.B. At the time, I had no idea that I was suffering from long-haul Covid symptoms.
