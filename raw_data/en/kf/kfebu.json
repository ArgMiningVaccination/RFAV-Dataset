Current research supports the use of physical exercise and yoga for increasing individuals' moods, concentration, academic success, and confidence, as well as decreasing anxiety and depression. Alongside traditional psychotherapy, we also provide one-on-one and group mind-body therapy modalities, including yoga therapy, fitness therapy, walk + talk therapy, active therapy, and more. Not only have we found our mind-body therapies to be effective in helping clients create long-term desired life changes, but clients share that movement and activity (rather than sitting directly across from a therapist) helps them to engage more openly and feel less inhibited. Activity-Based therapy Active Therapy is for pre-teens and teenagers who would benefit from therapy in a more active, sporty environment rather than a formal office setting. Active Therapy combines movement-based activities such as shooting hoops, playing ping-pong, and working on art projects with talk therapy. Traditional talk therapy can sometimes feel awkward and intimidating for t(w)eens. By shifting the focus from a more structured, face-to-face environment to a fun and energetic activity, kids have more success in therapy. Research has consistently shown that physical movement can significantly decrease anxiety and depression while improving overall mood. Physical movement spurs creative, deeper ways of thinking and helps children and teens to confront difficult issues in a far less threatening environment. At True Mind + Body, we have found that incorporating fun movement activities into our sessions enriches the counseling experience. When children and teens are active and engaged, they are more open to new ideas and their brains work in a different, more effective manner. Who could benefit from Activity-Based Therapy? Boys and girls who... Experience a variety of issues ranging from self regulation challenges, ADHD, anxiety, depression, grief and loss, life transitions such as moving to middle school or high school, family divorce, low self-esteem, and/or social skill deficiencies. Are intimidated by the traditional talk therapy environment and face-to-face interactions. Are sporty, active or artistic and would benefit from movement-based therapy Would benefit from a jump-start into a more active lifestyle Benefits of Activity-Based Therapy: Increases energy and allows children and teens to feel less inhibited and more in touch with their feelings Promotes clearer thought processes and open-minded brainstorming abilities Increases confidence and feelings of empowerment and mastery Increases physical and cardiovascular health Decreases depression and anxiety symptoms Reinforces the use of movement as a healthy coping mechanism Yoga Therapy In yoga therapy, clients have an opportunity to get out of their heads and into their bodies, both to explore the issues and to learn useful skills for addressing them. Yoga therapy combines yoga with psychotherapy. Yoga principles such as breath, movement/yoga postures, mindfulness, and self-awareness are combined with cognitive behavioral strategies to address obstacles and create meaningful change. We all get stuck: in our habits, thinking patterns, and relationships. But we can also get stuck in psychotherapy--when talking ABOUT the focus areas is no longer enough. Yoga therapy is the perfect alternative. Who could benefit from Yoga Therapy? Individuals of all ages who are coping with... Anxiety Depression Grief and Loss Divorce Life Transitions Maternal Mental Health (e.g., infertility, pregnancy anxiety, postpartum depression and/or anxiety) Cancer and other life-threatening/altering conditions Chronic Pain What does Yoga Therapy look like? Like all services at True Mind + Body, Yoga Therapy is individualized for the unique needs and context of each client. Typically, sessions include guided mindfulness activities, yoga movement appropriate for beginners-advanced yogis, varying amounts of skills training, and discussion of real-life application and weekly actions steps/ \"homework\" assignments. Additionally, True Mind + Body offers yoga therapy groups for tweens and teens. Walk + Talk Therapy Walk + Talk Therapy is just as it sounds\u2014 the client and the therapist are outside walking during therapy (or on a treadmill with inclement weather) instead of sitting inside an office. Research has consistently shown that exercise can significantly decrease anxiety and depression while improving overall mood. Walk + Talk Therapy encourages clients to be more physically active in order to promote both mental and physical health. It spurs creative, deeper ways of thinking and helps clients to get \"unstuck\" while confronting difficult issues. Walk + Talk Therapy also allows clients to feel like they are moving forward and ahead of their issues and encourages them to tackle their challenges with more power and efficiency. At True Mind + Body, we have found that incorporating walking into psychotherapy sessions enriches the counseling experience. Our clients have told us that looking forward rather than directly at a therapist can help them engage more openly and feel less inhibited. Who could benefit from Walk + Talk Therapy? Individuals who... Would like to create a significant change in their lifestyle by incorporating physical movement, talk therapy, healthy habits, and positivity Are looking for an alternative to the in-office, face-to-face, therapeutic approach Would like to break through unhealthy habits and incorporate more activity into their lifestyles through a safe and supported approach Would benefit from the meditative and energizing effects of walking in nature and fresh air Benefits of Walk + Talk Therapy: Increases energy and allows clients to feel less inhibited and more in touch with their feelings Promotes clearer thought processes and open-minded brainstorming abilities Increases confidence and feelings of empowerment and mastery Increases physical and cardiovascular health Decreases depression and anxiety symptoms Reinforces the use of walking as a healthy coping mechanism Jump-starts walking as fitness routine and as a way to maintain an active lifestyle Fitness Therapy Fitness Therapy combines exercise with psychotherapy.
