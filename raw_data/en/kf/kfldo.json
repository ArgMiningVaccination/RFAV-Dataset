This product in particular is one of the highest quality (physician only) vitamin D products on the market. Vitamin D is something that many people forget about taking, but is essential for our health. Here in Arizona, most people are vitamin D deficient due to little sun exposure. Our bodies naturally produce Vitamin D when we are in the sun. In addition, as we get older, we produce less Vitamin D. This vitamin is important for general wellness, immune health and function; as well as muscle, bone and joint health. During cold and flu season, a high dose of Vitamin D will act the same way as a cold med or flu shot. I recommend that every person be on some sort of a Vitamin D regimen for lifelong health benefits. If you have any questions regarding why I have chosen this brand and product, feel free to contact me for more information. Stay "}
