At Avalon University School of Medicine, we're happy to provide answers to these questions! While both MD and DO doctors have a wealth of medical knowledge, the differences lie in diagnosis and treatment philosophy. Although allopathic vs osteopathic philosophies may differ, the level of care the patient receives should always remain constant. A Comparison: Allopathic vs Osteopathic Allopathic (MD): Allopathic medicine is the more commonly known form of medical practice. This type of medicine focuses on classical scientific diagnosis methods such as lab tests and imaging. Allopathic medicine typically treats illnesses with the use of medication. Osteopathic (DO): Osteopathic medicine also utilizes lab tests during diagnosis, but additionally reviews the patient's daily life, environment, and diet when determining treatments. This type of medicine may take a more holistic approach to determining treatment and utilize osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM).
