When I decided to enter into the world of Yoga, my parents actually stood against me. They were not confident in my decision. I turned away from 16 years of education and came to an unfamiliar city to follow this passion. My [journey](https://www.myyogateacher.com/articles/the-journey-begins) started as a fitness trainer, completing certificates in Pilates, strength and conditioning and Strong by Zumba. I worked in a well-established gym called Chisel in Bangalore. Finally, I entered into the beautiful ocean called YOGA by enrolling in a Hatha and [Ashtanga](https://www.myyogateacher.com/) Vinyasa certificate program in the Yoga capital of the world: Rishikesh, India. I fell in love with [yoga](https://www.myyogateacher.com/articles/yoga-to-me-is-a-connection-to-my-childhood). Yoga is so so beautiful, monumental and soul-bearing and I adore it. Since completing that certificate program, I have worked with more than 50 multigyms in Bangalore and conducted more than 1,000 group classes. Each week, I teach everything from workshops to personal one-on-one classes and styles including hatha, [vinyasa](https://www.myyogateacher.com/signUp/), power and even [acroyoga](https://www.myyogateacher.com/articles/)! My experience, training and love for this practice enable me to teach confidently. Yoga gave me [confidence](https://www.myyogateacher.com/articles/yoga-for-confidence). Yoga gave me health.Yoga gave me a sound mind in a sound body. In short, [yoga](https://www.myyogateacher.com/articles/diversity-and-inclusion-in-yoga) gave me everything.
