These homeopathic remedies, which are dilutions of the substances that caused or contributed to the illness, are used to stimulate healing. A large number of proven remedies are available, and selecting the best remedy at the proper potency requires careful observation and skill. Homeopathic remedies can help to bring a harmonious state of health. Rather than suppressing the illness like traditional medicine, homeopathic remedies improve the immune system to get total control over the illness. Homeopathic remedies are usually given in very small doses. It is safe and has almost no side effects. Today there are many different theories and ideas about the use of homeopathic medicines, but the foundation and science of classical homeopathy emanates fromDr. Samuel Hahnemann. It is based on the recognition that health and disease are a change of state in each individual and depends on the individual's life force (i.e., vitality, or dynamic energy), state of susceptibility and inherited predisposition. What can homeopathy treat? Homeopathy can be used for acute symptoms (i.e. headaches, coughs, fevers, etc.), however, it has its greatest benefit when used for chronic conditions (i.e. mood swings, depression, anger, etc.). Issues we may have had from birth, inheritance, old traumas or incompletely healed illnesses or emotional stressors are a few examples of what can be addressed using homeopathy. Homeopathic can work on people of all ages but is particularly effective on children. Many childhood illnesses, health issues and fears can be improved through the use of homeopathy. What homeopathic remedy is right for me? Homeopathy is based on the principal of like cures like. The homeopathic practitioner chooses a remedy to treat symptoms that would normally be caused by that remedy at full strength. By doing this, the remedy acts to stimulate the body's own systems to cure the problem. Choosing a homeopathic remedy involves studying a history that goes beyond the symptom at hand. Your symptom may be a cough, but selecting a remedy out of the many that treat coughs may have more to do with your fears or sleep patterns than the cough itself. Based on one's physical and mental sensitivity to circumstances\u2014your homeopath may suggest different remedies. It is essential that you let your homeopathic practitioner know all of the symptoms you may have, not simply the main one. We tend to \"sugar coat\" things when it comes to our symptoms and leave out significant details. To the homeopathic practitioner, it is these details that can be the most helpful. The \"holy grail\" of homeopathy is to find a remedy that exactly describes the patient including the current symptoms. What does a homeopathic remedy look like? Homeopathic remedies come in a number of forms. For the most part, they will either be in a pellet tablet form or in a liquid/drop form. They are placed on or under the tongue and allowed to absorb there. It is essential that the mouth be clear of any food, mint, garlic, coffee, or any other strong odor. The best time to take a homeopathic is on an empty stomach. Homeopathies, by themselves, do not have side effects. Any symptoms that might develop as a result of the homeopathic treatment is part of the healing process and should be brought to the attention of your practitioner. What will my treatment at Bio Medical Energy Center look like? An initial Homeopathic consultation lasts about two hours and the fee is $275. Follow-up appointment fees range from $110 to $160.

To obtain the best results and full benefits of homeopathic science, one should seek homeopathy in the early phase of sickness. Because of the lack of awareness about the usefulness of homeopathy for all kinds of diseases ranging from colds to cancer, many patients seek out homeopathy late. Although homeopathic treatment may still help the ailing patient - the disease may have advanced to an incurable stage - which in early stages may have been a curable disorder.
