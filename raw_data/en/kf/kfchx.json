Transcripts from internatio nal institutions must be translated and evaluated by a professional transcript evaluation service who is a member of either the National Council on the Evaluation of Foreign Education Credent ials (NACES ) or the Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE). Fees for this service are the responsibility of the applicant. The applicant must request a course -by- course and degree evaluation. The transcript evaluation service must mail the official r eport and transcripts utilized directly to the SCNM Admissions Office and received before an evaluation of the applicant's file can begin. Additional coursework materials, such as catalogs, course descriptions, and syllabi, if requested, must be translated into English by a professional service. Transfer Applicants Applicants who wish to transfer from another accredi ted (or candidate) equivalent -level degree program must meet all program admission requirements, including payment of fees. Transfer students are required to submit a completed Verification of Student Conduct form signed by the Dea n of Students or the Registrar of the previously attended institution verifying that the student was in good standin g and not subject to any disciplinary actions .

Transfer applicants studying in the U.S. on a visa must work with the institution they are transferring from to transfer their student visa to SCNM. Transfer Credit Policy Students entering SCNM who have completed coursework or have graduated from a domestic or foreign accredited professional schoo l or graduate -level program may apply for transfer status. The Transfer Transcript Evaluation Fee (see Tuition and Fees) is waived for transfer applicants from other naturopathic institutions. Students must request and submit transcripts from all prior ins titutions, including military training transcripts for veterans, traditio nal college coursework, and vocational training. Transfer credit will be determined during the admissions process. Only graduate - level coursework (masters or doctorate) is considered for transfer credit. Courses considered for transfer credit must have been completed at institutions with candidacy status or accredited by those bodies recognized by the U .S. Department of Education. The transfer of credit is determined on an individual basis depending on academic standing, the type of program, degree, and courses completed. Coursework completed more than seven (7) years prior to matriculation requ ires a competency examination with appropriate fees . The Registrar's Office, in conjunction with the faculty and the Vice President of Academic Affairs , makes determinations of acceptable transfer credits. Transfer credit will not be considered after matriculation. Transfer status does not imply or guarantee that a student will graduate in less time than the student's prescribed program of study . Transfer students must complete the ir program in the time determined at the transfer evaluation and in accordance with the number of credits transferred. (See Satisfa ctory Academic Progress for prescribe d program of study .) Eligible Coursework Only coursework completed prior to matriculation at SCNM will be applied toward transfer credit, except for approved coursework taken while dual -enrolled at Phoenix Institute of Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture (PIH MA) or the Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health (MEZCOPH) at the University of Arizona ( see Program Partnerships) . Clinical training credit cannot be transferred or earned through the completion of a competency exam, with the exception of 12 or less credits completed at another accredited naturopath ic institution , less than five years' lapse in their completion and applied to the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program . Transfer Cred it Request All applicants seeking transfer credit should submit a completed Transfer Evaluation Form a minimum of ten weeks prior to matriculation. A non-refundable Transfer Transcript Evaluation Fee (good for one academic year pre - matriculati on) must be submitted to the Admissions Office with the completed application for admission. The Transfer Evaluation Fee is applied to the first quarter's tuition upon matriculation (see Tuition and Fees ). Transfer credits are counted toward the total hour s required for graduation but are not counted toward the GPA.

Financial Policies Page 15 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Financial Aid Students in eligible programs seeking federal funding for their educational needs will receive assistance through the Financial Aid Office. The Federal William D. Ford Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to students who qualify and are non -need on federal regulations. The student is responsible for the interest that accrues on an unsubsidized loan. Students have the option of paying the interest while in school or adding the interest to the principal balance at the time of repayment. Program Limits Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine students : The maximum amount a student may borrow in Direct Unsubsidized Loans is $40,500 per nine -month academic year. The total loan amount may not exceed $40,500 per academic year. The aggregate limit for Direct Unsubsid ized loans is $224,000. Master's students: The maximum amount a student may borrow in Direct Unsubsidized Loans is $20,500 per nine -month academic year. The total loan amount may not exceed $20,500 per academic year. The aggregate limit for Direct Unsubsi dized loans is $138,500. Private student loans are available to those who qua lify and are credit based. There are no fixed annual or aggregate loan limits for private student loans. However, private loans m ay not exceed the cost of attendance for a nine -month academic period. (See Financial Policies .) Financial Aid Recipients In accordance with the U.S. Department of Education (E D) 34 CFR 668.1 64 (c), federal student aid shall be posted to student accounts for allowable tuition and fee charges pr ior to cred iting student accounts for other costs such as living expenses. Further, student verification of attendance in classes or clerkships must be documented prior to financial aid disbursement. Once student aid is applied to student accounts and attendance veri fication is received, the net difference between aid and tuition and fee charges results in an amount due to student or an amount due from student. Amounts due to students are provided in the form of a paper check or directly deposited in student bank acc ounts. Amounts due from students are due and payable accord ing to the payment guidelines outlined previously . Foreign Financial Aid or Third -Party Payer Recipients Proof of official promissory note and/or offer letter from a third -party payer must be deliv ered to the SCNM Business Office prior to the first day of a term in order to avoid being dropped from all registered courses and clerkships and having to re -register for courses, as outlined previously . General Eligibility Requirements All students seeki ng financial aid must meet general eligibility requirements regarding citizenship, selective service, financial need , and satisfactory academic progress. Students who are currently in default and have not made satisfactory loan repayments or owe a refund o n a Title IV program do NOT qualify for any form of federal aid. Loss of Eligibility Due to a Drug Conviction A student who is convicted of a state or federal off ense involving the possession or sale of an illegal drug that occurred while enrolled in school and receiving Title IV aid is not eligible for Title IV funds (see SCNM's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy in the SCNM Student Handbook). A borrower's eligibility is based on the student's s elf- certification on the Free Application for Federal Student A id (FAFSA). Convictions that are reversed, set aside, or removed from the student's record or a determination arising from a juvenile court proceeding do not affect eligibility and do not need to be reported by the student. A student convicted of a drug -related offense while enrolled in school and receiving Title IV aid loses Title IV eligibility as follows: 1. For the possession of illegal drugs: First offense: one year from the date of conviction Second offense: two years from the date of the second conviction Third offense: indefinite period 2. For the sale of illegal drugs: First offense: two years from the date of conviction Second offense: indefinite period A school must provide a student who loses Title IV eligibility due to a drug -related conviction with a timely, separate, clear, and conspicuous written notice. The notice must advise the student of their loss of Title IV eligibility and the ways in which the student may regain that eligibil ity. Financial Policies Page 16 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Regaining Eligibility after a Drug Conviction Students denied eligibility for an indefinite period can regain eligibility after completing any of the following three options: 1. Successfully completing a rehabilitation program (as described below, wh ich includes passing two unannounced drug tests from such a program); 2. Having the conviction reversed, set aside, or remove d from the student's record so that fewer than two convictions for sale or three convictions for possession remain on the record ; or 3. Successfully completing two unannounced drug tests which are part of a rehab program (the student does not need to complete the rest of the program). A drug rehabilitation program is considered approved for these purposes if it includes at least two unann ounced drug tests and meets one of the following requirements: The program received or is qualified to receive funds directly or indirectly under a federal, state, or local government program. The program is administered or recognized by a federal, state , or local government agency or court. The program received or is qualified to receive payment directly or indirectly from a federally or state licensed insurance company. The program is administered or recognized by a federally or state -licensed hospital, health clinic, or medical doctor. When a student regains eligibility during the award year, SCNM may award campus -based aid for the current payment period (quarter) and Direct Loans for the period of enrollment (academic year). Federal Student Aid Hand book. (2019 -2020 ). School -Determined Requirements. Ch. from: https://ifap.ed.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/2019 - 08/1920FSAHbkVol1Master.pdf . Financial Aid Procedure Students in eligible programs interested in obtaining financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the Direct Master Promissory Note (MPN), and Federal Stafford Entrance Counseling Exam . Approximately two to three weeks after submission of the FAFSA, the results of the compilation of information, including the estimated family contribution, is sent to the student and SCNM. Once the student's file is reviewed for eligibility, federal funding is determined. The student will receive an offer letter reflecting the cost of attendance based on the student's credit hour load reflected in their final registration and the type of aid offered based on the student's eligibili ty. Federal Work Study Federal Work Study (FWS) awards are need -based. Campus - based s tudents in eligible programs are required to indicate their desire to participate in the FWS program when completing their FAFSA or communicate their desire to the SCNM Financial Aid Office to ensure FWS awarding is an option. Available positions are advertised each quarter. Please contact the Financial Aid Office for additional information at finaid@scnm.edu . International Students Although international students do not qualify for U. S. federal financial aid, there are other options to help fund the ir SCNM education. Private stu dent loans are available to foreign students; however, they must have a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co -signer. In addition, Canadian students may be eligible to apply for Canadian student l oans through their respective provincial governments. Canadian students receiving financial aid from their provincial governments w ill be held to the same payment deadlines for tuition . Tuition must be paid in full by the end of add/drop period. If provincial financial aid is received by SCNM after the student has paid, a refund of excess tuition will be is sued to the student within t en business days. Canadian students are responsible for initiating the process of financial assistance from their province. Documentation should be sent to the Financial Aid Office at SCNM for completion and returned to the appropriate provincial governmen t. Veterans Benefits Page 17 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Veterans Benefits Applying for VA Benefits SCNM's ND and MSCN program s are approved program s of study by the Arizona State Approving Agency (ASAA) for students eligible to receive VA ben efits. Eligibility for VA benefits is determined by the appropriate VA Benefits Office. Students must contact the VA Office and complete the required approval forms to determine eligibility. After the student has completed the process, the student must submit their notice of eligibility and status of benefi ts to the Registrar's Office. Yellow Ribbon Program SCNM is an approved participant in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' Yellow Ribbon program. Individuals wh o qualify for the Post -9/11 GI Bill\u00ae at the 100% rate may be eligible for additional funding to help them achieve their educational goal s. The Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program (Yellow Ribbon Program) is a provision of the Post -9/11 GI Bill\u00ae that allows veterans to attend private s chools and graduate programs costing more than the annual state tuition cap. Under the program, SCNM offers a veterans -only scholarship which the VA will then match. This benefit is offered to a limited number of students on a first -come, first - served basis. Veterans should contact the Registrar's Office for further information on the benefits and submission of the Yellow Ribbon Program application . VA Eligibility VA Benefits are not considered Estimated Financial Assistance when determining eligibility for Direct Loans. Veterans must continue to achieve Satisfactory Academ ic Progress (SAP) toward their educational program(s) eac h term in order to remain eligible for benefits. SCNM must report to the VA Office if a student is not making SAP or if there is an y change in enrollment status. (See Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study.) Students who served on Active Duty may be eligible for education benefits offered by the Department of Veteran Affairs. Students currently serving in the m ilitary or who are the spouse or child of a service member may be eligible for funding offered through the Department of Defense Tuition Assistance program. Students should check eligibilit y status and the amount for which they qualify prior to enrolling. (For additional information, refer to the financial aid web page on the SCNM website.) VA Principles of Excellence SCNM has agreed to comply with the Principles of Excellence as issued in Executive Order 13607 and signed on April 27, 2012. Any individual covered by VA benefits is eligible to attend or participate in courses during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides SCNM a certificate of eligibility for entitlement to educational assistance under Chapter 31 or 33 (a \"certificate of eligibility\" can also include a \"Statement of Benefits\" obtained from the Departm ent of Veterans Affairs' (VA) website - eBenefits, or a VAF 28 -1905 form for chapter 31 authorization purposes) and ending on the earlier of the following date s: (1) the date on which payment from the VA is made to SCNM , or (2) 90 days after the date SCNM certified tuition and fees following the receipt of the certificate of eligibility. SCNM will not impose any penalty, including assessment of late fees ; the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities ; or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds on any covered individual because of the individu al's inability to meet their financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement funding from VA under Chapter 31 or 33 (refer to Military Leave of Absence and to the Withdrawal Refund Policy ). Distance Learning Page 18 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Distanc e Learning In addition to traditi onal campus -based courses, SCNM offers courses via distance or online learning. Online learning can occur in different forms , from 100% online (online) to partially online (hybrid or blended) courses. Online learning \u2014 whether offered at a distance, locally through a 100% online course , or a hybrid course \u2014comprises directed learning processes and facilitates student interaction wi th the content. Directed learning processes generally involve educational information (articles, videos, images, and web links), communication (messaging, discussion forums), and assessment used to measure students' achievement. Online Courses Online learn ing consists of all e -learning (web -based) instruction and activities . In 100% online courses ; there are no in-person requirements within the course. All communication and coursework are completed through the learning management system. Hybrid Courses Blended (hybrid) learning consists of traditional in-person classroom instruction mixed with e -learning (web -based) instruction and/or activities. In-person, classroom -based learning time is scheduled along with web-based or out -of- class work; typically, in-person class time is replaced with web-based or out -of-class work. Communications and coursework are enhanced by making use of Canvas, MySCNM , and other online education tools. Technology Requirements Students enrolled in SCNM courses must have access to hardware, software, and internet bandwidth that meets the minimum technology and computer requirements that will allow them to successfully navigate SCNM's technology systems. To view recommended minimum requirements and evaluate their device(s), students should visit the Technology Check website at techcheck.scnm.edu . Course Accessibility Students will have access to online courses upon registration; however, course content may not be available prior to the start of the quarter. Student Authentication The United States Federal Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) of 2008, Public Law 110 -315, mandates that institutions validate that the person enroll ed in and receiving credit for the online course is the same person participating in and completing the online course. To authenticate stud ent identity in online courses , SCNM use s a secure login with username and password to authenticate student identity. In accordance with Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), methods used to authenticate student identity in online and distance learning courses will protect the privacy of student information. Privacy Students should be aware that informatio n posted using course tools in courses with online components, including discussion forums, blogs, or videos, are available to the instructor and fellow students. Students should refrain from posting personal or confidential information to safeguard their privacy. Institutional Policies Page 19 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Institutional Policies Enrollment Policy Once matriculated, a student must be continuously en rolled unless the student is taking an approved leave of absence.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act This federal law is designed to protect the confidentiality of the student 's edu cational records. The Act affords the student certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights ensure that eligible students have access to their educational records for inspection and review and to request an amendment if the student b elieves they are inaccurate or in violation of the student 's privacy. Further, this law protects the rights of a student to privacy by limiting access by others to education records without express written consent of the student and the right to file a com plaint with the U.S. Dep artme nt of Ed ucation concerning alleged failures by SCNM to comply with the requirements of FERPA. SCNM may release information from an education record without the consent of the student to officials of a nother college or universit y where the student seeks or intends to enroll, as permitted by FERPA \u00a799.31 (a)(2). SCNM may release information from an education record without the consent of the student to another educat ional institution in which the student is enrolled. For example, SCNM may release academic records for a \"dual enrollment\" without prior written consent (FERPA \u00a799.34 (b)). SCNM may disclose information from an education record without the consent of the student if the informatio n is necessary to protect the health or s afety of the student or other individuals (FERPA \u00a799.36). Student records are open to other school officials, including faculty and Institutional Policies Page 20 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog administr ation, and local and state education agencies that have been determined to have a legitimate educational interest, including those specified by the Act as amended January 3, 2012. Students have the right to review and inspect their education records, including their application, except for confidential recommendations. Photo identification must be presented before acc ess to education records will be permitted. An appointment must be made with the Registrar's Office to access an education record. Directory Information SCNM may release information that has been defined under the Directory Information Provision of FERPA. SCNM defines directory information as name, address, photo/photo -ID, phone number, e -mail address, dates of attendance, the program of study, degree conferral date, enrollment status, grade level, previous educational institutions attended, and degrees/awa rds earned. Forms are available at the Registrar's Office for a student to request that SCN M withhold all directory information . Proper Disclosure Student information of a private, personal, or confidential nature that is provided to SCNM faculty and staff will not be disclosed improperly. Faculty are expected to provide accurate evaluations of students. For the purposes of monitoring and recording student progress, evaluatio ns include the strengths and weaknesses of academic, clinica l, communication, and p rofessional skills. The evaluations also include observations and opinions regarding academic effort and professional conduct. Although not required, faculty and staff may provide judgments of a student's abilities and character to others in appropriate circumstances in accordance with the SCNM policy on student records. Change of Name The name used by a student on all educational records, including their diploma, must be the student's legal name. T o change the name reflected on student records, a student must complete the name change form and provide one of the following legal documents to the Registrar's Office: A copy of the student's social security card A certified copy of a court decree dissolving a marriage/restoring maiden name A certified copy of the court order directing a change of name A valid motor vehicle driver's license The student's request is recorded after all materials are submitted. Registration Pre-registration All SCNM programs are cohort -based ; therefore , students are automatically registered for core courses (not electives or selectives) , including courses, labs, and clinical clerkships. Students may not deviate from their prescribed program of study. Following registration and prior to the start of the term, students enrolled in campus -based courses will have the opportunity to trade course/lab sections or clinical clerkships ( see SCNM C linical Handbook) according to published deadlines for their prescribed program of study. Registration New campus -based students are r equired to provide a copy of a government -issued photo identification (i.e. Driver's license or passport ). Registration for ND selective courses is available to students online 24/7 during the open registration period. Registration dates for each program o f study are published in the academic calendar unless posted otherwise. Registration is the responsibility of the student. ND Students may not register for courses after the second week of classes ; MS students may not register for courses after the fourth day of classes (see Adding and Dropping Courses). Students who fail any courses may not be e ligible to progress in their prescribed program of study, will be dropped from the post -requisite course(s) and must meet with an Academic Advisor to amend their re gistration. Students must have the required prerequisites or co - requisites to be registered for the next quarter's courses. Students who fail milestone, capstone , or sequence courses are not eligible to progress until the course is repeated with a passing grade. Students must be final registered for courses in order to attend. To finalize registration each term, ND students must complete the online Registration Term Agreement. MS students will confirm their agreement through correspondence with their Studen t Success Counselor . As part of fall quarter registration, all students are also required to review and update their personal and emergency contact information. Students enrolled in online distance learning programs are required to verify their current address and indicate the state in which they will be taking course s, if different from their address, prior to the start of each quarter. Students who do not complete the agreement (and information update when required) during the designated time period will be charged a Late Registration F ee and may not be registered fo r the next quarter's courses . (See Tuition and Fee s.) Institutional Policies Page 21 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Registration Holds A registration hold may be placed on a student's rec ord to prevent the student from registering for courses in future quarters for financial, administrative , admissions, or academic r easons (including failure to comply with SCNM's Everfi requirement, current NPLEX policies, or address verification requirement) . Any registration hold must be resolved before a student is registered. Attendance Students are expected to attend all classes, laboratories, and clinical clerkships. It is the faculty member's prerogative to determine attendance requirements for campus -based lecture sessions. Attendance requirements are stated in the course syllabus. Attendance at laboratories and clinical clerks hips is mandatory. Students must notify the Dean of Student's Office , utilizing the excused absence form, to receive official recognition of their absence for course attendance and test rescheduling purposes within 24 hours (one business day) of a qualifie d incident, unless there are extenuating circumstances. Attendance for online distance learning courses is determined by active participation within a distance course such as submitting an assignment or exam, attending an online chat, or posting to a discu ssion forum. Simply logging into the course is not considered participation. Participat ion will not be counted for assignments submitted prior to the official first day of the quarter. Class participation by the end of the fourth day of the course is requi red to verify attendance and to release financial aid, if applicable. Students who do not maintain active participation in a distance course, as outlined in the syllabus, are encouraged to withdraw from the course to avoid failure of the course . (See Adding and Dropping Courses. ) Students receiving Title IV financial assistance, including assistance from the Veterans Administration (VA), are responsible for meeting VA and/or applicable federal aid attendance requirements. Academic Policy and Progress Committee The Academic Policy and Progress Committee (APPC) is comprised of faculty, administration, and staff members. The APPC makes academic decisions regarding students' progress throughout their program. The decisions of the APPC are final with the exception of decisions regarding academic dismissal, which may be appealed to the Dean of Naturopathic Medicine or the Dean of Nutrition depend ing on the student's program of study. Adding and Dropping Courses SCNM 's programs of study are track program s. Changes to the student's prescribed program of study must receive approval from APPC . Schedule changes requested after the start of a quarter are only permitted as detailed belo w: Students who fail to drop any course for which they are registered and fai l to attend/participate in that course are subject to failing the course and the academic policies pertaining to failing a course . (See Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study .) Students dropping a course after the add/drop period (ND program, end of week two; MS program, fourth day of course) may impact their academic performance/academic progress. All courses dropped after the add/drop period require the approval of the APPC. Courses that are taught in a n 11- or 12-week format that are dropped after the add/drop period through the fourth week of the course will result in a grade of Withdrawal (WD) on the student's official transcript and have no impact on the student's GPA; courses taken again after a WD grade was earned for that cou rse will be noted as a repeat on their official transcript and are subject to repeat failed grade policies . (See Grade of Fail or Unsatisfactory .). Courses that are taught in a n 11- or 12-week format that are dropped after the fourth week will result in students receiv ing the grade earned at the time of withdrawal; faculty will assign a grade of WD if the student is passing the course, or if the faculty cannot certify that the student is failing the course at the time the course is dropped . The faculty will assign a grade of Withdrawal Fail (WF ) if the faculty can certify that the student is failing the course at the time the course is dropped. (See Leave of Absence Policy for exceptions .) Courses that are taught in a shortened format (weekend intensives, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, or 8 -week s in duration) stand independent of the withdrawal timeframe outlined above. Courses dropped after the add/drop period are subject to a grade of WD . Dropping after 60% completion of the course results in a grade of WD if the student is passing or if the faculty cannot certify that the student is failing the course at the time the course is dropped. The faculty will assign a grade of WF if the faculty can certify that the student is failing the course at the time of the withdrawal. (See Refund Policy/Drop Courses for prescribed program of study .) If the student has completed all course requirements prior to the student's withdrawal date, the grade earned at that time w ill be assigned by faculty as the final grade Institutional Policies Page 22 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog for the course. A WD grade may be administratively assigned if no grade is submitted by faculty prior to the end of the term's grading period. Changes made to a student's schedule may result in appropriate tuit ion and/or fees being applied to their account. (See Tuition and Fees .) See the ND Program Add/Drop Requirements for additional program requirements . Auditing Courses Students may audit a course if they have already received credit for the course, met the course prerequisites , and have registered for the course. A student may not audit a course for which they have not already received credit. A student cannot audit laboratory courses or clinical courses. Non - degree students may not audit courses (exception applies for SCNM Alumni of that program ). When auditing a course, students do not earn a grade, nor do they receive credit. Courses taken as audit will appear as an AU on the st udent's official transcript. (S ee Tuition and Fees.) Leave of Absence A leave of absence (LOA) may be granted to any student maintaining satisfactory academic progress for their prescribed program of study and who has met all financial obligations to SCNM. All LOA s will be approved by t he APPC . While on LOA, students are not eligible to attend c ourses or clinical clerkships, nor receive financial aid. The Financial Aid Office will be notified of the student 's intended last date of attendance when s tudents request an LOA. If students are unable to complete a quarter, tuition and fee refunds will be issued according to the Add/Drop Policy ; and final grades will be issued according to the Grading Scale Policy. (See Adding and Dropping Courses and Grading Scale Policy .) LOA is a period of non -enrollment where students are not considered to be working toward the completion of their degree. The length of time allowed for LOA va ries depending on the type of leave (see Types of Leave of Absence) . Students on LOA are not eligible for financial aid and are subject to federal regulations pertaining to current lo ans. Upon return from LOA, the student must continue to me et technical standards and graduation requirements for their prescribed program of study. 1. Students will initiate the LOA process through an Academic Advisor or Dean of Students . 2. Requests for LOA will be considered individually by APPC using the following guidelines: a. LOA will only be granted to students demonstrating satisfactory academic progress for their prescribed progra m of study . b. LOA should be requested prior to the beginning of a term and be approved before the term for which it is requested. c. In cases of death , serious illness in the family, or serious personal injury, a hardship withdrawal may be granted during any ac ademic term; students will be administratively withdrawn from all coursework in progress at the time of approved LOA. Hardship withdrawals must be approved by APPC. 3. Leave time will be considered a portion of the total time limit for the degree. (See Satisf actory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study.) 4. Students who do not return to active enrollment at the end of the granted leave are administratively withdrawn from SCNM. Students who are absent in excess of one year must go through the admission process for re - entry. Students are responsible for any outstanding tuition, fees, medical center bills, and library fines. Types of Leave of Absence Administrative Leave of Absence The Administrative Leave of Absence (ALOA) policy assists and supports s tudents who are unable to progress in their prescribed program of study due to the failure of a required course by streamlining the leave of absence process. Students will receive an official notification of the ALOA from the Registrar's Office . The genera l policies for a student on LOA typically apply to a student on ALOA and are also included in detail in the SCNM Student Handbook. SCNM reserves the right to place a student on an ALOA in the event the student is unable to return to courses or has submitte d medical documentation indicating they are unable to participate in courses. Personal Leave of Absence Students who are temporarily unable to continue their program of stud y for personal reasons may request a Personal LOA for a specific period of time not to exceed two consecutive quarters in a 12 -month period. Students on a Personal LOA that exceeds two quarters must request an extension from APPC or they may be officially withdrawn . Medical Leave of Absence Students who are temporarily unable to continue their program of study for medical reasons may request a Medical LOA for a specific period of time not to exceed a 12 - month period. Students requesting an LOA for medical reasons must provide documentation by a clinician qualified to diagnose in the appropriate area of specialization. Documentation must be based on a current evaluation, provided on letterhead, typed, dated , and have an original signature. The same documentation is required when a student wishes to return from the medical LOA, indicating Institutional Policies Page 23 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog the student is now able to resume their academic program. All documentation must be submitted with the LOA request . For information regarding medical accommodations, please see Accessibility Office pages on MySC NM. A Medical LOA can be requested in conjunction with a Grade of Incomplete request, if occurring during the term and requirements are met. Military Leave of Absence Any student who is a member of the National Guard or other reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States and is called to active duty will be granted a Military LOA for the period of active duty and one year thereafter. Students will submit the student's notification of duty requi rements from the military . Upon return from a Milit ary LOA, the student will be reactivated with the same academic status and without loss of academic credits earned, scholarships or grants awarded, or tuition or other fees paid prior to the commencement of active duty. Leave of Absence and Financial Aid The U.S. Department of Education requires that a student maintain a minimum status of half -time enrollment to receive federal financial aid. Therefore, students who are on ALOA/LOA will be considered withdrawn according to financial aid regulation 34 CFR 668.22 (d). If students are unable to complete a quarter, tuition and fee refunds will be issued according to the Add/Drop Policy for their prescribed program of study ; and final grades will be issued according to the Grading Scale Policy. Leave time will be considered a portion of the total time limit for degree completion. (See Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study .) Exit Interview Students who are enrolled less than half time, withdraw , or graduate from SCNM are required by the U.S. Department of Education to complete the online exit counseling. Exit counseling help s borrowers understand their responsibilities when repaying on their federal student loans . Please visit https://studentaid.gov/ for more information. Leave of Absence and Library Resources Students in good standing with SCNM are allowed to use the library resources. The library provides ample opportunity for all patrons to resolve accou nt issues. The Registrar's Office notif ies the library of students approved for a leave of absence (LOA) . Students on a n LOA must return all library materials and pay any outstanding fines prior to LOA approval. (See Library P rivilege s during a Leave of Absence .) Reactivation of Enrollment after Leave of Absence Students wishing to be re -activated within a year from the last date of attendance must submit a Reactivation Application form, along with any supporting documents as determined by the type of LOA. The student must contact an Academic Advisor to initiate reactivation and for assistance on requirements. All reactivation requests must be approved by the APPC. The APPC will review the request and determine the student's readiness to re -enter the program . Upon return from LOA, the student must continue to me et any technical standards and all graduation requirements for their prescribed program of study . If a student enrolled in a n ND clinically -based program ceases to be enrolled, including LOAs, Arizona ND statutes require that the certificate to engage in clinical training hel d by that student be automatically canceled. This requires that ND students returning from a n LOA must re -apply for a new clinical training certificate (CTC) prior to their return to SCNM as required by the Arizona Naturopathic Medi cal Board. A CTC is required to be current, and it is the responsibi lity of the ND student to ensure that they have a valid CTC during their enrollment . ND c linical students who return from an LOA may be required to attend Clinical Skills Development Sessions (CSDS) to ensure they are prepared for re -entry into the clinical program . Returning ND clinical students will only be scheduled in onsite clerkships during the term they reacti vate. The time during which the student was on ALOA/LOA and/or withdrawn will be considered a portion o f the total time limit for degree completion. Academic Standing, Leave of Absence, and Withdrawals Students cannot avoid academic action by taking a n LOA or withdrawing. Each student's a cademic standing is finalized at the conclusion of each quarter after a review of the term 's final grade submissions. A student who meets the criteria for probation and/or dismissal will be notified at the end o f the term . (S ee Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of stud y.) Administrative Withdrawal SCNM is required to verify the enrollment and participation of students who participate in Federal Title IV student aid programs and/or who receive educational benefits through alternate funding sources. Institutional Policies Page 24 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Students may be administratively withdrawn from th e college under the following circumstances: Failure to pay tuition and fees for the prescribed program of study by the published deadline Failure to return to active enrollment at the end of the granted leave Failure to complete Registration Term Agreemen t, Personal Information Update (when required), and/or necessary authorizations for registration to occur Complete Withdrawal /Refund Policy Complete withdrawal is defined as completely withdra wing from all c ourses (including a leave of absence). In the case of a complete withdrawal, the following tuition refunds apply and are dependent upon the withdrawal date. For calculation purposes, the date of complete withdra wal is the date the student provides formal written notice to an Academic Advisor, Registrars , or Dean of Students' office. Written notice via e -mail is sufficient if the e -mail is sent from the student's SCNM e -mail account. In the case of a student who fails to notify the College of intent to withdraw, the date that is the midpoint of the term or the student's last documented date of an academically related activity will be considered the withdrawal date, whichever is the longest time. Courses that are taught in a condensed format (i.e. , selective courses offered as intensives or courses that precede the term) will be considered as stand -alone courses for the purpose of withdrawal and refunds. Refunds are determined based upon the last date of attendance in relation to the course's official start date. The percentage of time enrolled in each course will dictate the refund amount. Withdrawal Date Refund Calculations Complete withdrawal before the start of the term 100% tuition and fees except for non-refundable fees as noted in Tuition and Fees Complete withdrawal after the start of the term, or before 60% completion of the course % of tuition and refundable fees will be based on the federal guidelines formula as shown belo w, except for non- refundable fees as noted in Tuition and Fees After the 60% completion point of the course/term 0% tuition and fees refunded Federal Formula 1. Refund Ra te = Calendar days completed in the period of enrollment divided by total calendar days in the period of enrollment 2. Refund Amount = Tuition charges for the period of enrollment X the percentage of unearned Title IV aid This calculation determines the percen tage of federal funds that have been earne d by the school at the time of withdrawal and the amount of unearned funds that must be returned to the federal program. For more information , contact the Financial Aid Office at finaid@scnm.edu . Dropped Courses/ Refund Policy Students who do not completely withdraw from the college but drop a c ourse /clerkship during the published drop period will be refunded the difference in the tuition paid and the tuition rate applicable to the reduced number of hours, including course -specific fees assessed to the c ourses dropped. There is no refund due to a student who partially withdraws from courses after the official add/drop period of the prescribed program of study . Tuition paid for intensive courses will not be refunded once the course has begun. Special drop deadlines may apply for certain courses . Deadlines will be included in quarterly registration notifications . Examinations Examination Standards When taking in-person or online examinations, students: Are required to leave all books and other aids in an inaccessible spot, such as in the front of the room or in another room (exception: open -book tests) Must refuse to assist other students in cheating Should encoura ge honesty and discourage dishonesty among other students May not receive/send answers from or to other students (via text, instant message, phone, email, etc.) Are not allowed to talk to each other during an examination Should place as much space between themselves and other students as possible , when necessary Are encouraged to use a blank sheet of paper placed over their work and take the initiative to prevent others from copying their work , when necessary May not leave the room and return to the test o r hand test/papers to faculty/proctor without express permission Institutional Policies Page 25 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Students speaking to one another or appearing to engage in academic dishonesty during an exam will have their exams confiscated, will receive an automatic zero for the examination, and may be subject to disciplinary actions. For more information, see the SCNM Student Handbook , Integrity , and Academic Honesty . Final Examinations Final examinations will be conducted at the conclusion of every quarter during the period (s) designated in the academic calendar. Courses that conclude prior to the end of the quarter will conduct final exams during the final week of the course. A final examination schedule for campus - based courses specifying days and times for each course will b e established and published each quarter by the Academic Coordinator. All final examinations must be conducted according to the schedule. Exceptions to this schedule are only made for conflicts that may arise for students, for required or approved take -hom e final exams, online distance learning exams , or for special projects that will be due during the appropriate period set by the faculty member. A student may not take an examination at other than the designated time without petitioning and being granted p ermission to do so by the faculty member under the Special Exam policy. The appropriate form is available electronically on MySCNM. Special Exam ination Fee(s) apply. (See Tuition and Fees .) Missed Examinations Students are expected to sit for all examinations at the scheduled time and day or complete examinations by the published deadline . This includes didactic and clinical exams, quizzes , assessments (tests) , midterms, and finals. A student may be eligible, depending on course syllabus specificat ions, to reschedule a missed test, if due to an excused absence approved by the Dean of Students due to an extenuating circumstance out of the student's immediate control . Medical or docum entation other documentation from a neutral third party may be required by the Dean of Students to verify the situation , as deemed necessary. Requests to reschedule tests for unexcused absences will be sol ely at the discretion of the faculty member and may be refused if deemed not wi thin the set paramete rs of the course syllabus . Once a student receives an excused absence f rom the Dean of Students, they may reach out to faculty directly to reschedule the missed test at a mutually conv enient time . The format of the exam will be determi ned by the faculty member, subject to any ADA testing accomm odations required by law. Students who are not permitted to make up a missed examination and believe they were not provided fair treatment by the faculty member can utilize the normal grade appea l and/or grievance procedures. Competency Examinations Students may request to take a competency examination for select course transfer credit if a similar course has been completed more than seven ( 7) years prior to the start of the course . Competency exa minations must be requested and approved prior to matriculation. Competency e xams for all first-quarter courses must be completed prior to matriculation; all other competency exams for courses must be completed prior to the start of quarter two. Eligibility is determined on a case -by-case basis by the Registrar's Office, in conjunction with the faculty and the acad emic dean. A syllabus or other relevant documentation is required to determine eligibility. The competency examination appl ies only to the course requested and may not be used for another course. Students may request to take a competency exam by submitting a request to Admissions or the Registrar's Offi ce. Students may attempt a competency examination only once per approved course. If a s tudent fails the competency examination, the student must complete the course. Course credit given through passing a competency examination may be reflected as transfer credit or grade of \"S\" Satisfactory on the transcript. Competency Examination Fee(s) ap ply ( see Tuition and Fees ). Clinical credits are not eligible for competency examinations. Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress SCNM is committed to excellence in educational quality and learning outcomes by providing a supportive academic environme nt to students. Federal regulations require SCNM to develop and apply a consistent policy of academic progress, which includes a quantitative measure (credit hours completed) as well as a qualitative measure (grade point average). To make satisfactory acad emic progress, SCNM students must take and successfully complete a cumulative number of required credits by the end of every calendar year and maintain a minimum career GPA (see Satisfactory Academic Progress for the prescribed program of study ). Failure t o maintain either of these requirements will result in a student being placed on academic probation and/or being academically dismissed (see Good Academic Standing for more information ). Institutional Policies Page 26 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog At Risk for Unsatisfactory Academic Progress SCNM students have the r esponsibility to recognize when they are experiencing academic difficulties and to initiate requests for assistance. Students are encouraged to seek assistance from their faculty members and the SCNM Student Success Center . When a student's c ourse attendan ce, demonstrated competence, and/or rate of academic progress indicates he or she is not succeeding in a course, the faculty member may discuss the situation with the student and report the student's concerns to the Dean of Students. The Dean of Students will then connect the student with the appropriate resources to support their success. These may include but are not limited to, support from peer mentors, advisors, tutoring services, and counseling. Grading Scale Policy Faculty members are required to provide students with a course syllabus that outlines course requirements, including methods of evaluation that assess mastery of course content. Core courses in the ND program will be graded A/B/C/F ; clinical clerkships and lab/medicinary posts are graded satisfactory/ unsatisfactory (S/U). S/U graded courses have no effect on GPA and are noted in the course syllabus. Core courses in the MS program will be graded A/B/F . Please note, faculty are no t required to round up grades to higher grade scales irrespective of relative percentages. Faculty may also adjust a final letter grade depending on extenuating circumstances while maintain ing the academic integrity and learning objectives of the course. Grade Point Averages The Grade Point Average (GPA ) for each quarter is calculated by multiplying the point value of the grade received (see the following table) by the number of credits for each course. To calculate the GPA, add the credits, then add the grade points and divide the total points by the total credits. The same principle applies to the cumulative GPA reflected on the transcript. If a course is repeated, all grades earned are used in determining the GPA. Grades received at another institution ar e not included in the SCNM GPA . Grades specific to the Doctorate of Naturopathic (ND) program are indicated next to the grade . Grades specific to the Master of Science (MS) program are indicated next to the grade . Grade Description Points Percentage A Outstanding 4 90-100% B Very Good 3 80-89% C (ND) Average 2 70-79% F (ND) F (MS) Fail Fail 0 0 Less than 70% Less than 80% AU Audit Taken I Incomplete Additional work required I/R Incomplete/ Remediate Additional work required S (ND) Satisfactory Pass/Credit earned U (ND) Unsatisfactory Fail/No credit earned T Transfer Graduate transfer WD Withdrew Withdrew passing WF Withdrew failing Withdrew failing WV Waived Requirements waived WIP Work in Progress Continuing course Grade of Fail or Unsatisfactory A grade of Fail (F)/Unsatisfactory (U)/Withdrawal Fail (WF) can seriously affect the student's academic progress and the student's eligibility for financial aid. A U/F/WF in a prerequisite for other courses precludes the student from entering those courses until the U/F/WF has been rectified. In order to rectify t he grade of U/F/WF, the course must be repeated at the next available offering in the student's prescribed program of study (with the exception of selectives). A course may be repeated one time only. Both the original U/F/WF and the grade given in the repe ated course appear on the student's transcript. If a second U/F/WF is earned for the repeated course, the student m ay be academically dismissed. (See Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal for prescribed program of study.) Grade of Incomplete A grade of Incomplete is given by faculty teaching the didactic course/clerkship when a student has satisfactorily completed 70% of the course and its requirements as stipulated in the syllabus but is unable to complete the course during the term enrolled, and only if the student has a legitimate extenuating circumstance (i.e., serious illness, bereavement, or circumstances beyond the student's control). The Grade of Incomplete request form is required and submitted to the faculty for didactic courses. A legitim ate reason must be corroborated by communication with the Dean of Students and/or Academic Advisor and faculty teaching the course. Incompletes for ND clinical clerkship s will follow the Incomplete/Make -up Policy and process outlined in the SCNM Clinical H andbook. Institutional Policies Page 27 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog The student must complete the course/clerkship requirements by the Friday prior to the start of the next quarter unless an extension is granted by the faculty member who has also informed the Registrar's Office of the extension deadline. For cours es held in an intensive format or during the break, outstanding requirements must be completed by the end of the 2nd week following the conclusion of the course unless otherwise specified by faculty. All incompletes must have a final grade submitted by the faculty member no later than the end of the following quarter (please refer to course syllabus) with the exception of documented medical or military leave. (See Medical Leave of Absence or Military Leave of Absence. ) It is the responsibility of the studen t to c reate a completion plan with the faculty , to be approved by the APPC, identifying when all work will be completed and submitted to the faculty. The plan must have a deadline of the end of the standard break period or be approved, in advance, by the A PPC. Upon submission of the completed work, the faculty member submits a grade change to the Registrar's Office, convertin g the Incomplete to a letter grade. If the student does not meet the deadline, the Incomplete will automatically be conve rted to a fin al grade of Fail or Unsatisfactory. Students on documented Medical LOA or Military LOA may carry the Incomplete for four academic quarters. If the student on Medical or Military LOA does not return to courses within four quarters, the Incomplete will chang e to Withdrawal. Grade Reports Grade reports are available within two weeks of the end of the quarter for the prescribed program of study . Grades are considered a part of the student's educational record and will not be released to anyone other than the st udent or authorized school official or posted in any personally identifiable form. Grade reports are available upon reques t through the Registrar's Office and online through MySCNM. Grade Appeal Procedures Grade appeals must be initiated no later than two (2) business days from when a course's final grade is posted . Final grades are posted to the Student Services, Academic Records section in MySCNM. Instructors may post grades at any time following completion of coursework. All final grades should be posted no later than the Wednesday following the close of the quarter. Students should consider only the following evidence when initiating a grade appeal: Final grade inc luded a miscalculation of the overall course grades or final exam Final grade deviated from the assignment /calculation of course grades as outlined in the course syllabus First Appeal The student must submit an appeal in writing to the course faculty withi n two (2) business days of the posted grade. The first stage of a grade appeal process will be a meeting between the student and the course faculty. At that time, the student will have an opportunity to voice concern(s) about the grade received. The course faculty may elect to obtain additional information to further evaluate the student's concern(s) and will decide whether to maintain the original grade or submit a grade change form to the Registrar 's Office . A written notification of the decision will be provided to the student from the faculty within two (2) business days. Note, if the faculty is unavailable for the first ap peal, the process will proceed to the next step. Final Appeal If the grade appeal is denied by the course faculty, the student may ap peal in writing to the next level supervisor \u2014 the appropriate Department Chair , Division Director , or Dean (DC, DD, Dean ) within two (2) business days of notification of denial from course faculty. Should the course faculty also be the DC or DD , the student may make the second appeal to the DD or Dean , respectively . The DC, DD, or Dean may make a decision regarding the grade appeal with o r without meeting with the student directly. If a meeting is granted, the DC, DD, or Dean may also request the course faculty be present for this meeting. The student will again have an opportunity to voice concern(s) about the grade received. The DC, DD, or Dean will have the chance to review the criteria by which the final grade is determined. The DC, DD, or Dean may elect to obtain additional information to further evaluate the student's concern(s) and will decide whether to maintain the original grade o r submit a grade change form to the Registrar 's Office . A written notification of the decision will be provided to the student within two (2) business days. Academic Standing & Probation Good Academic Standing Good academic standing is defined as a student who is making forward progress in their prescribed Program o f Study while maintaining a cumulative GPA at or abo ve the minimum cumulative GPA requirement for their program . (See Cumulative GPA Requirement for the prescribe d program of study .) First Academic Probation A student is subject to the first level academic pro bation (Probation I) if any of the following occur: The student's cumulative GPA falls below the minimum cumulative GPA requirement for their prescribed program of study . (See Cumulative GPA Requirement for prescribed program of study .) Institutional Policies Page 28 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog The student does not meet the minimum academic requirements . (See Minimum Academic Requirements for prescribed program of study.) The student fails a course duri ng their enrollment at SCNM . Students placed on first academic probation will receive notification from the Registrar's Office, along with a notation on their transcript, and will be required to meet with an Academic Advisor for recommendations on how to i mprove their academic performance. Students are encouraged to meet with the Dean of Students to obtain additional academic assistance. A student whose cumulative GPA (CGPA) projections shows an inability to recover from a low CPGA in subsequent terms may b e subject to dismissal or an Administrative Leave of Absence after being placed on the first level of probation . Second Academic Probation Students are placed on a second and final level of academic probation (Probation II) if any of the following occur: The student's cumulative GPA falls below the minimum cumulative GPA requirement for their prescribed program of study . (See Cumulative GPA Requirement for prescribed program of study .) The student does not meet the minimum academic requirements . (See Minim um Academic Requirements for prescribed program of study .) The student fails a course after being placed on the first level of academic probation . Students placed on academic probation for the second time will receive notification from the Registrar's Offi ce, along with a notation on their transcript, and will be requ ired to meet with an Academic Advisor and the Dean of Students to discuss an academic agreement intended to improve performance. An Academic Advisor will report recommendations to the APPC to review and make additional recommendations as deemed necessary. A student whose cumulative GPA (CGPA) projection shows an inability to recover from a low CPGA in subsequent terms may be subject to dismissal or Administrative Leave of Absence after being placed on the second level of academic probation . Students on the first or second levels of academic pr obation who plan to continue the program at SCNM will be requ ired to complete an Academic Agreement during their meeting with an Academic Advisor . If the student is unable to continue in their prescribed program of study, the student may be placed on an Administrative Leave of Absence (ALOA) and may not be eligible for financial aid. The stud ent may be eligible to reenter their prescribed program o f study as determined by the APPC and SCNM's ALOA policy. (See Administrative Leave of Absence policy.) The Aca demic Probation notation remains on the student's transcript indefinitely. Students return to good academic standing when their cumulative GPA returns to the minimum required as outlined in the Academic Coursework section or higher and/or they pass previou sly failed course(s) per the Standard s of Academic Progress Policy . Academic Suspension A student may be subject to suspension due to the sa me reasons as academic dismissal (see Academic Dismissal policy). The APPC makes the decision for suspension or perm anent academic dismissal. Except where prior approval has been granted by the Dean of Students, a suspended or dismissed student will not participate in any SCNM - sponsored activities and will be barred from the College 's property during the suspension peri od and/or after dismissal. Academic Dismissal Students demonstrating unsatisfactory academic progress will be considered for dismissal. After being placed on academic probation for the second time, a student will be considered for dismissal if any of the f ollowing occur: The student's cumulative GPA falls below the minimum cumulative GPA requirement for their prescribed program of study . (See Cumulative GPA Requirement for prescribed program of study .) The student does not meet the minimum academic requirem ents (See Minimum Academic Requirements for prescribed program of study.) The student fails a course after being placed on the second level of academic probation The student fails the same course for the second time during any portion of their enrollment a t SCNM (a course includes any didactic or clinical course in the prescribed program of study) At any time in the program, SCNM reserves the right to dismiss a student when their academic record is deemed unsatisfactory. Likewise, a student whose total reco rd shows considerable ability and marked improvement may be given special consideration. Students may be subject to disciplinary actions, including suspension and dismissal, for failure to follow the Code of Student Professional Conduct and Academic Honor policies as outlined in the Student Handbook (see Student Handbook). Students subject to dismissal will receive a letter from the Registrar's Office. A copy of this letter will be for warded to the Dean of Students, Academic Policy and Progre ss Committee, appropriate academic Dean, and the Vice President of Academic Affairs . Institutional Policies Page 29 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Dismissal Appeal Process The student will be informed that they have five (5) business days in which to request an appeal to the APPC regarding dismissal. The student will receive a written notification from the Dean of Students regarding the outcome of the appeal. The Dean of Students will communicate this decision to the Dean of Naturopathic Medicine or the Dean of Nutritio n. The student will have five (5) business days t o appeal in writing to the Dean associated with their program (or their delegate), whose decision is final. While pending appeal for di smissal, a student may not enroll in or attend any courses, may not participate in any SCNM -sponsored activities, and will be barred from SCNM's property unless permission is given by the Dean of Students. Students who have been dismissed will not be readmitted to the college under any circumstances. Academic Honor List A full -time student who is enrolled in at least 12 didactic credits for the ND program or 4 didactic credits for the MS progra m and earns a quarter GPA of 4.0 shall be placed on the honor list for that quarter and will receive a letter from the Dean of the program . Students are not eligible for the honor list in any quarter in which they receive an Incomplete or a Fail/Unsatisfa ctory grade. When an Incomplete is resolved, however, otherwise eligible students shall be added retroactively to the academic honor list fo r that quarter. Student Course Evaluations Course evaluation s provide opportunities for the improvement of instructi onal methodology and the enhancement of the learning environment. Students are encouraged to complete evaluations near the end of each course . The Academic Affairs Department tabulates the information from these evaluations and p osts the aggregated results to MySCNM. Transcripts A transcript is a student's official academic record of courses taken and grades earned. An official transcript will bear the signature of the Registrar as well as the official SCNM seal and will be mailed directly to the address provided by the student. An unofficial transcript issued by SCNM is marked \"unofficial.\" The degree earned by the student at SCNM is recorded on the transcript after confe rral of the degree and completion of all graduation requirements for the prescribed pr ogram of study . Students are considered to be in good academic standing unless noted. The academic status of a student (such as suspended, academic dismissal, etc.), will be noted on the transcript. Students may obtain unofficial transcripts via MySCNM. SCNM has contracted with Parchment for official transcript request processing. To request official transcripts be sent to other institutions, students should use the following link to access MySCNM , Academic Records page, fee applies: https://www.parchment.com/u/registration/32844185/acc ountor (see Non-course -specific Charges ).

Naturopathic medicine attempts to find the underlying cause of the patient's condition rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. Naturopathic doctors cooperate with all other branches of medical science, referrin g pati ents to other practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are primary care physician s clinically trained in natural therapeutics with a philosophy derived in part from a Hippocratic teaching more than 2,000 years o ld: vis medicatrix naturae \u2014nature is the healer of all diseases. Their practice is based on the same basic bio - medical science foundation as that of allopathic pra ctice. However, their philosophies and approaches differ considerably from their conventional counterparts. Naturopathic doctors diagnose disease and treat pati ents by using natural modalities such as physical manipulation, clinical nutrition, herbal medicine, homeopathy, counseling, acupuncture, and hydrotherapy, among others. They choose treatme nts based on the individual patient, not based on the generality of symptoms. This approach has proven successful in treating both chronic and acute conditions. The precepts that guide the practice of naturopathic medicine include the Seven Principles of N aturopathic Medicine, The Therapeutic Order, and The Components o f Patient Centered Care. Naturopathic Principles These seven principles guide the therapeutic methods and modalities of naturopathic medicine. First Do No Harm primum non noc ere Naturopathic medicine uses therapies that are safe a nd effective. The Healing Power of Nature vis medicatrix naturae The human body possesses the inherent ability to restore health. The physician's role is to facilitate this process with the aid of natura l, nontoxic therapies. Discover and Treat the Cause, Not Just the Effect tolle causam Physicians seek and treat the underlying cause of a disease. Symptoms are viewed as expressions of the body's natural attempt to heal. The origin of disease is removed or treated so the patient can recover. Treat the Whole Person tolle totum The multiple factors in health and disease are considered while treating the whole person. Physicians provide f lexible treatment programs to meet individual health care needs . The Physician Is a Teacher doc ere The physician's major role is to educate, empower, and motivate patients to take responsibility for their o wn health.

Fam Med 2002;34 (9):644 -5 Licensure At the time of this printing, 22 states, the District of Columbia, the U .S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U .S. Virgin Islands, and five Canadian provinces have lice nsing laws for naturopathic physicians. In these states naturopathic physicians are required to graduate from an approved four -year naturopathic medical school and pass extensive postdoctoral board exam inations in order to receive a license. The North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) administers and provides the Naturopathic Physician Licensing Examination (NPLEX) which is comprised of biomedical science and clinical science examinations that are used in North America to license graduates of approved naturopathic medical schools. Once licensed, naturopathic physicians must practice within a specific scope of practice defined by their state's law s and fulfill state -mandated continuing medic al education requirements annually. It is the responsibility of the student/graduate to determine the licensure laws or scope of practice in the state in which they intend to practice. Naturopathic physicians practicing in the state of Arizona enjoy one of the broadest scopes of practice within the United States. The state of Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board (NPMB) regulates the practice of naturopathic medicine in the state of Arizona. This includes applications and fees for students planning to enter clinical training and new graduates applying for licensure. For more information about licensure in Arizona, contact: Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board 1740 W est Adams , Suite 3002, Phoenix, AZ 85007 Tel: (602) 542 -8242 | www.aznd.gov For more information about licensure in the United States and its territories, contact: American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AAN P) 300 New Jersey Ave N orthwest , Suite 900, Washington, DC 20001 Tel: (202)-237-8150 www.naturopathic.org For more information about licensure in Canada, contact: Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors (CAND) 20 Holly St reet, Suite 200 , Toronto, Ontario, CAN M4S 3B1 Tel: (800) 551-4381 | www.cand.ca For information about licensing examinations for the U.S. and CA., including NPLEX, contact: North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) 9220 Southwest Barbur Boulevard , IntegrityTreat the Pathology Naturopathic Asse ssment ND Program Information Page 43 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Scope of Practice As Arizona maintains one of the widest scopes of prac tice in the United States for naturopathic medicine, the physicians practice general medicine and utilize a wide variety of therapeutics including diet and lifestyle modifications, nutritional supplement ation, botanical medicine, homeopathy, counseling, mind -body medicine, oriental medicine, acupuncture, naturopathic manipulative ther apies, physical medicine, hydrotherapy, minor surgery, prolotherapy, IV micronutrient therapy, and pharmacotherapy. The SCN M Medical Center and Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine offer opportunities for students to work with a diverse group of medical practitioners including naturopathic physicians , medical doctor s, an Oriental medical doctor, acupuncturists, neurof / biofeedback specialists, and cranial sacral therapists . SCNM is committed to providing students diverse clinical settings to deliver patient care. In addition to clinical clerkships at the SCNM Medical Center and Neil Riordan Center for Regenerati ve Medicine , SCNM physicians and students provide care to underserved patient populations a t a variety of community clinics. These clinics are staffed by faculty members who oversee both the students' education and the patients' care. The community clinics provide students access to a broad range of patient populations an d disease conditions not regularly seen at the SCNM medical facilities . (For a list of these clinics, see Extended Sites Community Clinics .) The legal aspects of practicing naturopathic medicine vary by state in the U nited States and by province in Canada. In those states and provinces in which naturopathic physician s are licensed, NDs may see patients for general healthcare and for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and ch ronic conditions. Their scope of practice may include nutritional science; botanical medicine; naturopathic manipulative therapies and other physical medicine; mind -body prescripti ve authority, including immunizations; and all methods of laboratory, x -ray, and clinical diagnoses. The state of Arizona offers one of the widest scopes of practice for naturopathic physicians in the United States. Practicing Without a License In Arizona , practicing naturopathic medicine without a license involves the diagnosis or treatment of any patient by an unsupervised naturopathic medical student or any other unlicensed person where money may or may not be exchanged. Arizona Revised Statutes (ARS Ti tle 32) defines practicing without a license as any conduct involving the unauthorized, intended, or perceived practice of any of the healing arts, including but not limited to the unauthorized practice of naturopathic medicine or other healing arts, regar dless of whether the violation ultimately results in conviction or prosecution under relevant laws, and regardless of whether the violation results in any sanction o r other formal or informal action by any administrative or regul atory body outside the Coll ege.

If at any time the student can no longer meet these technical standards or requires additiona l accommodations, the Dean of Students must be notified immediately .: Observation Students must be able to observe demonstrations, conduct experiments, and tolerate normal odors associated with the basic sciences, including, but not limited to: anatomic dissections of preserved tissues and cadavers, microbiologic cultures, microscopic studies of microorganisms, and animal and human tissues in normal and pathologic states. A student must be able to observe patients accurately at a reasonable distance and close at h and noting non-verbal as well as verbal signals. Specic observational requirements ND Admissions Page 46 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog include , but are not li mited to the following abilities: detecting and identifying signicant changes in colors of fluids, culture media, and dipstick tests; perceiving with acuity and accurately discriminating ndings on x -rays and other imaging tests; efficiently reading writt en and illustrated material; observing intracellular details; through a microscope ; observing demonstrations in the classroom, including projected slides, films, videos, and overheads; observing and differentiating changes in body movement ; observing anato mic structures; discriminating numbers and patterns associated with diagnostic instruments and tests, such as sphygmomanometers and electrocardiograms; and competently using instruments such as the otoscope, ophthalmoscope, microscope, and stethoscope. Communication Students must be able to actively listen and relate effectively and sensitively to patients of all genders, ages, races, lifestyles, sexual orientations, and cultural backgrounds and be able to convey a sense of compassion and empathy. Students must be able to observe and clearly communicate with patients in order to elicit information, accurately describe changes in mood, activity, and posture ; and be able to perceive verbal as well as nonverbal communications. Communication includes speech as well as reading and writing. Medical education presents exceptional challenges in the volume and breadth of required reading and the necessity to impart information to others. Students must be able to communicate quickly and effectively in oral and written English with all members of the health care team. Specic requirements inc lude, but are not limited to the following abilities: communicating rapidly and clearly with the medical team during a case report, eliciting a thorough history from patients, and communicating complex ndings in appropriate terms to patients and to variou s members of the health care team. Students must learn to recognize and promptly respond to emotions such as sadness, worry, and agitation, as well as a lack of comprehension of physician communication. Students must be able to read and record observation s and plans, legibly, efficiently and accurately in documents such as the patient record. Students must be able to prepare and communicate concise and complete summaries of individual encounters. Students must be able to complete forms manually and on the computer keyboard, according to directions, in a complete and timely fashion. Sensory and motor function Students must be able to perform a complete physical exam of patients with acuity, accuracy, facility, and compassion on patients of all genders u tilizing palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. In general, this requires sufficient ability to observe with acuity and process visual, auditory, exteroceptive (smell, touch, pain, and temperature), and proprioceptive (position , pressure, movement, stereognosis, and vibratory) phenomena accurately, as well as the ability to manipulate patients, medical instruments, and equipment with precision at a fine level of movement. Methods of surgical instruction include practice on livin g or preserved animal tissues. A student should be able to provide general care and emergency treatment to patients in a timely manner. Examples of such emergency treatment reasonably required of physicians include responding quickly when called, initiating cardiopulmonary resuscitation , administering intravenous medication, applying pressure to stop bleeding , opening obstructed airways, suturing wounds, and performing other basic male and female and other physical maneuvers. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation may require moving an adult pati ent, repeatedly applying considerable chest pressure, delivering an adequate volume of articial respiration, and calling for help. A student should be able to learn to perform basic l aboratory tests, e.g., urinalysis, completed blood count, and diag nost ic and therapeutic procedures, e.g., phlebotomy, acupuncture, minor surgery and arthrocentesis. Students must be able to measure angles and diameters of various body structures using tape measure and goniometer, measure blood pressure and pulse, and interpret graphs describing biologic relationships. Students must have strength, coordination, and ability to use the torso and limbs to position oneself and skillfully and successfully perform common naturopathic manual procedures and techniques. Intellectua l, conceptual, integrative, and quantitative abilities These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis, judgement, and syntheses. The student must also be able to recognize letters and numbers quickly and accurately. Clinical reasonin g and problem solving, critical skills demanded of physicians, require all of these intellectual abilities and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situations. Moreover, the effective physician often must deal with several tasks or problems simultaneously. ND Admissions Page 47 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Students must be able to identify signicant ndings from history, physical examination, and laboratory data; provide a reasoned explanation for likely diagnoses; construct a reasoned and cost -effective diagnostic plan; and prescribe medi cations and therapy, recalling and retaining information in an efficient manner. Students must be able to identify and communicate the limits of their knowledge to others when appropriate. The ability to incorporate new information from peers, teachers, and medical literature in formulating diagnoses and plans is essential. Good judgment in patient assessment, diagnostic, and therapeutic planning is essential. Behavioral and social attributes Empathy, integrity, honesty, concern for others, good interpers onal skills, interest, and motivation are all required personal qualities. Students must be able to fully utilize their intellectual abilities, exercise good judgment, and promptly complete all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patie nts in all clinical and academic settings. They must be able to develop mature, professional, and effective relationships with patients of all genders, ages, races, lifestyles, sexual orientations, and cultural ba ckgrounds, as well as with their families, with other health care pr oviders, and with all members of the learning and working community. At times this requires the ability to be aware of and appropriately react to one's own immediate emotional responses. For example, students must maintain a profes sional demeanor and be able to function at a high level in the face of personal fatigue, dissatised patients and their families, and tired colleagues. Students must be able to develop professional relationships with patients and their families, providin g comfort and reassurance when appropriate while protecting patient condentiality.

Selectives may only be added up through week one of a quarter and in week two with the permission of the instructor (some exceptions may apply). Clinical Clerkships Clinical clerkships do not follow the same add/drop policy as didactic courses noted above ; clinical students must refer t o the Clinical Handbook regarding policy for adding and dropping clerkships. (See Add/Drop Refund Policy.) An add/drop fee will be charged for any clerkship ch anges after the clinic add/drop period has ended (see Tuition and Fees). Students are not able to drop clerkships after the clinical add/drop period without approval from the APPC. Students awaiting decisions are required to attend assigned clerkships and meet current clinic policies until otherwise notified in writing. ND Academic Policies Page 52 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog NPLEX Board Examinations The li censing of naturopathic physicians to practice medicine is a function of an individual state or pro vince. The states and provinces that license naturopathic physicians recognize the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE), which certifies ca ndidates as eligible to register for the licensing exam that is administered as the Naturopathic Physicians Licensure Examination (NPLEX) . It is the student's responsibility to be familiar with NABNE and NPLEX policies and procedures. SCNM considers the NP LEX Parts I and II to be significant measures of professional achievement toward becoming a naturopathic physician. Student performance on the NPLEX provides the faculty and administration an external measure of the level of understanding students have in a broad number of subject areas. This performance offers SCNM important information on curricular content and teaching methodology. Student scores also provide SCNM and the patients they see with a level of assurance that they can perform with basic compet ency as student physicians. To qualify for the NPLEX Part I, students must have satisfactorily completed all basic science coursework, including GNMD 6044, be currently enrolled or on an approved leave of absence, and be certified by the Registrar's Office as eligible to sit for the exam. NPLEX Part I Students are required to take NPLEX Part I to be eligible to participate in the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine clinical training program. Students must take the NPLEX Part I at the first offering of the exam immediately following their 8th quarter in the 4 -year POS and 12th quarter in the 5 -year POS or completion of the basic science courses, including GNMD 6044, whichever comes first. Students who do not pass NPLEX Part I must take it again at the next offeri ng. Students who do not take NPLEX I at the next offering will be dropped from the following quarter's clinical clerkships and may no t be allowed to continue in clinical clerkships until they have taken NPLEX I. In order to register for future clinical clerkships, all students must submit the original examination results from NABNE to the Registrar's Office each time it is taken. Appeals to any part of this process follow the norma l SCNM grievance procedures. This policy applies to all ND students, includin g professional transfer students. NPLEX Part II Passing NPLEX Part II examination is not a graduation requirement of SCNM, but it is required to become licensed. Students should be aware that NABNE may modify its policies and procedures at any time. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of NABNE/NPLEX policies and procedures. Satisfactory Academic Progress - Completion The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) program is designed to be completed in four calendar years or 15 academic quarters (five calendar years or 19 academic quarters for the 5 -year track). Students who deviate from the standard academic program will extend the length of the program. Satisfactory academic progress in the ND program is defined as passing all program requirements wit hin the maximum timeframe of one and one -half (1.5) times the length of the longest published program in which they are enrolled, from initial date of matriculation and including any and all leaves of absence and periods of withdrawal followed by re -activa tion. Generally, this is between 6 -7.5 years. Credits transferred from an approved institution cou nt toward the minimum academic requirements to be completed at the end of each academic year (see Minimum Academic Requirements) and count toward the maximum completion time for financial aid. Students must make satisfactory progress toward the completion of their degre e at SCNM to be eligible for most financial aid programs. Students must earn a minimum number of credits per quarter (see Minimum Academic Requi rements) . The Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy for the ND program includes a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher, minimum academic credits earned per term , and maximum timeframe for completion. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress for their prescribed program of study in any term will be given an academic warning and will be placed on academic probation .

ND Academic Coursework Page 56 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog ND Academic Coursework The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Program at SCNM is a cohort -based program tha t follows a prescribed track. All academic credit is computed in quarter hours (see Credit Equivalence ). All students are guided by the curriculum as outlined in their prescribed program of study. Students are pre-registered for core courses, including lab s and clinical clerkships. Students may not deviate from their prescribed program of study. SCNM reserves the right to make curriculum changes that are applicable to all students, if necessary. Students are admitted to either a 4 - or 5-year track program. The 4 -year track offers students a traditional path to graduation. The 5 -year track offers support for students who may want more time to complete the basic and pre -clinical sciences by distribut ing the first year of basic sciences and pre-clinical medicin e courses across two years. The remaining 3 years of both the 4 - and 5 -year tracks of the ND curriculum are the same. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress on the 4 -year track may be transitioned into the 5 -year track. Students cannot move to the 5 -year track after completion of year 1 of the 4 -year track. In addition , students cannot move back to the 4 -year track after starting the 5 -year track without approval from the Academic Policy and Progress Committee (APPC ). If a student stays on track with the program, taking all courses as they are offered in sequence, students can expect to graduate within 15 consecutive quarters, or four calendar years, if on the 4 -year track (or 19 consecutive quarters , or five calendar years, if on t he 5 -year track). After matriculation, approval by APPC is required for trac k changes. For a detailed list of required courses, see the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Program of Study . First Calendar Year (First Two Calendar Years in the Five -Year Track ) The first calendar year begins with the basic medical science curriculum in the study of biochemistry and normal structures and functions of the body, including anatomy and physiology. This material is organized by systems. Courses in research and the na turopathic modalities, history, and philosophy are introduced; and early clinical experiences begin with an introduction to clinical practice. These experiences include opportunities to work with standardized patients in clinical settings and shadow physi cians in private practice during field observation. (See Five -Year Track Program of Study for outline of courses .) Second Calendar Year (Third Calendar Year in the Five-Year Track) The second calendar year continues the basic medical science curriculum and focuses on the body's pathological transitions through disease, along with clinical recognitio n of these processes using physical, clinical, and lab dia gnosis. Courses in the naturopathic modalities such as nutri tion, mind -body medicine, homeopathy, and O riental medicine are explored during the second year. Third and Fourth Calendar Years (Fourth and Fifth Calendar Years in the Five -Year Track) In the final two calendar years, clinical methods of naturopathic medicine are presented and expanded in both the classroom and the clinical setting. Students have the opportunity to work with various patient populations at the SCNM Medical Center, Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine , and SCNM affiliated sites . In the final academic year of the program, stu dents concentrate on clinical training and take fewer didactic credits. Selectives SCNM offers selectives, or required electives, in the naturopathic medical degree program as part of the core curriculum. Selectives are advertised prior to registration, and an enrollment of ten students is required before most selective s will be offered (see Adding and Dropping Courses for prescribed program of study).

The multidisciplinary courses incor porate training in clinical biochemistry, physiology, pathophysiology, microbiomics, nutrients, botanicals, and therapeutic dietary patterns. Emphasis is placed upon understanding the body's metabolic pathways for macronutrients and micronutrients ; the use of food, nutrients, and botanicals in health and disease ; and the responsible use of dietary and herbal supplements . Critical analyses of the current evidence for nutritional and supplemental interventions are emphasized, and self -care practices are used both to apply didactic learning and to promote personal sustainability . . MSCN Program Information Page 99 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Nutrition Program The M aster of Science in Clinical Nutrition (MS CN) degree program transforms students who are passionate about nutrition into leaders and healers in the field of clinical nutrition . Students gain the professional knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to develop and implement effective and evidence -based nutrition -related services to support individual and public health. The innovative and 100% online curriculum has been developed with input from experts and thought leaders in the field of nutrition. The MSCN trains students in nu tritional sciences, self -care, whole food nutrition, and the responsible use of die tary supplements while also covering emerging topics such as nutrigenomics and microbiomics. Additionally, the program includes a novel Virtual Health Center experience wher e students practice applying new skills and knowledge safely in a virtual training environment. Graduates will be prepare d for success in private clinical practice or to be employed in integrative practices, community health, or corporate settings. The pro gram also introduces students to innovative ways to leverage their training from developing a telemedicine practice to becoming an entrepreneur in the multi -billion -dollar natural foods and dietary supplement industry. In addition to their MSCN degree, opp ortunities to earn industry -specific certifications are embedded within the curriculum to help students increase their competence and further distinguish themselves in their field. Program Mission To educate and inspire the next generation of leaders and practitioners in the field of clinical nutrition to use evidenc e- based practices to safely, ethically, and effectively enhance the health and well -being of the people and communities they serve. Scope of Practice Requirements for the practice of nutrition vary from state to state (and country to country), with a wide range of certification types available. Currently, the state of Arizona has no regulation for Dietetics and Nutrition practice. There is currently no licensure law in this state outli ning restrictions and/or regulations for the field of nutrition. Graduates of the MSCN program may wish to work as clinicians in private or integrative practice s ettings , while others may wish to work as consultants, writers, educators, or business leaders in the food, supplement, or natural products industry. Others may opt to go on to earn a PhD or a clinical doctoral degree. The MSCN program may also supplements students' existing clinical training/credentials with expertise and an advanced degree in nutrition. According to the Center for Nutrition Advocacy, a s of June 2020 , thirteen states require a Registered Dietitian (RD) credential to practice and be licensed / registered to practice nutrition and do not offer a pathway to licensure for non - dietitian nutritionists. Thirty -three states do not have licensing requirements to practice nutrition or dietetics, though some of these states offer licensing or state certification to RDs , Certified Nutrition Specialists (CNS) , and other advanced nutritionists . Four states require licensing to perform nutrition counseling and provide a pathway to licensure for CNSs, RDs , and other advanced nutritionists. For current updates on state laws , we recommend visiting the Center for Nutrition Advocacy's website at: https://theana.org/advocate . Certification SCNM's MS CN program has been developed to meet the eligibility requirement s of several nation al board certifications, most notably the Certified Nutrition Speciali st (CNS). SCNM's MSCN program fulfills the didactic requirements to sit for the CNS certification exam offered through the Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists (BCNS). Before qualifying for CNS certification, BCNS requires a graduate degree in the field of nutrition from a regionally accredited university, specific coursework, and 1,000 hours of supervised experience . SCNM currently does not offer this post -graduate experience but plans to do so in the near future . BCNS reviews each candidate individually, including current course descriptions, transcripts, and experience to determine eligibility . To learn more about becoming a CNS, visit www.nutritionspecialists.org . The CNS credential is the most frequent, non -RD credential recognized in state nutrition regulations. The CNS is : The only non -diete tics credential and examination widely named in state nutrition licensure laws Listed by the U .S. Government's Department of Labor as an advanced nutrition credential in the definition of the \"Dietetics and Nutritionists\" profession in its Occupational Out look Handbook Listed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid as among those potentially eligible to order therapeutic diets in hospitals Fully accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) MSCN Program Information Page 100 | 2020-2021 Course Catalog Private professional associations awarding nutrition credentials currently recognized by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies include: Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists (BCNS) American Clinical Board of Nutrition (ACBN) Commission on Dietetic Registra tion (CDR) Both BCNS and CDR are recognized by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in its Occupational Handbook definition of Dietitians and Nutritionists . Since certifying organizations may change eligibility requirements, students are advised to contact the appropriate board with any questions and to verify eligibility. Students are advised to also review licensing requirements by state for the most up-to-date i nformation. Program Learning Outcomes At the conclusion of th e MSCN program, graduates will be able to: 1. Utilize knowledge of nutritional sciences to describ e the relationship between nutrients and human health and disease . 2.
