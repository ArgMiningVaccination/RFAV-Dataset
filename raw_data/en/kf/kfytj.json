However, for some patients, a clear and strong recommendation may not be enough. They may need additional information to make an informed decision. You can help by following the SHARE approach: SHARE the tailored reasons why the recommended vaccine is right for the patient given his or her age, health condition (such as diabetes), lifestyle, occupation, or other risk factors. HIGHLIGHT positive experiences with vaccines (personal or in your practice), as appropriate, to reinforce the benefits and strengthen confidence in vaccination. ADDRESS patient questions and concerns about the vaccine, including side effects, safety, and vaccine effectiveness in plain and understandable language. REMIND patients that vaccines protect them and their loved ones from many common and serious diseases. EXPLAIN the potential costs of getting the disease, including serious health effects, time lost (such as missing work or family events), and financial costs.U.S. Vaccination Rates for Adults are Low1,2 2018-2019 influenza season estimates show only 62% of adults 18 years or older with diabetes received their influenza vaccination. Among adults with diabetes, only 33% of adults 19-59 years and 15% of adults 60 years or older received their hepatitis B vaccination. Only 32% of adults 60 years or older with diabetes have received their shingles vaccination. Only 38% of adults 19 to 64 years old with diabetes have received their pneumococcal vaccination. Only 24% of adults 19 years or older with diabetes have received their Tdap vaccination in the past 10 years. 1. https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2018.html 2. https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2018_data_release.htm June 2020cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/adults Common Questions and Answers about Vaccines for Patients with Diabetes When talking to adult patients with diabetes, make a strong recommendation and allow time for them to ask questions. Hearing your answers can help patients feel more confident about protecting themselves with vaccines. Why do I need vaccines? Even if you received the vaccines you needed as a child, the protection from some vaccines can wear off. Every year, thousands of adults in the U.S. become seriously ill and are hospitalized because of diseases that vaccines can help prevent. Many adults even die from these diseases. Living with diabetes, even if well managed, can make it harder for your immune system to fight infections. People living with diabetes are at increased risk for complications from certain vaccine-preventable diseases. For example, flu can cause your blood glucose to rise to dangerously high levels.Do vaccines work? Vaccines can lower your chance of getting certain diseases. Vaccines work with your body's natural defenses to help you safely develop immunity to disease. In the U.S., vaccines have greatly reduced or eliminated many diseases that once routinely killed or harmed infants, children, and adults. However, vaccines cannot prevent all cases. Your level of protection can vary based on factors such as age or existing health conditions. Which vaccines do I need? People with diabetes need: Flu vaccine every year, to project against seasonal flu; Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to protect against meningitis and bloodstr eam infections; Hepatitis B vaccine series, to project against hepatitis B virus inf ec tion, which causes a serious liver disease; Tdap vaccine, to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, or whooping cough; and Zoster vaccine, to protect against shingles if you are 50 years or older.Are vaccines safe? Before a vaccine is approved for use in the U.S., it goes through careful testing to make sure it is safe and effective. Highly trained scientists and doctors at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluate the results of these clinical studies. FDA also inspects the sites where vaccines are made to make sure they follow strict manufacturing guidelines. Once a vaccine is licensed, FDA and CDC continue to monitor its safety. Vaccines are one of the safest ways to protect your health. What side effects can I expect? With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of side effects. The most common side effects include soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given. Severe side effects are rare. For additional information and resources on adult "}
