Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what ba sis?: Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material?: Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when L andfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: Q7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill 8 material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we mig ht clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response.: Q13: Is th ere a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: Q16: What would b e the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: Q17: Are there any issues with the 9 current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: Q18: Is t here a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use it s new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be?: Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this?: Q21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons.: Q22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?: Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support?: Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate?: Q25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: Q26: In your view, are there any 10 exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities?: Landfill funding has become a vital source of project funding for many worthwhile charitable and community projects, supporting many activities difficult to fund from other sources: this should continue. However, by its very nature, it will be destroyed by its own success, with revenues dropping as waste reduction, re -use and recycling measures increase. To continue to deliver community benefit, streamlining of administration and tightening of objectives c ould help to make money go further. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (plea se specify).: Landfill Disposals Tax revenue, if resources are to become increasingly limited, should be focused on tackling the issues directly connected to the landfilling of waste. Projects should either: i)encourage waste reduction, re -use of material s, or recycling, and/or tackle waste crime and its impacts (e.g. community composting, disposal and discouragement of fly -tipping, creating news jobs in small enterprises demonstrating innovation in re - use of waste materials) ii) help to mitigate the negat ive environmental impacts of climate change such as warming, flooding, and biodiversity loss (e.g. new woodland creation, riparian and urban tree planting, restoration of natural habitats such as blanket bog) iii) improve the quality of life and local envi ronment in those communities affected by the proximity of a landfill site iv) remediate land directly and negatively impacted by past landfill activity (where not already subject to statutory obligations) v) provide revenue costs support for organisations delivering the above objectives (essential for many smaller organisations) Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: Layers of management and complexity could be removed by having a single centrally administered fund independen t of the landfill company distributors (e.g. increase Entrust's role), with a simple application and reporting process proportionate to the level of funding sought. This would also even out the regional variations, whereby certain companies have different rules 11 and stipulations to others. A certain proportion of the annual pot could be ring -fenced for projects within 10 miles of sites (see iii above), while the remainder could be geographically unrestricted, enabling more organisations and regions to benefi t and effectively deliver the other suggested objectives. Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment?: Responses to consultations may be made public - online or in a report. If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: (Checked) 12 Reference 2 Name: Hugh Towns Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: Consistency is extremely important in order to prevent what is referred to as waste tourism. Differences in costs in Wales an d England will encourage greater cross border movements of waste and utilise landfill space much more quickly on one side of the border whilst making sites on the other side uneconomic to operate. These sites will close resulting in even greater cross bord er movements. Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: The standard rate is appropriate but the lower rate is too low to encourage a move away from landfill disposal. Increasing the lower rate would encourage greater investment in re -use, recycling higher up the waste hierarchy. Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: Yes. Waste streams that cannot technically be re -used or recycled should have a lower rate than waste streams that can be recycled. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) t hat should be considered, and on what basis?: none Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material?: The system should be as simple as possible. To encourage source segregation and best practice applications there should be zero tolerance. Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: No. Waste is waste and the system should be as simple as possible. This introduces complexity, delay and potential loopholes to be exploited. Q7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: Not aware of any Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: Not aware of any Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: It would simplify the system and make operators think about the implications before material enters a landfill site. Q10: What activities would you expect to be Importation of cell liners, capping medium, 13 exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: capping geo -membrane, restoration medium. Q11: Do you have any other sugge stions for how we might clarify the taxable and non - taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: Clear segregation Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response.: No Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: Yes. Simplify the system and charge by weight only. Operators will reduce water content or change waste transport options if its worthwhile financially. If it is financially beneficial changes will be made. Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: No Q15: What would be the practical im plications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: The obvious one is th at suddenly all weighbridges would suddenly not be functional but it would also introduce a two tier system whereby operators without access to weighbridges would be treated differently. Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the defin ition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: This is an excellent idea and it would make illegal activity much less profitable. It has to be allied with greater enforcement capability to make the chances of ge tting caught much greater. Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: It is still perceived as less expensive to get caught than to comply with the law. It must become the norm that there is never a ny financial benefit in breaking the law. Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: Most definitely. There is no substitute for boots on the ground. That is where most of our intelligence comes from. Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be?: Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this?: Probably Q21: Would you support aligning th e tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons.: Yes - simplicity 14 Q22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?: None that I am aware of especially if the tax reporting period, NRW returns and the financial year are all aligned Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support?: Look at dev eloping a single return which would go the NRW and Tax Body Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate?: No. Definitely not. It encourages bad business practice. Q25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: No Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to p ostpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: Yes there may be if its going to put a company out of business. Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities?: Yes they should. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (plea se specify).: Supporting Compliance and enforcement most definitely. Improving health and wellbeing by supporting youth groups, sports clubs and outdoor activity. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: The Aggregates Levy S ustainability Fund Model Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: No Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment?: None Responses to consultations may be made public - online or in a report.

A1: This is considered ess ential to avoid potential cross border negative impacts. Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. A2: These are considered to be appropriate but th e Welsh Government should be mindful of changes elsewhere in the UK and consider the impact of such changes. Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? A3: Yes, if there is a recognised need to do so and it would avoid future legislation. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? A4: Nothing identified . Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? A5: It would not be practical to measure or evaluate this. Q6: Would you support the intro duction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.

Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? A9: Clear legislation is required to avoid litigation. It is not considered suitably practical to tax all materials entering a waste site. Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? A10: Temporary storage of civil eng ineering materials suitable for reuse elsewhere/later. Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non-taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? A11: Clearly defined segregated areas. Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. A12: No changes identified. Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain yo ur response. A13: No changes identified. Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? A14: Nothing identified but this should be monitored in the future. Compliance and enfor cement Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty f or failure to do so? A15: Where available, they should be used. Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? A16: This is considered to be a good proposal - to follow the Scottish example to minimise illegal disposals.

It represents 86,500 qualified and student civil engineers in the UK and across the globe and has over 3,600 members in Wales. ICE has long worked with the government of the day to help it to achieve its objectives, and has worked with industry to ensure that construction and civil engineering remain major contributors to the UK economy and UK exports For further information visit www.ice.org.uk and www.ice.org.uk/wales Registered charity number 210252 Charity registered in Scotland number SC038629 Reference 4 19 Members of Tredegar Town Council would like to be assured that any amendments to current legislation would not detract from its current efforts to support environmental projects. Regards Christine Keane Town Clerk Tredegar Town Council www.tredegartowncouncil.co.uk Reference 5 20 Name: OWAIN LLOYD Organisation (if applicable): DARLOW LLOYD & SONS LTD Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: Very important , any increase or decrease in rate compared to England or Scotland could result in Wales being seen as a cheap alternative for Landfill if the rate is cheap or on the other hand encouraging people to Landfill outside its borders if the rate is too high . Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: The rate is correct . The rate was brought in to encourage people / companies to think about what we Landfill and how we can change the way we treat waste . This has worked . If there was no financial incentive to curb Landfill tonnages i believe this would not have happened . Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: There is a value in so far as you can encourage innovation in waste treatment techniques . Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis?: No Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material?: I believe that this allowance wi ll be abused and should not be allowed . Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: I would leave it as it is Q7: Are there any problems with the existing ar rangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: An information zone does encourage companies to recycle waste etc . In principle it is a good idea and does work . Q8: In your view, are th ere any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: No issues Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: All Landfills will need a weighbridge. Many operators will have issues with this . Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax ) and why?: Capping and cover materials from an information zone that is suitable for the cap but is still classified as a waste waste . Q11: Do you have any other suggestions There should be no storage on a Landfill . If you 21 for how we might clarify the taxable and non-taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: have an information zone use it . Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your respo nse.: No they are practical Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: The water discount relief works . Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: No Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: All waste to Landfill should be weighed on a calibrated weighbridge . If you do not you cannot Landfill . Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill site s to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: The question arises who is responsible for the illegal deposit . Normally the person who has illegally Land filled cannot pay the Tax and the Bill ends up with the Taxpayer . If the wast e has to be moved where does it go if its Hazardous . The Welsh Government could have a Landfill centrally located to accept any illegal deposits of Hazardous waste that has to be moved . Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so , how might they be addressed?: No issues Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: The current need for compliance testing around different wastes is adequate . To carry out the tests samples need to be taken from the site . The manager should be overlooking this . Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be?: Increase NRW inspections/ Audits to all sites . This may lead to a need for more staff . Q20: In your v iew, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this?: Since Landfill Tax was brought in the higher rate has tried to be avoided and wastes have been treated etc to comply with the lower rate . Is this avoidance or innovation . If the tax was not brought in there would be no change . Therefore the Tax has been successful . 22 Q21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons.: Yes , All of the figur es are available . Q22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?: Internally these codes are already incorporated in reporting of landfill taxation, therefore extending this to external reporting would not cause much inconvenience.

Please find below a response by the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) to the consultation document \"Landfill Disposals Tax\". Summary: BASC recommend that Welsh Government should increase the proportion of funds allocated to the wellbeing of communities from the proposed Landfill Disposals Tax. BASC recommend that the biodiversity and environmental improvements activities should be prioritised as it is at high risk of underfunding. BASC recommend that the new administrative model that Welsh Government and the Welsh Revenue Authority create ensures that those communities and third sector organisations with good projects can apply and that they can apply for multi -year biodiversity projects. Introduction to BASC and our use of the Landfill Communities Fund: 2. Shooting is worth \u00a32 billion per annum to the UK economy and supports the equivalent of 74,000 full time jobs. 3. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation is a representative body for all sporting shooting in the UK. BASC is recognised for its role by government, all the main political parties, statutory agencies and other rural non-government bo dies. 4. The Association has an annual turnover of \u00a39 million and a membership of over 140,000. This includes 1,600 affiliated clubs and syndicates. 5. BASC focuses its efforts on the guidance of public policy and political opinion, setting and promoting high standards and safety, developing opportunity and the responsible ownership of sporting firearms, while promoting practical game and wildlife conservation. 6. BASC is a Registered Society operating for the benefit of the wider community. The Association is go verned by a Council that includes up to 19 members elected from the entire membership. 7. The Association's goals are pursued by a professional staff team who work at UK, international, home country and regional levels. BASC currently employs 112 staff at He ad Office, offices in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England (four English regional offices). The staff are supported by networks of accredited coaches and trainers, teams of volunteer helpers, and specialist committees of experts. 8. BASC have had a longstanding partnership with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and predecessor organisations under our biodiversity programme, Green Shoots . Currently we have funding from NRW until 2018 to deliver 25 Wales wide benefits to water voles and red s quirrels, both section 42 species under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. 9. However BASC have used Landfill Communities Funds in England to delivery public biodiversity and climate change targets. These projects would not have taken p lace due to lack of funds from statutory agencies, in spite of strong support for them. Further details can be seen on our webpages for our water vole work in south west England and our habitat connectivity work at a landscape scale in Cheshire. http://basc.org.uk/conservation/green -shoots/ 10. Our core interests are covered by questions 27 to 29 and this response focuses on them. Detailed responses: 11. Question 27: Should Welsh Government alloca te a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? 12. BASC urge Welsh Government to allocate a proportion of the funds to the wellbeing of communities. In fact we recommend that the level of funds diverted into the equivalent Landfill Communities Fund is increased. This is because the funds available to communities and third sector organisations to undertake these types of projects are extremely limited, yet they are recognised as having high value. There are few a lternatives to be sought out if the Landfill Communities Fund ceases or dwindles. Increasing the proportion into the scheme would offset the effect of the expected reduction in taxation and so maintain or, ideally, increase the funding for the wellbeing o f communities. 13. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) 14. Although BASC recognise the importance of all these areas, we feel the area of which is at most risk of underfunding is biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. So we concur with the suggestion at 5.24 in the consultation. Welsh Government shou ld consider reviewing the rules of the Landfill Communities Fund to allow projects to occur in a greater radius from the landfill sites to avoid a restriction in benefit. In addition allowing projects to take place around historic as well as active landfi ll sites will be most fair as the long -term impacts of landfill sites last long after the site ceases to be active. 26 15. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? 16. BASC recommend that Welsh Government ensure that the current range of applicants to the Landfill Communities Fund is retained. BASC is a registered society and we have drawn down funds from SITA Trust to undertake projects which have made significant contributions to species conservation and mitigating climate chan ge. Should they be made, Welsh Government should resist any calls to restrict the Landfill Communities Fund to charities or community groups only. 17. Paragraph 5.10 outlies HMRC's interest in increasing the flow of funding to projects under the Landfill Com munities Fund. The requirement on Environmental and Distributive Bodies to spend the funds they receive quickly has, in effect, restricted the term they are allowed to make agreements with applicants. This is an issue which has a negative impact on the t ypes of projects that can be funded under the biodiversity and environment that most often require a multi -year term to produce the outputs society and government wish to achieve. 18. For example grants from the SITA Trust to BASC have been over two or three years and this has been essential to deliver the biodiversity outcomes for society and local communities. This has only been possible because the grant applied for has been allocated from a single year's budget and then ring-fenced for draw down over the term of the agreement. The impact of HMRC's direction to spend, not allocate, a greater proportion of funds provided each year means SITA Trust and other Environmental Bodies are not able agree multi -year projects. This is nonsensical from the perspectiv e of funding projects that will achieve public biodiversity targets. 19. In the administrative model, Welsh Government and the Welsh Revenue Authority should ensure that those communities and third sector organisations with good projects can apply and that th ey can apply for multi -year biodiversity projects.

Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: only recycling and upcycling of items . maybe you could explore credits for reuse of materials otherwise bound for waste .. Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non - taxable activities on a landfill sit e and what would be the practical implications of these?: 28 Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified?

Q25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxp ayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities?: definitly as these s ites have been proven to impact on the well being of local communities .. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and dep rivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: poverty and deprivation should be the priority as these sites tends to detract from these areas ... waste minimisation should also be focused upon as little progress has been made in this area other than token changes to packaging etc Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment?: Responses to consultations may be made public - online or in a report.

Object B: The reduction, prevention or mitig ation of effects of pollution that has resulted, or may result, from an activity which has now ceased. Object D: The provision, maintenance or improvement of a public park or another public amenity. Object DA: The conserv ation of a specific species or a specific habitat where it naturally occurs. Object E: The repair, maintenance or restoration of a place of worship or a place of architectural importance. Object F: The provision of financial, administrative or other simila r services by one organisation en rolled with Entrust to another. -- Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: Public and private sector landfill operators should be able to provide 100% grants. Under the present system, voluntary groups find it hard to raise t he 10% required to secure funds. Perhaps qualifying groups could be eligible for grants directly from the landfill tax revenue to bridge this gap. We support the streamlining of the administration so that a higher proportion of the money can go directly to the funded projects.

B Parry 54 Reference 20 Dear Sir/Madam, We support the use of Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) to fund wildlife charities such as the Wildlife Trusts. We believe that the Wildlife Trusts are the most efficient and cost effective way of protecting and restoring wildlife habitats, because the members are knowledgeable enthusiasts who put in their own money and time too. It will significantly reduce their resources if this funding is withdrawn, but maintaining or preferably increasing it to 10% of landfill tax, would be applauded by many as a signal that the Welsh Government cares about the biodiversity that Wales is so lucky to have. Yours faithfully, S.J.Dalton I.D.Thomas 55 Reference 21 Hi I was disturbed to see this potential cut to funding from the Landfill Communities Fund. The list below covers not only my concerns but also suggests some proactive ways forwards. o The Landfill Communities Fund is one of the few funding streams for dedicated wildlife projects. o It produces direct environmental benefits for communities living in close proximity to landfill sites o Funding wildlife projects through the Landfill Communities Fund will help Wales to meet its key wildlife targets and legal obligations o I support the use of Landfill Tax to fund charities such as the Wildlife Trust to undertake amazing projects to protect and enhance important habitats and species.

It gives me and many people like me a great deal of pleasure and I have increasing respect for the hard work and dedication of the young people from the Trust who run the Reserves and get such wonderful results. They do not do this unaided \u2014many volunteers lend a hand. It is also a great learning opportunity and no doubt an in spiration to the very young keen budding naturalists who also benefit from the facility. All in all the wildlife projects appeal to and inspire all ages and I would suggest provide a therapeutic benefit in many cases too. I understand the Landfill Communi ties Fund is one of the few funding streams for dedicated wildlife projects and I would support the use of an increased amount of the Landfill Tax to fund charities such as the Wildlife Trust to undertake projects to protect and enhance important habitats and species. This will result in benefits to the environment and the community whilst helping Wales meet its key wildlife targets and legal obligations which I believe is to halt and reverse the loss of wildlife by 2020; and to ensure all of our most impo rtant and protected sites in Wales are in a favourable condition by 2026. Yours Faithfully T Jenkins 64 Reference 25 My attention has been drawn to the fact that the Welsh Assembly is considering using the income from landfill tax for general purposes rather than giving grants to conservation bodies. Nature needs all the help it can get if is diverse and accessible. Alth ough I live in England I am a long standing member of the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and make at least one visit to Wales each year to enjoy the scenery and wildlife. I am sure that I am not the only Englishman or Scotsman who supports the Wels h tourist industry for similar reasons to mine. I would ask members of the Assembly to bear tourists in mind and increase, if anything, the financial help given to conservation bodies. I would ask them to remember that the money spent in this way is very e fficiently spent as it\u00b4s value is increased by the efforts of hundreds of volunteers who give their services for no monetary reward. I have in the past been involved in conservation volunteering, in Wales as well as in England and hope that there will cont inue to be funding to allow those young enough to give their time and obtain the unquantifiable rewards which I enjoyed as a younger man. Thank you, T Strudwick 65 Reference 26 Dear Sir/Madam, I support the use of Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) to fund charities such as the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) to undertake essential projects to protect and enhance Wales' most important habitats and species (biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvem ents). This fund is needed to try to reverse the terrible loss of wildlife including 60% of UK species being in decline and more than 1 in 10 species in the UK being under threat of extinction. At this time, when so many people are being encouraged to t ake more interest in taking exercise in the outdoors in order to improve their health, it would seem appropriate to continue to support habitat charities. For many people the opportunity to get out in the fresh air in a clean environment could make a signi ficant difference to their quality of life. With financial support from the LCF, in the last two years alone, WTSWW has restored habitats on eight sites important for wildlife, from the Teifi Marshes nature reserve in Cardigan to Parc Slip nature reserve near Bridgend. LCF funds have directly supported WTSWW's work to save threatened species such as the lapwing and marsh fritillary butterfly, protect scarce habitats such as limestone grassland and create new habitats such as the wildlife -rich arable crops and wetlands at Parc Slip. It has also supported WTSWW to work with local communities at all these sites and engage with approximately two hundred community volunteers and engage with many more at community sessions such as guided walks and wildlife events . By supporting the voluntary sector, significant added value is achieved for every pound of grant funding awarded. Yours faithfully, L Martin 66 Reference 27 Name: N A Wright Organisation (if applicable): Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: Cross border consistency is only a consideration where lower rates are likely to encourage export/import of landfill wastes with the UK. The Welsh Government should place protection of the Welsh environment and people as its highest guiding principle over and above any consideration of tax rate equality with Engliand or Scotland. Inadequate protection afforded in Scotland or England sho uld not lead to lower standards in Wales. Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: Current Rates should be uprated and the lower rate fixed to 10% of the upper rate. The 2018 rate should not be below \u00a3100 per tonne. At present the lower rate is an inhibition to the exertion of pressure to recycle that material which falls into the lower rate category. Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government havin g the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: The rates in Wales should reflect both the challenges of the local economy, the threats to the local environment and human health, and any negative competive impacts of rates set in England and Scotland i.e rates which encourage waste import into Wales as a cheap non recycling option. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis?: The list should be subject to regular review and materials that due to increased recycling opportunity due to economic and technological change should be moved to the higher rate. Bottom ash and fly ash from coal and petroleum coke com bustion should be removed from exemption, other than as secondary waste from processes making use of bottom ash and fly ash from coal and petroleum coke combustion. Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material?: A threshold may have the effect of making inclusion of higher rate materials in primarily lower rate loads permissable up to the threshold, and thereby increasing the net volume of such material that is included. Nevertheless the benefit 67 of tighter regulation achieved by a defined threshold (either by weight or volume) is likely to outweigh the disbenefit of an increase in declared mixing of lowere and higher rate material. Q6: Would yo u support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: LoL testing is an entirely logical approach. Should England go ahead with a LoL programme, Wales would be faced with high levels of waste imports from English sources if Wales does not implement Lol because of the inevitable cost differentials. Q7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: no response offered. Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: no response offered. Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: no response offered. Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: no response offered. Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non - taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: no response offered. Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response.: Exemptions should meet strict tests of economic, environmental and social benefit that are additional to the mere disposal of waste. Failure to meet such tests should result in case by case removal of exemptions. Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: The water discount is paradoxical. If the water content is not recoverable f rom a volume of waste, then by definition the water itself is a waste that requires disposal. The relief should be removed. Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: Fly Ash and Bottom Ash from innovative heat from waste or biomass power generation plants. Exemptions to be time limited Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: no response offered. 68 Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: Beyond issue of direct management, this would undoubtedly have practical benefit in reducing landowner complicity in illegal dumping. Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: no response offered. Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk - based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: no response offered. Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be?: no response offered. Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this?: no response offered. Q21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please exp lain your reasons.: no response offered. Q22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?: no response offered. Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support?: no response offered. Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate?: no response offered. Q25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: no response offered. Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circum stances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: Where payment has a direct relationship to the operation of innovative technologies in power generation via heat from waste or th e burning of biomass, qualification for exemption may need to be tested via the appeal process, it would be unfair to demand pay before the test is complete. Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance t he wellbeing of communities?: Communities living adjacent to Landfill operations are often adversely affected by those operations. Allocation of funds from the LDT to exceptionally 69 meet the Welsh Government's policies regarding community wellbeing in the face of adverse of landfill operation impacts should be part of the LDT process. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling povert y and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: The four areas outlined in Q28 are of equal validity, rather than prioritising beteen them a more useful question is how the administratative process is to be enacted such that local priorities in the vicinity of both current and closed landfill operations are to be met ? A solely mathematical formula is not sufficient and a dynamic plan involving multiple partners will be needed Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model ?: Allocation of funds should be prioritised on local needs as identified by the geographic distribution of current and past landfill operations, as well as the broad environmental concerns of the Welsh Government. A regional board structure with appointe es from local Government, Wales Government Historic Landscape, Natural Environment and Economic Development advisors, and Voluntary Sector Health and Environment bodies may be the most effective way to structure a funding allocation body, which would work to priorties set by the Welsh Government. Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: The current allocation of revenue from the LDT includes sums granted to the Wildlife Tr usts in Wales. The work achieved by the Trusts is vital to the health of the Welsh environment, changes to the management of the LDT should wherever possible enable the Trusts to continue their work at least at 2015 levels. If this is not to be possible the Welsh Government should make a clear statement as to what amelioration of this negative effect it would seek to make.

It produces direct environmental benefits for communities living in close proximity to landfill sites Funding wildlife projects through the Landfill Communities Fu nd will help Wales to meet its key wildlife targets and legal obligations I support the use of Landfill Tax to fund charities such as the Wildlife Trust to undertake amazing projects to protect and enhance important habitats and species. This will help ens ure that our woodlands are alive with birdsong, our rivers are bubbling with life and our meadows are bursting with butterflies Funding wildlife projects helps inspires individuals and communities to connect with nature Welsh Government should increase the percentage of Landfill Tax that goes to funding wildlife projects to 10% I am a member of the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and have seen the difference to biodiversity and country side protection that has occurred thanks to funding from this fund. In particular I visited Carmel reserve in Carmarthenshire and what a joy it was to see carpets of blue bells and wild flowers in woodland glades. Surely such assets can only help encourage tourism and become havens for residents alike seeking a littl e natural peace in our busy world. I urge you to consider the very great value that has b een added to Wales by this fund. Yours Faithfully P Coleman 75 Reference 31 Dear Welsh Government The Landfill tax is a very effective way to fund Wild Life Projects that benefit the whole community. These help to protect the environment and should be encouraged, it is extremely short sighted to remove these funds from projects that do so much for everyone in Wales including meeting the Governments key wildlife targets and legal obligations. The fun ds should not be cut, the percentage of Landfill Tax that goes to wildlife projects should be increased to 10% to help charities such as the Wildlife Trust to be able to carry out work to improve the environment for the benefit of all sections of the comm unity. Regards E & M Sadler 76 Reference 32 As a member of and occasional volunteer for the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales I have just been informed of a possible threat to the Landfill Community Fund to fund wildlife projects. After reading the document with some difficulty due to its complexity I am interested in answering Questions 27 and 28. Quest ion 27 - Yes please allocate a portion of LDT to enhance the wellbeing of communities. Some excellent projects have been realised and more are in the pipeline. As your report states \"LCF is currently the main source of funding for biodiversity initiatives and environmental improvements. Without it these projects would find difficulty getting funding from other sources.\" The report says it all. I am only shocked at how small a percentage (around 5%) has been allocated to these important projects. A rise to a t least 10% would make a huge difference to the environmental improvements that could and should be undertaken. Please defend this as ring-fenced money for the environment at all costs. Question 28 - In my humble opinion, the most important uses for Land fill tax money is in minimising the impact of waste crime. More help for communities to dispose of their rubbish responsibly would be helpful. As council sites no longer accept black bin waste I see black bags building up in gardens, alleyways and anywhere that people can find to dump them. People may be prepared to pay to dump black bags at tips if ther e were a mechanism for doing so. Secondly and most importantly is use of the money for biodiversity initiatives and the improvement of the wider environme nt. Protection and enhancement of Welsh wildlife and habitat is vital for the vision of an environment that is respected and enjoyed. There are direct benefits for communities that are close to landfill sites and it is important for the public to know the re is a connection between responsible waste management and environmental and community enhancements. From S Thomas - Rhondda area 77 Reference 33 Wildlife is in desperate need of continued effort and financial aid , I do realise that the Welsh Assembly are helpful and compassionate with the human situation and appreciate how hard the members work to assist all members of the community, in order to b enefit humans we must also provide a wide range of wild and maintained natural landfill sites for the fauna and flora of this beautiful principality to prosper, we do have a legal obligations to fulfill and the benefits are tremendous both to wildlife and to the communities they serve. I do support the Wildlife Trust and ask that the Welsh Government increase the percentage of Landfill Tax so that projects can continue with the volunteers hard work to benefit the whole of welsh population. Yours sincerel y J Humphreys 78 Reference 34 Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing in response to the consultation on the operation of the Landfill Communities Fund. I am very keen that the current diversion of funds to environmental and communities projects is at least maintained, and ideally enhanced. In particular, I believe that the proportion funding natural environment and wildlife -related projects should be increased from its current levels. Wales' wonderful natural environment is o f vital importance not just to the wellbeing of its inhabitants but also in providing a range of highly valuable ecosystem services such as flood prevention as well as helping project an attractive image externally for both tourism and business. The variou s bodies carrying out work to support the natural environment are significantly underfunded already and achieve a huge amount even with this small amount, including helping Wales to achieve various targets under EU directives. Removing or reducing this imp ortant source of funds would be a highly retrograde step. With regards, Dr M Harbottle 79 Reference 35 I am very alarmed to learn that the Welsh Government is contemplating diverting these funds away from wildlife projects, such as those being pursued by the Wildlife Trusts. I urge the Government not to take this course. Landfill is pollution of the environment, and money needs to be set aside as we pollute to improve the environment where ever we can, so as not to leave a horrible legacy for our children and future generations. Government gets good value for money from organisations like the wildlife trust, as much of the work is done by volunteers. Yours sincerely, J Cook 80 Reference 36 Name: M.A.& J.R.Samuel Organisation (if applicable): Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: Wildlife organisations look after the countryside using the money from this tax, and if they did not do it because of lack of funding, Bridgend area would be a lot poorer environmentally. They are qualified people who are at present doing a very good job. The council could save a lot of money by only cutting the verges once a year in the Autumn as recommended by all the wildlife and horticultural organisations. Bridgend Council already has a bad name because it shut the visitor centre in Kenfig.

If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: Reference 37 I have been alarmed to learn that the Welsh Government is considering diverting receipts from the Landfill Communities Fund away from projects such as those undertaken by the Wildlife T rusts. Having witnessed several superb environmental projects funded in this way being undertaken by the Trust I am deeply disheartened to think that such work may cease in future. Safeguarding habitats and the wildlife it supports cannot be delayed until some hoped -for time when financial pressures will ease. I urge the Welsh Government to continue, or to increase, its support for these vital tasks, and to use Landfill finds accordingly. P Hatherley 84 Reference 38 I was horrified to learn that you are considering using the landfill tax for purposes other than conservation. This tax is one of the few dedicated specifically to wildlife and if my memory serves me correctly was so dedicated from the time of its introduc tion. Funding is so difficult these days that such a change would have massive implications, not only to wildlife but to the volunteers who give freely of their time. S Rosser 85 Reference 39 I am writing to urge you to continue to use the Landfill Communities Fund to fund wildlife projects. This is crucial funding for many wildlife projects and without it our wildlife will suffer It is really important. Kind regards, S Hazell 86 Reference 40 Please don't remove vitally important funding which is used so effectively to help our wildlife in Wales. Wildlife face huge challenges as we threaten more of their environments. The Wildlife Trust does some vital work to assist for very li ttle funding.

Regards, Cwmllynfell Community Council 88 Reference 42 RWE Generation UK Response to: Welsh Government Consultation on: Landfill Disposals Tax (Number: WG24170) Introduction RWE Generation UK plc is one of the UK's largest electricity generating companies, with major assets in Wales in the form of Aberthaw and Pembroke Power Stations. Aberthaw Power Station can generate around 1555MW of electricity for the National Grid Syste m. This is enough power to meet the needs of some 3 million households - equivalent to ten times the total population of Cardiff. RWE Generation UK aims to maintain Aberthaw Power Station as one of the most efficient coal -fired power stations in the UK and completed a \u00a3230 million environmental upgrade in recent years. Aberthaw Power Station was designed to burn semi -anthracitic, low -volatile coal. A high percentage of this coal is locally sourced coal, mined in Wales and is transported to the power station by rail. Pembroke Power Station is a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant which began full commercial operation in September 2012. The station is capable of generating over 2000MW, enough to power around 4 million homes - more than twice the number of households in Wales. The state -of-the-art CCGT technology means that Pembroke is one of the largest and most efficient plants of its kind in Europe. In January 2011 our new \u00a31 million education centre was officially opened by the First Minister of Wales. The Aberthaw Centre for Energy and Environment (ACE 2) provides an important new facility for schools, colleges and community groups throughout South Wales. Consultation response Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? RWE Generation UK believes that it is imperative that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates. A failure to do so could lead to cross -border 'waste tourism', with its associated impacts on the environment, human health and community wellbeing. These impacts would be likely to incl ude dis -amenity experienced by communities along the haul routes due to increased traffic. 89 Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. RWE Gen eration UK is of the opinion that the current standard and lower tax rates are set at an appropriate level for Wales. For the reasons discussed in the answer to Question 1 above, both the standard and lower tax rates should continue to reflect those applic able in the rest of the UK. Therefore, in line with the 2014 UK Budget Statement which announced that future Landfill Tax rates will be maintained in real terms until at least 2019 -20, it would appear appropriate that future Landfill Tax rates set by the W elsh Government should follow this trajectory. 90 Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? RWE Generation UK is of the opinion that there would be value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (as explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11). However, for the aforementioned reasons of preserving equity of taxation rates across the UK, it would appear inadvisable for thi s power to be exercised, other than where changing circumstances demand an appropriate deviation from this policy in order to avoid negative impacts. Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1 ) that should be considered, and on what basis? RWE Generation UK assumes that it is the intention of the Welsh Government to use the Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011 as the basis for determining which materials qualify for the lower rate of taxation. Therefore, RWE Generation UK believes it is important to draw attention to the fact that the notes shown for the Group 5 materials (Ash) shown in Appendix 1: \"SUMMARY OF THE LANDFILL TAX (QUALIFYING MATERIAL) ORDER 2011 \" of the consultation document actually reflect the text of SI 2012 No. 940 The Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) (Amendment) Order 2012. Following industry representations to HMRC in 2012, and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA ) advising HMRC that it saw no environmental rationale to prevent the co -disposal of ash from coal and from biomass, the UK Government decided that SI 2012 No. 940 would not be approved by the House of Commons and was allowed to lapse on 22nd May 2012 and the landfill tax liability of ash reverted to the original terms set out in Notes (7) and (8) of SI 2011 No. 1017 The Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011: '(7) Group 5 comprises only \u2014 (i) bottom ash and fly ash from wood or waste combustion; an d (ii) bottom ash and fly ash from coal or petroleum coke combustion (including when burnt together with biomass). (8) Group 5 does not include fly ash from sewage sludge, municipal, clinical and hazardous waste incinerators. ' The above definition of Group 5 materials is also shown in in Section 19.1 of Excise Notice LFT1: a general guide to Landfill Tax (as updated by HMRC on 27th March 2015). Additionally, this definition of Group 5 materials is also given in the Scottish Landfill Tax (Qualifying Mat erial) Order 2015, which came into force on 1 st April 2015. RWE Generation UK is aware that HMRC is currently in the process of reviewing the wording of the notes associated with Group 5 of the qualifying materials and has been engaged in dialogue with in dustry on the subject over recent months. RWE Generation UK is of the opinion that the approach to the taxation of ashes arising from the combustion of biomass, whether as a result of co -firing with coal or petroleum coke, or from 100% biomass combustion, needs to be carefully considered. It is important that the industry's attempts to reduce CO 2 emissions by the utilisation of renewable energy sources should not be hindered by the unintended consequences of the application of taxation. For example, giv en the wide range of biomass materials available, it is considered that the use of the term ' wood ' in relation to Group 5 of the qualifying materials is too restrictive, as this could potentially lead to ashes arising from the combustion of non - wood biomas s being excluded from the list of materials qualifying for the lower rate of Landfill Tax. Also, it is important that the wording of any mono -filling requirements is 91 carefully considered, in order that any intended environmental benefits can be achieved wi thout imposing any unintended, and potentially prohibitive, restrictions. RWE Generation UK would encourage the Welsh Government to engage with HMRC on this subject and update the relevant text to provide greater clarity for the sector and for the Welsh Revenue Authority. Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? RWE Generation UK has no comments to make on the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifyi ng waste in a load of qualifying material. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. RWE Generation UK would support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved, provided that this was to be for materials within the scope of SI 2015 No. 845 The Landfill Tax (Qualifying Fines) Order 2015. Also, it would be appropriate that any qualifying LoI threshold should ref lect that set by HMRC. Once again, this would help to ensure the maintenance of cross -border consistency, and so, avoid potential drivers for 'waste tourism'. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in whic h a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? RWE Generation UK has no comments to make on the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place. Question 8: In your view, are there any issue s with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? RWE Generation UK has no issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site. Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? RWE Generation UK has no comments to make on the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax. Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax ) and why? RWE Generation UK would expect qualifying materials which are used for the purposes of filling existing or former quarries in accordance with the conditions listed in Section 5.4.1 of Excise Notice LFT1: a general guide to Landfill Tax (as upda ted by HMRC on 27 th March 2015) to be exempt from landfill tax. Again, maintenance of consistency with the HMRC position will avoid potential drivers for 'waste tourism'. 92 Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxabl e and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? RWE Generation UK has no other suggestions for how the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site might be clarified. Question 12: Do you th ink that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. RWE Generation UK is of the opinion that none of the current exemptions should be removed or modified. In particular, RWE Generation UK is of the opinion that qualifying materials which are used for the purposes of filling existing or former quarries in accordance with the conditions listed in Section 5.4.1 of 'Excise Notice LFT1: a general guide to Landfill Tax' should remain exempt from landfill tax. This exemption encourages the restoration of quarries, which has the potential over the longer term, to improve landscapes and offer benefits such as increased biodiversity, improved amenity for local communities and the opportunity to return land to agricult ural use. Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. RWE Generation UK believes that there is no case for removing or modifying the water discount relief from the weighing process when determining liability for Landfill Tax. Historically, the water content of Group 5 materials (Ash) as designated under the Landfill tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011 has been exempted from the weighing process i.e. the water is discounted when determining Landfill Tax liability. Water is added to Group 5 materials (Ash) for the purpose of enabling the material to be transp orted for disposal. This is in accordance with condition (a) (i) under Paragraph (5) of Regulation 44 of SI 1996 No. 1527 The Landfill Tax Regulations 1996. RWE Generation UK is of the firm opinion that the handling and transport of Group 5 materials (As h) in a dry state has the potential to create significant dust and environmental nuisance impacts at both production facilities and landfill disposal areas. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to remove the water discount relief where water is added for t he purpose of mitigating the potential environmental impacts associated with handling ash in its dry state. Also, in certain cases water may be used as the transporting medium for ash, with the ash being dewatered at the landfill location. This is the cas e for settlement lagoon type Pulverised Fuel Ash (PFA) landfills, where ultimately, the carrier water does not form part of the material deposited within the landfill, but is discharged as supernatant water, post ash settlement. As a result of this, it is not possible to physically weigh the ash disposed to landfills of this type. Instead, the quantity of ash (dry weight) being disposed to landfill is calculated based on the ash content of fuel burned using a method that has been accepted by both SEPA and H MRC. The 'conditioning' of PFA by mixing with water within controlled proportions, also has longer term benefits either when disposed of in landfills or used as a bulk fill material. This is because, when mixed with water, pozzolanic reactions take place within the ash, meaning that when correctly emplaced it forms a fill material with enhanced properties of physical stability. This can often make it an ideal material for land restoration projects, such as the filling of disused quarries. 93 RWE Generation U K strongly recommends that for Group 5 materials (Ash) the water content continues to be discounted when determining Landfill Tax liability. Adopting this approach will also ensure consistency across England, Scotland, and Wales. Question 14: Do you thin k there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? RWE Generation UK is of the opinion that there is no case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs. Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for f ailure to do so? RWE Generation UK would support the placing of an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site. As stated in the consultation d ocument, this should help create a level playing field between operators and help deter the under - declaring of waste. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? RWE Generation UK supports the concept that extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax would provide an additional financial deterrent to illegal disposals of w aste and would help support the Welsh Government's Fly -tipping Strategy. Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? RWE Generation UK fully supports the concept that it should not be cheaper to offend than to take the appropriate precautions with regard to environmental offences. Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. RWE Generation UK has no comment to make with regard to whether or not there is a need for increased compliance activity on the ground. Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? RWE Generation UK has no suggestions for any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? 94 RWE Generation UK is not aware of any evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax. Chapter 4: Administration Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. RWE Generation UK would support aligning the tax return period with the financial year. Aligning the quarterly invoice period with the lan dfill site operators' waste returns to NRW would appear a logical step to support compliance activity. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax r eturn? RWE Generation UK is of the opinion that making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return would impose only minimal extra burden whilst simplifying the process of cross -checking tax and waste returns. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? RWE Generation UK recognises the fact that the small and diminishing number of landfill site operators i n Wales makes a complete move to an online platform for Landfill Tax unlikely to be cost -effective. However, changing the format of the tax return to enable electronic returns to be submitted via email and encouraging electronic payments would be seen as a step in the right direction. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? RWE Generation UK is of the opinion that the circumstances in which landfill site operators can claim bad debt relief should be narrowed, using a similar approach to that recently adopted in Scotland. Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? RWE Generation UK has no comment to make on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context. Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? RWE Generation UK has no comment to make on whether there are any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal. Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? RWE Generation UK is of the opinion that the Welsh Government should allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities. 95 Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbein g, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiativ es and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) RWE Generation UK has no comment to make with regard to which activities should benefit from funding. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? RWE Generation UK has no comments to make on the possible administrative model. Additional Questions Question 30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? RWE Generation UK would like to draw attention to the fact that since the electricity supply industry operates through the National Grid system, the vast majority of operators supply into a market which spans the national boundaries within the UK. Therefore, for generators of electricity, it is of particular importance that all elements of the industry, including costs associated with landfill disposals, are allowed to operate on a level playing fie ld which acts across these same national boundaries. Question 31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? RWE Generation UK has no comments to make on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment.

This is valuable source of funding for many community projects. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity in itiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - such projects are able to compensate communities for the disameni ty of the proximity of a landfill site. Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - any help deprived communities can obtain to improve community facilities should be facilitated. Using such funds to improve play areas, community buildings and other facilities will have a positive impact on the general health and well -being of communities. In our experience of funding projects, every \u00a3LCF is, on average, supported by another \u00a32 of other money, raised from the local community and other grant funding sources. Such an injection of additional money into local communities would not be realised if this tax revenue was used to minimise waste crime or for waste minimisation/diversion purposes. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model ?: In order to minimise the administrative cost, a model utilising an existing community grant - awarding infrastructure may be the most cost - effective. Setting up a new distributive body would likely be a disproportionately high cost, to be taken from the fund.

Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non-taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practi cal implications of these?: No Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response.: Dredgings - material removed from water Mining and quarrying waste remove exemption - is an environmentally destructive activity. Filling of quarries - maintain exemption only where material is benign. Pet cemeteries - remove exemption - people can and will find the money to fund this activity. The activity offers no benefit to the environment. Waste from visit ing (NATO) forces - remove exemption - too broad a catagory and open to abuse with potential for pollution (and Unidentified at that) Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief?

Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Enhancing environment al works which contribute to biodiversity and community understanding of the environment should be high on the agenda. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: The requirement to meet over stringent limits to funding models an d the poor understanding by some officials and waste companies in particular have made it very difficult to access some funds. The ability of fund managers to think out of the box and not be strung up by beaurocracy seem to me to be priorities for the next administration. Somewhat independent administration from the disposal tax contributors may well help all concerned to allocate funding support more appropriately. Some wildlife charities and communities have received considerable support and may be extrem ely disadvantaged by substantial change. Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: The \"old\" 10 mile limit should be changed as it radically affects the ability of communi ties in Wales to access the funds available and undoubtedly contributes to the underspend apparent at the moment. This limit MUST be changed to create a fairness of distribution in Wales.

UKELA's members are involved in the practice, study or formulation of environmental law in the UK and the European U nion. It attracts both lawyers and non -lawyers and has a broad membership from the private and public sectors.

How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the U K and Scottish Governments on Landfill tax rates and why? UKELA agrees with the analysis and arguments for maintaining consistency with rates in England set out in the consultation document. The factors which might impact on decisions to send waste genera ted in England to landfill sites in Wales are wide -ranging and complex, but there will inevitably be the possibility of waste generated in England being sent to landfill sites in Wales if Wales sets lower rates of tax than England. For that reason UKELA b elieves that the Welsh Government should maintain consistency with the UK and Scottish governments on tax rates. 2. Are the current standard and lower rates set at an appropriate level for Wales. Please explain your response. The logic of the UK Governme nt not increasing the lower Landfill tax rate in proportion with the standard rate is not evident from the consultation paper. However, UKELA considers that an analysis should be undertaken of the implications of raising the lower rate in Wales, in partic ular the likely impact on reducing, recycling or reusing waste; the likely effect on relevant businesses; and whether it would give rise to waste tourism and \"backhauling\". 3. Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lowe r rates of tax and why? UKELA would support the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax for the reasons set out in the consultation paper. It is difficult to predict the future with any certainty and any Government could be disadvantaged by not having the power to make necessary changes in response to economic, political, social and environmental developments. Defining Taxable Material 111 4. Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate tha t should be considered, and on what basis? Given the wide gap between the standard rate of tax and the lower rate of tax, there is a very real risk of waste tourism and backhauling if the Welsh Government adds additional materials to the list of materials qualifying for the lower rate of tax in Wales that are subject to the standard rate of tax in England. Again, UKELA believes that the Welsh Government should maintain consistency with the UK and Scottish Governments. Compliance with the Lower Tax Rate 5. What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non qualifying waste? The absence of specific guidance as to what constitutes a small quantity is of concern as inevitably interpretations would vary cons iderably, leading to potential, consequential loss of revenue. It seems sensible and reasonable to impose a threshold of 10%. The argument about fully enforcing EU Council Decision 2003/33/EC is valid, subject to consideration of the enforcement costs. Introduction of the Loss of Ignition Test 6. Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved. Please explain your reasons. The case for introducing this test appears to be well made and has the potential to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases. The Welsh Government has the opportunity to learn from the English and Scottish experiences of the test before taking a final decision. Defining the Area in which a Taxable Disposal Take Place 7. Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? It is difficult to respond to this question without some factual information on the extent to whic h tax is paid on waste items that are stored or sorted for recycling within tipping areas. The practical implications of changing the tax point need to be fully explored and the costs/benefits of each approach considered before a decision is made. Credit for Landfill Waste Removed 8. In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? 112 Whilst UKELA supports the Welsh Government's desire to ensure the arrangements for credit are fair, simple and appropriate, it is difficult to comment without knowing the difficulties (if any) of the current arrangements. This relates to the previous question as to the appropriate tax point and so i t is assumed that if the tax point is to be at the tipping area there would be no need for claiming credit. Landfill Site Activities to be treated as Disposals 9. What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material ente ring a landfill site is subject to tax? It is evident that the existing legislation is fraught with difficulties in view of the litigation that has arisen and the fact that this puts at risk significant tax revenues. The case for legislating to ensure tha t all material entering a landfill site, apart from that which is exempt, should be taxed appears to be well made and should overcome current problems with interpretation of the legislation. The Welsh Government should be aware of the First -Tier Tribuna l's Tax Chamber's decision in the case of Patersons of Greenoakhill Limited v The Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs [2014] UKFTT 334 (TC), which has clarified the status of biodegradable material that degrades to produce methane gas which i s subsequently used for power generation. 10. What activities would you expect to be exempt from tax and why? UKELA suggests that the Welsh Revenue Authority should adopt the same approach as HMRC to exempt activities, in order to avoid the risk of creati ng opportunities for waste tourism and backhauling. 11. Do you have any suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non-taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? Please see response to question 10 above. Exemptions and Reliefs 12. Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. The case for retaining the current exemptions is not apparent. If it is proposed to retain any of them, the reasons should be clarified in terms of impact on the environment and business. Furthermore, there will need to be robust guidance to minimise abu se and inconsistent application. 13. Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response? It does not appear that there is a sound case for retaining the water discount relief. However, the likely financial impact on businesses needs to be considered before a decision is made. 113 14. Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? It is impossible to comment on this in a meaningful way without understanding the rationale and implications. Improving Regulation 15. What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge, where one is functional and available on the landfill site or wit hin close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? There appears to be no reason why an operator should not be obliged to use a weighbridge where one is available and functional. The practical implications relate to regul ators satisfying themselves that weighbridges have been operational and that they have been used in every case. The guidance would need to be explicit on the circumstances in which a penalty will be charged and it would need to be sufficient to deter land fill operators and waste management companies from avoiding the requirement. Extend the Definition of a Landfill Site 16. What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? UKELA is concerned about waste crime and would support any measures aimed at reducing illegal waste deposits and fly -tipping. Cogent arguments have been presented in support of extending the definition of landfill sites to include il legal waste deposits within the ambit of the tax. However, the success of such a measure will be dependent to an extent on effective regulation and enforcement. The benefits will need to outweigh the overall costs, which have already been identified as si gnificant. While UKELA agrees with the proposal that anyone caught illegally disposing of waste and anyone who knowingly permits such a disposal at a site other than a landfill site should be made liable to pay landfill tax, it is concerned that liability should not be imposed on innocent landowners who fall victim to illegal waste disposal activities, or on innocent landlords whose tenants engage in illegal waste disposal activities on their land or go insolvent leaving their landlord with large quantitie s of waste to dispose of. Such landowners and landlords will have to pay landfill tax on the disposal of waste removed from their property, which is arguably unfair in itself, and should not be penalised twice for the illegal activities of third parties. UKELA notes that Defra and Welsh Government have recently consulted on waste crime issues, including the position of landowners and landlords faced with illegal waste management activities on their land. Criminal and Civil Penalties 17. Are there any is sues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? 114 UKELA believes that the current penalties are adequate. What matters, however, is that there is proper enforcement of the law by the enforcement bodies mentioned in paragraph 3. 29 of the consultation document and that the courts impose appropriate penalties to remove any economic benefit derived from offending and to deter future offending. Compliance Activity 18. Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. UKELA considers that on the ground regulation and enforcement is more likely to have the desired effect in reducing waste crime and tax e vasion, than desk based assessment of information. Offenders need to know that there is a real possibility of being caught in order to consider stopping re -offending and legitimate operators need to know that their businesses are not being undercut by ill egal operators. Minimising the Impact of Landfill Disposals Tax Evasion 19. Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement, and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? There is limited information about actions planned by Welsh Government to improve compliance and enforcement, and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposal Tax evasions. Achievement of these obje ctives will require action on a number of fronts including more effective enforcement and effective PR and communications activity. It will be important to establish the costs of such activity against the estimated costs of non -compliance and tax evasion on both financial and environmental grounds. Tackling Tax Avoidance 20. In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? UKELA has no information on this issue. The Invoice Period 21. Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. There does not appear to be any substantive reason for not aligning the tax return period with the financial year. The dominant criteria for such a de cision should be convenience to the site operator's business cycle and the regulator's administrative processes, rather than work flow considerations of the Welsh Revenue Authority, the new body to be set up to collect the taxes. European Waste Catalogue C odes 115 22. What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of returns? On the understanding that site operators are familiar with and competent in the use of EWC codes, and that their use does not impose an undue burden, UKELA would support implementation of the requirement to use the codes in the NRW waste returns. However, it would be helpful to have some indication of the costs involved for site operators and whether this is l ikely to lead to efficiency savings. Filing Tax Returns 23. How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? Whilst the costs and proportionality argument is valid to an ex tent, in today's technological environment, it would be a backward step to continue with a paper based system. Furthermore, apart from the medium term efficiency savings and improvements in records and compliance, there are also savings for the environmen t through the use of less paper. Bad Debt Relief 24. Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? All businesses face the risks of bad debt and this should be factored into their business modelling. It is not clear why the waste disposal sector has been awarded this relief. However, there may be a case for awarding relief in particular circumstances on a discretionary basis. Resolving Tax Disputes 25. Have you comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to see a review or appeal? UKELA supports the proposals as set out in the consultation paper. The Timing of Payment when a Dispute Arises 26. In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which tax payers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? The current HRMC arrangements appe ar fair and reasonable. In situations where the landfill operator has secured agreement to withholding payment until the appeal has been heard, the fact that there is a requirement to pay the full amount with interest if the appeal is lost presents a risk to the operator and should act as a deterrent to bringing forward appeal cases with a weak evidence base. There may well be exceptional circumstances in which the landfill operator may not have been able to secure the payment in question 116 from the waste di sposal company, so it appears reasonable to continue with the current arrangements. Community Well -being 27. Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax Revenue to enhance the well -being of communities? In a situation of reduced public funding, the Welsh Government's block grant being reduced in line with the amount of landfill tax being collected and anticipated reductions in the level of tax collected, it is difficult to decide whether all the tax should accrue to the We lsh Government for distribution amongst various budgets or whether some should be allocated specifically for the well -being of communities affected by landfill sites. Those communities living nearby are likely to be affected by traffic and other impacts f rom the site. It is further noted that a number of sites are close to communities in deprived areas of Wales. In the light of this and proposed implementation of the goals of the Well -being of Future Generations Act, UKELA concludes that a proportion of t he tax revenues should be retained to enhance the well -being of those communities affected by landfill operations. 28. If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of the Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community well -being, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement, and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Bio-diversity initiatives and wider environm ental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other It is suggested that the funding should be flexible and enable projects that cover all four of the above, although there are concerns about supporting compliance and enforcement as the money should be used for the communities rather than to supplement the work of public bodies in terms of these activities. There should be a strategy for the funding such as aimed at improving the living conditions of those residing near a landfill site and clear criteria for award of financial support. UKELA believes that research in areas such as biodiversity and waste management should be restored as legitimate purposes for the LCF (which used to be the case). This would mean relaxing the 10 mil e rule, but the rule would arguably be unnecessary, as the funds raised could only be used in Wales. 29. Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative models? It is noted that there are about 50 active environmental bodies in Wales, a number o f which could handle the process. It is important that care is chosen to select a body that provides value for money and ensures that the funds are well spent in the interests of the communities affected by landfill activity. 117 Lessons need to be learnt fro m the experience of using the existing distributive environmental and environmental bodies. Dr Norma Barry UKELA Wales Co -ordinator 118 Reference 48 Please would you not remove funding which is key to keeping our wildlife in our patch, so we are able to continue with the project we desperately need to keep. Regards K and L Jones. 119 Reference 49 In response to the consultation, the collective response from Third sector in Conwy is set at below: The 2 areas which have resonated with our communities are: Schemes to tackle the level of waste accrued from building operations are needed. Small scale Commu nity projects can utilise timber, bricks etc., a Community Company or other existing facilities could undertake the operation to divert such materials from landfill. 2. Tackling poverty and deprivation in all its forms restores to communities their self -respect and raises the desire to care for their communities. The investment of funds such as LDT revenue directly to grass -roots organisations demonstrates that government also cares and can 'kick -start' that development of self -respect. The control of funds for communities must be within an organisation that knows and works in its community. The Local Voluntary Services Councils are ideally placed. They know their communities, the local organisations, the local needs and priorities and are led by t rustees who have the good of their communities at heart. A new administrative body, and all the cost involved in setting up such a body should be avoided.

Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Using the services of DTA Wales membership and local community based charities would be simple and effective conduit t o facilitate a range of community based initiatives. Tackling Poverty and environmental initiatives in particular would have the maximum benefit to communities especially those in multiple deprivations. 123 Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible admini strative model?: Using the services of DTA Wales as a conduit would be an ideal organisation to obtain maximum coverage for Wales and in turn open a fund into which local community charities could bid to deliver hard outcomes for the community they repres ent.

If there are different r ates there is the potential for waste tourism. Scotland is too far away to have a similar impact. Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: Yes. The current standard rate level has discouraged landfilling waste and increased recycling. Further increases in the standard rate would likely have the effect of also increasing recycling costs. An increased standard rate would likely result in landfill opera tors finding it difficult to actually achieve landfill completion. An increase in standard rate would make it difficult for landfill operators to maintain environmental compliance (cover material) and maintain site (e.g. aggregate for roadways etc). Q3: I s there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: See response to Q4. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis?: Links to Q3. A higher lower rate would make it increasingly difficult (or more expensive) for landfill operators to maintain compliance with their environmental permits. The operators need material to cov er waste deposits and need material to maintain roadways etc. At the moment these are captured in the definition of the The Landfill Tax (Prescribed Landfill Site Activities) Order. Provided the materials are used on the landfill site then should they be t axed? 2009. Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non - qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material?: It would be very difficult to give anything other than a opinion of what constitutes a \"small quantity\" in a given load. Realistically, unless you test the entire load you cannot categorically determine the percentage of contaimination. Therefore, I think the current position is reasonable providing operators act in good consci ence. Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: Yes, it's a reasonable manner of determining one characteristic of the material's potential to pollute. Q7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: Yes, there are issues with the existing arrangements as even materials that have to be used are c urrently taxed. To resolve: materials imported to maintain haul roads or environmental controls off the active landfill cell should not be taxed as these materials are not being disposed. Materials placed within the waste mass, while not 125 necessarily being disposed, should be taxed at the existing lower rate. Materials (even low polluting materials) which have no beneficial use could be taxed at the standard rate. Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill m aterial permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: The current credit arrangements are reasonable though it can be difficult to accuratelty identify when waste was deposited. Q9: What would be the practical implica tions of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: See response to Q4. Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: See res ponse to Q4. Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: See response to Q4. Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response.: No. Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: Remove the water discount mechanism. It's complex and in any case it is still a material being disposed. Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: See response to Q4. Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: The only negative implication would be upsetting unscrupulous o perators or hauliers. It would aid in the management of tax avoidance. Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: It will act as an additi onal deterrent to illegally depositing waste so can only be a good idea. Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: No issues noted. 126 Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: Boots on the ground, even once a month trying to visit several sites should have no impact on the honest operators though will aid in identifying unscrupulous operators who evade tax. Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, plea se describe what those actions could be?: No, the industry will be aware of the tax. Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this?: No experience of tax avoidance. Q21: Would yo u support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons.: Aligning the tax returns with the quarterly waste returns would make sense. Quarterly returns will also help in managing cash flow. Q22: What would be the pra ctical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?: While initially awkward to incorporate, the EWC codes are used in the rest of the returns and are recorded on weighbridges so sho uld not make it difficult for operators. Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support?: Online support would make sense as the majority of other returns are handled by this means. Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate?: The Scottish model makes sense. WG should not offer significant tax relief for the public sector. Q25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: No comments. Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be ab le to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: The Scottish model makes sense as the operator should have already collected the tax from the person depositing the waste. Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a pro portion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities?: Yes, though limit the use of the fund to specific activities, see Q28. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax Activities or topics to cover should include only a small list of items: Waste Awareness (e.g. Waste minimisation and 127 revenue to enhance co mmunity wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodive rsity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: improving recycling/re -use) Biodiversity or environmental activities Activities which have a positive impact on the community It should not be spent to subsidise functions which should be budgetted elsewhere or on activities which do not have a positive envir onmental or community impact. If the fund is not being spent then it areas more than 10 miles from a site should be allowed to access it if it has a positive impact as above. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: A wider advertisement of the fund (e.g. WG website etc) with a single body responsible for administration rather than one per operator. Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: N/A Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment?: Responses to consultations may be made public - online or in a report.

The history of the L andfill Communities Fund (formerly the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme) has sought to address the dis -amenity of having a landfill operation within a proximity of the community. This has been a successful scheme for those communities, particularly deprived and rural that have not been able to access capital funding through other schemes. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from fund ing, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty an d deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: The success of the existing scheme has been the ability to support the built and natural environments, but always with people as the overall beneficiary. WREN annually exceeds \u00a31million of grants fo r halls, kitchen upgrades, access, play, and projects that promote social inclusion. As well as this, we also fund landscape scale biodiversity impact projects with a longer term delivery, and invest in the restoration and safety of historic buildings and monuments on the at risk register e.g. industrial heritage sites. There has been significant investment in each of these also, and this has led to wider understanding and access for the public. The revised and increased range of projects you suggest will significantly impact on the capital investment for the smaller and deprived communities, and may lead to pressure points between these communities and the commercial operations of the waste companies as a consequence. This is undesirable for all parties Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: The Welsh Government forecast for a fund in the future is very low, and with several organisations potentially distributing the monies, there is the prospect of erosion of the fund through administration. Equally daunting for the administration organisation is the prospect of a \"cap\" that may make the task a non-viable option due to the modest size of the fund they are distributing. The Welsh Government could therefore consider a single body through a tender basis, provided that the 131 landfill operators received assurances from the Welsh Government in terms of no financial penalties arising from the risk management of the project by an unrelated third party organisation and also that the landf ill operators could enjoy some form of PR recognition. Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment?: Responses to consultations may be made public - online or in a report. If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: (Unchecked) 132 Reference 53 Dear Sirs I gather that you are thinking of removing the funding for wildlife and conservation projects in Wales, when this used to be promoted as the basic reason and use for the Landfill Tax. Various charities such as Wildlife Trusts, Butterfly Conservation, Plantlife, Buglife etc who do tremendous work for the benefit of the whole community rely on some extra help from this fund. It would be a terrible shame if this help were withdrawn and would affect us all, even councillors. Your sincerely C Manley 133 Reference 54 Dear Sir / Madam, Members of St Fagans Community Council wish to make the following comments / observations in relation to the consultation paper on Landfill Tax: Q1 - Members consider there is no sense in having widely different rates for landfill tax either side of the border. As the document states it simply encourages landfill to the cheapest site. For that reason Members consider that it makes little sense to devolve this taxing power to Wales as it would be operating with its hand s tied behind its back as far as any competition is concerned. Q2 - Members believe the issue of lower rates of disposal for some products is a tricky one. Some of the products in the lower group (as defined in App. 1) are eminently re -usable and so are n ot really 'wastes' in the sense that they can't be used. Rubble can be used as a construction product for example. The Council's only issue is that the small waste generator (e.g. a small builder) pays the same rate to a waste haulier for a skip of rubble , as he does for a skip of mixed waste, so there is little incentive to separate things out. In any event, the Welsh rate has to be the same/similar to the English rate. Q3 - Members consider that changes to the lower rate will only work if it's reflected across the border, unless the difference is quite small thus cancelling out the transport costs. Q4 - The list of products qualifying for lower disposal rates is considered to be quite extensive! Members question why plasterboard is such a problem; it is excluded from Group 7 and banned from many council tips. Q6 - Members feel the Loss on Ignition test is at least scientific so consider that it's a good idea to use it. Q15 - Members are of the opinion that forcing sites to use a weighbridge should be a m inimum control measure. If you can't measure, can't control it. Q16 - Members are unsure as to what is meant in the paper by deterrent. However, paying twice for the landfill cost if you're caught dumping isn't considered to be much of a deterrent. If a w aste haulier tips three loads and gets caught for one of them, he would still be gaining financially. Members would favour very strict penalties, ranging from vehicle confiscation, punitive fines (\u00a31000/tonne?), to very long Community Service orders. Q17 - The same comments as in Q16. Q18 - Members are unsure as to how a desk based compliance regime works. From their personal experiences with the enforcement business at the Environment Agency, they consider there is no substitute for 'boots on the ground' initially when dealing with major frauds on landfill sites. Members hope these comments / observations will be of assistance i n taking this proposal forward. Yours sincerely, D Barnard St Fagans Community Council 134 Reference 55 This document contains the responses to the consultation on developing a Landfill Disposal Tax in Wales on behalf of the National Trust. We have consulted with colleagues in Wales in drafting our response. The table below contains our views on the questions that are per tinent to the National Trust as an applicant organisation. We have not responded to questions that are not directly relevant or where we have insufficient knowledge and experience. The Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) was introduced in 1996 and since then has awarded grants of over \u00a31.4 billion to projects that benefit local communities. The National Trust has been a regular applicant to the scheme, and our grant income from the LCF was \u00a31.3 million in 2014/15, although only a proportion of this was for proj ects in Wales. In Wales, England and Northern Ireland the LCF has funded crucial projects in the National Trust, including cycle trails, play areas, community spaces, and conservation of species or habitats and of historically significant buildings. Consu ltation questions All the consultation questions are included in the table below, with responses to the questions that are important to the National Trust in italics. Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with th e UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? It is important to maintain consistency with the rest of the UK on tax rates in order to make the scheme(s) as simple to administer as possible, especially for companies and organisati ons operating in more than one of the countries. This will also help to ensure that waste and landfill sites are managed appropriately. As an applicant organisation any lack of consistency could potentially have an impact on the funding that is available f or projects. National Landfill Operators and distributors of funding would have to comply with more than one system, which would increase complexity and cost as far as administration is concerned. We also recognise that the fact that the tax rate (and div ersion rate for the LCF) is announced in the budget each year could be a barrier to maintaining 135 consistency and would urge a longer term approach (e.g. rates set for the next three financial years on a rolling basis) to be taken across the UK. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (expla ined in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? It would seem sensible to look at the flexible approach that Scotland is taking, but to review and learn from how this is working there before implementing it in practice in Wales. It would also seem sensible for th e whole of the UK to take the same approach in order to reduce landfill waste and encourage recycling. Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that al l material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. 136 Question 1 3: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? 137 Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Yes. The LCF has been a crucial source of funding for voluntary organisations and community groups for a wide range of projects that are sometimes not easily funded from other sources. These projects are very different to what is funded through government and local authorities, and as a result add enormous value to their local area. The scheme is relatively easy and quick to apply to, making it compa ratively easily accessible even for small and less experienced or smaller community groups. As such it is important that the scheme continues, even if a slightly different format. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) Whilst widening the funding to areas that are not immediately adversely impacted by a nearby la ndfill site under the decreasing numbers of these could be a very positive thing, the types of activities that could be funded should be carefully considered. This is particularly important with the level of funds decreasing over coming years. As a result we do not agree that the following activities should be funded: responsibility and there are other proposals as part of the consultation that also targets this. If additional investment for this purpose (perhaps funded through some of the other measures proposed as part of the consultation) could be found this would be a good thing, but we don't believe that funding should be re -directed from other projects as a result. ion and the diversion of waste from landfill: This is something that we do support in principle, but we do not believe that this is the right source of funding for it. Promoting this to and educating industry and businesses could be achieved in different w ays, e.g. through existing networks and communication channels, and is in our view more about ways of working rather than funding. We do support, and indeed strongly recommend, that the funding should support the following activities and projects: or conservation of a species: These projects are vital for the communities that 138 surround them, but funding is often not easily accessible. Some other grant sources are either very onerous and for very large grants (e.g. LIFE+), or require additional activities in order for a project to be supported (e.g. HLF). These projects can also have additional benefits, e.g. projects to restore blanket bog peat or the natural flow of a r iver or stream can also help alleviate flooding and improve water quality. being achieved by many projects already delivered by the current LCF scheme. Most projects would rely on volunteers either during the delivery of the project or the running of the amenity once complete. There are vast amounts of evidence that demonstrate the positive impact of volunteering in terms of developing new skills and/or building confidence. Voluntee ring, and working in partnership with other local organisations to reach certain groups of volunteers, could be further encouraged under a revised scheme. The existing scheme also delivers facilities (as demonstrated by your examples) such as play areas, s kate parks and community halls, which would often not be possible without this funding. Many of these will be in urban or deprived areas. delivery) as part of the LCF scheme. Alt hough we would like to see it continue as a mainly capitally focused scheme, more flexibility to allow for support of volunteers, skills development, partnership activities and community engagement initiatives would be very positive for many projects. ojects that indirectly benefit the local area: These types of projects can encourage tourism and visits to an area that lead to other benefits (e.g. economic, job creation), and could include, for example, coastal access/footpaths, visitor facilities, coas tal and/or water sports centres or off - road cycle trails. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? Where there is an existing body and this is working well (e.g. in terms of spending LO contributions on projects quickly, keeping their administrative costs low etc.) then we would recommend that this should continue. Some of these operate in the UK as a whole and as a result you should be able to achieve some economies of scale. Discussions during the current consultation by HMRC also suggest that LO's might be resistant to losing control of how the funding is spent and as result withdraw from this (at present) voluntary scheme. Where there is no existing body, distribution could take place through an alternative organisation , e.g. Community Foundation in Wales, with the LO's permission and agreement on how the funds should be spent. To reduce the administrative burden and the costs relating to this we would recommend learning from both the Scottish and the UK models for mana ging the LCF. There are many aspects of the scheme that could be made less onerous, e.g. registration of projects, management of assets and the requirement for a contributory third party payment. There are also aspects 139 that are working very well, e.g. good practice developed by distributors of funding working together and sharing learning. Bearing in mind the geographical locations of the landfill sites in Wales, and the predicted reduction in these, we would also support that the geographical boundary limi t of 10 miles is reconsidered. We would especially welcome this for projects focusing on biodiversity and the environment since these are often in very rural areas. Question 30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or ot her comments that you would like to make? Although we have no direct experience of, or are impacted directly by, some of the proposals we would support changes that are beneficial to the environment (e.g. the water discount relief) or that aim to minimise Landfill Tax evasion/avoidance or waste crime. As such we would support the proposal to widen the legislation to also apply to sites that do not have the necessary licenses or permits but that are nevertheless accepting landfill waste. Question 31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? Case study Abergwesyn Common In 2009 Biffa Award funded a partnership project on Abergwesyn Common in Wales, and three other sites in England. The project was instrumental in giving us the o pportunity to trial a range of upland management techniques, and engage with our key stakeholders - the graziers. The funding was used to pay for molinia cutting - to benefit Golden Plover sites, to provide mulch for bare peat protection and to support a c attle grazing project and engagement with local graziers. The grazing project helped to demonstrate that it was possible to re -introduce cattle to large, unenclosed upland sites and that could be managed to graze molinia, but also that extra funding is nee ded to sustain this. 140 The project is still having an impact today, 3 years after completion, and the lessons learnt are still very relevant and has helped influenced recent projects both in the Elenydd and in other organisations. Abergwesyn is still ho me to Golden Plover, and a few pairs are still using the cut areas for feeding and breeding. The 1ha of bare peat that was mulched now has vegetation growing on it, helping to reduce peat erosion and release of CO2. 141 Reference 56 Name: Lucy Singleton Organisation (if applicable): Valpak Ltd Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: We are pleased that the Welsh Government has decided to consult on this topic. Whilst we recognise that the Welsh Government has powers to raise and set landfill tax levels in Wales, we believe that unless there are exceptional circumstances, it is important to maintain consistency wit h the UK and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates. This will help to ensure that waste tourism does not occur and will remove the incentive for waste carriers to travel across borders between the countries to dispose of waste. Q2: Are the current sta ndard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: Yes we believe they are. As mentioned in the previous question, differences in the standard and lower tax rates between countries could lead to waste tourism. Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: As the Landfill Tax (Scotland) Act 2014 gives power to the Scottish Government t o set different rates of lower tax, we believe that this power should also be extended to the Welsh Government. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? : We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material?: We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: We would support this. This legislation currently exists in England to prove that the waste is inert. A LoI test in Wales would therefore be consistent. If this is to be introduced, the Welsh Government should consider the thresholds used in other parts of the UK as this will ensure consistency in charges for producers. Q7: Are there any problems w ith the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangement s for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill We do not have expertise to comment on this question 142 site and if so, how might these be addressed?: Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all m aterial entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: We do not have exp ertise to comment on this question Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non - taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: We do not have expertise to comment on th is question Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified?

Please explain your response.: We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty fo r failure to do so?: In the current guide to Landfill Tax in England and Scotland, if a weighbridge exists at a landfill site then the Government would expect it to be used. If using a weighbridge would be too costly or if it has broken down then a produc er can ask to agree an alternative method of calculating the weight. If a site has no weighbridge then specified methods are listed in the guidance. If a weighbridge is available, it seems fair that the operator should use it if it is in working order and does not cause excess cost (eg if the waste does pass near the site where the weighbridge exists). Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax ?: We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: We do not have expertise to comment on this question Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Gover nment might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals We do not have expertise to comment on this question 143 Tax evasion?

If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: (Unchecked) 145 Reference 57 Dear Sir/Madam Welsh Government Consultation - Landfill Disposals Tax On behalf of its members, NFU Cymru welcomes the op portunity to be able to respond to the Welsh Government's Consultation on a Landfi ll Disposals Tax for Wales. The consultation poses quite a number of questions, not all of which are directl y relevant or applicable to our membership. We have therefor e confined our answers to those questions which are of greatest relevance and interest to our members. Consultation Questions Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Govern ment maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? NFU Cymru does consider it important that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK and Scottish Government in term s of rates to ensure that Welsh bu sinesses are not disadvantaged. A rise in landfill taxes may act as a disincentive for was te carriers to dispose of waste responsibly, thus leading to an increase in fly -tipping. Landowners who are the victims of fly - tipping would also be left with a greater financial b urden to responsibly dispose of the waste, something which would impact upon legitimate farming businesses. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rat es (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please expl ain your response. The current standard and lower tax rates are acceptable, providing there is no proposal for movements between categories. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government havi ng the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explai ned in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? There is value in the Welsh Government having the ability t o set different, lower rates of tax in order to be able to react quickly to changes in rates across the rest of the UK. It is however difficult to see any merit in setting a rate which is inconsistent with the rates in the rest of the UK. For example in addition to complexity for businesses operating cross border, reducing the rates would risk additional waste b eing brought in to Wales whilst increasing rates risks many farm businesses within Wales finding themselves victims of increased illegal fly tipping. 146 Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? If the list is made narrower, the landfill tax for these material s will rise very significantly, giving a further incentive not to dispose of the waste responsibly. There is a secondary affect that farmers and other landowners would then be left responsibl e for paying for these elevated tax rates, creat ing a greater financial burden. This list gives incentives to producers of waste to pr oduce non-hazardous waste types which have negligible greenhouse gas emissions or impacts on the environment. Industry in general may be less inclined to ensure the waste types they produce are of the same specification if they don't have the incentive of a lower landfill tax. Question 5: What would be the practical implication s of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? Weighbridges are less accessible in rural areas meaning many small -scale rural businesses will be reliant on the waste company to dete rmine whether the proportion of non-quali fying waste was above the threshold. This cou ld lead to exploitation as many would not know what a set tonnage or proportion of waste looks like. Alternative collections for separate waste types in rural areas are less readily available, meaning farmers ar e likely to have to pay more for separation costs or accept the greater landfill tax figures. Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specificall y exempt) is subject to tax? To make a complete response on this it would be benefici al to obtain information on the main waste types which landfill operators claim have a secondary use. Applying a tax to all waste types in all circumstances would hugely increase costs on small -scale farm businesses which produce the waste. As profit margins on these business types are low, this could have a detrimental impact on legitimate business as a whole. Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (n ot subject to tax) and why? A legitimate recovery operation such as the bailing of plastic for reuse should not be taxed. If these waste types and activities become taxed, it will red uce the incentive to recover waste. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for h ow we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what woul d be the practical implications of these? 147 The use of European Waste Catalogue codes is vital to ensure objectivity in the activities which are exem pt. There should be consultation on these activities before their implementation. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? Plastic wrapping used for silaging in agricu lture is often not able to be recovered due to sun and acidic silage effluent damage. Unlike many other processes, there is no alternative material which can be used which is recoverable. Small -scale farm plastic recovery firms offer services to collect this waste. A proportion can be reused but also a proportion has to be landfilled due to damage. If these services did not exist then silage wrapping would blight the countryside. By providing a reduced tax rate on the collection of this material it will pro vide an incentive to maximise the collection and reduce any impact on the rural environment. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? Currently Scotland has a Fixed Penalty Notice which can be issued in response to a fly -tipping event. These are relatively quick and easy to issue and it can be seen how being able to add the cost of landfill tax onto the cost of the fixed penalty not ice is beneficial. Currently in Wales and England this does not exist and we are unsure how enabling landfill tax on fly -tipped waste to be recovered can be enforced. For example, clarity is needed on which regulatory body would be able to charge the landf ill tax. The concern is that landowners would be left to pay extra to clear -up waste which is fly -tipped on their land. There is often huge subjectivity as to whether a landowner 'knowingly permitted' a waste disposal activity to occur on their land. Where landowners hold permits to spread waste to land, there are occasions where the waste operator supplying the waste disposes a different waste type to land than which was initially agreed. It is disproportionate in these circumstances for the landowner to b e left with the financial burden of clearing up the waste and paying extra in tax. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? A common example of tax avoidance is fly -tipping. The prevalence of this would increase with a sudden rise in Welsh landfill tax rates compared to English. It is estimate in 2013/14 remediating fly -tipping events cost local authorities and private landowners in excess of \u00a3100million. Fly -tipping al so impacts on farm businesses - e.g. their operational activities and time burden for surveillance. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? 148 This really related to operators, however from our own experience should an operator be located in a remote rural area there are often significant challenges to the use of electronic returns and online support. Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proport ion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit fr om funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling povert y and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) We believe research into creating a circular economy should be supported e.g. not just looking at ways to recover and recycle waste, but how processes can reduce waste production in the first insta nce. This will aid in reducing waste sent to landfill. The funding should also ensure greater compliance within the waste industry - for example 'duty of care'. There are proposals to introduce a fixed penalty notice (FPN) in England and Wales for fly -tipping events. We believe funding could be spent on implementing FPNs if they are introduced. It is believed this will reduce council and landowner spending each year in remediating after fly - tipping events and reduce the impacts on local communities. Questi on 31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? NFU Cymru does not have any further comments to make on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment. I trust you will find my comments useful, if there is anything that you would l ike to discuss further with me, then please do not hesitate before getting in touch with me . Yours faithfully Huw Thomas NFU Cymru 149 Reference 58 Hello I would like to contribute my thoughts to this consultation please. I feel it is hugely important that the organisation who oversees the grant monies is embedded in the local community and knows the local needs. Grass roots community action is where support is most needed in tackling poverty and other very real issues. There is already in ex istence a local Voluntary Services Council and I feel they have the experience of grant management and providing representation to other grant panels and also know their local areas via their memberships. I there would wish for serious consideration be gi ven to their administration of any community funding. Regards J Smith 150 Reference 59 1. Wales Council for Voluntary Action (WCVA) is a registered charity and umbrella body working to support, develop and represent Wales' third sector at UK and national level. We have over 3,350 organisations in direct membership, and are in touch with many more organisations through a wide range of national and local networks. WCVA's mission is to provide excellent support, leadership and an in fluential voice for the third sector and volunteering in Wales. 2. WCVA is committed to a strong and active third sector building resilient, cohesive and inclusive communities, giving people a stake in their future through their own actions and services, creating a strong, healthy and fair society and demonstrating the value of volunteering and community engagement. WCVA's response 3. WCVA welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Landfill Disposals Tax consultation. As an umbrella body for the third sector in Wales, we are concentrating our response in particular on Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing. Question 27 - Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? 4. Yes, we agree t hat Welsh Government should allocate a proportion of the tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing. 5. A range of third sector organisations in Wales have benefited from the Landfill Communities Fund, and the lack of such a fund when Landfill Tax is devolved would be seen as the removal of an important funding source. 6. Although the projected tax revenues are substantially smaller, and therefore the amount available for Community Wellbeing also smaller, we believe that allocating a proportion of tax r evenue to help address the dis - amenity of living near a landfill site is still an important activity. The fund also provides an opportunity for partnership working between the private sector (landfill site operators) and the third sector. Question 28 - If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals 151 Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of wa ste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) 7. As an umbrella body working to represent and support the breadth of the third sector in Wales, our members will be working in all the above activities, so we are not in a position to prioritise one above another. However, we note that the operation of landfill sites does contribute to environmental degradation and it would seem reasonable for these funds to mitigate this at both an overarching and a local level. 8. We would also suggest some principles for determining how funding should be prioritised. 9. We would suggest that a deci sion is made based on other available sources of funding at the time, and that the community wellbeing funding should be seen 'in the round', as complementing other grants schemes, or providing support where other funding is not available. 10. It is our experience that micro grants can be a very effective tool for mobilising local community -based action. Micro grants, with proportionately light-touch application and monitoring processes, could enable community groups to pilot different approache s, and demonstrate considerable social return on investment. Question 29 - Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? 11. We would suggest that an independent, experienced and trusted intermediary would be able to distribute the gra nt while minimising administrative costs; ensuring effective engagement with the Corporate Social Responsibility requirements of landfill site operators; and sharing successes and learning. Such a body could also administer any match funding, as required. 12. For example, although the proposals come into effect in three years' time, at the time of writing Environment Wales could fulfil the role of administering the funding whilst also providing practical advice and support to ensure effective spend and de livery. 13. Environment Wales is a third sector partnership, currently funded by Welsh Government, with an aim to contribute to sustainable development by 152 supporting and encouraging voluntary action to protect and improve the environment. The core partner s that make up this initiative are Keep Wales Tidy, The National Trust, Wildlife Trusts Wales, WCVA, Groundwork in Wales, and The Woodland Trust. Environment Wales both administers grants schemes and provides dedicated bilingual pan -Wales development suppo rt. A 2014 external evaluation of Environment Wales found that the initiative has levered in significant additional investment since its inception in 1992: \u00a36 for each \u00a31 invested by Welsh Government. The evaluation also found that its model of combining g rant aid with Development Officer facilitation has been successful in achieving attitude and behaviour change from individuals and groups and 'enables groups to achieve long -lasting impact in their locality'. Gareth Coles WCVA 153 Reference 60 Dear Sir I am very concerned about the proposal to end the Landfill Community Fund, one of the few sources of funding for environmental projects in Wales. While I appreciate the problems that lack of finance is causing in the wider a genda, wildlife groups use this sort of funding to leverage so much more effect in terms of protecting our fragile, natural environment. Communities benefit far more, pound for pound, by the use of this funding by organisations such as the Wildlife Trusts because of the added value these groups confer with their use of volunteers, their network of supporters, and their expertise and experience. We are suffering a devastating loss of wildlife - 97% of our wildflower meadows, so vital to supporting pollinat ing species such as bees, have been lost in the last 70 years for example, and species decline in general is accelerating at an alarming rate. We must support these third sector organisations in their attempts to address this decline. The Landfill Commun ity Fund is one of very few sources of funding for these vital projects. It is not just about protecting biodiversity. There is evidence that connecting with nature is hugely beneficial to the people's health and wellbeing. The communities around landfi ll sites deserve the opportunities to enjoy wildlife, and connect with the natural world. I strongly urge the Welsh Government not just to maintain this funding, but to increase the proportion of landfill tax that goes to funding wildlife projects. It really is money well spent.

If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: (Unchecked) 160 Reference 63 Name: Robert Alexander Organisation (if applicable): EEESafe Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: I don't believe its a high importance. Wales has Sustainability at the core of its constitution and should not let the rest of the UK hol d it back from developing a better system. Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: I'm not qualified enough to make this comment. Q3: Is there va lue in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: Yes. So that they are able to respond to economic changes, social circumstances and/or environmental developments. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis?: No Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualif ying waste in a load of qualifying material?: No comment Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: Not qualified to comment. Q7: Are there any problems wit h the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: No Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently remov ed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: Perhaps look at how Landfill site operators choose those they deem worthy to receive funding. They should be allowed to widen the scope to include Social Enterprises who can evidence Waste Prevention in any area of Wales. Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is We deal with Waste Prevention and couldn't comment on what the implications would be on legislating on this basis. 161 specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: We think that Tax Credits should be given where Waste Prevention is evidenced. Waste Preven tion is a higher priority than recycling and reprocessing. See our Page on Sustainability and the engagement of businesses with communities, to understand our views. http://eeesafe.com/sustainability/ Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: No Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or mo dified? Please explain your response.: Not particularly Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: Its now EU Law and therefore increased compliance has probably justified the removal of this discount. Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: Anything that is further up the Waste Hierarchy should be seriously considered for exemptions. If we're evidencing and reducing waste, we have less to tax and then less to burden businesses and communities as we work towards a sustainable living model. Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge wh ere one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: A positive one. One that would provide more accurate figures for forecasting and budget making decisions. Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: More revenue and less waste hopefully. However we think the cost of managing would increase. The return ratio of finance on Waste Crime may have a negative effect. It would be better to offer more education and invest in systems that engage communities in Waste Prevention, particularly where it's easy to engage and there are incentives, such as the o ne offered by our Sustainable Living Platform. http://hub.eeesafe.com/community -csr/ Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: We need to recog nise that Waste is a Resource, and build infrastructure to localise reprocessing. We're doing some work on that but have limited resources. We do however have an Quality Recycled Components Platform that through safe disassembly by our Competent Persons Re gister, we can teach communities how to be Certified and recognise the value 162 at a local level, of many components electrical and cosmetic. The need to penalise would be reduced if we were allowed to develop this in partnership with Local Authorties. The up shot being extremely positive in reducing Waste Arisings, increasing revenues to communities, creating new enterprises locally, reducing harmful emmissions and developing skills with our training course. We believe you should adopt our outside the box thin king on how best to tackle penalites with a carrot and not a stick. Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: You would have to supply more data on the costs of compliance, before we could make an informed comment. For now we refer to our answer in Q16 Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve complian ce and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be?: Our comments are in Q16 and Q17 Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, a nd what is the nature of this?: We are not informed enough to make a comment. Q21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons.: Yes. It must make administration easier in the long rung Q22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?: To be honest, it could put people off as it would appear as more red tape. Despite guidance being available, I think a simple guide with a simplified link to product categories might assist here. You could include the EWC codes alongside that. We are looking at adding EWC Codes into our own Household Items Database, used in our online Waste Prevention shop. This would assist us and others who lease our system, to automatically include the EWC's in community reports. Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support?: Similar to Q22, but our system is available for WG to use through the correct partnership models. Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate?: Yes it should be offered as it's not always the fault of the Site Operator and they shouldn't be unfairly penalised. I think a better system of administration can be put in place to reduce that part of the cost. 163 Q25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: You could use a similar system to Paypal to resolve most of it online, where both parties agree. Then you can follow your existing processes, of which should result in lower costs. Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: This would depend on each circumstance. We cannot comment further tha n that. Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities?: Yes Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: All of the above but I would also advocate where evidence of Waste Prevention exists, those that can provide it should have fundi ng. We offer opportunity to seriously and effectively tackle Poverty, as explained in the next question. Working with our model, we can evidence and reduce impact on the environment and help create jobs in communities with full alignment of the Health & We ll Being Bill. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: We offer an Administrative Model through our LocalitEEE Platform. Many waste Prevention and Community evidence is available through our Platform. We can demonstrate Tonna ge Savings, Volunteer outcomes and Social outcomes in the Circular Economy Model. Short presentation is available. http://bit.ly/localiteee The Model can operate at a National Level as well as a lease option for ind ividual authorities or approved groups. Both can co -exist. We have recently won an award for this. Details at http://hub.eeesafe.com/isustain -winner In our National Model, we are able offer a 35% Inter vention in the form of a Social Currency, which allows people who have earned the currency from volunteer activities, can spend on the shop online to purchase without real cash, goods, food and services required by those who are deemed as vulnerable and li ving in poverty. The Currency is explained here. http://eeesafe.com/eeecoins The current proposals for Reuse/Repair from the WG are extremely expensive, particularly when compared with our Platform 164 and the eviden ce it can provide. We urge Welsh Government to ensure they are getting best return from Taxpayers Money, when it comes to Reuse/Repair and Waste Prevention. We have already discussed our model with some Assembly Members who are supporting our work. Q30: D o you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: no Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment?: no Responses to consultations may be made public - online or in a report. If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: (Unchecked) 165 Reference 64 Natural Resources Wales response to: Welsh Government landfill disposals tax consultation We welcome the opportunity to provide our views on this consultation and recognise that the transfer of tax -raising powers to Welsh Government represents a significant step in devolution in Wales. We are represented on your Wales Landfill Tax Project Board , and Landfill Tax Technical Experts Group. Through these groups we have been working with you to look at the potential role and opportunities for Natural Resource Wales in relation to Welsh Landfill Tax. The purpose of Natural Resources Wales is to seek to achieve sustainable management of natural resources in relation to Wales, and apply the principles of sustainable management of natural resources. Natural Resources Wales works as a regulator, partner and advisor to businesses, non -governmental organisa tions, local authorities and communities to help deliver Welsh Government and European Union policies and priorities. We take an ecosystem approach to promoting integrated natural resource management that delivers social, economic and environmental benefit s for the people of Wales. We indicated in our response to the Welsh Government's consultation on the white paper \"Collection and management of devolved tax in Wales\" that we did not wish to be considered for the collection and management role at this tim e, but recognising there are potential synergies between our existing regulatory role and the forthcoming landfill tax regime, we committed to explore opportunities to deliver a more effective compliance and enforcement regime in Wales, working on the expe ctation that any additional role would be fully funded. I trust you will find these comments and recommendations useful. If you have further queries relating to our comments, please contact Becky Favager, Waste & Resources Manager. Yours Faithfully Ceri Davies Executive Director for Knowledge, Strategy and Planning 166 Response to specific questions Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Sco ttish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? We believe there are significant potential benefits to continued consistency between Welsh Government and the UK and Scottish Governments. The UK Landfill Tax introduced in 1996 was the UK's first environme ntal tax and is a key mechanism in enabling the UK to meet its targets, for the landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste, set out in the Landfill Directive. Landfill Tax is a tax on the disposal of waste at landfill, which provides a strong incentive for waste producers to produce less waste, recover more value from waste, for example, through recycling or composting and to use more environmentally friendly methods of waste management. Through increasing the cost of landfill, other advanced waste treat ment technologies with higher gate fees are made to become more financially attractive. The effectiveness of this tax in changing behaviour has been demonstrated by the reduction of waste disposed at Landfill sites in Wales. Since 2000 the amount of waste disposed at landfills in Wales has reduced from 4.5 million to 2.1 million tonnes in 2013. The proximity of major urban areas on both sides of the Welsh and English Borders means that potential flows of waste could easily be reversed simply by relatively small changes in differential rates. To create incentives to waste tourism to other parts of the UK could impact negatively on Welsh waste management enterprises when bidding against competitor operators from other parts of the UK. Welsh Government should also consider the potential impact on existing and developing long-term regional waste contracts, whilst primarily focussed on managing local authority municipal wastes, the business model would almost certainly include an element of commercial waste, the basis of which, would have been unlikely to have considered or mitigated for different taxation rates. We believe co -operation between administrations in setting rates and fees is desirable if taxation is to achieve optimal environmental responses supporting the management of waste further up the waste hierarchy within appropriate proximity of its arising. We also recognise that stability and certainty are critical to how the business community will respond to any proposals. It would be helpful if any changes were clarified as early and as openly as possible. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. Standard rate We believe that the current standard rate is appropriate for Wales. As highlighted in our response to the previous question, the effectiveness of achieving a gr eater than 50% reduction in disposal of biodegradable municipal waste at landfill, indicates that that the implementation and escalation of the standard rate in tax has been successful. We would be concerned if the level of standard rate applied in Wales i s changed as it could have the potential to negatively distort current waste management practise and weaken a key mechanism to delivering the ambitious targets set in Towards Zero Waste. Page 3 of 10 www.naturalresourceswales.gov.uk 167 Lower, 'inactive' rat e We do not believe that the current lower rate provides enough of an incentive to effectively drive recovery and corresponding diversion from landfill of this waste stream. Since its introduction the inactive rate of Landfill Tax has remained at a low rate and not in pace with price changes in the wider economy. We recognise that it is difficult to separate out the impact of the rate change from that of the global downturn following 2008 and therefore assess the effectiveness of the lower tax rate in driv ing waste producer behaviour or choice of waste management options for qualifying waste types. There are a number of well -established options for recovery which should be encouraged over disposal at landfill and we would support Welsh Government in taking this opportunity to consider increasing the lower rate. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? We would support Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax as this would provide a mechanism for tax rates to respond and support delivery of future policy objectives for Wales or to reflect any changes in England and Scotland . We recommend that the consequence of any actual proposed changes would need to be fully considered before introduction, for example, potential to alter waste flows and impact on waste crime. Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qu alifying for the lower tax rate that should be considered, and on what basis? We believe that there are inherent advantages, highlighted above, in maintaining a consistent approach and keeping the list broadly the same as across the remainder of the UK. We recognise that there is an inconsistency between what is defined as inert for waste regulation purposes and that which is defined as inactive for taxation purposes. Aligning the two classification systems so that only inert materials qualify for the lo wer rate, could incentivise improved management of non -inert waste streams, and however in doing so would have a significant economic impacts on large industrial waste producers in Wales. Any proposed changes would require detailed modelling and the benef its of international experience where available to ensure that all potential outcomes, positive and negative are identified so perverse consequences are avoided. Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? We would strongly recommend that no threshold is introduced to define a small quantity. In our experience of regulating waste facilities, our common sense approach to waste accepta nce is that any non -qualifying waste must be incidental, i.e. present by accident. We anticipate that the practical implications of introducing a threshold will encourage some parts of the industry to use less efficient methods for segregating waste at source and treatment, with even some operators deliberately mixing wastes to achieve the limit set. So introducing a 10% limit will legitimise 10% of higher rate waste to be disposed of at the Page 4 of 10 www.naturalresourceswales.gov.uk 168 lower rate. As we ll as encouraging poor waste management practice this also legitimises tax avoidance. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. We would support the i ntroduction of the Loss on Ignition test in Wales. The LoI test was introduced in response to concerns raised that there was no consistent methods for both operator and regulator to assess whether certain materials attracted the lower or higher rate of tax . We believe that the introduction of a consistent measure is essential if the scheme is to be delivered successfully. The Environmental Services Association has supported the UK scheme in that it creates a level playing field and will reduce misclassifica tion. We note that Scotland have a different methodology from England and recommend that Welsh Government learns from their experience and consults with other bodies before developing any test in Wales. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? We are not aware of any problems with the existing arrangements, although we recognise that there may be potential for confusion between wastes deposited for recovery purposes within a landfill. We would recommend that the taxable disposal area is consistent with the site boundary identified within a landfill facilities environmental permit and operator's management plan. We would also recommend that the landfill operator ensures that they keep an accurate record of intention and final use of the wastes entering the disposal area. Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the cur rent arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? We have no relevant experience of this happening in practise. We would recommend that the landfill operator ensures that t hey keep an accurate of any material removed, including its final destination. Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is s ubject to tax? We would support Welsh Government in taking a common sense approach, so that materials entering the landfill where waste disposal was never the intention are excluded from tax requirements, for example, compaction vehicles. We believe that it would also be useful to ensure that any exemptions are clearly defined. It is essential that operators keep an accurate record is kept all wastes types and quantities. Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) why? We would support Welsh Government considering tax exemptions for activities that promote recycling or recovery of waste over disposal, or the activity offers a clear benefit by reducing unnecessary administrative burden. We believe the exemptions in pla ce under the current regime are appropriate, and therefore should be maintained in the Welsh provisions. These exemptions incentivise the reuse of waste materials on site, where appropriate, without compromising the objectives of the tax regime. 169 Question 1 1: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? We suggest that the operator's management system / site working plan includes information which clearly sets out the location and activities being undertaken. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. We do not believe that removing the exemptions would result in any positive changes in the amount of waste arising and/or encouraging alternative waste management to landfill disposal. For example, there are limited options for the appropriate treatment and disposal of dredgings. Where the dredged material cannot be deposited on the bankside or otherwise recovered the most appropriate option would be disposal at landfill. Removing the exemption would not decrease the amount of waste destined for disposal but could potentially increase costs for public author ities with a responsibility for dredging waterways. We also believe that there are benefits, in maintaining a consistent approach and keeping the exemptions broadly the same as across the remainder of the UK. Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? We would support Welsh Government in considering modification of the water relief discount and recommend that a cost -benefit analysis is undertaken and the potential timescales analysed. The current system encourages the addition of water to waste, increasing the amount of leachate being generated that will require further management to ensure that the environment is appropriately protected. The availability of a water discount relief may also support bad practice of operators in undertaking ineffective pre -treatment of waste prior to landfill. However we do believe it is appropriate to maintain water discount relief in some circumstances, for example, where water has been added to ash to ensure dust suppression or in the disposal of fire damaged materials. We would recommend that Welsh Government considers the potential for limiting the water discount relief to specific wastes and/or circumstances. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new ex emptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? We believe there may be merit in including difficult stable non -reactive (SNR) wastes, such as Asbestos and Gypsum, in the list exempting landfill disposal tax. An important and appropriate wast e management option for disposal of both waste streams is landfill. There are limited asbestos and no gypsum disposal facilities in Wales. The sensitive handling required for both materials means that they are likely to be illegally dumped and/or deliberat ely mis -described resulting in inappropriate management putting the environment and human health at risk. Providing an incentive for these specific wastes to qualify may encourage responsible management of wastes. We would also support the introduction of an exemption for public authorities, such as Natural Resources Wales and the Local Authorities, who have responsibility to clear and dispose of fly tipped and illegally deposited waste. This would reduce the financial burden on the public purse and may en able waste to be clearly more quickly. 170 Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty fo r failure to do so? We do not believe that there would be any practical implications of obliging operators to use a weighbridge, as our understanding is that all permitted landfill sites in Wales have a weighbridge. We recognise that we may become aware of potential breaches of this obligation through our compliance activities and would ensure that this information is shared with the appropriate body. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? We believe that introducing this measure may act as an additional deterrent to illegally depositing waste. However Welsh Government should be aware that this measure will only become effecti ve if sufficient evidence is gathered to undertake successful enforcement action. There are some practical implications that we recommend Welsh Government further consideration, such as; ld Welsh Government expect every illegal deposit to be assessed and who would take responsibility for undertaking the assessment? - we use the avoided costs (legitimate disposal) figures to prove criminal benefit. It would b e duplicitous to expect a Defendant to pay a Confiscation Order based on his criminal benefit and then expect them to repay the taxation which, essentially, will already be covered by the POCA proceedings. Excluding the legitimate disposal would reduce the total benefit assessment, which could reduce the amount of funds payable under the confiscation order and the subsequent funds returned back to the regulators Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? We have no experience of the penalty regime, however we would recommend that Welsh Government consider the development or implementation of the penalty scheme to deliver the Hampton1 principles as follows; Six Penalties Principles A sanction should: Aim to change the behaviour of the offender; Aim to eliminate any financial gain or benefit from non -compliance; Be responsive and consider what is appropriate for the particular offender and regulatory issue, which can include punishment and t he public stigma that should be associated with a criminal conviction; Be proportionate to the nature of the offence and the harm caused; Aim to restore the harm caused by regulatory non -compliance, where appropriate; and 171 Aim to deter future non -complia nce. Seven characteristics of a successful sanctioning regime Regulators should: Publish an enforcement policy; Measure outcomes not just outputs; Justify their choice of enforcement actions year on year to stakeholders, Ministers and Parliament; Follow -up enforcement actions where appropriate; Enforce in a transparent manner; Be transparent in the way in which they apply and determine administrative penalties; and Avoid perverse incentives that might influence the choice of sanctioning response . Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. Our perception is that currently there is little on the gr ound compliance activity undertaken, which may not pose an effective regulatory framework. We support Welsh Government's aspiration to increase compliance with the tax regime, and believe there are significant benefits in undertaking on the ground site com pliance activities as it will allow the regulating officer to check compliance and compare actual site practise against the site management documentation and record keeping. We also believe that on the ground presence will be essential to ensure that the L oI tests are being undertaken properly. We also the recognise the benefits that having an effective tax compliance would have on protecting the environment, for example, operators ensuring inactive and active wastes are appropriately described would ensur e that the correct amount of tax is levied and that the wastes are properly managed. It would also support more effective segregation of wastes at source and pre -treatment, providing increased opportunity to recycle and recover more materials. We will co ntinue to work with Welsh Government to explore any potential role that we may have in compliance or enforcement of this regime, to ensure that we are fully funded and that there is a resilient level of knowledge and skills present to enable us to deliver any role effectively. Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? We recognise, that there are opportunities and synergies in delivery of this activity to achieve shared outcomes. Examples include improving information sharing and coordination, and potential to reduce administrative burdens on business es, through new policy approaches. We will continue to work with you on these opportunities through our representation on your Project Board and Technical Experts Group. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Lan dfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? We have no evidence of tax avoidance. 172 Chapter 4: Administration Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. Yes we would support align ing the tax return period to a financial year. Landfill operators are required to submit a quarterly summary of the waste received on site, this is an important information source to cross -check the accuracy of the tax return submission. Aligning the tax r eturn periods will simplify this cross -checking. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? We would support the use of the European Waste Catalogues (EWC) codes in the completion of the tax return as this is the classification system used for waste regulation purposes and is the basis of the waste return summary highlighted above. If both return s use the same classification system this will improve the ability to cross -check the information. We highlighted the difference in categorisation of inactive (for tax purposes) and inert (for waste regulation purposes), to help overcome this difference i t would be useful if the inactive list was translated into the associated EWC. There will be some codes that are more difficult to directly translate, for example 19 12 12 - Other wastes (including mixtures of materials) from mechanical treatment of wastes . Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? We recognise that the number of landfill operations in Wales is likely to decrease significantly by 2018, an d that the expense associated with developing an electronic system will be a consideration for Welsh Government. We would be happy to share the experience we've gained from developing replacement IT system for waste permits and returns, following decouplin g from the Environment Agency. We have designed the overall architecture for our regulatory IT systems to be modular to facilitate additional functionality to be built in if required, including automatic validation or quality assurance checks. In our exper ience this provides a cost - effective way of providing an electronic system. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? Question 26: In your view, are there any excepti onal circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? We have no comment on these questions. Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing 173 Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities ? We would strongly support the allocation of a proportion of the Landfill Disposal Tax (LDT) revenue to be used to enhance the wellbeing of communities. Question 2 8: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) We would support the use of the LDT revenue to support compliance and enforcement and recognise the wider potential benefits that an effective enforcement regime could bring to community wellbeing. We are aware of the success that the Environment Agency ha s been able to deliver, to reduce waste crime with additional funding, this could also lead to greater amount of tax captured. We also recognise and support the use of this funding in tackling poverty and deprivation via biodiversity initiatives and wide r environmental improvements. It is well documented that the wider benefits of a healthy environment on communities, urban and rural, so activity that encourages access to quality outdoor space, environmental improvement work, habitat restoration and biodi versity enhancements are very welcome and important to local communities as well as wider ecosystems. An example of how we believe the funds could be put to use is woodland creation in areas of greater social deprivation. This would allow regeneration of f ormer industrialised areas whilst promoting health and well -being agenda through provision of attractive open green spaces. This can drive economic regeneration, opportunities for flood alleviation and education opportunities for the community. A significa nt number of sites brought forward annually for action are associated with past waste management practices (e.g. closed landfills/closed tips). We have benefited directly from some small amounts of LCF funding, and would wish to be able to eligible for fu nding but also recognise the great importance of this funding for third sector partners in delivering biodiversity and community outcomes. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? We consider that there are opportuniti es to simplify and improve efficiency of the administration of this fund, particularly as we recognise that the total size of the fund is estimated to be around \u00a31M and diminishing. A model that it might be worth looking at might be the Welsh Government's Aggregate Levy Fund, with a cross - sector assessment panel including WG, Landfill Operators, NRW and other parties, although we think a flexible timetable is essential to support partners to find match and \"contributing third party\" funding. 174 Reference 65 Name: Florence Bullough Organisation (if applicable): The Geological Society Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales?

An important area of activity that is omitted in th e consultation document is geoconservation and the protection of geologically important sites. Many of our Fellows and people in the wider geoconservation community have expressed concern about the lack of awareness, support and protection of important geo logical sites in Wales. The inclusion of geoconservation activities in the remit of the Landfill Communities Fund would help to improve the maintenance of these sites and also enhance the public's appreciation and understanding of this amenity. Wales is ho me to vast number of geological sites that are of great importance to research and education in geoscience, some of global significance. They also form a crucial part of the history of geology and serve as a 177 major tourist draw to Wales. Wales is home to ma ny established geotourism sites including National Parks, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Geoparks and others. Some of these sites were highlighted in The Geological Society's 100 Great Geosites project which launched to much media attention in late 2014. Many of the less well known sites represent an important knowledge source to locals as well as people from the rest of the UK and around the world. Time and place are important factors in the study of geology: key geological outcrops that underpin ou r understanding of the planet we live on are not replicated elsewhere and are unique to a specific location, so conservation of regional sites is very important. They also inspire great enthusiasm on the part of many local geoconservation groups and amateu r geologists and contribute to a sense of pride in the regionality of local geology. Visitors to Wales' vast areas of natural beauty and geological heritage contribute significantly to the Welsh economy. Aside from the more established sites, there is a we alth of scientifically and historically important geological sites in Wales that are not used or promoted in the most beneficial way. Allocation of funds from the Landfill Disposal Tax revenue to geoconservation could significantly improve care and mainten ance of areas of geological importance as well as enhancing access to this public amenity through activities such as raising awareness of Welsh geology and generating branded promotional materials including installation of geological interpretation panels and maps of local sites. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: The Geological Society is the UK's learned and professional body for geoscience, with more than 11,500 Fellows (members) worldwide. The Fellowship encompasses those working in industry, academia and government with a broad range of perspectives on policy -relevant science, and the Socie ty is a leading communicator of this science to government bodies, those in education, and other non -technical audiences.

This fund is essential if Wales is to reverse the terrible loss of wildlife including 60% of UK species be ing in decline and more than 1 in 10 species in the UK being under threat of extinction. Welsh Gov projects such as those to increase wildflower populations will suffer if related projects funded by landfill tax do not take place due to lack of funding. Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: I urge the Welsh Government to maintain as a minium current funding and if possible increase the percentage of landfill tax that goes to funding wildlife projects to 10%.

Health & wellbeing benefits of the natural environment are well documented in academic research. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Supporting work that; a) improves ecolocy and increases biodiversity, b) protects the natural environment c) helps improve community wellbeing (i.e. via access to open space) d) offers training and or work experience opportunities that help tackle poverty and deprivation ia constiuted bodies such as Charities, Community Groups, Social Enterprise and or Community Interest Companies.

If Wales can set its own rate then it can determine which it wants to do. Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your resp onse.: If the levels are different it will promote the movement of waste across borders. It depends if you think this is a good thing or not. Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: If WG would like to attract the resource of waste into Wales then lower tax would provide an attraction. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be con sidered, and on what basis?: Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material?: The issues are with policing this and who is responsible. Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: An LOI test is required to be consistent with England. Unless you wish to push waste away OR draw it is? Q7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material per manently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: A landfill site is a 3 dimensional form with different areas of the site subject to different activities at different times. For example you would not want to penalise a company that wants to improve upon the minimum restoration cap thickness. Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: Engineering, daily cover, fluff layers over liner and below cap Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? 186 Please explain your response.: Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: Most transactions are undertaken by weight. No pratical implications for t his. Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: This would be good it should cover illegal waste deposition and the costs that criminals h ave avoided. Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: AS I understand it illegal waste disposal sites are not required to pay the avoided landfill tax. They should be and even at a higher penalty rate. Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be?: Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this?: Q21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons.: We operate two landfill sites and to assist our cash flow we have the sites on differe nt quarter dates. We use the third month of the quarter to make our VAT payments. Q22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?: If the waste is comi ng out of transfer stations or pre -treatment facilities it will have a 19 code so what would the benefit be. Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support?: Returns are quite straight forward now. Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate?: Q25: Have you any comments on the operation 187 of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities?: Yes Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wi der environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Compliance and Enforcement: NO.

The Landfill Communit ies Fund provides funding to a vast number of projects that would otherwise struggle to find funding in the current economic climate; the overall scheme is very popular and the Biffa Award programme always receives far more applications than the sums available for distribution. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement an d minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Biodiversity initiatives; wider environment improvements; and tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - these would have the most direct impact on those local communities that are near to landfill sites, enhancing their wellbeing. Other community projects such as improvements to community hubs and amenities, eg village halls and sports clubs, should also be considered as these types of projects remain consistently popular, making up a high percentage of the types of applications which are funded u nder the current scheme, and often without many alternative funding sources available. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: If a Third Party Contribution is required under the new scheme, then the regulations around who ca n provide this should be relaxed so it is less complex and that it is compliant for small charities or community organisations to raise and provide this through general fundraising and ordinary reserves held. This may also prevent delays to that part of th e process, speeding up the administrative procedures and helping ensure that monies flow through the scheme and are spent out in a timely manner.

Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimis ation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: If money raised and distributed increase in addition to protecti ng and enhancing biodiversity nad natural environment wellbeing benifits to people or communities might include training or work experience opportunities that help tackle poverty and deprivation. Money should only be made available to Charities, Constitute d Community Groups, Social Enterprises and Coops. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: It needs to be simple. All to often administration in Wales is much more complex and time consuming that that found in England and Scotland. Welsh Government must at all costs avoid the invoplvement of local authorities given their inability to be cost effective.

The Woodland Trust (WT) welcomes the opportunity to respond to this consultation. The Trust is a charity receiving no statutory funding, relying on donations from a wide range of sources, and some operationally related income. We receive funding from var ious landfill operators through the Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) in Wales and throughout the UK. This response focuses only on those questions that are most relevant to us, and is set in the context of the vital part that Landfill funding plays for us in Wales, and the threats and opportunities that we see. 2. The Trust is the UK's leading woodland conservation charity. Operating since 1972, the Trust is the UK's leading woodland conservation charity. We have three aims: to protect native woods, trees and their wildlife for the future; to enable the creation of more native woods and places rich in trees and to inspire everyone to enjoy and value woods and trees. We have over 500,000 members and supporters across the United Kingdom. We manage over 1, 000 woods, over 100 of them in Wales cover 1,580 hectares (3,900 acres). Wales is one of the least wooded countries in Europe, with woodland making up just 14% of the landscape and less than half of this is native. 3. Over the life of the Landfill Disposal s Tax WT has registered over 800 projects through Entrust which has resulted in funding of well over \u00a310million towards our environmental and community outcomes throughout the UK. Financial Context 4. DEFRA has reported that delivering against the Governmen t's Biodiversity 2020 targets costs in the order of \u00a3425m per year and that there is currently a shortfall of around \u00a3100m against this, increasing year on year - meaning that targets are not being met, environmental degradation is continuing and the best efforts of the voluntary sector to deliver are not being supported and mobilised. 5. 'Where the Green Grants Went, 6' (Environment Funders Network, 2014) and its predecessors have reported that, of philanthropic and 195 grant giving in the UK, less than 5 % go es towards environmental causes despite the environment being the backdrop to the lives and wellbeing of people in the UK. This incredibly low level has long been the case and shows no sign of improvement despite the huge climate challenges that we are fa cing, including flooding and tree disease. 6. It is also in stark contrast to the ever growing awareness of the importance of the natural environment to tackling some of the great policy challenges of the age such public health and climate change. For examp le, the Natural Capital Committee has recently called for the creation of a further 250, 000 ha of new woods close to people but it is clear that central government is only going to be prepared to fund a small proportion of this (Natural Capital Committee Third Report 'The State of Natural Capital' (2015)). Recent work carried out for the Woodland Trust by Europe Economics has placed the total value to society of UK woodland at \u00a3270 billion excluding the health and water benefits of which there is a growing awareness. Qu. 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? : 7 It is important that consistency is maintained to avoid the risk of \"Waste Tourism\" ei ther side of the Wales/England borders. Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? : 8 The Woodland Trust supports the continuation of the fund. 9 We propose that a proportion of the tax should continue to be allocated towards directly enhancing the wellbeing of communities through biodiversity projects rather than all of the tax being absorbed into the general Welsh Government budget. Waste is an e nvironmental pollutant and landfill sites have a negative environmental impact so we therefore strongly feel that the fund should benefit environmental projects and the allocated funds should be kept separate to help mitigate the impacts. Creating new lan dfill sites will always be highly controversial, yet there continues to be a need for them, albeit hopefully at a lower level than in the past. The existence of the Landfill Fund at least gives the communities concerned some indication that they are likel y to benefit from them in some way. 10 We advocate that a higher percentage of the fund should support Biodiversity as this benefits the community through recreation and wellbeing as well as benefiting habitats and wildlife. Under Object DA, the LCF is also one of the few remaining funding str eams that maintain 196 a direct interest in Biodiversity. Indeed, against the wider backgrounds of austerity and a funding community rarely focussed on nature conservation, this fund is increasingly essential (Where the Green Grants Went 6). 11 The LCF has: - allowed important habitats to be restored to help safeguard Wales' rich, but drastically declining, biodiversity provided healthy green spaces for people to enjoy and connect with nature supported volunteering and skills development opportunities for loc al communities 12 It also helps to support the Well Being Goals in the Well Being of Future Generations Act 2015, especially in creating A Resilient Wales - \"A nation which maintains and enhances a bio diverse natural environment with healthy functioning ec osystems that support social, economic and ecological resilience and the capacity to adapt to change (for example climate change)\" 13 The LCF is one way that the Finance Ministry can discharge their statutory duties to conserve and enhance biodiversity under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, especially in meeting the responsibility to take account of biodiversity and more particularly to conserve species and habitats listed under section 42 of that Act. 14 At the Woodland Trust we have reg istered over 800 projects through Entrust which has resulted in funding of well over \u00a310million throughout Wales, Scotland and England. Not only has this had a direct financial benefit through biodiversity projects for wildlife, habitats and communities, it also forms the basis of match funding which typically levers in other private funding at a ratio of 1:4 (so each \u00a31 of Landfill Tax will attract a further \u00a34 investment into those communities and their environment). 15 Diluting the income through the gene ral taxation pot would reduce the visibility of the impacts that currently so clearly demonstrate its benefits. As the fund is currently a private scheme it does not need to be diverted to align with Government policy, so it can continue to enhance the ar eas most affected by the impact of landfill. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting complia nce and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - 197 Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify). 16 We would advocate the use of funds towards Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. Biodiversity funding is extremely limited whereas other funding needs such as waste minimisation and tackling poverty do have alternative opportunities especially through market mechanisms. We would further suggest that because the tax is generated by landfill, which has a negative impact on the environment, then it is right to ensure that the fund is used to achieve environmenta l improvements and local Biodiversity. 17 There are a number of key benefits to supporting Biodiversity initiatives which include: - Climate change mitigation, A wide range of improved health benefits including improved air quality, mood improvements and im proved health outcomes such as enhanced birth weight Improvements to water and soil quality Important aesthetic benefit to local communities and visitors. 18 To provide you with the background and research into this area a attached a copy of our recent commissioned report 'The Economic Benefits of Woodland' is attached. 19 If funding is diluted or diverted away from supporting environmental projects that will impact on the opportunity to hit specific environmental Welsh Government commitments such as halti ng the loss of Biodiversity by 2020. LCF -funded wildlife projects contribute to Wales' key environmental objectives and legal obligations: - halting and reversing the loss of wildlife/biodiversity by 2050 (with interim targets for 2020) ensuring all statu tory designated sites (such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and Special Areas for Conservation (SACs)) are in favourable condition by 2026 - with interim targets for 2015 20 LCF has been absolutely vital to the success of the Woodland Trust and we would not have been able to achieve so much without the direct support of this scheme; it has often been our first confirmed funder which has then helped us to secure support from other funders to enable the project to happen. When we do have severa l funders contributing to elements of a project this can leverage much larger scale funding, spreads the risk and delivers greater overall impact. LCF has also been the final funder on a number of occasions so without them the work would not have been abl e to be completed. The funds we receive at times may seem like a small part of the project 198 funding but they ensure we can complete a large scale and long term positive result. 21 An example of this is how we have been able to develop our ancient woodland at Plas Power near Wrexham with the help of three landfill funders. Their investment allowed us to work with the visitors' centre there to bring the local community into the wood by improving access, creating and updating way markers and interpretation board s as well as creating an interactive maze and running a number of events. The effect of this was that more people felt able to explore this beautiful location and increase their confidence to enjoy such a wonderful piece of natural heritage. The longer t erm impact is to increase the community's sense of ownership and attachment to the woods, and reduce any anti -social behaviour or environmental damage. It has been a very successful project and just would not have been possible without our landfill partne rs. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? : 22 It should be a clear and effective administration process; either through one third sector provider (there are existing organisations who would be able to deliver this combined d istribution of funds) or by individual third sector organisations as currently happens, this will show a clear and transparent flow of funds clearly audited and one step away from Governmental influence. This should not be handled by a Government departme nt as this could mean that the funds might be drawn into other requirements and will not show the benefits that it currently achieves. There should be no duplicate process set up that would add complexity and administrative burden to DEBs and charities an d would mean less money for good causes. 23 It would be beneficial to widen the definition from landfill sites to 'landfill sites and related activities (such as depots and transfer stations)'. This will ensure that more stakeholders will benefit from this opportunity across Wales. 24 The administrative model should follow a simplified process and provide the key benefits for the landfill operator, such as PR related to their support for good causes, in order to secure their continued support for the fund and thereby its ongoing success. 25 Multiyear projects would enable us to look at projects that have a larger impact on the natural environment as the action/work is so subject to seasonal constraints (weather affected access, presence of breeding species, seas onal dependencies etc) that it very often may take a couple of years to complete to maximum effect 199 26 It is vital to recognise that there is a big difference between 'unspent' funds and funds retained by a DEB but already allocated for multiple - year projects , released on a yearly basis. . It must be recognised that funds committed through a contract are not easy to spend within short timescales. Indeed, it is vital for the success of conservation projects to have funders who can commit to funding medium te rm projects (3 -5 years). Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? : 7 The Woodland Trust activity in Wales would be where it is now without the support of the LCF. Our projects have a direct impact on the Welsh stakeholders. As an organisation we are only the custodians of the project we run that are open to all residents in the vicinity. 8 Everyone benefits from trees, woods and forests even if they never see or touch a tree, or walk in a wood. We all rely on the natural world to supply us with the essentials of life such as clean air, water, food and fuel. Trees offer other riches too: our lives would be far poorer without their place in our landscapes, literature, la nguage and livelihoods. Our spiritual and practical connections with trees and woods go back centuries and millennia but are now lost for many people. It is time to renew that cultural connection with trees and woods to bring them back into all our lives . The LCF can help to achieve this and we very much hope that it will be part of this connection into the future. The Woodland Trust, Kempton Way, Grantham, LINCOLNSHIRE NG31 6LL www.woodlandtrust.org Trust Ymddiriedolaeth Natur Gwent Developing a Landfill Disposals Tax Consultation Response About: Gwent Wildlife Trust (GWT) was established in 1963 and is a registered charity. It is a member of the largest voluntary organisation concerned with all aspects of the protection and enhancement of our natural heritage - the Wildlife Trusts Partnership. Wi th over 10,000 members, GWT aims to protect and enhance the wildlife of Gwent, and encourage public enjoyment and awareness of local wildlife for all with its vision of an environment rich in wildlife for everyone. We work to inspire people about the natur al world and to encourage individual action for wildlife. Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Gwent Wildlife Trust agrees that a proportion of Landfill Di sposals Tax should be allocated to enhance the wellbeing of communities. We also advocate that not only should the specific focus of the fund remain on biodiversity delivery, but that a higher percentage of tax returns should be diverted towards this schem e (e.g. currently the LCF is funded by 5.7% of the Landfill Disposals Tax, we recommend that it is increased to 10%). Projects that are enabled through the Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) contribute significantly to Welsh environmental objectives such as halting biodiversity loss, ensuring favourable condition for SSSIs, SACs and SPAs, creating resilient ecosystems and providing accessible natural greenspace. LCF projects deliver an enormous quantity of added benefits. On a broad scale, biodiversity deliv ers ecosystem services that positively affect our health and wellbeing. Individual projects provide jobs, training opportunities for the unemployed, volunteering opportunities, community resources, educational facilities and much more. For example, Veolia funded a restoration and enhancement project at Gwent Wildlife Trust's Great Traston Meadows nature 201 reserve, where much of the work was carried out by a substance misuse support group - giving them skills and much needed confidence. Whilst there are conce rns regarding unspent funds and high administrative costs, we believe that these can be addressed through monitoring and regulation. As a recipient of LCF funding, we have strict reporting schedules and claims procedures to ensure that money is spent where it's most needed. It is also important to note that there is a difference between unspent funding, and funding that is allocated, but held for release at certain stages of a long term project. And whilst excessive administrative costs are to be avoided, i t is important to recognise that administrative support is essential - for office space and IT, and supervision and management of staff. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wel lbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? Gwent Wildlife Trust supports funding for biodiversity initiatives, and would not like to see this diluted by broader objectives. In the current economic climate, as a charity we are finding it ever more difficult to fund our work, our members cannot afford to be as generous, and there is increased competition for fewer grants. Natural Resources Wales is facing funding cuts. Lack of funding was identified as a key factor in Wales' failure to meet the 2010 target to halt biodiversity loss. The Landfill Communities Fund is one of very few that grants are specifically dedicated to biodiversity. At a time when our wildlife is in crisis, there needs to be funding allocated to protecting our ecosystems. As already stated, LCF projects bring social and economic benefits in addition to their environmental focus. Areas with high biodiversity and natural green spaces are associated with bette r physical and mental health, stronger sense of place and community and even higher house prices. Question 29 : Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? Gwent Wildlife Trust supports the use of Distributive Environmental Bodies, as these have the expertise to support applicants and are regulated by being registered companies. We would support a relaxation of the eligibility criteria from within 10 miles of a landfill site, to within approximately 20 miles of a landfill site or site for other waste related activities (such as waste transfer stations). More projects would be able to benefit, as the current restriction runs the risk of exhausting the provision of projects in closer proximity. 202 Good grants schemes, in our experience: Take a long -term approach, recognising that certain activities are seasonal, and that environmental change is slow - 3 to 5 year projects are more valuable tools for environmental work than 1 year projects Support the continuation of existing successful proje cts, as well as new initiatives Work with existing plans, frameworks and partnerships, such as LBAPs Are flexible, both in their decision making and in terms of managing grants Provide for reasonable administrative and management costs Accept applications on a continual cycle, or fix their application and decision schedules well in advance, allowing applicants to plan accordingly Require strict, but not onerous, reporting, against clear objectives Sorrel Jones, Conservation Officer Ian Rappel, CEO Gwent Wildlife Trust 203 Reference 73 Name: Mr Ceri Evans Organisation (if applicable): Amgen Cymru Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: Very important. Need to ensure consistency across all Governments to dissuade \"Waste Tourism\" Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your respons e.: Along with diversion targets, the standard rate has now reached the level where it has had the desired effect in promoting recycling and diverting waste from landfill, especially municipal waste. Increase in the lower rate may need to be considered if the Welsh Governemnt wants to provide extra incentive to promote further recycling in the Construction / Demolition and Industrial sectors. Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in pa ragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: Yes. With Scotland having the ability to set its own rates, need for Welsh Government to have the same powers as a means to rreact where necessary. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis?: Consideration to Bonded Asbestos. Limited or no environemntal effect from leaching and gas generation. Material potentially stabilised. Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material?: Would be better than current system with defined threshold, although still open to abuse for reasons mentioned in consultaion document with mix ing of wastes after sampling. Currently disconnect between tax and environmntal laws. Materials on qualifying list can fail Inert WAC thresholds. Opportunity to align both with 3% limit. Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition ( LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: Yes, needs to be included form the outset to avoid confusion, unlike Scotland recently. Need to maintain consistency across all Governments to avoid \"Waste Tourism\". Q7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: No views. Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill materi al permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: No views. Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material \"Landfill\" sites now undertake a diverse range of recycling activites within their boundaries. 204 entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exe mpt) is subject to tax?: Use of information areas and prescribed disposal activity descriptions and notifications seems to work. Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: No views. Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non - taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: No views. Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response.: No views. Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: In 12 years experience have only had two instances of this exemption being applied. Not onerous to landfill operator if exemption remains. Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: No views. Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: None to ourselves as already use a weighbridge. Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: None to ourselves. But agree with the need to increase the financial penalty and thus deterent for those flytipping. Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: No views. Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the gro und, rather than desk - based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: Yes. Agree with comments in paragraph 3.31. HMRC officers now based in Newcastle whereas previously in Swansea. Q19: Are there any fu rther actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be?: Ensure appropriate funding, comm unication, sentencing and financial penalties apply in the processes of compliance and enforcemnt. Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this?: No views. Q21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please No views. 205 explain your reasons.: Q22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?: None for ourselves. Ability to report landfill tax rates against EWC codes exists. Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support?: Provide for the option of online filin g in additon to electronic payment alongside that of the paper based approach. Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate?: Yes, as existing circumstances. Q25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: No views. Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: No views. Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities?: Response to be provided directly b y Environmental Body. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Response to be provided directly by Environmental Body. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: Response to be provided directly by Environmental Body. Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: No views. Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment?: No views. Responses to consultations may be made public - online or in a report. If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: (Checked) 206 Reference 74 Please record my objections to the proposal to divert funding away from wildlife projects. The wildlife organisations, particularly the Trusts, are already under threat of less funding due to the setting up of the NRW and the cost cutting involved. It is the responsibility of a government to look after its flora and fauna and these decisions giv e the public the impression that they are reneging on that undertaking. The hundreds of volunteers in wildlife conservation need support and it gives the impression that the government considers their work of secondary importance. Yours sincerely R Williams Chair Bridgend Biodiversity Committee 207 Reference 75 Dear Sirs Consultation on Landfill Disposals Tax (Number WG24170) PricewaterhouseCoopers (We) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Consultation Document, issued on 24 February 2015. We have included our comments below for your consideration. A summary of our responses is set out immediately below under each heading. Our detailed response to each question is enclosed at Appendix 1. Our comments in respect of tax rates and taxable disposals In our opinion, maintaining consistency with landfill tax rates imposed by the UK and Scottish Governments will ease the devolution process and minimise the risk of cross border transportation of waste, i.e. customers se eking to move waste across borders to take advantage of more favourable tax rates. However, the Welsh Government may wish to consider introducing the ability to set different lower rates of tax from those imposed by the UK and Scottish Governments to incre ase its flexibility to respond to socio -economic and technological developments. Consideration might also be given to aligning tax legislation more closely with environmental legislation to simplify administrative and operative processes. The introduction of a threshold to define a small quantity of non -qualifying waste should provide greater certainty for landfill site operators, but careful consideration will need to be given to how this is implemented to ensure consistency of treatment b etween landfill site operators and prevent potential difficulties. Legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax could potentially remove much of the current uncertain ty around the tax treatment of certain activities. This will also provide the Welsh Government with an opportunity to align exemptions with activities that are necessary for environmental reasons, and enable the Welsh Government to drive environmental poli cy and also react to economical/technological changes. However, introducing new exemptions could potentially increase the risk of cross border transportation of waste and give rise to issues in respect of EU law. 208 We believe the continuing availability of water discount relief would be welcomed, but consider that the Welsh Government has an opportunity to remove much of the uncertainty surrounding this relief. Our comments in respect of compliance and enforcement Our view is that the Welsh Government shoul d maintain the potential for landfill site operators to agree alternative methods of weight calculation where the use of a weighbridge is impractical. Increased compliance activity on the ground will improve the effectiveness of compliance operators. To a ssist in this process the Welsh Government may wish to consider the involvement of National Resources Wales in this process. Our comments in respect of administration Our view is that the Welsh Government should consider reducing the administrative burden on landfill site operators by aligning landfill tax return periods with environmental reporting periods or site operators' own accounting periods. A failure to align landfill tax return periods with environmental reporting periods could increase the adm inistrative burden on site operators. Maintaining the current paper based filing procedures may mitigate the financial impact for the Welsh Government of introducing the new tax as it will obviate the requirement for potentially costly electronic systems implementation. We consider that the bad debt relief rules should be maintained and possibly extended to shorten the timescale within which relief can be claimed. The Welsh Government might also want to consider extending the current appeals procedures to include customers of landfill sites. Our comments in respect of Community Wellbeing We do not have any comments on this section. We trust tha t these comments are helpful. Yours faithfully PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Appendix 1 Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals 209 Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? Maintaining consistency of landfill tax rates with those set by the UK and Scottish Governments will minimise the risk of cross border transportation of waste, as differential tax rates or tax treatments may cause waste to be moved across country borders. This is particularly relevant for those sites which are close to the English/ Welsh border. Consistency of treatment would also ease introduction of the new Welsh tax as landfill site operators would be operating under rules with which they are already familiar. This would hopefully reduce the risk of non -compliance, and mitigate the requirement for comprehensive guidance and day to day involvement on behalf of the Welsh Revenue Authority. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please e xplain your response. We consider that to maintain consistency with the UK and Scottish landfill tax policies and to avoid the risk of cross border transportation of waste, the current rates should be maintained however see our response to Question 3. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? In our opinion the ability to set different lower rates of tax would enable the Welsh Government to respo nd to economic changes, social circumstances and/or environmental developments. This flexibility may be desirable to the Welsh Government, given that rates have historically been determined for the UK market and, as such, a degree of fluctuation may be dee med necessary to reflect the specific requirements of the Welsh economy. The Welsh Government might also wish to consider at some point the introduction of additional tax bands to discourage the disposal of specific materials and/or to incentivise the a doption and development of specific alternative treatment and recycling technologies. However, drafting a definition of waste qualifying for the different rates of tax would need careful consideration to avoid introducing complexity and confusion into wh at is currently a relatively simple tax. Implementing a clear and simple tax is especially important given the relatively low amount of revenue that is expected to be derived from landfill disposals tax in Wales. The above comments are also relevant in r espect of other questions in this document where the Welsh Government is able to include a degree of flexibility in respect of the way in which the new tax is legislated/administered. 210 Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? In our view there is currently a disconnect between the tax legislation which defines the types of waste which is subject to the lower rate of tax, and the definitions of in ert waste in environmental legislation. There may be an opportunity to align the definitions leading to administrative and operative simplifications. The list of qualifying materials was identified by the Treasury by reference to criteria published by HMRC under section 42(5) Finance Act 1996. These criteria were that waste subject to the lower rate should be as follows. \"Non -hazardous Wastes which are not 'hazardous' within the meaning of the Council Directive on Hazardous Waste (91/689/EEC). (This is likely to be superseded shortly by the revised Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC).) Low potential for greenhouse gas emissions Wastes which are not bio -degradable, have a low organic content or do not break down under the anaerobic conditions tha t prevail in landfill sites to produce methane. These include inert waste within meaning given under the Landfill Directive; and waste with little or no organic content such as inorganic residues or completely combusted residues from the incineration of biodegradable/organic wastes. Low polluting potential in the landfill environment Waste where the contaminants are unlikely to become mobile in the landfill and any leachate produced has little or no pollution potential. Where the pollution potential of the waste is reduced if deposited alone in mono -fill landfill sites or within separate cells (not mixed with other wastes) within a landfill site. The engineering requirements for the landfill are lower that would be the case for a non -hazardous landfill (as laid out in the Landfill Directive) by virtue of a risk assessment agreed with the regulator. The aftercare period and requirements are significantly lower than would normally be required for a non -hazardous waste landfill, based on a risk assessment agreed with the regulator.\" Under the Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011 the waste does not have to be inert in order to qualify for the lower rate of tax. Similarly, not all wastes that meet the criteria and which could be considered as ine rt waste under environmental legislation, are included in the list of qualifying materials. In practice, where waste streams are mixed and can contain a number of materials this can lead to confusion. Revenue & Customs' Briefs 15/12 and 18/12 highlight th e fact that site operators have experienced difficulty in 211 determining the correct tax treatment of fines from recycling facilities and transfer stations. Some landfill site operators have applied the lower rate of tax, while others have applied the standar d rate of tax. This causes issues for operators in the market and, as a result, we believe it may have led to some difficulties in the past, based on the different tax treatment adopted by different operators. New legislation and guidance was implemented in the UK with effect from 1 April 2015 to deal specifically with fines from mechanical treatment plants. However, there remains ambiguity in relation to other qualifying materials, as well as to the level of non -qualifying materials which can be present before the load must be taxed at the standard rate. In our view the application of the lower rate of tax could be clarified significantly by aligning the tax legislation with environmental legislation. Inert waste is defined in the EU Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC as: \"waste that does not undergo any significant physical, chemical or biological transformations. Inert waste does not dissolve, burn or otherwise physically or chemically react, biodegrade or adversely affect other matter with which it comes into contact in a way likely to give rise to environmental pollution or harm human health. The total leachability and pollutant content of the waste and the ecotoxicity of the leachate must be insignificant, and in particular not endanger the quality of surface water and/or groundwater.\" The EU Council Decision on Waste Criteria [2002]1 sets out waste acceptance criteria for inert wastes, both in the form of a list of European Waste Catalogue (EWC) codes for wastes which may be accepted as inert witho ut testing (subject to certain conditions), and in the form of leaching limit values and organic parameters limit values which have to be met for any other waste. Legislation could be introduced by the Welsh Government that would align the tax position mo re closely to the requirements of the environmental legislation. This could result in any waste which meets the definition of inert waste, and meets the waste acceptance criteria for inert wastes, qualifying for the lower rate of tax. This approach would a lso help to \"future proof\" the tax against changes in waste processing and treatment technology, by linking the tax legislation with the environmental legislation. Any new waste streams generated by new treatment technology would naturally fall to be taxe d at the lower rate if they qualified, as opposed to the Welsh Government needing to update a defined list of qualifying materials. It should be noted that any divergence from the existing UK and Scottish tax rates could have an impact on cross border tran sportation of waste and as such, the potential impact of any such changes would need to be carefully considered. To mitigate this risk and reduce complexity, any changes might be made in lockstep with the UK and Scottish revenue authorities, 1 The Council Decision of 19th December 2002 establishing criteria and procedures for the acceptance of waste at landfills pursuant to Article 16 and Annex II to Directive 1999/31/EC 212 Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? The introduction of a qualifying threshold would provide greater certainty for landfill site operators and their customers in respect of the application of the lower rate of tax. However, in practice, consideration will need to be given as to how this is measured for different types of waste, whether testing is required, and at what frequency , an d also on which party the risk falls in instances where the amount of non -qualifying material breaches the thresholds set. Clear and comprehensive guidance on the application of the threshold would be necessary to allow the rules to be applied consistentl y and to prevent advantages/disadvantages between landfill site operators arising from any ambiguity. In addition, careful consideration would need to be given to the parameters set in order to prevent misuse or abuse of the rules. For example, the Welsh Government may wish to consider whether it is necessary to prescribe that the load cannot qualify for the lower rate of tax, even where the \"small quantity\" threshold is met, if the qualifying waste has been blended/mixed with non-qualifying material. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. The introduction of a Welsh LoI test would help to maintain consistency with the rest of the UK and Scotland, w hich would ease compliance for businesses operating in two or more or the relevant jurisdictions, provide a degree of certainty both for site operators and their customers, and help to prevent any issues arising from cross border transportation of waste. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? In our view, the current disconnect between tax legislation and environmental legislat ion does lead to a disparity of treatment. Closer alignment of tax with environmental legislation could remove that disparity and is likely to be simpler for landfill site operators to understand and comply with. We would support the proposal that the are a already identified within the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) permit should be the taxable area of the site and, as a result, the taxable activities would in effect be those taking place while the operational phase is underway. This would allow closer linking of permanent engineering, cell development and restoration activities as agreed with Natural Resources Wales in order for those activities to be agreed to be outside the scope of/exempt from the tax. 213 Question 8: In your view, are there an y issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? The credit mechanism allows site operators to claim a landfill tax credit where they deposit waste to landfill, which is intended to be re -used by way of recycling, incineration or removal for use, and is in fact subsequently re -used. The credit can only be claimed where the waste is reused within one year of disposal, unless water was added to facilitat e the disposal, in which case a five year time limit applies. Use of the credit mechanism is common in the power industry where ash deposited in landfills or lagoons is subsequently removed for use. Other industries are also developing the capability to r ecover materials from their landfills. It is foreseeable that there will be a time when landfills are seen as a valuable source of material, and \"landfill mining\" or recovery will start to take place. The Welsh Government might wish to consider extending the rules with a view to encouraging the practice of landfill mining. This would have a number of potential benefits: the recovery of recyclable materials; use of combustible material in power generation; creation of further disposal space in existing sites; and remediation of hazardous sites. This could potentially be achieved by replacing the requirement to inform tax authorities of the future intention to remove the material at the time of disposal with a requirement to notify the tax authorities when m aterial is intended to be removed for recycling, recovery or treatment. In addition, the time limit which applies for the period between disposal and removal could be extended or removed. Support for the recovery of waste material may also have a benefici al impact on the development of Energy from Waste (EfW) facilities by providing additional sources of fuel. Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that whic h is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? Taxing all material which enters a landfill site (other than specifically exempt materials) could potentially remove much of the current uncertainty that has arisen following the Waste Recycling Group2 decision , and the way in which a taxable disposal is defined in the legislation. Broadly speaking, following the Waste Recycling Group decision, the disposal is not a taxable disposal if the site operator does not intend to discard the material, but has a use for it. The mechanism which has been used to close 2 HMRC v Waste Recycling Group (WRG) Limited [2008] EWCA Civ 849 214 the gap created by the decision is a list of prescribed landfill site activiti es which are taxable. This leaves the potential for activities which are not included on the list to be non -taxable. Introducing legislation to define all disposals as taxable, regardless of the site operator's intention, other than those which are speci fically defined as exempt would allow the Welsh Government to align the exemptions with the activities that are necessary for environmental protection and safe management of the site as agreed with Natural Resources Wales. Question 10: What activities wou ld you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? As well as the existing exemptions, consideration should be given to providing exemption for engineering activities on -site such as site development and infrastructure (including permanent haulage r oads), cell construction, temporary and permanent capping. This will remove much of the doubt arising from the way in which taxable activities are defined in the current legislation. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? See Question 9. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. Subject to certain conditions, the current exemptions are for: material removed from water; mining and quarrying waste; pet cemeteries; filling of quarries; and waste from visiting NATO forces. There are circumstances where the clean -up of spoil heaps from mining and quarrying operations may not currently qualify for the exemption, because the spoil is produced in a separate process from the original mining or quarrying. The Welsh Government may wish to consider whether amending the mining and quarrying ex emption to remove the requirement that the material has not been subjected to, or results from, a non -qualifying process, would help it to achieve its environmental objectives. Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. 215 The current water discount relief provides a valuable relief from landfill tax for certain industrial and water industry wastes. Removal of the relief might have a significant cost impact for Welsh industry. There are issues with the drafting of the current water discount relief in UK legislation arising from the requirement that no water should be present in the material naturally. We agree that no water discount should be provided for naturally occurring water, but t he exclusion of relief from wastes which contain any natural water would make the relief virtually impossible to apply if the legislation was interpreted and applied literally. The Welsh Government may wish to consider retaining the water discount relief in order to retain the benefit to Welsh industry, but modifying the existing rules in order to avoid future potential disputes. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and wh y? Any new exemptions or reliefs introduced by the Welsh Government may risk cross border transportation of waste as described in question 1, making Wales a destination of choice for the exempted or relieved materials. The Welsh Government may wish to con sider carefully whether to introduce new exemptions or reliefs in the light of this impact. A potential new exemption for certain legacy materials, such as asbestos, has been previously raised for discussion by the Welsh Government. These materials are d amaging to either the environment or human health if they are left in position. However, an exemption may attract asbestos to be transported to Wales for disposal from the rest of the UK. Any attempt to constrain the exemption to waste materials generate d in Wales may give rise to issues under EU law. The same applies to the clean -up of certain contaminated land. The application of landfill tax to wastes from these sites encourages the development of alternative treatments and remediation technologies , but there will be some situations where this is not the best practicable environmental option. The Welsh Government may wish to consider reintroducing landfill tax exemption certificates for land remediation, for circumstances where the landowner can de monstrate that landfill of the contaminated material represents the best practicable environmental option (to be agreed by Natural Resources Wales). As the assessment of best practicable environmental option should include consideration of the environment al impacts of transporting the contaminated material over long distances, this may act to limit the impact of cross border transportation of waste arising from the exemption. Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement 216 Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? There are circumsta nces where mandatory use of a weighbridge is impractical or impossible. For example, some vehicles used to move waste from information areas or recycling/treatment areas are too big to use the weighbridge, and tax is currently collected based on an agreed estimation method. The Welsh Government may wish to consider maintaining the potential for landfill site operators to agree alternative methods of calculation the weight of waste, where those methods are necessary for practical and/or operational reasons. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? No comment Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? No. Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. Landfill tax is an operati onal tax, which is based on the activities which take place on site. We consider that, in order to enforce and administer the tax effectively, it is necessary for the tax authorities to be familiar with the sites and the way that they operate. This neces sitates increased compliance activity by compliance officers. In Scotland administration of the tax is to be supported by Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), which allows environmental and tax regulation to be connected and allows the tax to be administered by an agency which understands the operation of landfill sites in detail. The Welsh Government might wish to consider the involvement of Natural Resources Wales in the administration of the tax for similar reasons. Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? No comment. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? 217 We have not experienced instances of tax avoidance within the existing landfill tax. Chapter 4: Administration Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. Under the current UK legislation a landfill site operator can request a tax return period which suits their business, and choose to align the tax return period with thei r accounting periods. This helps to reduce the administrative burden imposed on taxpayers. In Scotland the tax return periods have been aligned with environmental reporting periods to increase transparency. In our view, reducing the administrative burde n should be considered in any proposed change to the landfill tax return periods, either by aligning them with environmental reporting periods or by allowing landfill site operators to continue to align their returns with their accounting periods. Questio n 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? If the landfill tax return periods are aligned with environmental reporting periods, then the only impa ct on landfill site operators would be the need to analyse each European Waste Catalogue (EWC) code from their environmental report to determine the correct landfill tax treatment applied. However, if the landfill tax and environmental reporting periods d iffer, then there may be a significant additional burden on landfill tax operators, as the waste disposed of may need to be analysed more than once for different periods. There could also be discrepancies and differences arising, which may be difficult to compare and resolve if the periods do not match. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? Given that expected revenues from the tax in Wales are less than \u00a350m, and there may be only ten Welsh landfill sites affected, developing a digital replacement may not be a priority on a cost/benefit based analysis. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? We consider that the current bad debt relief rules should be maintained as far as possible. One area where the Welsh Government may wish to consider 218 change is in respect of the time period that must elapse before bad debt relief can be claimed, which at present is 12 months. To improve cash -flow for landfill site operators, the Welsh Government may wish to consider reducing this period to six months in line, with other indirect taxes such as VAT. Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? The Welsh Government may wish to consider allowing customers to seek reviews/appeals of decisions which affect their waste streams as, in most instances, it will be the customer that bears the burden of the tax. Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax u ntil the conclusion of their appeal? In our opinion there are no such exceptional circumstances. Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of comm unities? No comment. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforce ment and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify ) No comment. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? No comment. Additional Questions Question 30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? 219 We are not aware of any related issues which have not been addressed specifically. Question 31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? No comment. 220 Reference 76 Dear Sirs Consultation on a Landfill Disposals Tax Please find enclosed our comments on the above consultation document issued on 24 February 2015. We welcome this opportunity to comment on what constitutes an important issue, particularly given that this is one o f the first two taxes for which the Welsh Government will have responsibility, where that responsibility previously lay with the UK Government. Our detailed comments are set out in the attached Appendix. Yours faithfully Christopher Sanger Head of Tax Pol icy For and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? It is important t hat consistency is maintained with the UK Government but also - perhaps to a slightly lesser extent - the Scottish Government, in respect of their Landfill Tax regimes, if the Welsh Government is to avoid unintended competition distortions and environmenta l impacts. For example, it is conceivable that material differences in the rates would result in waste being transported longer distances, with increased pollution. This 'waste tourism' would also be in contravention of the aim of the Landfill Directive. T he sizeable border between Wales and England, and the number of landfill sites within a small distance of that border is the main reason why rate arbitrages between Wales/England could have a larger economic effect on Wales than arbitrages between Wales/Sc otland. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. 221 Our initial view is no but we believe that this question should be considered by the Welsh government in more detail. Increasing the standard rate has helped to achieve the policy objective of moving waste up the waste hierarchy and been a key driver for increased levels of re -use and re -cycling. However, the widening differential between the st andard and lower rates has certainly made the potential for crime arising from the misclassification between these rates more likely. The increase in tax has, we believe, also influenced fly tipping and illegal dumping in the UK. Moreover, due to the reaso ns set out in Question 1 above, we consider it difficult for Wales to materially operate rates below those set out by the UK and Scottish Governments. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of ta x (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? Yes. There is an argument to be had for the introduction of an intermediate rate of landfill tax, as it is incorrect to assume that everything that is not a 'qualifying material' is equally as polluting. Thi s does not necessarily mean that it is important to have more than the current two rates immediately, but the ability to adapt to future changing circumstances, and indeed to quickly react to changes by the UK and Scottish Governments is positive. Waste tourism could again, however, be in point. Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? Broadly, in our view, the Qualifying Materials Order (QMO) is effective. However, there are a number of waste streams produced by what is considered to be environmentally friendly behaviour that are standard rated. Perhaps, such material would be more appropriate to the lower rate and hence within the QMO. Air pollu tion control residue (\"APCR\") is a good example of this. However, it is noted that every waste producer/industry will have its own views on this. The ability to move items in/out of the QMO quickly - both in a proactive and reactive manner - is a positive step. Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? An objective threshold is arguably preferable as it enforces an even playing field across the industry and removes reliance on visual tests. However, there is a risk that this is of greater benefit to smaller operators which, it is understood, are less likely to be inspected by the financial and environmental regulators. More regulatio n and inspection has the potential to give comfort that rates are not being abused. Finally, for consistency purposes, it should be noted that Revenue Scotland have recently set out further guidance as to 'qualifying materials containing a small amount of non-qualifying material' without defining 'small'. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. 222 Yes. But the testing framework needs to be brought in with more planning and should not be rushed, as is the perception regarding the position in Scotland. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? No. The site boundaries are typically quite clear, as is the disposal area. Information areas and tax free zones work effectively in controlling the non - taxable 'temporary deposits' of waste on a landfill site. Question 8: In your view, are there any issu es with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? The credit for permanent removal scheme works well in our view. Question 9: What would be the practical im plications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? There are a number of flaws in this suggestion. To give just one example, this fails to take account of the fact that some landfill sites include processing and recycling plants/operations. Note that this was part of the UK Landfill Tax 2009 consultation, but was quickly rejected. Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? It should be expected that all exemptions in effect in the UK and SLfT regimes should, at least initially, continue to remain exempt under the Welsh tax since failure to implement the same exemptions would have a more damaging effect than a small disparity in rates between the regimes. From a wider perspective however, arguably anything that encourages green behaviour could be exempt. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? The prescribed activities order works well in highlighting taxable and non - taxable activities on a landfill site - notwithstanding whether each of the regulations are in keeping with the primary purpose of Landfill Tax. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. We have no specific comments at this time. Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modif ying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. From first principles, water should not be regarded as waste. Any water added to waste due to another process should be discountable as ultimately it should be collected in the leachate which w ill be treated i.e. it is not a part of the material being disposed of. Also of course, water itself is now banned from landfill. However, there is significant scope for abuse under this regime, particularly as it is the producer, not the site operator, wh ich applies for the discount. There is clearly some uncertainty in this area. Originally, Revenue Scotland proposed removing the water discount, but this is no longer being considered. 223 Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exem ptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? We have no specific comments at this time. Compliance and Enforcement Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbr idge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? It depends on the context. If every load that comes onto site had to pass over a weighbridge (if oper ational) this is perfectly reasonable. This helps not only from a Landfill Tax perspective, but also with the accounting and invoicing procedures, as most weighbridges have an electronic system configured to it which feeds the AR. However, requiring moveme nts out of information areas to pass over the weighbridge could create difficulties depending on where the works are being done on site, where the weighbridge is located, and where the information area is located. Furthermore the only weighbridge in a clos e proximity may be third party owned. The implications for costs, use of the weighbridge, responsibility for accuracy etc need to be considered. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to includ e illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? We believe this would be a positive step in a number of areas. Firstly, it encourages secure boundaries of sites in a similar way to warehousing, forcing the operator to take ownership of illegal de posits on their sites. Secondly the fly -tipper - if caught - could be faced with a double tax bill (i.e. for the original 'dumping' and then the disposal on a site) in addition to any criminal sanctions. Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? We have no significant comments at this time but would welcome sight of any considerations around any penalty regime for a future LOI testing regime. Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. Yes. In our view, there is no substitute for a site inspection . Note also our response to Question 5. 5 Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? 224 Yes. Further actions such as objective and scientific testing (eg LOI ) along with more inspections (as per Question 18) would help to improve compliance and enforcement. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? We do not consider that there is wide scale tax avoidance, but note that fly - tipping by waste producers could constitute evasion. Administration Question 21: Would you s upport aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. Not necessarily. Operators should be free to choose their accounting quarters as per VAT returns. There should be an appreciation for those who will have quarterly VAT payments and also QIPs, and the operator should be empowered such that they can successfully manage their cash flow position. Landfill Disposals Tax Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? Aligning the EWC and QMO should be desirable for every stakeholder however this would be fraught with difficulty. It would take a revision of the EWC codes (given that two loads of a certain EWC c ode could be subject to the lower rate one day, and the standard rate the next day). Furthermore some EWC codes are hazardous for environmental purposes but lower rated for UKLfT purposes. However, it would provide certainty for operators. Question 23: H ow might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? Online returns should be favourable for operators and for the relevant tax authority. However we note that there was a recent tax tribunal case where a Christian taxpayer did not want to use a computer for religious reasons and the Tribunal required HMRC to provide the option of a paper return. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is i t appropriate? Bad debt relief should be available, but it should mirror VAT given that both taxes will generally be charged on the same invoice. Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? It should be clear that an \"Independent review\" is independent. 6 Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers mi ght be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? There are no circumstances we wish to raise at this time.

The Association of Welsh RIGS Groups was established in April 1999, bringing together the RIGS 1 groups in Wales with geologists from the then Countryside Council for Wales and British Geological Survey with the aim of conserving and promoting Welsh geodiversity 2. We regard partnership and communication of geodiversity and geoconservation (inclu ding other conservation organisations in biodiversity, local government and the National Assembly for Wales and Welsh Government) as essential objectives in the holistic and sustainable management of the natural resources, services and landscapes of Wales. Our Aims & Objectives are set out in Appendix A, abstracted from our revised Constitution (2015). AWRG worked with the Welsh Government in a full Audit of Regionally Important Geodiversity Sites in Wales completed in 2012 and, around and since then, resp onded to the A Living Wales (2010), Natural Resources Wales (2012) and Nature Recovery Plan for Wales (2014) Consultations. Our Response Our responses conform to the numbering system used in the Consultation Document and, after some initial comments, re late entirely to Section 5 : Community Wellbeing - since matters of Taxation (2), Compliance (3) and Administration (4) lie outside our brief. Ministerial Foreword We welcome the Minister's wish \"....to consider whether and how a proportion of the tax r evenue might be used to enhance community wellbeing.\" and \"I am seeking to consider the fullest range of options through this consultation...\" encouraging us to share our ideas \"....on how we can design this tax so that it works well for Wales.\" 249 Chapte r 1 : Introduction and Policy Background 1.16 It is our case that recognition of Wales' geodiversity and its conservation and accessibility are integral part of the scientific, historical, educational, cultural, aesthetic and recreational landscapes of Wales and thus supports the Welsh Government's long -term vision for Wales by 2050 ... to be the best place to live, learn, work and do business and put into law a set of clear, integrated, wellbeing goals for Wales. 1.21 Funds supporting geoconservation, and the closely -connected expression of Wales' geodiversity to its people and visitors, through the development of Wales' natural, historic, cultural and industrial landscapes closely accords with the use of a proportion of landfill tax funds to support local community and environment projects within the vicinity of a landfill site and is illustrated from many examples of such projects across the UK. Chapter 5 : Community Wellbeing 5.1 We strongly recommend a decision to allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing and, below, propose a range of geodiversity -related proposed activities that could receive funding. 5.3 The Landfill Communities Fun d (LCF) is a tax credit scheme which 'offsets' some of the dis -amenity of living near a landfill site. The purpose of this fund is to incentivise landfill site operators to support local projects benefitting the general public, biodiversity or the environm ent. We welcome the intentions set out here, including opportunities for site operators to demonstrate Corporate Social Responsibility , and set out the following justification for supporting geodiversity -related projects. 5.3.1 In this age of austerity i n government funding, landfill tax offers a mechanism to provide direct community and environmental benefit without impinging on direct or indirect personal taxation. Landfill represents an environmental dis -benefit through wasted natural resources, many of them geological, and many landfill sites are located in disused quarries. It is therefore fitting that landfill tax credits be used to \"pay back\" both the environment and the communities affected and we assert that geoconservation and raising awareness of geodiversity, geological resources and heritage is a pre -eminently fitting use. 5.3.2 Geoconservation projects in Wales and elsewhere in the UK demonstrably benefit the general public, biodiversity and environment - the intended beneficiaries of the LC F - and specific examples are included in our response to 5.7 below. 250 5.3.3 With regard to benefits to the general public , the published Constitution and Aims of Geoconservation Cymru - Wales (formerly the Association of Welsh RIGS Groups) is to encourage the identification, conservation, appreciation and promotion of what were first collectively known as Regionally Important Geological/Geomorphological Sites (RIGS) and are known currently as Regional Important Geodiversity Sites (RIGS) in Wales, for educa tion and public benefit, through a series of Objectives - which are set out in Appendix A below. 5.3.4 Geoconservation Cymru - Wales is the national, coordinating 'parent' body of the voluntary Geoconservation movement in Wales, which is reflected in the Objectives. The Constitution also includes the Objectives of the Regional Geoconservation Groups where public benefits are elaborated. 5.3.5 With regard to benefits to the environment , in general terms geoconservation and geodiversity draw attention to a fundamental component of the physical landscape and control of its operating processes, the underpinning of biodiversity and a strong influence on the cultural and socio - economic environments developed over time. This awareness is obscured - and therefore often ignored and uncomprehended - through its largely subsurface expression, which makes the occurrence of surface outcrops and exposures, and their conservation and opportunity for scientific study, informing national policies and strategies, public edu cation and amenity all the more important. Active geoconservation also improves environmental quality, exemplified in responses to 5.7 below. 5.3.6 With regard to benefits to biodiversity , geodiversity provides the fundamental underpinning of the biospher e, through the chemical and physical character of the rocks and, together with climate, is the principal determinant of the structure and composition of the plant communities. For all these reasons, geodiversity is also a major determinant of human land us e provides a wide range of ecosystem and related services. Geodiversity creates biodiversity. 5.3.7 However, a serious problem of the definition, recognition and application of geodiversity pervades public, private and governmental organisations inter al ia and is bound to influence the nature and level of acceptance of geoconservation and geodiversity in this Consultation and Landfill Disposals Tax policy decisions which flow from it. The essential problem concerns what is and isn't included in the term 'nature' and 'nature conservation and hence the derivation of the term biodiversity. In some organisations and publications, 'nature' is considered to embrace both biotic and abiotic (physical - geological) components but in other, narrower definitions 'na ture' covers only the biotic. 5.3.8 Exclusion of the geological half of 'nature' is rarely deliberate and comes instead from lack of understanding. Geoconservation and geodiversity 251 have a good pedigree in the publications and policy of the UK's Statutory Conservation Agencies and other organisations but their continuity into downstream publications and policy - including this Consultation - is inconsistent, unreliable and often subject to individual author's understanding. There is a frequent necessity to re-state the case for their recognition. Extended justification for the definition and use of the terms is provided in Appendix B. 5.3.9 It is therefore a principal request that in order to avoid ambiguity and exclusion, the terms geodiversity and geoco nservation be written into the eventual Landfill Disposal Tax Policy and relevant Regulations wherever reference is made to biodiversity and bioconservation and wherever the general term conservation implies either of these. For example, the relevant phrase in 5.3 should read '.... projects benefitting the general public, biodiversity and geodiversity, or the environment.' 5.3.9 As the terms geoconservation and geodiversity underlie basic understandi ng and communications in this broad field, consistency and stability of the nomenclature is essential. 5.3 & 5.4 With regard to the use of the Landfill Communities Fund to 'offset' some of the dis -amenity of living near a landfill site (5.3) and the option for landfill site operators to contribute a proportion of their tax liability ... to approved projects (5.4), we recognise the past importance of such significant funding sources to geoconservation and geodiversity through e.g. the Aggregates Levy Su stainability Fund and are committed to seeking similar support in future. 5.4.1 Since the LCF is essentially a geology -based tax it is only right that it should focus on geologically associated products and ventures. Nearly all such grants are wildlife an d flora specific and, since this is the only one that specifically involves geodiversity, it needs to grant aid accordingly and publicise geodiversity - particularly to government organisations. For example, organisations engaged in geoconservation and geod iversity - e.g. RIGS and Geoparks - find it difficult to get grants when biodiversity is seen as the only, or senior, partner in government organisations. 5.4.2 In addition conservation is essential in geodiversity since the removal of any geological resource is final and cannot regrow or be reintroduced, whereas biodiversity can recover or be restored through habitat -recreation and species re -introduction. 5.4.3 With regard to access to funding for geoconservation and geodiversity projects and refere nce to landfill site operators asking an independent party to make up the remaining amount (5.4) it should be noted that whilst such projects are largely dependent on schemes such as LCF, the 252 geoconservation community also has a good record in seeking mat ched funding from other agencies and organisations. 5.7 5.7.1 With regard to the 6 listed objectives under Projects looking for support , geoconservation & geodiversity projects typically relate to:- 5.7.2 Object A - especially the conservation o f geological exposures as part of the remediation or restoration of land, typically former quarries and mines. 5.7.3 Object D - especially the conservation of geological exposures and the provision of relevant public information boards and leaflets, withi n parks formed as part of the restoration in Object A, or at other park sites such as those on land with historic buildings and other associations with a geological context. The creation of parks frequently provides educational value (providing outdoor lab oratories for local schools) as well as being public amenities and in many cases preserving the heritage of the local community, with an archaeological / historical economy related to geological resources, including local building stones. 5.7.4 Object DA - especially the conservation of a specific species which includes, in the case of geological conservation and geodiversity e.g. a rock type, or rock structure or fossil bed and of a specific habitat e.g. the evidence of the exposed rock characteristics fr om which past environments and processes can be reconstructed and tell of Earth's history. In this respect, geodiversity also provides key evidence essential to the understanding of Global Climate Change and human adaptive responses. 5.7.5 It is apparent from the above that the specific identity of Geoconservation and Geodiversity needs to be included alongside references to the Biodiversity and Bioconservation. Geology provides the essential underpinning of living species, soils and habitats and thus not only of virtually all bioconservation projects but also of wider environmental improvements. Unlike biodiversity, geodiversity is non -renewable and its conservation requires special care. 5.8 5.8.1 With regard to how Projects receive funding GeoConserv ation Cymru - Wales could operate, upon advice from Welsh Government, as either an Environmental Body or Distributive Environmental Body and in so doing follow the role played elsewhere in the UK by GeoConservation UK which has a record of organising and b rokering public funding for its English member groups, counterparts of the Regional Geoconservation groups in Wales. 253 5.15 5.15.1 We submit as Appendix C a table of Examples of Projects which have been supported or wholly created by Geoconservation Cymru - Wales (as its predecessor Association of Welsh RIGS Groups) and the Welsh Regional Geoconservation (formerly RIGS) Groups. 5.17 & Question 27 5.17.1 We support unequivocally that Welsh Government should allocate a proportion of Landfil1 Disposals T ax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities , initially on the Consultation Document's own premise that communities experience substantial dis -amenity which LCF can help to offset. 5.17.2 Further grounds include the fact that landfill sites are frequently sites of former extractive mining and quarrying for geological resources and that the character and history of local physical and human -cultural environments - underpinned by its geology - is largely dependent on such funding for the conservation and enhancement for public access. 5.18 With regard to the Activities that could receive funding, our principal responses relate to your heading Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental i mprovements , are specifically: - 5.23 5.23.1 It is our case throughout that the terms biodiversity and bioconservation narrowly defined are restricted to the living environment and that - under the important but inconsistent incorporation of geology under 'Nature' - equally important geodiversity and geoconservation are frequently excluded from funding for conservation and wider environmental initiatives. 5.24 5.24.1 We concur strongly with the suggestion that LCF funding is currently likely to be the main source of funding for these objectives, supported by the precedent of funding from the ALSF elsewhere in the UK. Once such funds are available, the voluntary geoconservation community contributes a significant matched funding element through its v olunteers' expertise, efforts and time and also seeks other matched funding sources - but LCF funding would be the major component. 5.25 5.25.1 It therefore follows from the above that these objectives would largely go unfunded, to the loss of the spec ific projects and communities concerned, especially as other funding sources dry up. 5.32 5.32.1 With regard to the general Objective of Tackling Poverty and Deprivation in communities , there is a good record of opportunities to develop working and soci al skills in the local community during the execution of projects of geoconservation environmental improvement, which also help to 254 relieve environmental and amenity deprivation. There are also good examples of geoconservation and geodiversity projects whic h enhance local employment and the tourist industry, especially with regard to GeoPark Projects. Question 28 In terms of enhancing community wellbeing, those activities we strongly believe should benefit from funding are Geo(Bio)diversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements and Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities.

APPENDIX B : GEODIVERSITY Geodiversity is def ined as the variety of rocks, minerals, fossils, landforms and soils, together with the natural processes that shape them. Geodiversity is a foundation for life and our society. It provides the fundamental underpinning of the biosphere , through the geochem istry, structure and water/thermal conductivity of rocks and soils and is actively altered by surface geomorphological processes. Geodiversity influences landscape, habitats and species as well as our economy, historical and cultural heritage, education, health and wellbeing 2. 2 Collated from Scotland's Geodiversity Charter [Scottish Geodiversity Forum, 2012, in partnership with the Scottish Government, Scottish Natural Heritage and British Geological Survey; England's Geodiversity Charter [English Geod iversity Forum, 2014, in partnership with Natural England and the British Geological Survey]; the Association of Welsh RIGS Groups [supported by the Welsh Assembly Government] and UK and Signific ance of Geodiversity Geodiversity is defined as the variety of rocks, minerals, fossils, landforms and soils, together with the natural processes that shape them. Geodiversity is a foundation for life and our society. It provides the fundamental underpinn ing of the biosphere , through the geochemistry, structure and water/thermal conductivity of rocks and soils and is actively altered by surface geomorphological processes. Geodiversity influences landscape, habitats and species as well as our economy, hist orical and cultural heritage, education, health and wellbeing 2. Geodiversity is internationally recognised by the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (2004) that states: 'geological heritage constitutes a natural heritag e of scientific, cultural, aesthetic, landscape, economic and intrinsic values, which needs to be preserved and handed down to future generations'. This is also an essential consideration in the application of the European Landscape Convention (2002). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Resolution 4.040 on 'Conservation of geodiversity and geological heritage' (2008) provides a benchmark statement of the wider role and relevance of geodiversity, recognising that 'the conservation and m anagement of geological heritage need to be integrated by governments into their national goals and programmes'. Geodiversity also provides a wide range of ecosystem and 257 related services listed in Appendix C, abstracted from the AWRG response to the Livi ng Wales Consultation of 2010. Biodiversity is underpinned by geodiversity . Without the variety of rocks, landforms, soils, water and nutrients that support the locally, nationally and internationally valued habitats, species and ecosystems these could no t exist. Unless the geodiversity is robust and conserved then the range of biodiversity will be diminished. Geodiversity , like other aspects of the natural environment, is threatened. For example, poorly planned development can destroy geodiversity and irrevocably change natural processes. Similarly, lack of management and co -operation can lead to the progressive decline of geodiversity and loss of access to critical geodiversity sites. Careful management of geodiversity, and an understanding of its envi ronmental value, has wide economic, social, cultural and educational benefits. In particular, integration of geodiversity into the 'ecosystem approach' will better inform robust adaptations to climate change, as well as supporting policy such as that descr ibed in the Government paper The Natural Choice. Lack of action will lead to loss of geodiversity and missed opportunities for science, society and education. APPENDIX C : EXAMPLES OF GCW / AWRG SUPPORTED PROJECTS IN WALES Project Description Locati on Objective All-Wales audit of Regionally Important Geodiversity Sites (RIGS): Equivalent to Local Nature Reserves, this geological and geomorphological audit resulted in approximately 1000 sites documented and registered with local authorities for their scientific, educational, historic and aesthetic qualities.

RIGS groups in Wales have worked with a number of partners who promote the understanding of geodiversity though grant aid and specialist support. R IGS groups have been very active in developing interpretation initiatives that encourage the public to look at and appreciate the rocks and landscape around them. This may be through the development of trails looking at the geology between Aberystwyth an d Clarach, or the mineral wealth of Coed y Brenin. But what has been especially successful is the development of geological town trails. These self -guided walks are available for a number of towns and look at the incredible wealth of building stones, obtai ned locally or from around the world. 259 Geological town trails offer an insight into the geological wealth of Wales and are an example of how geologists are keen raise awareness. 260 APPENDIX D : GEODIVERSITY SERVICES The following provides some examples of Services that Geodiversity provides, abstracted from the AWRG response on 8th December 2010 to the Living Wales Consultation. Geodiversity in Regulating Services: Atmospheric and oceanic processes Dynamic circulation Global heat regulation Terrestrial processes Rock, carbon & water cycles Geomorphological processes e.g. landslides Flood control - water infiltration in the landscape, run -off Water quality, quantity and storage Geodiversity in Supporting Services : Bedrock - landsc ape, resource - stone, sand & gravel Soil - growing medium, soil profile development, weathering, Habitat provision - caves, cliffs, limestone pavements, ponds, valleys, moorland, salt marshes etc. Land as a platform - buildings, airports, sport Burial and storage - human, animal, waste including nuclear Protection - coastal & flood defences Geodiversity in Provisioning Services: Mineral resources - Superficial and bedrock Food and drink - soils for food plants, meat (sheep, cattle, pigs) water, beer, wine & whisky Nutrients - minerals inc. salt, zinc Fuels - coal, gas, oil, uranium etc. Construction materials - stone, including limestone and sandstone, slate, shale, sand and gravel, cement, glass, copper Industrial minerals - quartz, calcite etc Ornament al - fossils and minerals, e.g. Welsh gold Geodiversity in Cultural Services Environment quality - landscape both local and national (Country parks, AONBs, National Parks, Geoparks) Geotourism and leisure - landscape both local and national (Country park s, AONBs, National Parks, geoparks) Cultural, spiritual and historical meaning Folklore, sacred sites, 'sense of place' Artistic inspiration - art (Turner to Kyffin Williams), sculpture, literature, poetry Social development - local geological societies, field visits, walks & talks 261 Geodiversity in Knowledge Services Earth History - evolution and landform; major Welsh contribution to the understanding of the Earth and natural systems Physical processes Geoforensics History of research - unconformities/ge ological time/mountain building/evolution Environment monitoring - glacial retreat, sea -level change, acidification Education and employment - field skills training, on & offshore exploration through the management of sites, areas and wider landscapes . ANSWERS TO SPECIFIC APPENDIX 2 QUESTIONS 5.17 & Question 27 5.17.1 We support unequivocally that Welsh Government should allocate a proportion of Landfil1 Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities , initially on the Consultation Docum ent's own premise that communities experience substantial dis -amenity which LCF can help to offset. 5.17.2 Further grounds include the fact that landfill sites are frequently sites of former extractive mining and quarrying for geological resources and tha t the character and history of local physical and human -cultural environments - underpinned by its geology - is largely dependent on such funding for the conservation and enhancement for public access. 5.18 With regard to the Activities that could receiv e funding, our principal responses relate to your heading Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements , are specifically: - 5.23 5.23.1 It is our case throughout that the terms biodiversity and bioconservation narrowly defined are restri cted to the living environment and that - under the important but inconsistent incorporation of geology under 'Nature' - equally important geodiversity and geoconservation are frequently excluded from funding for conservation and wider environmental initia tives. 5.24 5.24.1 We concur strongly with the suggestion that LCF funding is currently likely to be the main source of funding for these objectives, supported by the precedent of funding from the ALSF elsewhere in the UK. Once such funds are available, the voluntary geoconservation community contributes a significant matched funding element through its volunteers' expertise, efforts and time and also seeks other matched funding sources - but LCF funding would be the major component. 5.25 5.25.1 It therefore follows from the above that these objectives would largely go unfunded, to the loss of the specific projects and communities concerned, especially as other funding sources dry up. 262 5.32 5.32.1 With regard to the general Objective of Tackling Pove rty and Deprivation in communities , there is a good record of opportunities to develop working and social skills in the local community during the execution of projects of geoconservation environmental improvement, which also help to relieve environmental and amenity deprivation - and examples of geoconservation and geodiversity projects which enhance local employment and the tourist industry, especially with regard to GeoPark Projects. Question 28 In terms of enhancing community wellbeing, those activit ies we strongly believe should benefit from funding are Geo(Bio)diversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements and Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. 263 Reference 86 Confidential: This document contains commercially sensitive information. Its content is provided for formal consultation purposes only - and is not for public release. Dear Sir / Madam We submit this formal response supplementary to our participation in a round of Welsh Government consultation meetings on the topic. Our response builds on our response to the Welsh Government's consultation on the devolution of taxes, submitted on 15th December. This response included the following feedback - summarized with particular reference to landfill tax: - 1. Our response to the WG Consultation on the general principles/structure of introducing devolved tax (submitted on 15th December 2014) describes how Wales is important to Tata Steel - and how we, in -turn, are important to Wales. It is critical for our positive development that Wales becomes an attractive target for business investment and that the business environment prom otes economic growth in Wales - and provides practical improvements benefiting all parties. 2. Tata Steel's interest in the devolution of taxes in Wales is as a payer, fiscal costs form a vital and substantial part of our competitive costs. We have no direct commercial interest in tax collection or management - or provision of advice about tax - specifically landfill tax - as a business proposition. Landfill is a last resort. 3. A stable and internationally competitive tax framework is vital for business and fo r the successful development of the Welsh economy. 4. The complexity and administrative structures around a tax framework should be proportionately lean, transparent and practical. This is particularly important in an economy of Wales' current size. There a re relatively few landfill sites in Wales - and the Welsh Government is pursuing a \"Zero Waste Strategy.\" A keen eye should be trained on the cost & complexity of creating a regime for a small and declining sector. 5. Devolution of some tax powers offers the opportunity to consider the appropriateness of some less competitive aspects of the UK framework for the Welsh economic landscape. This must include taxes which affect unavoidable costs such as landfill disposals, and the timeliness and responsiveness of some processes. 6. The creation and promotion of a positive culture of payment and compliance is to be welcomed and fully in line with Tata's corporate values. A key element of that would be a fair, transparent and responsive enforcement of enforcement. 7. While a devolved fiscal framework may create a positive business environment in Wales, it will always be important to address the vital issue of how such a framework aligns and agrees with UK and European counterparts. 264 8. Tata Steel would welcome the opportuni ty to share its experience of operating in multiple tax regimes as part of the Welsh Government's further considerations of this important policy area. Landfill Disposals Tax Summary of General Observations In general the existing waste management system is doing a good job. We believe it is fulfilling the essential objectives of sustainability, serving communities and the economy. It is driving positive behavior in diversion of reusable/recyclables, and technical improvements in recovery and reappl ication. Changes to the tax regime should not lose sight of these fundamental principles not only from a Welsh perspective, but taking account of the wider community, UK... global. The availability of landfill sites and the capacity of existing sites is low . This is particularly true of hazardous waste sites. It is vital that any new Landfill Tax regime does not compromise a critical infrastructural requirement. As an owner/operator of landfill sites - and notably Wales' only hazardous site - without a direc t commercial interest in waste management, we feel that our feedback is particularly pertinent to the consultation exercise and stress that changes to the land fill tax regime should support this vital part of our operations. Management of waste is an im portant business operational cost for us - and the addition of land fill tax is a very significant extra burden for a business operating in very tough competitive conditions. It is vital that the tax regime - including land fill tax - contribute to sustai nability - economic, for the community and the physical environment Tata Steel manages landfill sites as part of the internal operations. The company is not a commercial provider of waste services and some operational sites are customers for the waste man agement supply chain. Where we are self -sufficient in landfill, management of known -waste at -source has a profound benefit for the environment and the community. A case exists to support responsible industry, which, under regulation by the authorities mana ges its wastes in -house. The impact of individual taxes imposed on major enterprises - on which the community depends - should be assessed taking account of the combined impact of these measures on the sustainability and competitiveness of the industry. We have a track record of recovering reusable materials from our landfill for manufacturing operations. The new Welsh Land Fill Tax regime should do everything possible to encourage this to contribute to sustainability and competitiveness An \"intimate\" pr ofessional relationship with a Welsh land fill tax managing authority should replace the common need to interpret tax policy to fit activity on the ground - with mutually beneficial solutions based on close relationship. A local tax regime may carry furthe r benefits of clearer interpretation of tax policy, based on local need and resources, and specific Welsh national goals and objectives. 265 Wales should not fulfill a Zero Waste Strategy at the cost of encouraging \"waste - tourism\" or to optimize land fill tax revenue. We should encourage the application of the best available technology not entailing excessive cost, (\"BATNEEC\") with a fair approach to land fill as the best solution for controlled -hazard material and as a last resort for non -recoverable inert wa ste. A case exists for clear arrangements to be made for industrial sites which handle by - product of consistent composition. Some of these materials can inappropriately fall under a category of \"waste,\" while they are still, in fact, \"material -in-proce ss.\" 1. Introduction & General Principles a) Tata Steel: Waste Management & Diversion from Landfill Tata Steel is a business committed to steelmaking and related services. We own and operate two landfill sites in Wales including Wales' only formally designated Hazardous Waste Landfill Site - an important asset in Wales' strategic waste infrastructure. Ho wever the business has no commercial interest in waste management for third parties*. Our activities in by -product management are focused entirely on the sustainability of the core business activity - and minimizing its impact on the community and the envi ronment. We would not landfill any material if there was a viable alternative. Our waste management contractor, Darlow Lloyd, is a highly valued business partner. A local business, DL has contributed to the development of this document and has attended We lsh Government consultation meetings on this subject. Waste from our 4 main manufacturing sites is consigned both to Tata Steel sites and third party sites: material from Port Talbot, Llanwern and Shotton steelworks is consigned to Tata Steel landfill fac ilities and a proportion of waste from Trostre, (Llanelli) is managed elsewhere. All waste from Orb Works, (Newport) is managed by a third party. It is quite possible that closer landfill facilities may be available for Llanwern, Orb and Shotton in England than in Wales, consequently the development of a Land Fill Tax regime in Wales may have a bearing on these sites' choice of channel for waste. *The exception being providing emergency facilities for a single consignment of hazardous waste at the special request of the authorities in 2011. Tata Steel's largest landfill site, based at Port Talbot Steelworks is consists of a number of cells (both operational and closed) is committed to the handling of waste designated as non - hazardous and hazardous. The company has a strong track record in recovery of recyclables and waste minimization, but annually commits circa 30,000 tonnes of material to landfill, costing the company some \u00a3260k. This activity has generated \u00a321,000 and \u00a316,000 for the Landfill Communi ties Fund in the financial years 2013 -2015, respectively. 266 Tata Steel has recovered approximately 150kt material from waste confined to landfill in the recent past for reuse in the manufacturing operations. The company did not benefit from a tax rebate fo r this. The viability of recycling process materials previously consigned to landfill is intimately affected by the landfill tax regime - as it is by the cost of the material as a new resource. As a manufacturer of a key material in high volumes from raw materials, Tata Steel has a well -established process for managing by -products in large amounts - preventing, where possible, the costly and environmentally -damaging transport of waste - and the recovery and reuse and recycling of materials. As such, Tata S teel is a champion of sustainable waste management. We recycle over 2 million tonnes of steel in our manufacturing process - a substantial volume of which is being diverted from land fill. The company recovers waste water, oils and hydrocarbons and solid w aste bearing metals or mineral content. A list of additional recovered materials can be supplied on request. The Welsh Government and the authorities have distinguished themselves by their accessibility to us as a company and the capacity to work in partn ership on specific projects or long -term challenges. The potential professional intimacy which may be achievable with the Welsh Landfill Tax managing body may reduce the propensity to interpret general tax policy for practical application on -the-ground. We hope we will be able to work together with the Welsh regime for mutual benefit. Tata Steel - and the wider Tata Group - has experience of working under different tax systems in many fiscal regimes in the international arena. We should be able to contribu te knowledge towards our shared goals which will enable us to work together for mutual benefit. Response to Questions of Specific Detail 2. Tax Rates & Taxable Disposals Q1 How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates Producers of waste are free to source the optimal sustainable solution for managing their by-product and regulated op en competition promotes good -practice and environmental care. It is important that a local land fill tax system does not create distortions or anomalies. It is unlikely that Tata Steel would wish to consign Port Talbot generated waste to England, but the p roximity of major operating sites such as Llanwern and Shotton -could make it feasible for waste generated there to be managed under the English regime. This may benefit the environment and be advantageous for all parties. It would contradict the sustainab le principles of the Welsh Government if Welsh waste is directed to Welsh landfill sites to fulfill a self -sufficiency strategy - or generate Welsh fiscal revenue. It would be equally invidious for Wales to achieve a \"Zero Waste Strategy\" by applying fisca l tools to influence behavior. 267 There should be consistent alignment in waste classification and consignment guidelines between Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom. It is important that there is no disparity that could lead to wastes being directed in to/away from Welsh landfill sites. The timing of land fill tax rates could equally play a part in encouraging waste -tourism. Uncertainty is a hazard to enterprise. Alignment will allow companies to carry out optimal business planning and financial provi sion. Q2 Are the current standard and lower tax rates set at an appropriate level for Wales? Landfill tax rates should be set at a level that continues to drive good practice and contributes to the competitiveness of the industry in Wales. Rates should acknowledge that there will always be an element of wastes for which landfill is the best and only sustainable solution. With respect to hazardous waste, this material is consigned to landfill for the benefit of health, safety and the environment. A respo nsible last resort solution should not be penalized. The tax rates do - and should - drive the commercialisation of recovery technologies and recycling, but the rates should not drive disproportionately high investment or operational costs being quoted o wing to the high cost of the only alternative - taxed land fill. Q3 Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax and why? We believe there is merit in setting a lower rate which reflects local conditions and circumstances. However attention must be paid to low capacity for land fill: we should not allow a situation to arise in which low supply demands a high price where adequate resources have not been provided. We would stress that companies resort to la nd fill when there is no other safe and sustainable option. The risks of promoting \"waste -tourism\" have already been made. Wales should not meet a \"Zero Waste Strategy\" consequent to waste export - or an increase in illegal disposal sites. 3. Defining the Taxable Material Q4 Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate that should be considered, and on what basis? Inert waste materials for which there is no alternative but to landfill - can play a vital role in acting as stabilizer, protective envelope or cover for more challenging waste materials. Health, safety and environmental care can be optimized where this good practice is embraced and encouraged by the system. Industrial waste from a consistent process s uch as steelmaking is consistent in composition and, owing to technical development, may subsequently be reprocessed. A clever solution contributing to Welsh Government waste reduction targets and commercial competitiveness 268 may be to encourage this process and we would welcome the opportunity to work in partnership with the Welsh Government on potential options. Q5 What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define \"a small quantity\" of on -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? A definition is required for the phrase \"small quantity.\" As stated above, the composition of industrial by -product tends to be well -known and closely regulated. Consideration must be given to ensure large -scale or complex operations aren't und uly penalised. Thresholds or standards must be set in the context of environmental benefits gained/lost, balanced against the resource required to comply - and the administrative burden of providing evidence. This matter could be managed though the use of guidelines or Technical Advice Notes which may be managed as formal thresholds, definitions and limits. This solution may apply with respect to materials composition, moisture -content and other factors. Q6 Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when landfill tax is devolved? The application of LOI is more favorable than the alternative of complex chemical analysis. However, the level of sampling commitment across landfill users and operators should be reviewed to ens ure that an excessive level of testing (time & cost) is not a consequence. Q7 Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and, if so, how might these be resolved? The definition of a taxable area is complex and as stated in the consultation document, changes may cause practical issues in daily operation and management of records. The alignment of environmental permiting and tax requirements would help in improving consistency and cl arity, but we would not support changes that increase the level of information management, which is already very demanding. Q8 Are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? The land fill tax system should widen the credit system to allow for the recovery of material as new opportunities for recovery/recycling are developed. Owing to technical improvement in our processes, material that has been land filled in the more distant past contains a high potential for recovery. As things stand there is no credit for recovering land filled material more than three years old. It is unusual to know at the time of landfill if, and when, that landfi ll material could be recovered for reuse from a landfill site. The tax system as it is at the moment does not adequately support recovery schemes and even a partial credit for material recovery would help support our efforts to recover useful content from previously land filled . Q9 What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? 269 This may offer some advantages in simplificatio n. However a process of pay -by-default will introduce a culture of retrospective claims for credit for exempt materials. This will lead to additional procedures for all concerned adding further cost and encumbrance to the system - and a penalty for land fi lling in Wales. Q10 What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? We have already made the recommendation that materials which stabilize, mitigate, cover or contain should be treated as making a positive contribution to hea lth, safety and sustainability - and material which may be recoverable could also be treated differently to encourage good practice in sustainability. Q11 Other suggestions about how we might clarify the taxable & non -taxable activities on a landfill s ite - and what would be the practical implications of these We believe that land -fill tax for a non -commercial site, handling by -product of known composition for an industry subject to a range of taxes at all levels - could be assessed under a bespoke reg ime benefiting all interests. Q12 Should any current exemptions be removed or modified? The existing exemptions should be retained and recommend no modifications at this stage. Q13 The case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? We suppo rt the continuation of the water discount relief is supported. Tata Steel mitigates air quality challenges (fugitive emission of dust or particulates) using water for the benefit of the environment and local community. We should not be penalized for this. Some industrial by -products can naturally retain a high percentage of water without becoming a liquid waste. The WDR provides a logical and practical acknowledgement that the presence of harmless water is unavoidable (or even desirable) may be present in some wastes. It would be inappropriate to penalize this. Equally, the application to apply the WDR should continue to discourage undesirable practices in the waste management industry. Q14 The case for introducing new exemptions or reliefs At this time we have no further recommendations to make than those mentioned above. 4. Compliance & Enforcement Q15 What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge.... With a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? 270 We are supportive of the requirement to use a weighbridge. Our landfill facility already has this in place. This requirement would promote greater accuracy of recording and help maintain a level playing field in the waste management indu stry. The practical acknowledgement in the consultation document (3.16) is welcomed and arrangements would need to be made with each facility to ensure planned maintenance and unforeseen breakdowns are taken into account and the facility operators/users ar e not unfairly penalised. Q16 What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of wastes within the scope of the tax? The existing regime - including its incumbent arrangements for cost -recovery and compensation - is intended to act as a deterrent for illegal waste disposal (and fly -tipping). Land fill taxation is levied at the point when waste is land filled legally and properly. The system does not account for \"materials -in-process\" wh ich are stored on a heavily regulated industrial site under the scrutiny of other authorities. Such materials are, in fact, part of a manufacturing process which may not be complete. We do not believe it is the intention of the regime to consider this mate rial on this site as an illegal disposal. Q17 Issues with the current penalty scheme To our knowledge we have not experienced penalties in land fill tax. We aspire to an excellent relationship with the Welsh land fill tax managing body which would not ge nerate issues here. However we would propose a fair, impartial scheme. Q18 Need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? We are generally supportive of the practical approach, but it is important to understand who will ma nage the supervision of land fill tax locally. There will need to be high levels of expertise in waste and tax to ensure that all regimes are applied and checked fairly and accurately. A small country like Wales should be wary of creating a costly culture and system of multiple visits by a multiplicity of authorities and agencies whose responsibilities could collide or overlap. Q19 Further actions the WG might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimize the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? As a well -established, well -scrutinised organization whose waste -stream varies relatively little, our ability to self -regulate under supervision is proven. We are best placed to interpret waste -management legislation and strategy and seek endorsement from officials and we propose that this continue. Q20 Is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax - and what is its nature Our own understanding and approach to \"avoidance\", the role of tax -specialists within our business and the well -scrutinised environment in which we operate does make avoidance 271 impossible. In areas of doubt we engage with the authorities for clarity and to sustain certainty in tax exposure. Q21 Aligning the tax return period with the financial year We support the alignment of land fill tax returns with other parallel processes in government - offering benefits in consistency. Currently we do have arrangements with HMRC with respect to accounting periods. This works well for all parties - and in an international b usiness this is essential for reporting processes. Q22 The practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return If clear value can be ascribed to this it may be supportable, howe ver the current regime is adequate. Q23 Simplification and modernization of the filing of tax returns We would be supportive of a simple, modern system, consistent with our other administrative processes; so long as the system is secure, comprehensive, accessible and historical records can be kept. Q24 Bad debt relief As things stand we do not believe t his applies to us. Our waste supply -chain is simple and internal and we have appropriate arrangements with our on -site contractor. As the consultation progresses, we will clarify any BDR effect where the company uses third party waste sites. Q25 The opera tion of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions. We have no experience of this to date. Q26 Postponement of payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of an appeal We are not supportive of the application of penalties in advance of the conclusion of a legal process. However once the nature, structure, culture and working practices of the Welsh Revenue Authority and its scion managing land fill tax - has become estab lished a process fair for all parties can be put into place. Q27 Allocation of a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of local communities? Tata Steel's land fill activities have generated significant resources for the Landfill Communities Fund. This should be seen in the context of the major commitment the business has to community support - notably around our integrated steelworks site where our operations have the greatest impact on the community. The LCF resource is very small set against the well -established activity of UK Steel Enterprise, the steel industry 272 regeneration body which has, for over 40 years played a major part in community regeneration in Wales (and indeed the UK). In the context of reduction in reso urce at all levels of government many community services are severely stressed. It is understandable that national and local government seeks other ways to resource community activity. As our own commitment to community relations activity demonstrates, w e acknowledge the role we can play. However it is appropriate at this time to examine government -imposed community resourcing proposals to create a consistent approach. With respect to landfill, the LCF levy should not be contributory to the calculation of LDT such that it becomes a distortion affecting competitiveness. 5. Conclusion: Wales may address its own land fill tax challenges, but Wales must be \"Business -Country\" The steel industry is well -established in Wales. Working with government here, we ar e able to sustain a highly -skilled workforce, develop a strong energy and transport infrastructure, and a sound regulatory structure. Above all, a supportive fiscal environment can work together with a pro -growth economic development policy to make Wales t he country of choice for future investment in our business. Tax devolution does present some potential risks to manage. We understand the appetite within parts of the community for self -determinism at a Welsh level, and tailor -made solutions to solve loca l problems. New approaches to government, new ways to manage communities, new philosophies and new technology can all make this happen. But simultaneously we are an international business with global interests and partners. While we focus positively on imp ortant matters at a local level these must be consistent with the much broader global view to continue to drive economic benefit. To be effective for us, the instruments of Welsh devolution, be they policy, lawmaking or tax - of whatever type - must work i n this context. Some important questions must be answered to inform our proposals with respect to a devolved tax regime in Wales. The future of the Barnett Formula (or whatever its successor may be), and the future of distribution of resources from the EU with both effect Wales' fiscal balance and efficacy. These may command detailed study, consultation, and debate in their own right. A perceived major risk today lies in the complexity and cost of introducing a regional tax system - and the possibility th at a high -tax regime could be a medium/long term result, additional bureaucracy could cause delays and uncertainty and inconsistencies with UK neighbours and other EU states causing major frustration to business. Equally, we are currently unclear about h ow borrowing powers may be managed - and with what impact on the Welsh tax regime. If the Welsh Government proceeds it must be with diligence and caution and with a clear business vision of viability. 273 We wish the Welsh Government success in this consultat ion process on a subject which is clearly a political Rubicon - carrying opportunity and risk. We are optimistic that much will be learned from organisations and experts who offer their observations with good will and support for the wide ambitions of the Welsh Government. Tata Steel welcomes the opportunity to contribute its views and look forward to making further contributions where appropriate. 274 Reference 87 Name: Martin Fenn -Smith Organisation (if applicable): Monmouthshire Meadows Group Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales?

The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) represents the 22 local authorities in Wales. The three fire and rescue authorities and the three national park authorities are associate members. 2. It seeks to provide representation to local authorities w ithin an emerging policy framework that satisfies the key priorities of our members and delivers a broad range of services that add value to Welsh Local Government and the communities they serve. 3. The WLGA welcomes the opportunity to comment on the cons ultation on the tax that will replace Landfill Tax in Wales once this tax is devolved from April 2018 and to contribute to policy development in this area. We will respond to the detailed questions below but it is important that we set out our general posi tion in respect to the new tax environment, and the importance of controlling resources close to communities , where this is best to do so. WLGA's general position on the new tax environment 4. An essential part of our vision is that local government sho uld have maximum freedom and flexibility to control the resources needed to deliver services locally to communities. The tax raising powers which local government already possesses are a key feature of the resource landscape at the local level and are a ke y element in our vision for greater local control of resources. The WLGA would argue that in the new tax environment, local democratic responsibility for taxation remains a key feature. Just as there is recognition in the Welsh Government's proposals that the new devolved taxes should be brought together, there must equally be recognition of the link between nationally devolved taxes and their administration with the management and control of local taxation. Gerry Holtham's paper to the Institute of Welsh A ffairs1 recognised the strategic links between locally 278 collected property taxes, newly devolved taxes and taxes that have the potential to be devolved. 5. The WLGA has welcomed invitations already made to participate in the Tax Advisory Group and our offi cers are contributing constructively in other fora. We believe that there is a need for Local Government to have a close relationship with the WRA and a means for high level and meaningful interaction with the new body. Devolution of Landfill Tax 6. Land fill Tax has had a major impact in terms of the downward trend in the amount of waste being taken to landfill sites. As the amount of tax escalated over recent years, so the incentive grew (i) to encourage less waste in the first place and (ii) to find alt ernative, more sustainable forms of treating waste and extracting valuable resources. The tax has therefore made a significant contribution to the Welsh Government policy of moving Towards Zero Waste. Local authorities have responded positively to this pol icy and, with Welsh Government support, recycling levels have increased significantly and waste reduction messages (such as Love Food, Hate Waste) have been widely promoted. In addition, alternative treatment facilities are coming on stream including anaer obic digestion for food waste and energy from waste for residual waste. 7. The WLGA supports the Welsh Government's decision to replace Landfill Tax in Wales once it is devolved from April 2018 with the Landfill Disposals Tax (LDT). The absence of such a tax would undermine all the work that has been undertaken to date to introduce more sustainable, resource efficient systems. Also, while there inevitably will be a downward trend in terms of tax yield as landfill tonnages continue to decrease, it never the less still contributes towards the costs of public services. Since the Welsh Government's block grant will be reduced to reflect its devolution, it is important given the continuing impact of austerity measures on public services that resources are not f urther reduced by having no income from a landfill tax on devolution. 8. We also concur that final decisions on some aspects of the new tax can be made much closer to April 2018, in order to take account of developments in the economic situation within Wa les both for taxpayers and for public services. Welsh Government and wider stakeholders within Wales will also be able to benefit by learning from the experiences of Scotland due to the earlier devolution of this tax to the Scottish Government from April 2 015. RESPONSE TO THE CONSULTATION QUESTIONS 279 Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? 9. Continuing with the current rates would provid e stability for all stakeholders and would mean no cross -border impact of differing tax regimes, which may be desirable at the outset of the devolution of this tax. Even though the battle for greater fiscal devolution has been hard fought, it may be wise t o guard against change for change's sake. 10. Should Welsh Government be minded to look at changing tax rates the risks are two -fold. Set them too low and waste will come into Wales, raising revenue but undermining the policy objective of reducing the amount of waste landfilled in Wales to protect the environment. Set them too high and waste will be transported to England and revenue will be lost. Care needs to be taken to ensure that we do not significantly reduce the yield from the tax in Wales. A key consideration for the WLGA is to ensure that the overall level of funding for public services is not reduced significantly. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates set at an appropriate level for Wales? 11. Landfill operators use some o f the lower rate material to help with the ongoing development of their sites. An increase in the lower rate in Wales could lead to reduced amounts of this material coming on site (e.g. because it is transported to English landfill sites instead and/or inc ineration becomes a cheaper option and/or because business generating the waste are forced out of business by the higher costs). If landfill operators had to purchase similar materials for their site development works this would increase their costs and could undermine their viability. 12. For this reason, as in paras 9 -10 above, there is merit in retaining consistency with rates in England. There can be attempts to pass off higher rate waste at the lower rate because of the significant cost differential. However, this is better dealt with through checks and enforcement than by changing rates. Question 3: Is there value in Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax and why? 13. There may be merit in having the power to set d ifferent lower rates of tax for different categories of qualifying material. This would provide a safeguard against any sudden changes of this nature by the UK or Scottish Governments which could otherwise put Wales at a disadvantage. Question 4: Are ther e any changes to the list of material qualifying for lower tax rate that should be considered and on what basis? 280 14. The current list is established and generally understood in the industry (or subject to legal cases). Making changes would introduce unnec essary uncertainty at a time of change and could also lead to unintended consequences in terms of 'waste tourism'. It is better left as it is in the initial period and possibly reviewed once the new arrangements have bedded in. Question 5: What would be t he practical implications of introducing a threshold to define a 'small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? 15. The figure quoted in the consultation document of 10% appears to be an existing 'rule of thumb' that operators already apply successfully. However, it would be worth contacting the (limited number of) operators in Wales to substantiate this position. Typically, a load that appears to infringe this threshold, with non -qualifying waste deliberately concealed, will be impounded by the site operator. The disposer is required either to take the load away or pay the higher rate - or else the instance is reported to NRW. The disposer would also have to demonstrate compliance before they are allowed to tip again. 16. If this existing system is working effectively then there would not appear to be much merit in making a change but it would be worth confirming the position with operators. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of Weight Loss on Ignition (LoI) test w hen Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. 17. The LoI test is effective for testing fines (e.g. from MRF trommels). However, it is an expensive test that takes time to generate results and would not be suitable for use with much of the ma terial that comes in skips to landfill sites. 18. Therefore we would support selective use but widespread application would not be applicable. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place and, if so, how might these be resolved? 19. There is a need to have a clearly defined area within the overall landfill site within which taxable disposal take place. The site entrance weighbridge tends to be the most sensible locatio n for this and for practical reasons the existing arrangements should not be changed. Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and, if so, how m ight these be addressed? 281 20. At present there is limited removal of material from landfill sites so this is not a major issue. In the future, it is possible that interest could increase in 'mining' landfill sites to extract resources. However, this is ver y much subject to market forces. As supply of certain materials declines and their value increases, so the economic case for extracting these resources builds. Any such large scale recovery operations would, however, raise environmental issues that would n eed to be considered too. Question 9: What would be the practical implication of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? 21. Whilst such an approach has some attractions, the practical implication is likely to be that it will open up a fresh round of legal challenges over what is, and is not, on the exempt list (as opposed the current challenges which are over what is, and is not, on the taxable list). As a res ult it is felt that it would be better to retain the existing arrangements based on the prescribed list of taxable materials. Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? and Question 11: Do you have any othe r suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? 22. There would be no need to specify exempt activities if the approach in para 21 is taken. It would a lso ensure consistency with the approach in England. Given the existing legal cases regarding what is, and is not, taxable it may be best to retain existing arrangements until such time as court cases resolve the issues. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? 23. The current exemptions should remain in place to ensure consistency with England and avoid diverting waste. Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? 24. Water is used as a transport medium in some cases to move certain types of waste into landfill (e.g. pulverised fuel ash). It is also used, for example, by some street sweeping machines. In such instances it is the most effective and efficient way of d ealing with the waste and therefore relief is appropriate. Likewise, rainfall on waste adds to the weight and volume but some allowance for this is sensible. 282 25. There are issues with leachate though that are recognised and therefore there might be a case for further investigation and clarification on the issue of when water relief should - and possibly should not - be applied. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs? 26. No. Again for reasons of consistency with England there is value in retaining the same exemptions and reliefs (but perhaps undertaking periodic reviews jointly with England). Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? 27. On the face of it this seems a sensible and reasonable idea. One potential pract ical implication could be that some waste carriers will choose to use sites where there is no weighbridge if they believe the possibility of under - declaring is felt to be greater at certain sites. That would undermine the attempt to create level playing fi eld. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? 28. The main practical issues associated with this proposal would be in relation to enforcement. Illegal waste disposal is difficult to control by its very nature and obtaining hard evidence to prove who is responsible is not always easy (although some councils have successfully prosecuted offenders, for example using CCTV evidence). The costs of enforcement would need to be weighed against the likely tax income and, crucially, local authorities (and NRW) would need to be resourced to carry out monito ring and enforcement activity. Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penal ty regime and, if so, how might they be addressed? 29. No major issues. Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? 30. Yes - only when there is visible activity is there a deterrent effect. More over, 'on the ground' work can help to identify causes of recurring problems and suggest preventative measures instead of simply and repeatedly dealing with the consequences after the event. 283 Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposal Tax evasion? 31. The measures proposed look sensible. Given their 'on the ground' presence and experience of local tax collection, Wels h Government may want to consider resourcing local authorities to assist with local enforcement. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? 32. Yes. Local authorities an d NRW frequently have to deal with instances of fly tipping of waste which, if taken to landfill, would have incurred Landfill Tax. Similarly there have been incidences where piles of materials at recycling facilities have caught fire, sometimes in suspici ous circumstances. If this material was contaminated and not fit for recycling then it might (in the absence of other options) have had to be sent for landfill, which would have incurred Landfill Tax. Illegal waste sites have also been known to exist (e.g. where unofficial tipping has been allowed by landowners). Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? 33. Alignment with financial year has some obvious attractions in terms of consistency of financial reporting periods. Local authorities are already able to do this by requesting a form from HMRC each year and similar provision should continue to apply. The situation may not be as straightforward, however, for some private sector operators if they work o n a January to December financial year. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue Codes are used in completion of the tax return? 34. Operators already report tonnages handled using the Catalogue codes so this should not be an additional burden. However, the codes may not align in a simple way (e.g. with higher and lower rate Landfill Tax rates) in terms of completing tax returns and views of operators need to be taken into consideration . One option to consider would be for returns completed using the European Waste Catalogue Codes (e.g. weighbridge sheets) simply to be attached to tax returns. As a guiding principle, administrative burdens should be kept to a minimum, however. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? 284 35. Introduction of electronic forms would be beneficial but, given the small number of operators and the declining ton nages, the costs of developing an online version would probably outweigh any additional benefit. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and, if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? 36. Bad debt relief should be retained. There may be meri t in tightening up on the conditions where this applies, though, and the experience of doing this in Scotland should be monitored before making a decision. Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals pro visions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? 37. WLGA agrees with Welsh Government that taking steps to avoid disputes arising in the first place should be the prime focus. Should a dispute arise, however, only the person who submitted the documentation should be eligible to appeal and this should then be subject to an independent review. Procedures need to be kept as simple as possible. Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circ umstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposal Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? 38. Yes. If the appeal is over payment at the lower rate of tax and this payment is required upfront, the risk that a subsequent decision might force the higher rate to be paid would be too great. Operators would have to charge customers at the higher rate to protect themselves against such a risk. If they continued collecting only the lower rate of tax, such a decision could drive them out of business. Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax to enhance the well -being of communities? 39. Whilst the Landfill Communities Fund has supported a range of good projects in communities over the y ears, the declining revenue expected from the tax over coming years will mean that this will be a dwindling fund. Since each fund requires its own administration, with associated costs, having a multitude of small funds is not a cost effective approach. 40. One option would be for a proportion of the revenue raised to be used to support waste awareness work by local authorities. There is already an established mechanism for supporting local authorities with waste awareness work in the form of Waste Awarene ss Wales so there would be no need to establish a new body to oversee this. 285 41. Otherwise, it would seem more sensible for the revenue raised to contribute to strategic funding within Welsh Government to protect public services to communities. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community well -being, which of the following activities should benefit from funding: - supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - other 42. If the response to question 27 regarding Waste Awa reness Wales is accepted then this would fit best under the 'waste minimisation and diversion from landfill' heading (or if the suggestion of revenue being used to support strategic funding is adopted, none of these would apply in a direct sense). The enforcement option would seem worthy of consideration if the claimed return of \u00a33.60 to \u00a35.50 for every \u00a31 spent on enforcement is correct. This would have the potential to increase the amount of revenue raised overall in protection of services. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? 43. Again, if the response to question 27 is accepted then this would be administered via the existing Waste Awareness Wales operation. (Alternatively, if the funds simply go to support strate gic funding of public services within Welsh Government then this would not be an issue).

Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response.: Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why?: Q4: Are there any changes to the list o f materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis?: Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifyin g material?: Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons.: Q7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved?: Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed?: 'Credit' for removal of landfill material should be made available for any activity that can demonstrate waste prevention, such as 're -use or repair' of items otherwise destined for disposal. Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax?: Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why?: Q11: Do you have any other suggestions 287 for how w e might clarify the taxable and non-taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these?: Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response.: Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response.: Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why?: Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so?: Q16: Wh at would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax?: Illegal waste deposits, where identified, should be classed as landfill sites and taxed accordingly. Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed?: Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible.: Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what tho se actions could be?: Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this?: Q21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons.: Yes - it makes financial administration more efficient in most cases. Q22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes 288 are used in completion of the tax return?: Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support?: Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate?: Q25: Have you any comments on the operat ion of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal?: Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal?: Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities?: Yes, absolutely. Landfill Disposals Tax sh ould be used in line with the Well -being of Future Generations Act and ensure that activities that offer local skills, jobs and resource efficiency - and which also offer anti -poverty or other community benefits - are actively supported through the new tax. Examples will be community furniture re -use projects that divert waste from landfill, provide volunteering, jobs and skills opportunities and in most cases enable access to affordable household items for people with limited financial means. A minimum of 25% of the revenue from the tax should be protected for waste prevention and re - use/repair activities that also support community well-being. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbe ing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiati ves and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Supporting waste minimisation and diversion of waste from landfill - especially re -use and repair activities that capture materials and retain their utility and social and economic value within local communities (25% of tax revenue). Also biodiversity and wider environmental improvements to ensure that reinvestment in the natural capital of Wales is supported - a protected budget could be considered to support the Environment Wales network of community projects in Wales (25% of total tax revenue). Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: Keep it streamlined and efficient. Link to Waste Data Flow - seek improve ments in managing the whole process of data capture and processing for purposes of tax and public sector revenue. 289 Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: The recycling i nfrastructure in Wales is now well established. Much greater efforts must be made to invest in the infratstucture higher up the Waste Hierarchy - notably for re -use and repair of usable items otherwise destined for ladnfill disposal. Where such infrastruct ure also supports community well-being then these activities should be given priority for investment and future development.

The point is that the Landfill Tax has been a Godsend to various environmental projects up and down Wales that simply would not have been undertaken without it. Examples in my area in Newport are small -scale enhancements to our local park (Woodland Park) undertaken by a community group, making it much more useful to local residents and to wildlife; and various wildlife projects undertaken by Gwent Wildlife Trust. It is only right that the environmental costs of landfill - which are quite considerable in Newport - are compensated for by undertaking environmental improvement works in the local area. And it is important that this source of funding remains open to small, local organisations who otherwise struggle to find funding for their valuable work. So, whatever else happens to this tax in Wales, please maintain these arrangements which seem to be working well, rather than have all the tax proceeds swallowed -up centrally and used potentially for environmentally -damaging projects such as the M4 relief road around Newport. yours sincerely Robert Waller 297 Reference 93 Name: Dipti Patel Organisation (if applicable): Gwent Wildlife Trust Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why?: Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales?

We want to hand our countryside and green spaces on to the next generation, and in a better condition than when we were children. Wales needs to mo ve to a 'circular' economy, where waste is minimised, resources are re -used through repair, remanufacturing and recycling, energy is captured from waste that cannot be re -used and landfill is kept to the absolute minimum. This is not just for the sake of our environment but to ensure the ongoing competitiveness of our economy in a more challenging global environment. We cannot afford to be complacent about competition for resources or the risk of resource shocks in the coming decades. We have a real oppor tunity to lead the way, generating sustainable prosperity and jobs. Replacement of UK Landfill Tax by Welsh Landfill Disposals Tax The Welsh Liberal Democrats submission to the Part I of the Commission on Devolution in Wales was fully supportive of landfill tax being devolved as waste management and recycling is already largely devolved to the National Assembly for Wales. The obje ctive of the landfill disposals tax to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill is obviously agreed. However, we are fully aware that once the landfill tax is transferred to the Welsh Government, the negotiated sum, which Wales will have had taken off the block grant from Westminster could leave us a budget deficit. It needs to be ensured that Wales does not have a funding shortfall due to the amount of waste going to landfill being reduced. Reducing pressures on landfill We believe that the amount of waste sent to landfill should be reduced by using regulation both nationally and in the European Union to promote 301 sustainable design where repairability, reuse and recyclability are prioritised, and to reduce packaging waste. There needs to be added education about the cost implications of sending waste to landfill to the general public. Reduction of fly -tipping One potential impact of the landfill tax has been an increase in fly -tipping. The number of fly -tipping incidents has consistently falle n since a peak in 2007/08. However, we believe the 32,934 fly -tipping incidents reported by Welsh local authorities during 2013 -14 is still too high. The proportion of fly -tipping incidents involving household waste decreased only slightly to 70% in 2013 - 14, from 71% in 2012 -13. Despite estimated fly -tipping clearance costs falling from a peak of \u00a33 million in 2007 -08, the \u00a31.9 million cost in 2013 -14 is still excessive. During 2013 -14, 24,701 enforcement actions were taken in Wales; an increase on the 22, 938 taken in 2012 -13. Of those where local authorities carried out prosecutions, 75% resulted in a fine3. The Welsh Liberal Democrats want action taken to boost the number of organisations prosecuted for illegal dumping. Under the proposal, organisations caught fly -tipping on an industrial scale to deliberately evade tax could face up to \u00a39m in fines. Currently only a small number of prosecutions are successful across the UK, ranging between 171 -197 a year. This is despite the large -scale dumping operation s conducted by some companies. There should also be a higher, more consistent level of fines for fly -tippers who damage Britain's environment. As well as causing severe damage to Britain's environment and wildlife, illegal waste sites, fly -tipping and l andfill tax evasion costs the UK taxpayer on average \u00a3500m a year in lost revenue. The Welsh Liberal Democrats believe there should be increased penalties for waste crimes, aiming to move from an average fine of \u00a350,000 to \u00a375,000 and to an average sentenc e of 12 to 18 months. The Welsh Liberal Democrats believe there should be a 'carrot and stick' approach to waste, one which combines a Stern Review style action plan that turns waste into an economic asset but comes down hard on industrial fly tippers th rough larger penalties and fines. It needs to be made simpler who accepts responsibility for prosecution. The boundary between Natural Resources Wales and local authorities can make prosecuting a guilty party more difficult because there can be confusion about who is responsible and who has the resources to prosecute. 3 http://gov.wales/statistics -and-research/local -authority -recorded -flytipping/?lang=en 302 Landfill Communities Fund The Landfill Communities Fund is a crucial benefit from this tax and we believe it must have a continuing role and be refocused to environmental aims. For example the percentage of Landfill tax for funding wildlife projects should be increased - possibly t o 10%. Projects like the Wildlife Trust of South & West Wales at Parc Slip, Bridgend would not have been able to manage and protect scarce habitats for threatened species of Lapwing and Marsh Fritillary butterfly without this specific funding. These are as are crucial to protect for the benefit of wildlife and our environment, but also for the health and well -being of the local community. There is an increasing population of obese children and people with ailments that could be prevented such as heart di sease, diabetes and stroke. Connecting with nature and the natural environment helps create a healthier, happier community. The design of the landfill disposals tax needs to keep in mind that many Welsh communities are suffering because of landfill sites including those near the border, where there's been a tradition of the clay industry. There would be concern in those communities if they don't see any benefit in terms of the tax being spent locally. Collection of the Landfill Disposals Tax The Welsh Liberal Democrats support the establishment of the Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA), as a non -Ministerial department, accountable to the Assembly. We also support the majority of the Welsh Government proposals that will enable to Wales to have a fully -functio ning, efficient and effective regime for the collection and management of Welsh Taxes. It is important that the cost of the administration of the tax that falls on Wales is kept to a minimum. The WRA should be able to draw down money from the Welsh Cons olidated Fund. The Wales Audit Office should be given the job of overseeing this process. The WRA needs to be scrutinised by the Assembly through the Finance Committee. Conclusion In addition to the points made above the Welsh Liberal Democrats will continue to develop its policy on landfill tax. 303 Reference 95 I am concerned that revenue may be lost from biodiversity funding and wish to ask government to ensure that this is not the case. Thank you M Pitt 304 Reference 96 British Heart Foundation (BHF) Cymru is the nation's leading heart charity. We are working to achieve our vision of a world in which people do not die prematurely or suffer from cardiovascular disease. In the fight for every heartbeat we fund ground breaking medical research, provide support and care to people living with cardiovascular disease and advocate for change. Our dedicated staff and nearly 1,000 volunteers raised \u00a31.3 million in profit across Wales to fund our life -saving resea rch in Wales last year. In Wales we have 25 standard shops and 7 larger -format Furniture and Electrical stores. We welcome this opportunity to respond on the consultation on the distribution of the Landfill Disposal Tax Communities Fund and this response addresses Q27 -29 in the consultation questionnaire. Question 27 : Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Yes Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) We agree that a proportion of the tax revenue should be directly assigned to community benefit, but that the balance of this funding between the communities around the sites and others throughout Wales should be 305 reviewed. Waste disposal creates a local disbenefit in the immediate area, which should be recognised and compensated with in reason, and a wider impact in terms of reduced economic opportunities from re -use and recycling. Enforcement action should be given adequate support, but it does itself generate a direct income and should not require additional funding. As landfill p lays a less significant role local impacts are reducing - there will be less and less expansion and development of new sites. Landfill operators are already obliged to contribute to the management of sites when they close. Therefore the key unfunded impa cts of disposal for this reducing volume of material will be in terms of economic and social value of wasted items. Waste minimisation and re -use can play a major role in tackling poverty and deprivation. We would argue that these two objectives could bo th be met by targeted application of tax revenues to develop the re -use sector. There are already many charity retailers and others engaged in effective re - use activity, which diverts thousands of tonnes from landfill and provides employment, volunteer opportunities, affordable goods and savings to local authorities' waste budgets. There are structural interventions that could support the sector on a medium term basis as the use of landfill reduces, for instance: 1. Generic communications to encourage resi dents to choose to re -use, eg Wales wide campaigns, training and support in local website and call centre management for waste enquiries 2. Pilot projects to capture more of the harder to reach items for re -use through kerbside or bulky collections, eg small electricals, bric -a-brac, furniture 3. Infrastructure for re -use at Household Waste Recycling Centres, eg containers, signage, operative training 4. A national re -use line, as already in place in Scotland, as the default route for bulky waste enquiries - this c ould represent a cheap and convenient option for householders with no call on local authority time or budgets, allowing for inclusion of local, regional and national re -use services as appropriate 5. An accreditation process, as already in place in Scotland ( Revolve), which would improve confidence in re -use services for local authorities and create a standard which must be met in order for them to be recognised partners. A formal, documented process would not only increase transparency of end destinations, i t would address concerns about unfairness and allow accredited organisations of whatever size to benefit from promotional activity and disposal/recycling of residual donations. At present our experience has been inconsistent across Welsh local authorities . 6. Furniture recycling - a proportion of material collected for re -use is inevitably unfit for sale or donation. A joined up system which incorporates repair, upcycling and removal of parts, as well as 306 recycling, would open up further opportunities to deri ve value from discarded furniture and would reduce the cost burden on re -use operators. All of the above ideas are extensions of existing good practice which could deliver social and economic benefits to a wide variety of organisations and individuals wi thout requiring on -going commitments in the longer term. They mitigate the wasted opportunities represented by landfill disposal as well as taking strategic steps to move away from disposal towards a circular economy. The existing and future re -use secto r includes both small and large charities and businesses. Benefits of re -use will continue to be felt at local level, with warehouses, workshops and retail outlets necessarily spread across many communities. However the organisations involved do not them selves need to be 'small re -use and recycling businesses' (5.29), as larger operators are often able to deliver better value through reduced overheads and efficiencies. It is also worth noting that larger organisations such as national charity retailers d irect these savings towards other community benefits, such as healthcare which are delivered at local level. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? The current administration of the LTCF is costly, with 14% of revenue going towards administration rather than direct community benefits. It is also biased towards the interests of landfill operators and does not address need or capacity issues, as distribution of funds is decided by individual environmental bodies case by case. If the Landfill Disposals Tax is to make a strategic difference it should logically be related to strategic priorities, for instance in 'Towards Zero Waste', sector plans, and on -going policy developments by the Welsh Government and local authoritie s. The Welsh Government or a suitably qualified organisation with relevant experience would be better placed to deliver against agreed objectives than a large number of individual environmental bodies. This would also reduce the proportion of administrat ive overheads. If the tax revenues are to achieve a planned result the communities fund needs to be a compulsory element centrally managed. In relation to match funding there is no reason why a landfill operator could not make additional community contri butions which are tax deductible.

May 2015 307 Reference 97 Response by Buglife to Developing a Landfill Dispo sals Tax Consultation by the Welsh Government Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Buglife have found the Landfill Communities Funding (LCF) to have had a positive impact for both biodiversity and communities. Example: West Glamorgan Stepping Stones (funder WREN) Project Budget: \u00a3101,000 Biodiversity West Glamorgan Stepping Stones is g athering important survey data for invertebrates, reptiles and plants on fivewildlife -rich brownfield sites in South Wales, restoring 48 hectares of brownfield habitat. Project sites include Kilvey Hill and Pluck Lake in Swansea, and Bryn Tip, Cymmer Coal Tip and Tata Steel in Neath Port Talbot. The survey data gathered is used to inform habitat management for species such as the Brown -banded carder bee ( and the wide variety of wildlife that finds refuge on brownfield sites. Community Local Communities are involved in work parties, gaining both land management skills and improvements to their health and well -being. Project activities promote the value of brownfield sites for supporting Welsh wildlife, and highlight the wildlife on the doorstep of local communities. Local Economy In addition to volunteer work parties, Buglife have used local contractors for heavier tasks such as 'scrub clearance', thus boosting the local economy. Industrial heritage 'brownfields' These sites are closely linked to West Glamorgan's industrial heritage of copper, tin and coal mining. Swansea was once known as 'Copperopolis - the copper capital of the world'. 308 The exte nt and scale of the industrialisation that took place in this region, at a time when there were no environmental controls in place, created a legacy of contaminated land. However, where these brownfield sites have returned to nature they now form some of t he best wildlife habitats in the local area. The LCF has been the only source of significant funding for brownfield projects run by Buglife. Brownfield sites have particular significance for Buglife as they are known to support a rich and unusual range o f invertebrate species, many of which are rare or threatened. Brownfield projects offer a unique opportunity to make substantial improvements for biodiversity and to connect local communities with the wildlife on their doorstep. Question 28: If the Wels h Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why: - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling povert y and deprivation in communitie - Other (please specify) Buglife supports maintaining Landfill Disp osals Tax revenue for Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements . Recent experience of seeking funding for a Buglife South Wales biodiversity project involved researching a wide number of funding sources. The following funders advised that this type of project was not suitable for them: Local Authorities, Neath, Carmarthenshire, Swansea Big Lottery Heritage Lottery Fund Princes Countryside Fund The Dulverton Trust Community Foundation in Wales Landfill Disposals Tax Revenue offers the only dedicated funding source for maintaining and improving the biodiversity of Wales for the benefit of all. There are a number of other funding streams for compliance, waste minimisation and tackling poverty but funding for biodiversity is scarce. If funding from landfill tax is diluted, it will make it hard to hit specific environmental Welsh Government commitments such as the halting the loss of biodiversity by 2020 or delivering the Action Plan for Pollinators in Wales. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? 309 Buglife support: 1. measures to speed up the flow of money to support biodiversity and community groups making administration of the fund more effective and efficient e.g. grant payment in advance not in arrears 2. having a single body administering grant making 3. keeping the administrative costs of any delivery body to a minimum 4. streamlining processes, with standardised application forms, guidance notes and reporting forms for all applications 5. maintaining the link between the site of the landfill activity and the benefit brought about by a grant within a 25m radius of the landfill site with a review of the distance every two years 6. remove the requirement for independent third pa rty contributions Yours sincerely, Clare Dinham Conservation Officer, Wales 310 Reference 98 Consultation Response Form Name: Kim Gutteridge, Grants Manager, High Value Fundraising, UK Headquarters Organisation (if responding on behalf of that organisation): RSPB Specific responses to consultation questions For the purposes of this consultation response we restrict our comments to general principles of Tax Rates and Tax Disposals (Chapter 2) and Community Well being (Chapter 5). Opening Remarks The way that society deals with waste, and our behaviours relating to resource consumption, can have direct and indirect impacts on wildlife and its habitats. The RSPB therefore supports the intention behind Wales's Tow ards Zero Waste Strategy (2010) and the drive towards an environmentally sustainable Wales where waste use is minimised and everyone uses only their fair share of resources. Such an approach is consistent with the principles of sustainable development - as set out, and supported by the Welsh Government, in One Wales: One Planet - the Sustainable Development Scheme for Wales (2009)4. These principles include \"livi ng within environmental limits\". This scheme for Sustainable Development is consistent with the overarching principles of the UK shared framework. The UK's shared framework, One Future - different paths states that the goal for sustainable development wil l be: \"pursued in an integrated way through a sustainable, innovative and productive economy that delivers high levels of employment, and a just society that promotes social inclusion, sustainable communities and personal well -being. This will be done in ways that protect and enhance the physical and natural environment, and use resources and energy as efficiently as possible\"5 4 http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/documents/829/One%20Wales -%20One%20Planet%20(2009).pdf 2 Watson and Albon, 2011, The UK National Ecosystem Assessment: Synthesis of the Key Findings. UK's shared framework for sustaina ble development. 311 Sustainable development and biodiversity conservation as a key indicator of sustainable development, are therefore central underp inning principles to which all Welsh Government policy should adhere. All policies should therefore contribute to securing the achievement of sustainable development and biodiversity conservation . Accordingly, we believe that policies in relation to waste and landfill should be developed so as to secure the maximum possible contribution to the achievement of sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. A key part of the Towards Zero Waste Strategy is the policy of reducing and ultimately eradic ating landfill in Wales. This is clearly consistent with achieving sustainable development and, given the impact of resource use and waste management on wildlife and its habitats, the RSPB fully supports this policy. A key means to secure this objective i s the use of landfill tax to apply a real 'cost' to the, otherwise, 'free' activity of disposing of waste to landfill. Therefore, whilst the practice of landfill is in existence and taxation and other policies are securing its phasing out, we strongly su pport the existence of a Landfill Communities Fund, or similar such fund, which hypothecates tax raised from an environmentally damaging activity for projects that benefit the environment. Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals Question 1: How import ant is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? If there is no replacement or consistent cost in Welsh Landfill Tax rates this would become the cheapest option for was te disposal and would not result in the behavioural change desired in reducing waste to landfill. A lower rate of tax could result in 'waste tourism' and increased transportation of waste into Wales. This will cause an increase in the disamenity to local c ommunities due to higher levels of noise and pollution and increase of carbon emissions. The way that society deals with waste, and our behaviours relating to resource consumption, can have direct and indirect impacts on wildlife and its habitats. The RSPB therefore supports the intention behind Towards Zero Waste Strategy (June 2010) and the drive towards an environmentally sustainable Wales where waste use is minimised and everyone uses only their fair share of resources. Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax re venue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? 312 The LCF has provided much -needed financial support to communities around Wales since its conception in 1996. It has been one of the few funding streams to support 'pure' biodiversity projects. This has allow ed important habitats to be restored/enhanced to help safeguard Wales's rich diversity of plant and wildlife species and provide healthy green spaces for people to enjoy and connect with nature. We believe a Landfill Community type fund will help support the Well Being Goals in the Well Being of Future Generations Act 20156 especially in creating A Resilient Wales - \"A nation which maintains and enhances a biodiverse natural environment with healthy functioning ecosystems that support social, economic and ecological resilience and the capacity to adapt to change (for example climate change)\". Value of Nature to Community Wellbeing The life -enhancing qualities of nature are well documented. What is less appreciated is its importance to local economies and well-being. At a time of fiscal austerity the financial benefits of the natural world must sit at the heart of green economic strategy and the Landfill Communities Fund is a vital addition to help achieve this. Fantastic places for wildlife can also be fantastic places for people. Enhancing the natural environment is a sound investment. It not only benefits wildlife, it also benefits local economies, our health and education, ensures the provision of valuable goods and services and makes a vital contri bution to sustainable communities. Land is more than just a wide open space; it is the unifying backdrop to community activities. The role of the environment is critical to the long -term sustainable future of our communities and the people in them. Peo ple do not exist in isolation from the environment. The multi -functional benefits of the natural environment often go unnoticed and are consequently under -resourced. Only 3% of UK philanthropy goes to addressing environmental problems and climate change funding, though increasing, still only receives a paltry 0.7% of total giving. Of this biodiversity receives only 20%. Of that \"Environmental philanthropy continues to have a strong international element, with nearly half of all grants (48.3%) going for work outside the United Kingdom.\"7 Actions to save UK biodiversity have been costed at only 0.2% of all public spending8 but only around half of that is supplied9. 6 http://www.senedd.assembly.wales/documents/s37945/Well - being%20of%20Future%20Generations%20Wales%20Bill%20as%20passed.pdf 7 Where the Green Grants Went 5 report, by Jon Cracknell, Heather Godwin, Nick Perks & Harrier Williams, January 2012, Environmental Funders Network. 8 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228842/8082.pdf 9 http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=NE0111_9411_ABS.docx 313 Nature is good for young people As well as contributing to community wellbeing, the natural environment is enhances us all and can have a profound impact on the next generation. Getting hands on with nature, whether through an informal visit or formally through education or volunteering has many benefits both individually and for the community. \"First -hand experiences... can help to make subjects more vivid and interesting for pupils and enhance their understanding... [and] could make an important contribution to pupils' future economic wellbeing and to preparing them for the next stage of their liv es.\"10 Nature is good for community cohesion It reduces crime and aggression and improves community integration11. Interaction with nature improves children's concentration and behaviour as well as improving self esteem. Teenagers and adults can learn new s kills making them more employable in the long term. Early involvement can spark a life -long interest making communities and sites more sustainable. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance co mmunity wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) The RSPB recommends that biodiversity conservation must be the priority area for any future funding from the LCF . We strongly support both maintaining a Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) and extending the credit limit for contributions to the fund. We would like to see the fund increase from 5.7% diversion rate currently to being ring -fenced at a minimum of 10%. Funding for the natural environment is becoming increasingly restricted and compe titive. There is a huge gap in funding of around \u00a3338 million for UK BAP habitats and species. Halting biodiversity loss by 2010 was largely missed in the UK, although some notable RSPB exceptions were: stone - curlew - 369 pairs in 2010 against a target of 300 pairs and bittern - 47 sites supporting breeding bitterns in 2010 compared to a target of 31. If funding from the LCF is reduced or removed, Welsh Government will not achieve its biodiversity obligations and targets such as: 10 Ofsted (2008) Learning Outside the Classroom: how far should you go? Manchester: Office for Standar ds in Education, Children's Services and Skills. 11 Bird W, 2004 Natural Fit, the RSPB. 314 halting the loss of bi odiversity by 2020 and 2050 having all statutory designated sites (e.g. SSSI and SAC) in favourable condition by 2026 Biodiversity Benefit - Nature is in Trouble and Needs Help Under Object DA, the LCF is also one of the few remaining funding streams that maintains a direct interest in outcomes for wildlife. Indeed, against the wider backgrounds of austerity and a funding community rarely focussed on nature conservation, this fund is increasingly essential to continue work to halt the continuing, and in some places, devastating, loss of wildlife in Wales. As is widely reported in the groundbreaking State of Nature Report12, we are in a state of major and continuing decline in wildlife with 60% of the species in the UK having declined over recent decades. We have quantitative assessments of the population or distribution trends of 3,148 species. Of these: 60% of species have declined over the last 50 years 31% have declined strongly more than one in ten of all the species in the UK are under threat of disappearing from our shores altogether We believe that the Welsh Government should continue to keep money coming into the biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements not just for its own sake but for the well documented social, economic and health and well -being benefits that it brings. Addressing Disadvantage We believe that the natural environment can help support people achieve a better quality of life in difficult times. For example: Improving the local environment and creating new volunteering opportunities = New skills, greater self esteem/health and more employability at little or not cost to the participant Influence young people's attitude to nature by increasing their nature based knowledge and skills, and that of their parents and teachers. Children getting better life chances (education, health and wellbeing) through early interaction with nature 'Every Child Outdoors' RSPB 201013 Increase young people's environmental learning opportunities, improving their knowledge and ski lls for solving environmental problems, and promoting pro -environmental actions. Health and Well -being 12 The State of Nature Report http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/stateofnature_tcm9 -345839.pdf 13 http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/everychildoutdoors_tcm9 -259689.pdf 315 Nature is much more than an economic booster. It has proven health and well-being benefits. Accessible green space can provide a wide range of physica l and mental health benefits, increasing our well -being and reducing health care costs. Physical inactivity costs the UK over \u00a38 billion a year and leads directly to chronic disease and lack of independence in the elderly14. The joy of being outdoors often overcomes any noticeable physical exertion involved. The quality and proximity of nature affects our psychological wellbeing15. The total cost of mental healthcare in England is \u00a341.8 billion. 'The countryside can be seen as a great outpatient departmen t whose therapeutic value is yet to be fully realised.' (Dr William Bird author of NATURAL FIT: Can Green Space and Biodiversity Increase Levels of Physical Activity? (Oct 2004) Economic Value of Nature Nature makes a substantial and measurable contribution to the economy. Evidence from two recent reports, The Economics of Ecosystems (TEEB)16 and National Ecosystems Assessment (NEA)17 provide compelling evidence that if we properly account for nature's value it makes economic sense to preserve it. Pavan Sukhdev, who heads up the ongoing TEEB report, suggests18 that we lose as much natural capital each year, equal to that lost in the recent credit crunch. Whilst we might be cynical about the precise value but one thing is clear, losses are big and h ave tangible impacts which are only increasing. RSPB nature reserves are economically diverse tracts of land that provide many local benefits: direct employment; spend by staff and volunteers; direct expenditure on goods and services; grazing through farm ers (lets) and visitor spend within local area. Visitors want to see an attractive coastline and flourishing wildlife. Footpaths, viewing facilities and interpretation all help them enjoy spending time in the UK. Having the chance to understand and val ue their local wildlife, whether on a nature reserve or at the end of the pier, helps communities take a pride in their natural assets and help conserve them. Green Tourism and Employment Nature conservation is big business and green tourism is a growth s ector. Visits to RSPB nature reserves grew by a massive s38% from around 1.5 14 Bird W, 2004 Natural Fit, the RSPB. 15 Pretty J, Griffin M, Peacock J, Hine R, Sellens M and South N (2005) A countryside for health and wellbeing: the physical and mental health benefits of green exercise.

UK's shared framework for sustainable development. 17 Sukhdev et. al., 2010, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity: A synthesis of the approach, conclusions, and recommendations of almost 2 million between 2005 -2009. This is at a time when general UK tourism trips declined by 9.2% during the same period. Across the UK the natural environment sup ports 750,000 full time equivalent (FTE) jobs and over \u00a327.5 billion pounds of economic output. The RSPB estimate that our reserve network supports 1,872 jobs in local economies (in 2009) an increase of 87% since 2002. A study19 shows RSPB South Stack Cliffs in Anglesey in 2009 supported 3.6 direct jobs, a figure which has since increased to 12 FTE jobs in 2010 following investment at the site, and volunteers completed 307 working days at the site. The reserve spent almost \u00a340,00 0 on maintenance and developments, and hosted 38 hectares of worked agricultural lets. South Stack Cliffs also received 32,165 visitors, of whom 74% said that the reserve was one or the main reason for them visiting the area. These visitors spent a total o f \u00a32.2 million, of which \u00a3570,000 was local, additional spend, attributable directly to the reserve. Nature reserves help extend tourist seasons. Seabird colonies and overwintering wildfowl attract visitors in their thousands throughout the winter months . A healthy natural environment is also an influencing factor in where businesses choose to locate. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? We believe that it is important for any LCF -type programme to have an indep endent regulator. In Wales there is a variety of sources for LCF funds which includes three Councils licensed as Landfill Operators. Any Welsh Scheme will have to consider the best way to achieve value for money whilst upholding the ethos of the scheme t o benefit local communities and biodiversity. We have no specific recommendation at this point, only to specify that any administrative model must ensure that the amount going to projects is maximised and the administration of the fund is kept simple an d cost effective. Distribution of funds must be fair and transparent. Currently applicants can apply to a number of funders at the same time (depending on where their priority projects occur) and we would like to see this principle continued - otherwise it will mean a reduction in funding for biodiversity projects across Wales. 19 RSPB, 2012 Natural Foundations: Conservation and local employment in the UK 317 We have a great deal of experience in this Fund and we look forward to being involved further in the development of the administrative model. We have been closely involved in the Scottish Government's approach and applaud their inclusion of a higher credit limit to 10% to increase the funding available for environmentally sound projects. Additional Questions Question 30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifical ly addressed or other comments that you would like to make? Geographic Vicinity The current regulation states 'vicinity of a landfill site' yet ENTRUST guidance interprets this as 10miles as the crow flies. By defining the exact distance, this potential ly puts at a disadvantage projects that fall just outside this area and does not allow the funder any degree of flexibility to include worthwhile projects falling just beyond this area. In the long-term, this could mean an exhaustion of good projects in th e 10 mile radius with good projects just outside being excluded. We appreciate that the original intent of LCF was to benefit communities/projects within a suitable distance from the landfill operation. By restricting funding for biodiversity projects to within 10miles of a specific landfill operator's site means that funding for such projects effectively becomes a postcode lottery. If this fund is - as a contribution to Welsh Biodiversity Strategy objectives - to pay for UK Biodiversity Action Plan pri ority species and habitats, then it has to be prepared to fund them wherever they occur in the vicinity of any landfill site (however this is eventually defined). What counts as a landfill site? There is a discrepancy regarding what is considered an eligible landfill site. The HMRC list of licensed operators is mainly based on those still paying tax. However, there are some sites which remain licensed as they still have to be managed. Some funders will only accept those on the HMRC list which potentia lly means projects will be turned down even though they are within the required distance from an eligible landfill site. If the 10mile 'rule' is scrapped but projects still have to be 'within the vicinity of a landfill site', we would welcome a definitive list in Wales of eligible sites. In addition, given that populations are more sparse and spread out in many areas of Wales, we would also welcome any broadening of the eligibility criteria. Any list produced would have to be kept up -to-date and amended when sites change owner, or if they are no longer licensed or owned by a person/organisation registered to pay landfill tax. Rate of spend 318 It must be recognised that funds committed through a contract are not easy to spend within short timescales (e.g. Wels h Government's Nature Fund). Indeed, it is vital for the success of conservation projects to have funders who can commit to funding long term projects (3 -5 years). Therefore RSPB recommends that the fund must continue to allow multiyear projects. It is als o be recognised that this fund helps to unlock significant match funding (independent funding organisations and volunteer hours). It's vital to recognise that there is a big difference between 'unspent' funds and funds retained by a DEB but already alloc ated for multiple -year projects, released on a yearly basis. Summary The RSPB strongly supports the principles of the Welsh Government's Towards Zero Waste Strategy. A tax on landfill disposals is a welcome and positive contribution to achieving the aims of this strategy, and we support the continuation of such a measure when the power is devolved in 2018. As a general concept, so -called 'green taxes' are welcome. Th e Welsh Government could make greater use of fiscal measures to achieve environmental policy objectives. While landfill still exists, and the tax is 'driving down' quantities, the continued existence of a Landfill Communities Fund (or similar scheme) to give operators credits for dispersing funds to environmental projects is important. The LCF (object DA) is one of the few funding streams for 'pure' biodiversity projects. It has supported a wide range of good projects, and has the potential to continue and expand this delivery. Without this funding stream, the Welsh Government's biodiversity targets will not be met. All public finances must be transparent and well -regulated. However, with many recipients of these funds being charities, it should be pos sible to use existing regulatory/auditing functions, and ensure that the use of the funds is appropriately monitored and reported on. It is right that the use of taxes on an environmental 'bad' should be used to deliver benefits, in the form of an enviro nmental 'good', \"in the vicinity of\" the 'bad'. However, given Wales's geography and the distribution of its biodiversity, there is a need to be flexible about how \"in the vicinity of\" is defined. The LCF fund must continue to allow multiyear projects. R educing the length of projects means increased administration costs for both applicants and the Distributive Environmental Body plus most environmental projects need several seasons to be implemented and to carry on effective monitoring. 319 Please see append ix one for a case study demonstrating the value of the LCF to biodiversity and its ability to provide a strategic multi year framework to the recovery of priority habitats across the UK, including at the Newport Wetland and the Gwent Levels.

Appendix 1 - UK Case Study RSPB/Biffa Award National Coastal and Floodplain Grazing Marsh Programme 2008 -2011 (\u00a31.8m) Overview of Organisation The RSPB is the country's largest nature conservation charity, inspiring everyone to giv e nature a home. Together with their partners, they protect threatened birds and wildlife so our towns, coast and countryside will teem with life once again. They also play a leading role in a worldwide partnership of nature conservation organisations. Th e RSPB manage over 200 nature reserves across the UK and these support a diverse range of wildlife and habitats. They are supported by more than 17,000 volunteers and more than 1 million members. The RSPB has been successful in securing Biffa Award grants for a number of projects and sites across the country including this national coastal and floodplain grazing marsh project. Project Background Over the past 60 years, there have been substantial losses in the size and quality of this important UK BAP habi tat. Losses of grazing marsh from the early 1930s to the mid -1980s are estimated as having decreased site are by around 40%. The exact current extent of grazing marsh in the UK is not known, but it is possible that there may be a total of 300,000 ha. Engl and holds the largest proportion with an estimate in 1994 of 200,000 ha with smaller but equally important concentrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The RSPB was approached by the Biffa Award grants team to identify opportunities to improv e the natural environment. As a result a number of options were developed in outline and presented to the Biffa Awards team, who subsequently determined that an application should be developed based on maintaining, achieving favourable condition and resto ring coastal and 320 floodplain grazing marsh across the country in areas eligible for Biff Award funding. Project Delivery The project approved included 3 years of funding focussed on 14 sites across the UK. A summary of the range of activity across some of t he sites is detailed below: Vane Farm (RSPB Loch Leven in Scotland) - Approximately 50,000m3 of soil was moved to create five wader terraces and two main 250m earth bunds. 1500m of ditches were excavated, three scrapes created and seven sluices installed . There is now direct hydrological control over a 20 ha area of floodplain grazing marsh. Newport Wetlands (South Wales) - Removal of hedges and restoration of ancient features to restore SSSI ditch habitat within 54 ha of grazing marsh (to favourable cond ition) and provide a more attractive habitat for foraging lapwing and a home for more aquatic species including otters. Lough Beg (Northern Ireland) - Funding was used to recruit a member of staff to develop a conservation management plan to identify pract ical solutions to problems affecting 300 hectares prior to any physical implementation. Marshside (Merseyside) - Maintained 110 ha by de -silting ditches and adjusting the grazing regime by using native cattle. Trialling of anti - predator measures including llamas to act as - guards for ground nesting birds. West Canvey Marches (Essex) - Water controls and a new 3 ha reservoir are providing improved breeding and overwintering conditions across 131 ha for many priority species. This site is close to many peopl e who can enjoy spectacular views of the wildlife. Otmoor (Oxfordshire) - Burying power cables and the erection of a predator fence has increased the breeding wader population. For example, the number of breeding lapwing pairs has increased alongside lapwi ng chick productivity. Lapwing Landscapes (Upper Thames Tributaries) worked on the catchments of the Upper Thames, including the Thames, Cherwell, Ray and Windrush. Across these areas, RSPB provided advice to farms and nature reserves covering more than 680 hectares. This has provided habitat for breeding waders and other associated grazing marsh birds including skylark, yellow wagtail, reed bunting and tree sparrow. Habitat restoration does not happen quickly. It needs sustained funding over more than one year to achieve maximum benefits. The fact that funding was available over 3 years was critical to this project. The flexibility to move funding between projects during each year was also important in managing unforeseen challenges, such as unexplode d artillery found at more than one site or adverse weather conditions 321 The flexibility to fund existing staff and not just contractors was important in managing the projects in a flexible and responsive way. Being able to purchase land with the Biffa Award grant was also a key benefit, enabling critical pieces of land to be joined or brought into conservation management. A key benefit was the flexibility of the Biffa Award team in inviting the RSPB to put forward a bespoke biodiversity proposal that was not constrained by any criteria other than the need to deliver significant results for UK wildlife and habitats within the framework of LCF funding. Project Impacts and Legacy This programme had a national impact both in terms of meeting biodiversity targets and in demonstrating the value of targeted partnership funding. At the commencement of the project targets were agreed against three UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) 2010 measures alongside further interlinked outcomes. The coastal and floodplain graz ing marsh habitat targets below were met and in some place exceeded, as detailed below: 1. Maintained the extent of 1,443ha of existing habitat contributing to 0.67% of UK BAP target by 2011 was achieved; 2. Achieved the favourable condition of 1,049ha of existi ng habitat contributing to 1.94% of the UK BAP target by 2011 (35.5ha over original target); 3. Restored and improved 904.6 ha of land under inappropriate management contributing to 14.71% of the UK BAP target by 2011 (additional 195 ha over target); 4. Maintain ed populations of 50 UK BAP priority species that are dependent on this habitat; and 5. Maintained and improved naturally functioning floodplains and water quality to benefit the local community. The project funding has left a clear legacy in terms physical improvements that continue to deliver benefits to wildlife and local communities. 322 Reference 99 I'm an ecologist and conservationist in West Wales. I support the Landfill communities fund as an essential source of funding for wildlife and conservation projects. Please don't scrap it because: The Landfill Communities Fund is one of the few fundin g streams for 'pure' wildlife projects. It produces direct environmental benefits for communities living in close proximity to landfill sites Funding wildlife projects through the Landfill Communities Fund will help Wales to meet its key wildlife targe ts and legal obligations. I support the use of Landfill Tax to fund charities such as the Wildlife Trust to undertake amazing projects to protect and enhance important habitats and species. This will help ensure that our woodlands are alive with birdsong , our rivers are bubbling with life and our meadows are bursting with butterflies. Funding wildlife projects helps inspires individuals and communities to connect with nature. Welsh Government should increase the percentage of Landfill Tax that goes to funding wildlife projects to 10% Best wishes C Griffiths 323 Reference 100 Energy UK, Charles House, 5 -11 Regent Street, London, SW1Y 4LR www.energy -uk.org.uk Welsh Government Consultation on Landfill Disposals Tax 19 May 2015 Introduction Energy UK is the trade association for the energy industry.

Together our members generate more than 90 per cent of the UK's total electricity output, supplying more than 26 million homes and investing more than \u00a313 billion in the British economy in 2013. Our response below is structured around the questions set out in the consultation document issued on 24 February 2015. Response to consultation questions Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? Energy UK considers that it is imperative that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with th e UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates. A failure to do so could lead to cross -border 'waste tourism', with its associated impacts on the environment, human health and community wellbeing. These impacts would be likely to include los s of amenity experienced by communities along the haul routes due to increased traffic. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. Energy UK is of the opinion that the current standard and lower tax rates are set at an appropriate level for Wales. For the reasons discussed in the answer to Question 1 above, both the standard and lower tax rates should continue to reflect those applicable in the rest of the UK. Therefore, in line with the 2014 UK Budget Statement which announced that future Landfill Tax rates will be maintained in real terms until at least 2019 -20, it would appear appropriate 324 that future Landfill Tax rates set by the Welsh Govern ment should follow this trajectory. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? Energy UK is of the opinion that there would be value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (as explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11). However, for the aforementioned reasons of preserving equity of taxation rates across the UK, it would appear inadvisable for this power to be exerc ised, other than where changing circumstances demand an appropriate deviation from this policy in order to avoid negative impacts. Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be co nsidered, and on what basis? Energy UK assumes that it is the intention of the Welsh Government to use the Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011 as the basis for determining which materials qualify for the lower rate of taxation. Therefore, Ener gy UK believes it is important to draw attention to the fact that the notes shown for the Group 5 materials (Ash) shown in Appendix 1: \"SUMMARY OF THE LANDFILL TAX (QUALIFYING MATERIAL) ORDER 2011 \" of the consultation document actually reflect the text of SI 2012 No. 940 The Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) (Amendment) Order 2012. Following industry representations to HMRC in 2012, and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) advising HMRC that it saw no environmental rationale to pr event the co -disposal of ash from coal and from biomass, the UK Government decided that SI 2012 No. 940 would not be approved by the House of Commons and was allowed to lapse on 22 May 2012 and the landfill tax liability of ash reverted to the original ter ms set out in Notes (7) and (8) of SI 2011 No. 1017 The Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011: '(7) Group 5 comprises only \u2014 (i) bottom ash and fly ash from wood or waste combustion; and (ii) bottom ash and fly ash from coal or petroleum coke combustion (including when burnt together with biomass). (8) Group 5 does not include fly ash from sewage sludge, municipal, clinical and hazardous waste incinerators. ' The above definition of Gro up 5 materials is also shown in in Section 19.1 of Excise Notice LFT1: a general guide to Landfill Tax (as updated by HMRC on 27 March 2015). Additionally, this definition of Group 5 materials is given in the Scottish Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Ord er 2015, which came into force on 1 April 2015. Energy UK is aware that HMRC is currently in the process of reviewing the wording of the notes associated with Group 5 of the qualifying materials and 325 has been engaged in dialogue with industry on the subjec t over recent months. Energy UK is of the opinion that the approach to the taxation of ashes arising from the combustion of biomass, whether as a result of co -firing with coal or petroleum coke, or from 100% biomass combustion, needs to be carefully consi dered. It is important that the industry's attempts to reduce CO2 emissions by the use of renewable energy sources should not be hindered by the unintended consequences of the application of taxation. For example, given the wide range of biomass materials available, it is considered that the use of the term ' wood ' in relation to Group 5 of the qualifying materials is too restrictive, as this could potentially lead to ashes arising from the combustion of non -wood biomass being excluded from the list of mate rials qualifying for the lower rate of Landfill Tax. Also, it is important that the wording of any mono -filling requirements is carefully considered, in order that any intended environmental benefits can be achieved without imposing any unintended, and pot entially prohibitive, restrictions. Energy UK would encourage the Welsh Government to engage with HMRC and industry stakeholders on this subject and update the relevant text where appropriate to provide greater clarity for the sector and for the Welsh Re venue Authority. Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? Energy UK has no comments to make on the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition ( LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. Energy UK would support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved, provided that this was to be for materials within the scope of SI 2015 No. 845 The Landfill Tax (Qualifying Fines) Order 2015. Also, it would be appropriate that any qualifying LoI threshold should reflect that set by HMRC. Once again, this would help to ensure the maintenance of cross -border consistency, and so avoid potential drivers for 'waste tourism'. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? Energy UK has no comments to make on the existing arra ngements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place. 326 Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be ad dressed? Energy UK has no issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site. Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landf ill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? Energy UK has no comments to make on the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exemp t) is subject to tax. Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? Energy UK would expect qualifying materials which are used for the purposes of filling existing or former quarries in accordance with the cond itions listed in Section 5.4.1 of Excise Notice LFT1: a general guide to Landfill Tax (as updated by HMRC on 27 March 2015) to be exempt from landfill tax. Again, maintenance of consistency with the HMRC position will avoid potential drivers for 'waste to urism'. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? Energy UK has no other suggestions for how the taxable and non-taxable activities on a landfill site might be clarified. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. Energy UK is of the opinion that none of the current exemptions shou ld be removed or modified. In particular, we take the view that qualifying materials which are used for the purposes of filling existing or former quarries in accordance with the conditions listed in Section 5.4.1 of 'Excise Notice LFT1: a general guide to Landfill Tax' should remain exempt from landfill tax. This exemption encourages the restoration of quarries, which has the potential over the longer term to improve landscapes and offer benefits such as increased biodiversity, improved amenity for local communities and the opportunity to return land to agricultural use. Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. Energy UK considers that there is no case for removing or modifying the water discount relief from the weighing process when determining liability for Landfill Tax. 327 Historically, the water content of Group 5 materials (Ash) as designated under the Landfi ll Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011 has been exempted from the weighing process i.e. the water is discounted when determining Landfill Tax liability. Water is added to Group 5 materials (Ash) for the purpose of enabling the material to be transported for disposal. This is in accordance with condition (a) (i) under Paragraph (5) of Regulation 44 of SI 1996 No. 1527 The Landfill Tax Regulations 1996. Energy UK is of the firm opinion that the handling and transport of Group 5 materials (Ash) in a dry s tate has the potential to create significant dust and environmental nuisance impacts at both production facilities and landfill disposal areas. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to remove the water discount relief where water is added for the purpose of mitigating the potential environmental impacts associated with handling ash in its dry state. Also, in certain cases water may be used as the transporting medium for ash, with the ash being dewatered at the landfill location. This is the case for settlem ent lagoon type Pulverised Fuel Ash (PFA) landfills, where ultimately, the carrier water does not form part of the material deposited within the landfill, but is discharged as supernatant water, post ash settlement. As a result of this, it is not possible to physically weigh the ash disposed to landfills of this type. Instead, the quantity of ash (dry weight) being disposed to landfill is calculated based on the ash content of fuel burned using a method that has been accepted by both SEPA and HMRC. The 'c onditioning' of PFA by mixing with water within controlled proportions, also has longer term benefits when material is either disposed of in landfills or used as a bulk fill material. This is because, when mixed with water, pozzolanic reactions take place within the ash, meaning that when correctly emplaced it forms a fill material with enhanced properties of physical stability. This can often make it an ideal material for land restoration projects, such as the filling of disused quarries. Energy UK strong ly recommends that for Group 5 materials (Ash) the water content continues to be discounted when determining Landfill Tax liability. Adopting this approach will also ensure consistency across England, Scotland, and Wales. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? Energy UK is of the opinion that there is no case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs. Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement Question 15: What w ould be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is 328 functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? Energy UK would support the placing of an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site. As stated in the consultation document, this should he lp create a level playing field between operators and help deter the under -declaring of waste. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? Energy UK supports the concept that extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax would provide an additional financial deterrent to illegal disposals of waste and would help support the Welsh Government's Fly -tipping Strategy. Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? Energy UK fully supports the concept that it should not be cheaper to offend than to take the appropriate precautions with regard to environmental offences. Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. Energy UK has no comment to make with regard to whether or not there is a need for increased compliance activity on the ground. Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? Energy UK has no suggestions for any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve complian ce and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? Energy UK is not aware of any evidence of tax a voidance within the existing Landfill Tax. Chapter 4: Administration Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. Energy UK would support aligning the tax return period with the financial year. Aligning the quarterly invoice period with the landfill site operators' waste 329 returns to Natural Resources Wales would appear a logical step to support compliance activity. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? Energy UK is of the opinion that making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return would impose only minimal extra burden whilst simplifying the process of cross -checking tax and waste returns. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including impr oving electronic and online support? Energy UK recognises the fact that the small and diminishing number of landfill site operators in Wales makes a complete move to an online platform for Landfill Tax unlikely to be cost -effective. However, changing the format of the tax return to enable electronic returns to be submitted via email and encouraging electronic payments would be seen as a step in the right direction. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it app ropriate? Energy UK is of the opinion that the circumstances in which landfill site operators can claim bad debt relief should be narrowed, using a similar approach to that recently adopted in Scotland. Question 25: Have you any comments on the operatio n of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? Energy UK has no comment to make on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provi sions in a Landfill Tax context. Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? Energy UK has no comment to make on whether there are any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal. Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Energy UK is of the opinion that the Welsh Government should allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to e nhance the wellbeing of communities. 330 Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compl iance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) Energy UK has no comment to make with regard to which activities should benefit from funding. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? Energy UK has no comments to make on the possible administ rative model. Additional Questions Question 30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? Energy UK would like to draw attention to the fact that since the electricity suppl y industry operates through the National Grid system, the vast majority of operators supply into a market which spans the national boundaries within Great Britain. Therefore, for generators of electricity, it is of particular importance that all elements o f the industry, including costs associated with landfill disposals, are allowed to operate on a level playing field which acts across these same national boundaries. Question 31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? Energy UK has no comments to make on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment.

The Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) has been a great success and has left its mark on community life and the natural env ironment. We strongly support the use of taxes raised from environmentally damaging activities to support wildlife and community projects as a form of environmental and social justice. PLANTLIFE strongly supports the continuation and enhancement of the LCF. Under Object DA, the LCF is also one of the few remaining funding streams that maintains a direct interest in outcomes for wildlife. Indeed, against the wider backgrounds of austerity and a funding community rarely focussed on nature conservation, th is fund is increasingly essential to continue work to halt the continuing, and in some places, devastating, loss of wildlife in Wales. As is widely reported in the groundbreaking State of Nature Report1, we are in a state of major and continuing decline in wildlife with 60% of the species in the UK having declined over recent decades. We have quantitative assessments of the population or distri bution trends of 3,148 species: 60% of species have declined over the last 50 years 31% have declined strongl y more than one in ten of all the species in the UK are under threat of disappearing from our shores altogether. 1 in 5 of our native plants species in Wales is threatened with extinction The LCF has: - allowed important habitats to be restored to help safeguard Wales's rich, but drastically declining, biodiversity - provided healthy green spaces for people to enjoy and connect with nature - supported volunteering and skills development opportunities for local communities LCF-funded wildlife projects also help Wales to meet its key environmental objectives and legal obligations: 332 - halting and reversing the loss of wildlife/biodiversity by 2050 (with interim targets for 2020) - the Aichi Biodiversity Targets - ensuring all statutory designated sites (such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and Special Areas for Conservation (SACs)) are in favourable condition by 2026 - with interim targets for 2015. This fund helps charities to contribute to these governmental obligations. For example, Plantlife have undertaken work to conserve nationally and internationally important lichen communities on the Gower peninsular through the control of invasive species. It also helps Natural Resources Wales (NRW) to fulfil Welsh Government's statutory duties to restore sites of national and international importance such as the Carmarthenshire Dunes SAC where Plantlife has secured LCF funding for dune restoration work. Withdrawing this fund would mean that Welsh Government will lo se a much -needed mechanism to reach its biodiversity targets and will cause further loss of biodiversity in Wales. It also supports the Well Being Goals in the Well Being of Future Generations Act 20152 especially in creating A Resilient Wales - \"A natio n which maintains and enhances a biodiverse natural environment with healthy functioning ecosystems that support social, economic and ecological resilience and the capacity to adapt to change (for example climate change)\" . Finally the LCF is one way that the Finance Ministry can discharge their statutory duties to conserve and enhance biodiversity under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, especially in meeting the responsibility to take account of biodiversity and more particularly to conserve species and habitats listed under section 42 of that Act. The LCF also contributes to a number of other Welsh Government duties and obligations, including poverty alleviation , improving health and wellbeing , creating jobs, developing and teachin g skills , and adapting to climate change . QUESTION 28: IF THE WELSH GOVERNMENT ALLOCATES A PROPORTION OF LANDFILL DISPOSALS TAX REVENUE TO ENHANCE COMMUNITY WELLBEING, WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES SHOULD BENEFIT FROM FUNDING, AND WHY? Plantlife re commend that biodiversity conservation must be a priority area for any future funding from the LCF . The LCF is one of the few funding streams for 'pure' biodiversity projects. It has supported, and should continue and expand, this delivery. If funding fr om the LCF is reduced or removed, Welsh Government will not achieve its biodiversity obligations and targets. 333 Biodiversity funding as a whole is significantly underfunded and was a key factor in Wales failing to hit the 2010 target to halt the loss of bi odiversity3 . However, as the fund is likely to decrease in Wales, we would like to see the fund increase from 5.7% diversion rate currently to being ring -fenced at a minimum of 10%. However, given the social and environmental justice, perhaps significant ly more of the tax should be diverted towards biodiversity conservation in order to meet the Welsh Government biodiversity objectives. Plantlife supports Welsh Governments strategic wider environmental objectives (including climate change mitigation and r esilience) as well as compliance, waste minimisation and tackling poverty. However, Plantlife believes that these objectives can and should be delivered through mainstream government policy and public spending. This will ensure that more funds within this scheme remain available to empower communities and deliver biodiversity projects. As mentioned above, biodiversity -centred projects still help and contribute to tackling poverty and deprivation in communities, public health and climate change mitigation. QUESTION 29: DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE MODEL? Considering the number of landfill sites in Wales is reducing to 10, Plantlife recommends that there is one Distributive Environmental Body (DEB) in Wales - this will help cut down administration and therefore more money should be directed at good causes. It is worth noting that all regulation builds in costs. However, DEBs and charities demonstrate correct procedure by being registered companies and/or charities and are thus subject to regular audits. Setting up a duplicate process would add complexity a nd administration burden to charities which would mean less money for good causes. Current regulation for project funding eligibility states that projects must be 'in the vicinity of a landfill site'. In practice, however, this has often been interpreted as 10 miles. This inflexibility disadvantages projects that just fall outside this area and, in the long -term, could mean an exhaustion of good projects in the 10mile radius. For many habitats and species the reliance on a distance from a decreasing numbe r of Landfill Sites, even if related operations were added, means that it is not possible to take action for their conservation and management. Plantlife recommends that sites within an approximate 20 mile radius of any new or disused landfill site (e.g. h ave a fuzzy boundary) should be eligible initially, but asks that consideration also be given to removing the vicinity test altogether in order to allow LCF funds to be spent where there is the greatest conservation need and therefore likelihood of success . We would also like to see a widening of the definition from landfill sites to 'landfill sites and related activities (such as depots and waste transfer stations)'. 334 It must be recognised that funds committed through a contract are not easy to spend with in short timescales (e.g. Welsh Government's Nature Fund). Indeed, it is vital for the success of conservation projects to have funders who can commit to funding long term projects (3 -5 years). Therefore Plantlife recommends that the fund must continue to allow multiyear projects. It is also been recognised that this fund helps to unlock significant match funding (independent funding organisations and volunteer hours). It is therefore important that the fund continues to fund projects by 90% - this could be increased to 100% funding. It's vital to recognise that there is a big difference between 'unspent' funds and funds retained by a DEB but already allocated for multiple -year projects, released on a yearly basis. We would encourage Welsh Government to take the opportunity to look at other avenues for ' green taxation' and how these might be used to fund Welsh Government's statutory nature conservation obligations. PLANTLIFE Recommendations Biodiversity conservation must be a priority area for any fut ure funding from the LCF. The LCF should be increased to 10% of the Landfill Disposal Tax There is one Distributive Environmental Body (DEB) in Wales. There should be no duplicate process set up that would add complexity and administration burden to DEBs and charities which would mean less money for good causes. Because of the likely contraction of the number of Landfill Sites (and related activities - see below) then Plantlife would ultimately like to see the removal of the location criteria. Biodiversity projects should be judged against meeting the Aichi targets, contributing to the Wales Biodiversity Action Plan and species and habitats that are listed under section 42 of the NERC Act 2006. A widening of the definition from landfill sit es to 'landfill sites and related activities (such as depots and waste transfer stations). The LCF continues to fund projects by 90% or possibly increased to 100%. The LCF fund must continue to allow multiyear projects. Reducing the length of project s means increased administration costs for both applicants and the Distributive Environmental Body plus most environmental projects need several seasons to be implemented and to carry out effective monitoring. Welsh Government to take the opportunity to look at other avenues for 'green taxation' and how these might be used to fund Welsh Government's statutory nature conservation obligations. Plantlife Cymru is part of Plantlife International, a wild plant conservation charity that speaks up for wild fl owers, plants and fungi. Wild Plants play a fundamental role for their wildlife, their colour and character lighting up our landscapes and providing us with many of the ecosystem services for our 335 future survival. We carry out practical conservation work on our own reserves but also with our many partners throughout Wales, the UK and the world. Yours sincerely Colin Cheesman Plantlife Cymru Programme Manager 336 Reference 102 Our wildlife is under increasing threat, from climate change, environmental destruction, pollution etc. The use of the Landfall Disposal Tax to support projects that can help slow or reverse this decline is extremely important. The loss of it would be detr imental to both the wildlife concerned and the local communities so affected. K Simmonds, Tregaron 337 Reference 103 RSPB Cymru response to the Welsh Government consultation on Landfill Disposals Tax (Number WG24170) Name: Michele Hunt, Head of Marketing, RSPB C ymru Organisation - RSPB Cymru For the purposes of this response, we have restricted our comments to the Community Wellbeing section (Section 5). Opening remarks The way that society deals wit h waste, and our behaviours relating to resource consumption can have direct and indirect impacts on wildlife and its habitats. RSPB Cymru therefore supports the intention behind Wales' Towards Zero Waste Strategy (2010 ) and the drive towards an environmen tally sustainable Wales where waste use is minimised and everyone only uses their fair share of resources. A key part of the Towards Zero Waste Strategy is the policy of reducing and ultimately eradicating landfill in Wales. This is clearly consistent with achieving sustainable development and, given the impact of resource use and waste management on wildlife and its habitats, RSPB Cymru fully supports this policy. A key means to secure this objective is the use of landfill tax to apply a real 'cost' to the, otherwise, 'free' activity of disposing of waste to landfill. Therefore, whilst the practice of landfill is in existence and taxation and other policies are securing its phasing out, we strongly support the existence of a Landfill Communities Fund, whic h hypothecates tax raised from an environmentally damaging activity for projects that benefit the environment. Question 27: SHOULD WELSH GOVERNMENT ALLOCATE A PROPORTION OF LANDFILL DISPOSALS TAX REVENUE TO ENHANCE THE WELLBEING OF COMMUNITIES? Since it s conception in 1996, the Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) has been a great success and a lever for community regeneration and enhancement of the natural environment. We strongly support the use of taxes raised from environmentally damaging activities to su pport wildlife and community projects as a form of environmental and community justice. RSPB Cymru strongly supports the continuation and enhancement of the LCF. This is because the LCF has: 338 allowed important habitats to be restored to help safeguard Wales' rich, but drastically declining, biodiversity provided healthy green spaces for people to enjoy and connect with nature supported volunteering and skills development opportunities for local communities Value of Nature to Community Wellbeing The life -enhancing qualities of nature are well documented. What is less appreciated is its importance to local economies and well -being. At a time of fiscal austerity the financial benefits of the natural world must sit at the heart of green economic str ategy and the Landfill Communities Fund is a vital addition to help achieve this. Fantastic places for wildlife can also be fantastic places for people. Enhancing the natural environment is a sound investment. It not only benefits wildlife, it also bene fits local economies, our health and education, ensures the provision of valuable goods and services and makes a vital contribution to sustainable communities. An example of this is RSPB Conwy nature reserve in North Wales. Here the LCF has enabled green j obs growth within the Welsh economy through projects such as the creation of the indoor learning and events space (see attachment). In 2005/06, the LCF provided \u00a339,874 of funding for the creation of a new facility at RSPB Conwy. This funding not only safeguarded two full time and six part time posts, but in addition helped to unlock funding for the creation of a further two full time and three part time posts, as well as a wealth of new volunteer opportunities due to the expansion in activities and events on offer at the reserve. Visitor numbers to the site almost doubled within 2 years, encouraging indirect spend within the Welsh economy too. The role of the environment is critical to the long -term sustainable future of our communities and the people in them. People do not exist in isolation from the environment. The multi -functional benefits of the natural environment often go unnoticed and are consequently under -resourced. Our special sites are the crown jewels in Wales' natural environment and are the cornerstone of a logical approach to ecosystem management. A recent report by the RSPB, 'Special Sites: Resilient Ecosystems' 20 states that Every \u00a31 spent on maintaining special sites (SSSI's) delivers benefits to society worth over \u00a38. Only 3% of UK phil anthropy goes to addressing environmental problems and climate change funding, though increasing, still only receives a paltry 0.7% of total giving. Of this biodiversity receives only 20%. Of that \"Environmental philanthropy continues to have a strong int ernational element, with nearly half of all grants (48.3%) going for work outside the United Kingdom.\"21 20 RSPB (2015 ) Special Sites: Resilient Ecosystems 21 Jon; Godwin, & Harrier (2012), 'Where Green Grants Went' ; Environmental Funders Network 339 Nature is good for young people As well as contributing to community wellbeing, the natural environment enhances us all and can have a profound impact on the next generation. Getting hands on with nature, whether through an informal visit or formally through education or volunteering has many benefits both individually and for the community. \"First -hand experiences... can help to make subjects more vivid a nd interesting for pupils and enhance their understanding... [and] could make an important contribution to pupils' future economic wellbeing and to preparing them for the next stage of their lives.\"22 Nature is good for community cohesion It reduces crime an d aggression and improves community integration23. Interaction with nature improves children's concentration and behaviour as well as improving self esteem. Teenagers and adults can learn new skills making them more employable in the long term. Early involvement can spark a life -long interest making comm unities and sites more sustainable. If children understand and enjoy the environment nature, they are also more likely to respect it and therefore reduce waste and other rural crime such as grass fires in the future. LCF-funded wildlife projects also co ntributes towards Wales' key environmental objectives and legal obligations. The Well- being of Future generations (Wales) Act 2015 demonstrates the importance of biodiversity within our society in the following well being goal; 'A nation which maintains and enhances a biodiverse natural environment and healthy functioning ecosystems that support social, economic and ecological resilience and the capacity to adapt to change (for example climate change)24 And moreover in the Environment Strategy Wales (2006) halting and reversing the loss of wildlife/biodiversity by 2050 (with interim targets for 2020) ensuring all statutory designated sites (such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI's) and Special Areas for Conservation (SAC's) are in favourable con dition by 2026, with interim targets for 2015 Question 28: IF THE WELSH GOVERNMENT ALLOCATES A PROPORTION OF LANDFILL DISPOSAL TAX REVENUE TO ENHANCE COMMUNITY WELLBEING, WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES SHOULD BENEFIT FROM FUNDING, AND WHY? 22Ofsted (2008) 'Learning Outside the Classroom: how far should you go? ', Manchester : Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills. 23 Bird, Williams (2004 ) , Well -Being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 . Available here : www.assembly.wales/laid%20documents/pri -ld9831%20 -%20well - being%20of%20future%20generations%20%28wales%29%20bill/pri -ld9831 -e.pdf 340 RSPB Cymru recommends that biodiversity conservation and enhancement must be the priority area for any future funding from the LCF. The Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 clarified that restoring biodiversity is fundamental to achieving sustainable development, through inclusion of the following wellbeing goal: A resilient Wales; A nation which maintains and enhances a biodiverse natural environment and healthy functioning ecosystems that support social, economic and ecological resilience and the cap acity to adapt to change (for example climate change). Object DA of the LCF is one of the few funding streams still currently available for 'pure' biodiversity projects. If funding from the LCF is reduced or removed, Welsh Government will be even less like ly to achieve those biodiversity obligations and targets. The LCF has supported practical conservation delivery on the ground through projects such as 'Magical Malltraeth', an RSPB Cymru initiative funded through WREN (Waste Recycling Environmental Ltd) to create the largest reedbed in North Wales, improving habitat for a range of species such as bittern and rare plants. Such funding not only supports nature, but helps to build resilient ecosystems, which in turn provide numerous socio -economic benefits. Nature needs funding Under Object DA, the LCF is also one of the few remaining funding streams that maintains a direct interest in outcomes for wildlife. Indeed, against the wider backgrounds of austerity and a funding community rarely focussed on nature conservation, this fun d is increasingly essential to continue work to halt the continuing, and in some places, devastating, loss of wildlife in Wales. As is widely reported in the groundbreaking State of Nature Report25, we are in a state of major and continuing decline in wildl ife with 60% of the species in the UK having declined over recent decades. We have quantitative assessments of the population or distribution trends of 3,148 species. Of these: 60% of species have declined over the last 50 years 31% have declined strong ly more than one in ten of all the species in the UK are under threat of disappearing from our shores altogether Funding mechanisms to deliver Welsh Government obligations on biodiversity have been woefully inadequate and a key factor in Wales failing t o hit the 2010 target to halt biodiversity loss. Moreover funds for biodiversity are becoming increasingly squeezed, restricted and competitive. Key examples of this include the level of demand for the Nature Fund in 2014, the reduction in grant funding f rom Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the call on funding 25 The State of Nature Report 2013 . Available here: http://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/stateofnature_tcm9 -345839.pdf 341 through the HLF UK Landscape partnerships scheme (\u00a319 m against a pot of \u00a366.3 m)26 It is because of such a demand and that over time this fund is likely to decrease, that we suggest that increasing the percentage of LCF spent on biodiversity actions from 5.7% diversion rate to at least 10% would be a positive step towards resourcing the desperate need in this area. This coupled with a ring fencing of single use plastic bag levy proceeds to environmen tal projects could be a medium term solution to levering appropriate funding required to deliver actions. RSPB Cymru therefore suggests on -going support and increase in the percentage of funding going to biodiversity to 10%. RSPB Cymru supports Welsh G overnments strategic wider environmental objectives (including climate change mitigation and resilience) as well as compliance, waste minimisation and tackling poverty. However, RSPB believes that these objectives can and should be delivered through mainst ream government policy and public spending. This will ensure that more funds within this scheme remain available to empower communities and deliver biodiversity projects. As mentioned above, the biodiversity -centred projects still help tackle poverty and deprivation in communities, public health and climate change mitigation. QUESTION 29: DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE MODEL? RSPB Cymru is supportive of the idea of a single Distributive Environmental Body (DEB) in Wales - helping to reduce the administrative burden and maximise money directed at good causes. Whilst we would not want to dictate who the DEB should be, it is clea r that the administering body should be totally transparent and offer value for money. RSPB Cymru does not support setting up a duplicate or layered process that would add complexity and administration burden to charities. Geographical vicinity Current r egulation for project funding eligibility states that projects must be 'in the vicinity of a landfill site'. In practice, however, this has often been interpreted as 10 miles as the crow flies. This inflexibility disadvantages projects that just fall outs ide this area and, in the long -term, could mean an exhaustion of good projects in the 10 mile radius. For many habitats and species the reliance on a distance from a decreasing number of Landfill Sites, even if related operations were added, means that it is not possible to take action for their conservation and management. With a reduction in number of landfill sites, RSPB Cymru recommends either : 26 University of London (2011 ) 'Evaluation of the Heritage Lottery Fund Landscape Partnership Programme 2011' 342 widening of the definition from landfill sites to 'landfill sites and related depots and activities (such a s depots and transfer stations)' with clear information about the whereabouts of these provided. scrapping the vicinity test in order to allow LCF funds to be spent where there is greatest conservation need and benefit and therefore likelihood of succes s and best value for money. If going to a single DEB model, it is worth noting that applications for funding should be available several times a year (4+) and take into consideration geographical spread and need, This will therefore enable multiple appli cations from organisations in each round or across the year as appropriate. This will enable third sector organisations to ensure smart timescales for projects as well as maximizing biodiversity outcomes from range of projects running at any one time acros s Wales and increasing the rate of spend. Rate of spend It is vital to recognise that there is a big difference between unspent funds and funds retained by a DEB but already allocated for multiple -year projects, released on a yearly basis. It must also be recognised that funds committed through a contract are not easy to spend within short timescales (e.g. Welsh Government's Nature Fund). Indeed, it is vital for the success of conservation projects to have funders who can commit to funding l ong term projects (3 - 5 years). Therefore RSPB Cymru recommends that the fund must continue to allow multi -year projects. It is also to be recognised that this fund helps to unlock significant match funding (independent funding organisations and volunteer hours). It is therefore important that the fund continues to fund projects by at least 90% - this could be increased to 100% funding. Summary of recommendations The Welsh Government should sustain the Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) for the benefit o f the environment and wellbeing of communities. Increasing the funding from the LCF for biodiversity conservation and enhancement projects (from 5.7% to a minimum of 10%) as a positive step towards addressing Welsh biodiversity obligations The developmen t of a simple, cost effective and transparent administrative Distributive Environmental Body in principle The broadening of definition and eligibility criteria to ensure biodiversity priorities can be resourced and benefits maximised across Wales. Multi -year funding sustained to maximise sustainability and ability to meet long term outcomes The ability for charities to recoup the true costs of projects through the full cost recovery principle. 343 Reference 104 Dear Welsh Government, I hear you are think ing of removing the landfill tax which provides a substantial source of income for welsh conservation charities. I urge you to reconsider this in the light of the fact that sustainability and conservation are not just patches in the agricultural landscape , but they are the landscape. Wales' problems with declining biodiversity, flooding, water quality, erosion, carbon sequestration and such are not a matter of aesthetic taste but rather a vital link in Wales' future. The preservation of biodiversity offers increased resilience in the face of invasive pests; potentially agriculturally and in forestry, and a substantial tourism trait. What do you want Wales to be know as, a land savaged by humans for the production of un -economic lamb, a land with a falling biodiversity and environmental health problems? Any civilized nation should consider cultural and environmental sustainability as part of long term economic progress. Under -investment here may save you money in the short term but it's not sustainable for a ll that Wales is. Thank you D Traynor 344 Reference 105 345 346 Reference 106 I hear the Govnmt in Wales is reviewing Landfill Tax as a charitable stream, which has benefited wildlife conservation in our country. Please do not reduce funding for conservation. Remember wildlife benefits tourism and reduces tress. It also is a valuable resource for food, especially the sea. With best wishes, for I know there are many demands on funding. A Agnew 347 Reference 107 Tenovus Cancer Care's response to Welsh Government's consultation on 'Developing a Landfill Disposals Tax' Tenovus Cancer Care welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Welsh Government's consultation on 'Developing a Landfill Disposals Tax'. At Tenovus Cancer Care our aims are simple. We want to help prevent, treat and find a cure for cancer. We do this by offering support, advice and treatment to cancer patients and their loved ones. We also promote healthy lifestyles and fund cancer research to find new ways to prevent it, diagnose it, and treat it. We do this where it is needed most - right at the heart of communities across Wales. Our vision is for a Wales where fewer people get cancer and everyo ne with cancer will have equal access to excellent treatment and support. To support this vision we will work in partnership to deliver innovative research -led cancer prevention, treatment and support in the community to people with the greatest need, init ially in Wales. It is important to note that charities play a key role in improving the environmental landscape in the UK by reducing the amount of goods sent to landfill. In Wales and the UK, charity shops remove 250,000 tonnes of textiles from the waste stream each year (data from Association of Charity Shops surveys and Charity Finance). Over the last year, Tenovus Cancer Care collected 321,525 bags of textile and bric -a-brac from donors; this is a significant contribution in reducing landfill waste. For the purpose of this consultation, we will reserve our comments to Chapter 5 'Community Wellbeing' and the objectives for allocating a proportion of the Landfill Disposal Tax revenue. Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfi ll Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Tenovus Cancer Care believes that it would be a positive step to allow for a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to be allocated to enhance the wellbeing of communities. Flourishi ng communities are those where everyone has someone to talk to, neighbours look out for each other, people have pride and satisfaction with where they live and feel able to influence decisions about their area. 348 Residents are able to access green and open s pace, feel safe going out and there are places and opportunities that bring people together. (Dr Ruth Hussey, 2010) It is now widely acknowledged that there is more to health than simply the absence of illness. In recent years there has been a greater emph asis placed on the importance of wellbeing, moving away from a constricted meaning of health and towards one which encompasses social and emotional factors. In A glass half -full: how an asset approach can improve community health and well -being, Dr Ruth Hussey has emphasised the importance of health in the context of community wellbeing: Assessing and building the strengths of individuals and the assets of a community opens the door to new ways of thinking about and improving health and of respon ding to ill -health. (R. Hussey, 2010) Under the current objectives for funding projects under the Landfill Communities Fund (5.7), some community wellbeing benefit and community recycling projects cannot be accommodated. This should be corrected by the add ition or the inclusion of criteria that would allow the funding of projects that: a. address health issues and promote healthy living in the community, irrespective of whether or not the proposed project is explicitly linked to 'Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities'; b. promote re -use / recycling and facilitate charitable community schemes to facilitate its achievement on a community level. Tenovus Cancer Care believes that Welsh Government has an opportunity to enhance the wellbeing of commu nities across Wales by appropriately allocating funds from the Landfill Disposal Tax. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackli ng poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) Welsh Government has clearly recognised the impact that poor health and deprivation has on communities across Wales. With the recent introduction of the Wellbeing of Future Generations (W ales) Act and positive interventions in public health, there is a clear drive towards creating greater community wellbeing by reducing preventable illnesses and alleviating poverty. 349 Tenovus Cancer Care would welcome the inclusion of 'Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities' in activities funded from a proportion of the Landfill Disposals Tax revenue. As identified in the consultation document, projects based in Wales have rece ived \u00a34m from the UK Landfill Communities Fund in 2013/14. If a similar scheme was to be taken forward following the devolution of Landfill Disposals Tax, it would provide an important source of project money for supporting communities in a more targeted w ay. As highlighted through our response to Question 27, we would stress that it is important to recognise the inextricable link that poverty and deprivation has with poor health outcomes in communities across Wales. Tenovus Cancer Care would encourage th e Welsh Government to extend the activities to include projects that enhance health, promote healthy lifestyles and help to alleviate ill -health in a community. Tenovus Cancer Care would recommend the inclusion of additional objectives for the improvement of health and community re -use/ recycling projects. As highlighted, the role of charities in reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill is considerable. We would welcome a greater level of future recognition that charity shops are part of the solution to improving our environment in Wales. Should you wish to discuss our comments further, please do not hesitate to contact the Research & Policy Team (Jon.Antoniazzi@tenovuscancercare.org.uk / 029 2076 8898). Yours sincerely, Jon Antoniazzi Policy Officer 350 Reference 108 Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to express my very strong desire that the Landfill Community Fund is allowed to continue (ideally increased) funding for wildlife conservation projects. I feel wildlife conservation is a fu ndamental moral duty and also will help the Welsh Government meet it's own policy objectives for sustainability. Please can my views be added to the consultation process. With thanks. Yours faithfully, A G Walker (Dr) 351 Reference 109 As a member of Gwent Wildlife Trust and an active volunteer recorder of biodiversity in my county I am concerned about any change to the current use of landfill tax to promote biodiversity in Wales. The use of landfill tax in this way is of enormous value in financing projects which improve habitats for specific species or for biodiversity generally and I would wish for no change in the current arrangement. Yours faithfully Dr. R. E. Roome 352 Reference 110 RESPONSE BY THE BEVAN FOUNDATION The Bevan Foundation develops ideas to make Wales a better place and improve people's lives. It is independent of government and politically neutral, and is a registered charity. We welcome the opportunity to respond to the consultation on the proposed Landfill Disposals Tax. Preamble The Wales Act brings a unique opportunity to reform and strengthen a tax on landfill disposals. Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? It is important that the Welsh Government maintains a tax on waste disposed to landfill. However we do not have sufficient expertise to comment on the implications of the Welsh Gover nment adopting a different regime to that in England and Scotland. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. We do not have sufficient expertise to comment on this question. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? As a matter of principle the Welsh Go vernment should have the ability to set different rates of tax. Questions 4 - 26: We do not have the expertise to respond to these questions. Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? We support the principle that the communities directly and adversely affected by the nuisance of a landfill site should receive some benefit as 'compensation' for the detriment they suffer. We consider that such a scheme should : 353 be based on boundaries that are closely aligned with the area directly and adversely affected by a landfill site (and not the very broad areas currently eligible - it is hard to see a connection between the dis - amenity of a landfill site and some of the projects cited as examples); be simple to access with the minimum of administrative requirements and costs; be responsive to the needs of the community, whatever those might be, and not based on narrow criteria. We strongly recommend that the experienc e of existing distributors of small grants (e.g. Big Lottery, Community Foundation in Wales, WCVA, County Voluntary Councils) be drawn upon to design an appropriate scheme. In addition, we support the principle of a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax being allocated to assist in reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill and waste crime. This is a separate objective and should apply across the whole of Wales. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax reve nue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime? We would support a proportion of revenue being allocated to this purpose but on an all -Wales basis, not only for communities near landfill sites. Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill? We would support a proportion of revenue being allocated to this purpose but on an all -Wales basis, n ot only for communities near landfill sites. Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements We do not consider these to be an appropriate use of revenue as they are not necessarily reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill or ameliorat ing the harm caused by landfill sites. Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities We do not consider these to be an appropriate use of revenue as they are not necessarily reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill or ameliorating the harm caused by landfill sites. The solutions to poverty 354 and deprivation do not lie in small -scale, local initiatives. Other (please specify) We would support locally -determined schemes of most types that are based in communities directly and adversely affected by landfill sites. The current list of types of schemes - e.g. funding for places of worship - is not rational and should be scrapped. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? The existing administrative arrangements should be scrapped in total. A new scheme should be easily accessible, have a light administrative burden and a quick turn around. As already mentioned several organisations have considerable expertise administerin g small, community grants and their experience should inform any new scheme. We suggest that if possible the Welsh Government should delegate the administration of any revenues to appropriate third parties rather than doing so itself. While we welcome la ndfill operators (and the wider waste industry) demonstrating their corporate social responsibility, we do not consider that they need to do so through a Landfill Credit scheme. There are many other ways that they can be socially responsible. Victoria Winckler Director Bevan Foundation www.bevanfoundation.org 355 Reference 111 CONSULTATION RESPONSE FORM, INCLUDING SUMMARY OF CONSULTATION QUESTIONS Welsh Government Consultation on: Landfill Disposals Tax (Number: WG24170) Consultation Response Form Name: Clifford Parish Organisation (if responding on behalf of that organisation): Vale of Glamorgan Council Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. The current levels of Landfill tax at a minimum should be indexed linked and increase at the rate of inflation. Given the extremely high recycling rates for contraction waste reported it is likely that the majority of inert waste at landfills is likely to be SME building contractors where the waste is not homogeneous and can contain mixed mate rial including potentially active or polluting elements. Excepting that the LOI test will be considered later, irrespective of this, there is still a strong argument that where the inert materials are either re -unsalable or recyclable that such hard -core, river dredging, top -soil or incinerator bottom ash (IBA) that they should be taxed above the lower tax rates to encourage their use in the construction industry in a more sustainable way than simply landfilling them. I believe that it is of significant importance that Welsh Government (WG) maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates to ensure that there is a level playing field for the waste management industry within the UK and to ensure that differential devolved landfill Tax rates between Westminster and the devolved admin istration does not create a cross border distortion of waste movement/disposal between the various administrations resulting in beaches of WG and EU Waste policies specifically relation to the Proximity Principle' and 'Regional Self Sufficiency.' 356 Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? While landfill exists in the Wales, landfill tax has a role to play, in achieving WG's environmental goals and WG need to cons ider their objectives very carefully if it is to continue to promote good behaviour by landfill operators while utilising the tax as an additional lever to support its policies. Clearly having the ability to set different lower or even higher rates of tax would assist it in achievement of this Having the ability to create more rate bands to reflect better the relative impact of different types of waste would also be of value to WG. As there is presently a huge differential between the two existing it in i tself creates problems and the introduction of a banding tax charge may address these matter together with realigning Landfill tax rates to the polluter pays principle Landfill tax is due to rise with inflation from \u00a380 per tonne to \u00a382.60, Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) confirmed. On 1 April 2015 landfill tax increase d in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from \u00a380 to \u00a382.60 per tonne as a result of a change in Finance Act 2014. This will again increase to \u00a384.40 per tonne for disposals made, or treated as made, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on or after 1 April 2016, according to a HMRC briefing note. The lower rate of tax, which applies to less -polluting wastes listed in the Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011, is currently \u00a3 2.50 per tonne, having increased from \u00a32 per tonne on 1 April 2008. This will increase to \u00a32.60 per tonne in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1 April 2015 as a result of a change in Finance Act 2014.This will increase again to \u00a32.65 per tonne for d isposals of waste made, or treated as made, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on or after 1 April 2016. If WG is committed to reducing landfill and moving waste higher up the waste hierarchy then there must be merit in it setting a higher rate for re-unsalable or recyclable waste sent to landfill. I would therefore support WG having the ability to set different lower rates of tax . I feel WG needs to ensure that landfill waste disposal is properly priced in order to promote greater efficiency in the waste management market and the economy as a whole; and to apply the 'polluter pays' principle to promote a more sustainable approach to waste management reducing waste production and recycling or recovering more from it . To do so there needs to be some consistency between administrations 357 Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? The exiting list would appear to be appropriate. Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? If Threshold are to specified then they need to be quantifiable and measurable If this can't be achieved then there is little point in WG considering setting a threshold level to define 'small quantity' for non -qualifying waste in a given load of inputted waste. The is an old adage \"if you can't measur e it you can't manage it\" and it is my belief that without knowing what is within a mass of material the safest option would be not ton specify any threshold to try to define what a small quantity' of non - qualifying waste in a load would be. This is spec ifically a concern when dealing with active waste or demolition waste where hazardous material such as asbestos, lead etc. can exist in fairly small quantities, Non-homogeneous waste will be very difficult to sample and define whether the threshold has be en exceeded or not. Introducing such a definition as 'a small quantity ' will add costs to landfill operators and a further regulatory burden on both the operator and regulator. I would therefore question whether setting thresholds to define 'a small quant ity' of non-qualifying waste would be either practical or cost efficient 358 Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? Loss on ignition is a well -established laboratory test used in inorganic analytical chemistry, particularly in the analysis of minerals has already been implemented, from the 1st April 2015. It would be therefore be my opinion that WG would b e best served monitoring the outcome from this and subsequently deciding whether it should introduce a similar proposal within its Landfill tax policies So whilst Scotland may have decided not to introduce the LoI test given that this has raises concerns that Scottish (ESA in Scotland) waste producers may travel south of the border to use English landfills. WG has the opportunity to consider the value of introduction or not given the difference in policies between UK and Scottish landfill tax policies and make a more valid decision whether or not to introduce it based on the experiences from the two separate administrations. I believe that there are existing problem with defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place and that there are difficulties in distinguish between those activities on a landfill site which constitute a taxable disposal and those whic h are non-taxable uses of waste . In order resolve this and to have as much clarity a s possible on tax liability, there is a need for landfill operators to be obligated to inform landfill tax regulators abou t non-taxable uses of waste and setting up an information area. It will also be necessary to contact their environmental regulators (NRW) to ensure that any changes they propose to make to your site, or the running of it as a result of the introduction of an information area, are acceptable under the terms of the permit. To address these landfill operators should be require d to designate more than one information area (to allow storage of different types of waste or different activities such as sorting and recycling ). In these situations they should also be require d to identify clearly the quantities and type of material which relate to the different uses. 359 Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? I am not aware that there is a particular problem with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from. However the procedure for landfill operators claiming such credit would appear to be open to possible abuse i.e.: If a landfill waste temporarily with the intention of later recycling, incinerating or removing it for re -use (but not on a landfill si te, except when re -using it as restoration material - see below in this paragraph), when you remove the waste you will be able to claim a credit of the tax you accounted for and paid on the original disposal at your site, if you meet both of the following conditions: This should be addressed by effective regulation by the regulatory body and mass balance of waste input against export. Dependant of the actual legislation there shouldn't be any practical implications in specifying all waste material entering a landfill site (other than that w hich is specifically exempt) is subject to landfill taxation, other that the monitoring and regulation of any proposed legal requirements. It is not possible to fully answer this question without seeing draft legislation 360 Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. Dredging materials is an activity essential to navigation, maintaining the ecology and biodiversity of waterways and adjacent land, the management of flood risk and drainage acti vity. The consequences of not dredging, or carrying out limited dredging can be significant. Provision of clear guidance documentation for landfill operators and regular inspection by regulatory body, should clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical imp lications of non -taxable activities on a landfill site s. I would propose that the following list, while not exhaustive, would include material that should be exempt given that they can be used in more sustainable ways than simply being landfilled: Bricks and Blocks Bricks can be reclaimed and reused in new brickwork Bricks and blocks can be crushed and used as a constr uction material Bricks and blocks can contain recycled material such as wastes in their manufacture Roofing Tiles roofing materials can be made from a wide range of materials including concrete, clay and slate old tiles (present in demolition rubble) can be recycled via crushing and reused during construction old tiles can be reclaimed and utilised in new construction and maintenance projects (such as conservation work) roofing tiles are now produced incorporating recycled plastic and slate waste Topsoil can be reclaimed and reused in construction for landscaping 21 can be used as a medium for compost Green Waste can be composted shrub can be shredded & used as mulch or composted 361 Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? Given the possible complexity and possible abuse of accounting for the taxable element it is my belief that there would be a case for removing the water discount relies. If there is a discount water relief I would support the existing conditions where no relief exists : if is present naturally in the waste (although you may agree a scheme to discount water up to, but not beyond, the amount present naturally) it is present because of rain or snow it was added to waste to damp it down to prevent it blowing away and the added water is less than 25% of the waste, by weight any of the water is capable of escaping from the landfill site by leaching. to water which is present natu rally cannot be discounted As the existing UK landfill tax provisions are well understood and operates well within its intended scope, the WG should not intend to pursue significant changes to the form or structure of the existing tax regime for the introduction of its landfill tax policies . This will ensure that the stable mar ket conditions needed to support long - term investment are maintained. For this reason it may therefore be more appropriate for WG to start with the existing exemptions and consider any changes following an initial period of stability prior to examining and pursue refinements or enhancements that will support its continued smooth operation in Wales . While accepting that WG are interested at this early juncture to receive views on longer -term changes it may prove prudent to wait to assess the Scottish Gover nment introduction may wish to consider of the tax in 2015 before finally deciding on introducing new exemptions or other changes to the existing landfill regime. 362 Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? The most significant practical implications would be that such a requirement would penalise the smaller operator, increasing operational and administrative costs of their operations. This may distort the market place and result in additional and premature closure of this existing type of landfill operation. There may also be issues with some operators where their site is physical restricted and it is simply not possible to locate a weighbridge and without a public weighbridges within the vici nity also result in the financial scenario stated above. Where waste is weighed away from a landfill site, I would maintain there must be a clear audit trail including a record of weights for each vehicle, container, wagon, and that that waste must go dire ctly to the site and record all waste brought onto site(s), showing where the waste was weighed, the identifying number and type of vehicle/container, a description of the waste, and the date disposed with retent ion of the weighbridge tickets. However, i t also needs to be noted that Controlled Waste entering a landfill site may need to firstly place in an area where processing, recovery, sorting etc. can be carried out. In these circumstances, there is a time lag between the waste entering the site and it e ntering the tipping area , if it was a requirement that such waste be weighed and characterised immediately pri or to tipping (the tax point). Then this proposal c ould replace the current burdens associated with tax -free areas such as separate weighing and characterisation and the requirement to keep a separate disposal account i.e. t he operator would have ensured that the waste disposed is clearly and separa tely identified from all other wastes entering a mixed treatment site. 363 Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. This definition will be central to the integrity of the tax in Wales, and the WG need to consider all views on this question carefully , particularly those from landfill op erators, on any steps that the W G should take to ensure that taxable and non -taxable activities and materials are set out in a clear, consistent manner that will avoid dispute about what is and is not taxable . I feel that while carrying out desk -based checks into returns or other documents to make sure that customers pay the right amount of tax at the right time are important . On site 'compliance checks' are critical in determining that the correct information is being assessed . This will however, require additional regulatory duties by the Regulation body and WG must ensure that sufficient resources are available to for this increased compliance activity on the ground to be undertaken. Undertaking checks over the phone or from written submission cannot be automatically taken to be a true reflection of the operational practices undertaken by the landfill operator . Support would be giv en to the 'boots on the ground' approach proposed by Stakeholders. The officer dealing with the check can explain these time limits to you. If we find something wrong we may extend our check, for example, we may check earlier periods. It is my understanding that Landfill site operators, who deliberately fail to correct an under -declaration of Landfill Tax, may be liable to a civil penalty for dishonest evasion, a civil penalty for deliberate inaccuracy or criminal prosecution . These are very serious penalties and assuming that there are sufficient enforcement resources and Court time available shouldn't result in any issues when implementing the current penalty regime. If there are, then WG needs to ensure that the regulator bodies and the courts are made properly resources and competent to fulfil the requirement of the regime. 364 Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? Chapter 4: Administration Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. I would support support aligning the tax return where businesses it will impact on when they pay tax on profits. Aligning their accounting date with the tax year would be the simplest option, but there are implications for a growing business that WG wil l need to consider in considering this matter; For incor porated companies, an accounting date will determine the payment date of tax. The business should have sufficient cash to pay the tax liability when it becomes due. For an unincorporated business, profits for a tax year are decided at the accounting date i n that tax year. The earlier in the tax year you select as your accounting year -end, the longer you will have to pay tax on your profits. Although there is a cash -flow advantage to having an earlier year -end, you should make a provision for the higher liability when the business ceases. Using an accounting year -end of 5 April or 31 March is the simplest way to apply the current year basis of assessment. The later in the tax year the accounting date falls, the shorter the period in which to make the related tax payment, and therefore the greater the risk of incurring a penalty for late payment. Over the life of a business, they can only be taxed once on your profits. But some of your profits will have been taxed twice during the life of your business, unless your accounting date is 31 March or 5 April. Tax relief (\"overlap relief\") for these profits when you cease business or change your accounting date. Where profits are seasonal, selecting a date before a peak in your profitability will delay the payment o f tax. Finalising year -end accounts can be a time -consuming process and so it is better to choose a time of year when you are less busy. . When you eventually terminate your business, the earlier in the tax year of the date of your final accounting year - end, the lower the profits that will be assessed in the final tax year. An accounting year -end is not set in stone when first chosen. The factors above may influence your decision to change an accounting date at any time. While unable to say that there is clear evidence it is likely that where there is a possibility for shroud accounting that tax avoidance does occur under the existing Landfill tax system. It is likely that these would result from the tonnages reported, the y composition and water content although Natural Resource Wales would, as regulator, be far better placed to confirm whether there is evidence of such tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Site Returns information , and what if at all is the nature of this of tax avoidance WG should consider the actions within its 'Fly -tipping Free Wales Our strategy for tackling fly -tipping'. As landfill tax powers will increase regulation controls and additional burdens on regulatory bodies it will need to ensure that effective resources an d powers are available to those bodies to improve compliance enforcement and communication. 365 Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? WG may wish to consider the Courts Service and the Revenue Commissioners proposal to delivering fast and efficient public service where they are removing many of the curren t certification and clearances required and by moving to a fixed filing date Revenue aims to simplify and streamline the process and bring it more into line with other self -assessment taxes while also reducing compliance costs and the administrative burden for taxpayers. Part of this modernisation and simplification of procedures is the enhancement of e - filing for CAT through Revenue's online service (ROS). Revenue is recognised as a leader in using information and communications technologies to deliver fa st and efficient public services and ROS. The European Waste Catalogue (EWC) codes should be well known and used when dealing with Site Returns and Waste Transfer Notes to larger landfill operators and there should therefore be very little practical implications making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? Thence g iven that the waste re ceived i nto the landfill will have contained EWC codes there should be very little impact on any requirement requiring them to be used in completing their landfill tax return. 366 Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? I would share the view expressed by others that this gives tax evaders an unfair advantage over those law -abiding businesses and individuals who pay their fair share. This is unacceptable and we will consider all the available tools to deter and take action against those who are seeking to avoid or evade tax. The review of appealable decisions in the following regimes: aggregates levy, capital gains tax, child trust fund (tax appeals), climate change levy, the construction industry scheme, corporation tax, customs duties, excise duties, income tax, inheritance tax, insurance premium tax, landfill tax, decisions associated with money laundering provisions, National Insurance Contributions, PAYE, petroleum revenue tax, certain stamp duty penalties, stamp duty reserve tax, stamp duty land tax, statutory payments, s tudent loans, and VAT appears to be fair and protects the appeal process and natural justice. WG should offer bad debt relief based on the existing model for VAT bad debt relief in accordance with the following legislation: The VAT Act 1994 Section 36 and Section 26A which covers the repayment of input tax when a customer fails to pay for supplies received within six months of the relevant date. The VAT Regulations 1995 Parts XIX, XIXA and XIXB Bad debt relief should be at least six months from the later of when payment was due and payable. The due date for p ayment may be determined by normal credit terms, or by any longer period for payment if agree d with landfill operator's customers. It should not be claim on a return for an accounting period e arlier than the one in which operators become entitled to any proposed relief. Landfill Operators will need to supply all necessary documentation required by WG e.g. a copy of all invoices for which you are claiming a re lief under. And a separate bad debt account showing the: (a) amount you have written off as a bad debt (b) amount to cl aim as bad debt relief (c) the period in which is claimed a refund (e) the period in which you o riginally accounted for; (f) payment received; (g) name of your customer, and (h) date and number of the invoice to which the bad debt relates. (If no invoice, sufficient information to allow the time and type of the supp ly to be readily identified) 367 Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Question 27 : Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? WG should consider the proposals being considered in Scotland which would allo w in exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of tax when drafting its own legislation. Not only will this address the Landfill tax issues but would be valuable for any future tax raising powers devolved to WG. In Scotland I believe that their government is proposing that Revenue Scotland should be able to consider an application for agree to a postponement of tax, interest or penalties pending a review or appeal, but only in exceptional circumstances and only in relation to LBTT decisions. Where Revenue Scotland do not agree to postpone tax, interest or penalties the taxpayer may appeal to the Scottish Tax Tribunals. I would strong support and encourage WG in allocating a proportion of Landfill Disposals tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities Landfill tax revenue should be explicitly linked to WG's environmental objectives and encourages environmentally positive behavioural change. WG needs to establish a clear vision of how they want to enhance wellbeing of communities which contai ns a clear set of commitments with an emphasis on delivering results that everyone can see in their daily lives. WG's aim in doing so should be to use Landfill tax revenue to build a shared and better future for all . The vast majority of people Wales want WG to succeed in delivering on wellbeing commitments and improving the opportunities available to this generation and the next. This additional resource would be another measure intended not let them down. The challenge in using it to enhance community we llbeing is how WG will measure outcomes effectively? Landfill tax is structured in relation to environmental outcomes so that the more polluting the behaviour, the greater the tax levied. Although this objective (the 'polluter pays' principle) appears fair and reasonable, the imposition of environmental taxes can have an uneven environmental impact (for example, standard -rated LFT is charged on the weight of waste irrespective of its potential environmental effect). Additionally, in order to reduce the impa ct on national competitiveness of burdensome carbon taxes, government has specifically legislated to relieve the burden for some businesses of these taxes through exemption or agreement, thus diluting the impact of the tax. 368 Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) Yes. I would strong ly support this proposal. While I accept that the existing Landfill Tax regime does seek to incentivise landfill site operators to support local community and environmental projects through a Landfill Communities Fund. I strongly believe it very important that WG use a significant proportion of the Landfill Disposals Tax to enhance and deliver benefits to communities. The difficulty would be identifying ant priority between them and there are excellent reasons for each. Utilising the new revenue to enha nce Wellbeing should fulfil the basic communities needs are met, that individuals have a sense of purpose, and that they feel able to achieve important personal goals and participate in society. Wellbeing is enhanced by conditions that include supportive p ersonal relationships, strong and inclusive communities, good health, financial and personal security, rewarding employment and a healthy and attractive environment. All of the activities stated with question 28 should help in securing the economic, social and environmental wellbeing whether that is environmental, socially or economically. I fully supports maintaining the Landfill Communities Fund in Wales but and extending the credit limit for contributions to the fund. I see it as an important source of funding for the third sector in particular, who may find it difficult to apply for and manage larger funds or find the appropriate match funding required. It also acts as a valuable community funding source where other more complex funding stream is difficult to access. There have been the Contributory Third Party for many projects and have therefore seen some of the successes since the Fund started. Any increase into the funds will be greatly welcomed as many more very worthwhile community projects can be achieved. 369 Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? It would appear that the existing Landfill tax Community Fund administrative spend is higher than would be expected on admin/running costs. It is suggested that a bout 5p in every pound or 5% of the money allocated to the administration . It is clear that WG needs to ensure that the administrative model should be accountable for how the money is spend it is taxpayers' money. Administration costs are often the focus of attention - with the implication that they are somehow 'bad'. Therefore it seems to follow t hat a 'good' charity spends as little money as possible on its running costs. While accepting that f ocusing purely on running costs isn't perhaps the key indicator. I would bring the following to WG's attention: For example, is a charity that spends 1% on admin and 99% directly on its beneficiaries providing excellent value for money? What if it doesn't know how many people it is serving, or what impact it is actually making on their lives, or evaluating and learning from its projects to see if they can be improved? Although the aim is not, and shouldn't be, to spend as little % of Taxpayers money as possible on running costs . There between does need to be a careful balance between delivering the best possible support to the community with properl y monitoring and evaluating projects to measure their impact and to share what's learned with other NGOs. WG needs to make sure all money is being spent properly and put to the best long -term use. It should also be noted that the reported Community Fund d istribution costs of 11.4 is high compared to that of the Big Lottery Fund at 6%. The reported large accumulations of funding for community projects unspent (25% of \u00a31.2 billion total funds within the existing administrative model must also be a concern an d a matter that WG needs to ensure can't be repeated in Wale and keeping the proposed administrative model simple as possible would appear to be the best way to achieve this. However, I believe that an independent regulator would help ensure consistency, transparency and accountability though their role depends considerably on the chosen delivery model. 370 Additional Questions Question 30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?

If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: (Checked) 374 Reference 113 Landfill Disposals Tax FSB Wales FSB Wales welcomes the opportunity to present its views to the Welsh Government's Consultation on the Landfill Disposals Tax. FSB Wales is the authoritative voice of businesses in Wales. With 10,000 members, a Welsh Policy Unit, two regional committees and twelve branch committees; FSB Wales is in constant contact with business at a grassroots level. It undertakes regular online surveys of its members as well as a biennial membership survey on a wide range of issues and concerns facing small business. Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals In the current circumstances, it seems sensible that consistency is maintained between England and Wales in terms of Landfill Tax rates, for the reasons identified by Welsh Government this is necessary to avoid 'waste tourism' . The Welsh Government should, however, have the flexibility to vary the rates of tax to take account of any change in circumstances. It should be noted, of course, that tax on waste produced in Wales and exported to England would go to England. It is also important that there remains a constructive dialogue between UK and Welsh Governments over taxation levels, rather than either Government arbitrarily increasing tax levels only for the other to potentially need to rapidly respond to any changes being made by the other. Therefore we believe that each Government should ensure there are procedures established to facilitate such a dialogue. Caution should be exercised with regard to the point at which tax becomes payable. Waste at landfill sites should, idea lly, be clearly separated at the point of entry, and tax charged only on waste entering the tipping area for waste destined for landfill. There should be a full study of the impacts of such a change on each of the landfill sites in Wales before such a chan ge was introduced, to ensure that any difficulties and implications were resolvable. We also believe that a study would need to be undertaken prior to agreeing any tax credits for waste removed from sites, so as to consider the environmental impact of any waste removed and whether it justifies the tax 375 credit. It would seem to make good legislative sense to include all materials entering the tipping area of a landfill site as subject to tax unless otherwise identified. This would help ensure the legislation is properly enforceable and would limit the areas where landfill site operators may launch appeals and legal action. In general we believe the most effective legislation is simple legislation and subsequent regulation should be framed in terms of 'Better Regulation'.1 The exemptions outlined in this consultation add a level of complexity. With regard to the water discount, the implication would seem to be that tax should not be charged to the water content of waste as it has little negative environmental impact. We are concerned that a discount may be being applied to contaminated water, which might lead to a disincentive to purify water, particularly when used for industrial purposes. We recommend the Welsh Government undertake a full evaluation of the im pact of removing the water discount. Any additional discounts should be introduced with caution as these may further complicate the implementation and enforceability of the legislation. Compliance and Enforcement Whereas we fully support efforts to com bat the problem of illegal waste tipping, and can understand the possible additional deterrent of tax being applied to illegal waste, this is clearly a highly complicated area of law. There is existing legislation in place, such as the Environmental Protec tion Act 1990, which gives local authorities powers to tackle illegal fly tipping, and we believe that local authorities should make better use of these powers to investigate and prosecute those responsible. We support the approach of increasing practica l enforcement action to tackling illegal waste recognising that failure to tackle illegal tipping places a disproportionate burden on those small businesses that act in good faith and comply with current legislation. The approach taken in England, to use funding from the Landfill Communities Fund to increase enforcement activities, would appear to be sensible if it leads to both a reduction of the incidents of illegal waste disposal and subsequently in increased revenue for the Landfill Disposals Tax. The h igher revenues should be used to 'repay' the Landfill Communities Fund, but consideration should also be given to increasing the Fund as a proportion of any resulting increases in revenue. As a general principal, FSB Wales argues that good regulatory enf orcement rests on taking an approach to regulation that prioritises education as the first response to non -compliance. This is also true for tax compliance. The Welsh Revenue Authority should prioritise assisting small businesses to comply with regulations prior to resorting to any enforcement action. This requires clear guidance from the Authority, as well as officers that are able to support SMEs where complications arise. 376 Likewise, it is our contention that the vast majority of small firms are tax comp liant and would not seek to avoid tax. Tax avoidance allows firms to illegally gain a competitive advantage. We believe the Welsh Government should seek to ensure all firms are operating on a level playing field. Often larger, multinational firms are among st the most significant avoiders of tax. FSB Wales is therefore supportive of the principle of a General Anti - Avoidance Rule as set out in Scotland. Administration There are only a small number of sites that qualify for paying the Landfill Disposals Tax and this number is likely to decrease. Aligning the tax return period with the financial year will have a limited impact beyond this small number of operators. As a g eneral principle, however, we fully support the simplification of the tax regime to enable businesses to better manage their tax reporting requirements. Whereas we believe the cost of administering the new tax should be proportionate, the move to a simpl er online reporting procedure in line with the Welsh Government's Digital Wales ambition is encouraged. The Welsh Government's proposed new Welsh Revenue Authority should apply the principle of digital first, which could reduce the costs of designing an on line reporting facility if it is commissioned at the same time as those required for other devolved taxes. As it is the intent to see recycling increase, the Landfill Tax collected in Wales will diminish year on year, it is therefore imperative that the co st of tax collection is kept as low as possible. We believe there should be a general principle that tax is not payable if its payment is subject to an appeal, unless the appeal is unsuccessful. As a deterrent to spurious appeals, which might be used to delay payment of the tax due, the Welsh Government may wish to consider placing an interest charge on tax due for the period of the appeal should the appeal be unsuccessful. The Welsh Government should, however, issue regulations regarding the timescales w ithin which the Welsh Revenue Authority should deal with appeals, so that the amount of interest paid can be calculated in advance of any appeal. Businesses would then be able to predict the degree of financial risk associated with an appeal. The Welsh Rev enue Authority on this and other matters should have a statutory duty placed upon it to report annually on the timescales in which it responds to complaints and appeals. Community Well -Being We believe the Welsh Government should allocate a specific pr oportion of the Landfill Disposals Tax to the well -being of communities. We believe the Welsh Government should be able to use an element of the ring -fenced Well -Being of Communities Fund to undertake additional enforcement action. As indicated above, howe ver, we believe this should be repaid to the Fund from the additional tax receipts. This should result in larger sums being allocated to the Fund as the total revenues increase. 377 We also believe that tackling poverty and deprivation in communities should be the key driver for the Fund. Local economies offer the greatest source of tackling poverty and where local businesses can demonstrate sustainable business growth, particularly leading to job creation or protection, they should be eligible to bid for fun ding. It is our belief that this activity should take precedence over other desirable but less efficient ways of tackling poverty or promoting sustainable economic development. The administration of the fund itself should be done in the most economical way that promotes the take up of the Fund. We note that this fund is currently under spent, with \u00a3140m of unspent funds being accumulated by Environmental and Distributive Environmental Bodies, and believe that urgent actions should be taken to widen the poss ible definition of economic beneficiaries and also to make the application proc ess as accessible as possible.

The Welsh Environmental Services Association (\"WESA\") is an arm of Environmental Services Association (ESA): the trade association representing the UK's waste and secondary resource industry, a sector with an annual British turnover of around \u00a311 billion. Driven by EU environmental law, WESA is a leading partner in Wales' s transformation from a disposal to a zero waste society. Our Members recover both value and energy from the Wales's waste whilst protecting the environment and human health. 2. The landfill tax has proved one of the principal policy drivers for effecting cha nge in the waste and recycling sector. By increasing the costs of landfill in a uniform and predictable way, the landfill tax has made alternative treatment infrastructure more economically viable, thereby encouraging the industry to invest in a range of f acilities designed to recycle and recover the value embedded in waste. Q1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? 3. Very important. We welcome the assurances received thus far from the Welsh Government that the new Wales Disposal Tax regime will be broadly aligned with that operating across the rest of the UK. Price disparity might otherwise be exploited, leading to \"wa ste tourism\", where waste is transported to or from Wales to take advantage of the cheapest waste disposal option. Such an outcome would be contrary to the proximity principle. The industry requires as much certainty as possible to invest in waste manageme nt and recycling infrastructure, and to this extent the uniform and relatively predictable increases to landfill tax via the escalator have been helpful. It would not, however, be helpful to introduce uncertainty in to the market place, with either proposa ls for different tax rates or for variation throughout the UK. Q2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. 4. Yes. Again, we would advocate that there are no disparities between Wales and the rest of the UK. See answer to Q1 above. Q3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? 380 5. WESA does not see any value in this approach. Changing the lower rate would have significant implications for investment and the way waste material is managed. If the lower rate of tax is increased in Wales it is likely to lead to such waste streams simply being transported across th e border to England. Q4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? 6. The list of materials under the existing Qualifying Materials Order remains fit for purpo se and, subject to our comments in Q5 and 6 below, we do not advocate change to the materials that are subject to the lower tax rate. Instead, the new Wales Landfill Disposals Tax regime would benefit from greater clarity on the application of the lower rate of tax to prevent the widespread and deliberate misclassification of waste for the purposes of benefitting from the lower tax rate. See response to Q6 below. Q5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small qua ntity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? : 7. It is worth noting that in effect a 10% limit has already been introduced in the England and Wales in relation to transfer station 'fines'. The practical issues that would arise would inclu de how to actually assess material going to landfill against a specific limit? A visual inspection would be open to interpretation whereas a requirement to sample and undertake some for of scientific test would pose the following questions for considerati on: How to take a representative sample? Which test to use? How often should the test be taken? How to ensure consistency of results between different operators? 8. At the very least it would be helpful for the Welsh Government to produce practical guidanc e to assist operators in the assessment of small or incidental amounts of standard rated materials within loads of mainly qualifying materials. Q6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Pl ease explain your reasons. : 9. Yes. The ESAET Report 'Waste Crime - Britain's Dirty Secret' calculated that at least \u00a3168m was being lost to the public purse in the UK, due to waste materials arising out of waste transfer stations and delivered to landfill s ites being, deliberately or otherwise, misdescribed as 'low rated' in terms of landfill tax. 10. Landfill operators were previously put in an unenviable position, whereby the onus was on them to determine whether material was low rated, based solely on visual inspection and information provided to them by the waste producer/carrier. Yet, it is the landfill operator, not 381 the waste producer, who is accountable if HMRC disagrees with the decision. Of particular concern was 'fines' from trommelled wastes arising ou t of waste transfer stations and delivered to landfill sites. Due to the nature of this material it is impossible for landfill operators to detect from a visual inspection alone whether the material has been misdescribed by the producer or waste carrier. 11. The differential between low rate (\u00a32.60) standard rate (\u00a382.60) landfill tax is now so significant that it is really no surprise that problems arose. ESA therefore urged the Government in England for many years to develop a more objective approach and we w ere therefore pleased when the Loss on Ignition testing regime was implemented in England and Wales in April 2015. We think that it will provide an objective testing regime for waste fines arising from mechanical treatment facilities which we believe will go a long way to prevent the misclassification of waste which has been so costly to responsible operators and to the UK's economy. The new LOI regime in England and Wales should also provide a level playing field for all operators - both those producing an d those disposing of waste fines - and to prevent misclassification of waste fines either deliberately or otherwise. 12. It is also worth noting that the main purpose of landfill tax is to divert material away from landfill. Continuing with LOI regime will hel p to differentiate between wastes and therefore facilitate the beneficial reuse of essentially inert materials in, for example, construction projects and quarry restoration, rather than them ending up in landfill. 13. The new testing regime is a much more obje ctive approach and applies to all 'fines' destined for landfill that have arisen from a 'waste treatment process that involves an element of mechanical treatment'. In the main, it will apply to 'fines' which arise after material has been processed via trom melling equipment designed to remove recyclable material. In order to qualify for the lower tax rate the 'fines' must consist predominantly of 'Qualifying material' with no more than an 'incidental amount' of any other 'non qualifying material. 14. The testing regime itself is fairly straightforward and low cost. It will involve both a pre acceptance check by the landfill operator on the process producing the waste fines as well as a sampling and testing aspect to effectively measure the level of 'contamination ' in the waste 'fines'. 15. Under the new regime, a representative waste sample must be taken from the waste 'fines' as they arrive at the landfill site. The frequency of the LOI test will depend on a number of 'risk factors' that the landfill operator must co nsider with default minimum being one LOI test for every 1,000 tonnes of waste received from an individual processor. Importantly, the landfill operator will also have to keep a sample in reserve should HMRC decide to retest a sample itself. 16. The key aspect is that every load that exceeds the 10% LOI (15% for the first 12 months) limit will be liable to the standard rate of landfill tax. So for a typical twenty tonne truck the difference between low and standard rate tax will be significant i.e. Approximate ly \u00a31600. 382 17. Whilst WESA recognises that the new regime will take some time to 'bed in' we are also urging HMRC to be both consistent and robust in its enforcement to ensure that the new requirements are properly implemented by all parties. We will continue t o engage closely with HMRC to help ensure the implementation of the regime is as smooth as possible. We hope that the new regime will provide more confidence, certainty and consistency to our sector. Q7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangemen ts for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? : 18. WESA is not aware of any problems. Q8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? : 19. Leachate Removed from site incurs significant costs to the landfill operator for transport and treatment. As this forms part of taxable inputs should leachate outputs attra ct a credit against landfill tax? Q9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? 20. Modern landfill facilities are signific ant civil engineering projects and require a range of materials including virgin clay, stone, plastic membranes and pipework. These construction materials should not be subject to landfill tax. The tax should only be applied to waste materials entering the site and not to other materials used in the construction or management control of the site. Q10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? : 21. Engineering materials including clay, stone (already subject to aggregates levy ), pumps, pipework and road building material should all be exempt. These materials are all products essential to the running of the facility and not waste being disposed of. Materials used in the capping and restoration of a site should also remain exempt . All other exempt activities should be retained. Q11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? : 22. If a material is being used on site as a product and an essential item in order for the landfill to be operated and not for the purpose of permanent disposal, then it should be tax free. The definitions of what an essential item in order to operate the landfill needs to be agree d and we suspect that this may cause further interpretation and challenge issues to those that have gone by under the current regulations. 383 Q12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. : 23. No Q13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. 24. No: WESA strongly opposes the proposal to remove the existing provision which enables water to be discounted from taxable disposal and urges the W elsh Government to carefully consider the economic impact of this proposal on Welsh businesses. 25. While the number of affected businesses is relatively small, the financial implications on such companies would be severe: in some cases a 6 figure increase (p er annum) in disposal costs. Clearly, this will place affected Welsh businesses at a competitive disadvantage to their UK counterparts, who would continue to benefit from cost savings through the existing provision within the UK landfill tax regime. 26. The l ikely consequence of this proposal would simply be to encourage \"waste tourism\" to other parts of the UK. Even accounting for transport costs, arranging for landfill disposal in other parts of the UK would be a cheaper and entirely viable option for affect ed companies. This would of course reduce potential tax revenues for the Welsh Government; result in a loss of business for Welsh waste management operators; while increasing the distance waste travels for disposal. 27. The level of water within the discounte d tonnage spread across the various landfills in Wales would have little impact on a further pollution risk. In addition, the resources used to treat this extra water are already part of the infrastructure of responsible landfills. Q14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? 28. No. Q15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and availa ble on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? 29. WESA would support this proposal which would help ensure a level playing field for all operators. Q16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? 30. We are not aware of any specific practical difficulties. We support proposals in the consultation to allow recovery of avoided ta x from illegal dump sites. Illegal waste management activity is a national problem requiring strong leadership and resources sufficient to create a climate where the fear of being caught is high. With the introduction of 384 new, higher environmental standards and the increase in the landfill tax this has never been so important. 31. We believe that more resources should be invested in tackling illegal waste management activity to provide a high level of protection for communities and responsible waste management companies across the country. Q17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? : 32. WESA is not aware of any issues with the current penalty regime for landfill tax offences. 33. However, the current regime i mposes the financial penalties on the landfill operator only because LFT is applied at the point of disposal at the landfill site. Some waste delivery operators attempt to take advantage of this and should be penalised alongside the landfill company. This may encourage more responsible behaviour. Q18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. 34. Yes. The regulator must b e both consistent and robust in its enforcement and we consider that this must include an increase on compliance activity on the ground. Q19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? 35. We are not currently aware of any additional actions. Q20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? : 36. WESA is only aware of anecdotal evidence of tax avoidance and would encourage HMRC to take robust enforcement action to ensure that there is a level playing field. Q21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. 37. Landfill operators should be given the option of aligning reporting with the financial year. However, we are aware that some operators see advantages in being allowed to continue using non standa rd periods. Not allowing this will lead to a relatively small amount of additional time required to produce the return, but may cause significant work internally in terms of budgeting/reporting and managing cash flows. Q22: What would be the practical imp lications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? 385 38. Weighbridges should use EWC numbers when booking in wastes to their facilities. This should be a requirement on every site. It will add a relatively small amount of time in producing the return, especially if electronic formats are utilised. Q23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? 39. Why not include tax returns as an extension to Natural Resources Wales Return, all of the information is already recorded. This would ensure accuracy, save administration time and double handling of information. The ability to file electronically would als o be helpful. Q24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? : 40. Debt relief is appropriate on all bad debt for the landfill operator. With standard rate LFT at \u00a382.60/t, and the gate fee for the landfill operat or between \u00a310 -20/t so the LFT element is between four and eight times more than the gate fee the operator can earn from the waste. The landfill industry cannot cover this bad debt risk. Q25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? : 41. ESA has no comment Q26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? : 42. ESA has no comment Q27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? : 43. Yes. The landfill communities fun d delivers significant benefit to the communities around the landfill sites operated in Wales, despite dwindling funds due to decreased inputs to landfill. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance c ommunity wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify). : 43. WESA considers that funding should allocated to supporting compliance and minimising the impacts of waste crime . Waste crime blights communities 386 and undercuts legitimate operators and supporting compliance ensures a level playing field for all operators. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? 44. No. Q30: Do you have any related issues w hich we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? : 45. No Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? : 46. Whilst we understand the financial reasons for implementing the tax in Wales we do ques tion some of the assumptions made in terms of revenue that will be generated. It is also worth noting that the Welsh Landfill disposal tax is proposed to be implemented in 2018, yet the Welsh Waste Strategy aspires to zero waste to landfill just seven year s later in 2025. 47. On Page 11 the report suggests that the figures for landfill tax income will increase from 2013/14 figures to 2019/20. In fact WESA is aware that the OBR has published revised figures for landfill tax receipts in March 2015 which actually project a fall i n landfill tax receipts over the next 5 years rather than the marginal increase referenced in the consultation paper. 48. This lower projection reflects lower -than-expected receipts in 2014 -15 and a lower projection for the proportion of local authority waste sent to landfill. This is based on updated DEFRA projections that suggest a steeper fall in landfill waste in the near term. 387 Reference 115 Response from Conwy Town Council: Question 27: Should WG allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? (or should it be taken into the WG budget to be allocated across WG priorities & public services?) Yes Question 28: If the WG allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the above activities should benefit, & why? All activities are important and also include to \"Prevent social isolation of communities/ and enhance and promote community development\" Question 29: Do you have any though ts on the possible administrative model? Broaden the geographical focus of funding (increase the 10 mile radius) and have an administrative office in Wales. H Barritt Town Clerk and Responsible Financial Officer Cyngor Tref Conwy Town Council Website: www.conwytowncouncil.gov.uk 388 Reference 116 Response to the Consultation on Landfill Disposals tax (Number: WG24170) We have received a copy of the above draft for comment as part of your consultation process. The Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM) is the professional body which represents over 6,300 waste and resources management professionals, predominantly in the UK but also overseas. The CIWM sets the profession al standards for individuals working in the waste and resources management industry and has various grades of membership determined by education, qualification and experience. CIWM is recognised as the foremost professional body representing the complete spectrum of the waste and resources management industry. This gives the Institution the widest possible view and, perhaps more pertinently, an objective rather than partial view, given that our goal is for improvement in the management of all wastes and re sources. The Cymru Wales Centre Council of the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management welcomes the opportunity of contributing to the Consultation on proposals for Landfill Disposals Tax. In relation to the current Consultation document, our points a re provided as responses to the specific questions raised, in relation to the information received, as follows below and in the next pages. Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? It is of significant importance that Welsh Government (WG) maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates to ensure that there is a level playing field for the waste management industry within the UK. It is impor tant to ensure that differential devolved landfill tax rates between Westminster and the devolved administration does not create a cross border distortion of waste movement/disposal between the various administrations resulting in beaches of WG and EU Wast e policies specifically relation to the Proximity Principle' and 'Regional Self Sufficiency'. However, WG could explore increasing the tax level for certain waste types to increase the incentive to reduce, recover or 389 recycle these waste types, this could b e done using European Waste Catalogue (EWC) codes for these waste types and CIWM Wales would recommend that WG reviews the EWC list to identify the waste types which they consider would be best managed further up the waste hierarchy. Question 2: Are the c urrent standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. The current levels of landfill tax at a minimum should be indexed linked and increase at the rate of inflation. Given the extremely high recycling rates for construction waste reported it is likely that the majority of inert waste at landfills is likely to be SME building contractors where the waste is not homogeneous and can contain mixed material including potentially acti ve or polluting elements. It may be beneficial to set a tax rate for mixed construction wastes at a higher level than is currently the case to encourage the separation of the materials through a treatment facility rather than just landfilling the mixed con struction wastes this would apply to the following EWC codes; 17 01 07 mixtures of concrete, bricks, tiles and ceramics other t han those mentioned in 17 01 06 17 09 04 mixed construction and demolition wastes other than those mentioned in 17 09 01, 17 09 0 2 and 17 09 03. Excepting that the LOI test will be considered later, irrespective of this there is still a strong argument that where the inert materials are either re -unsalable or recyclable that such hard -core, river dredging, top -soil or incinerator b ottom ash (IBA) that they should be taxed above the lower tax rates to encourage their use in the construction industry in a more sustainable way than simply landfilling them. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? While landfill exists in the Wales, landfill tax has a role to play, in achieving WG's environmental goals and WG need to consider their objectives very carefully if it is to continu e to promote good behaviour of landfill operators while utilising the tax as an additional lever to support its policies. Clearly having the ability to set different lower or higher rates of tax would a ssist it in achievement of this. Having the ability to create more rate bands to reflect better the relative impact of different types of waste would also be of value to WG. As there is presently a huge differential between the two existing it in itself creates problems and the introduction of a banding tax c harge may address these matter together with realigning landfill tax rates to the polluter pays principle Landfill tax is due to rise with inflation from \u00a380 per tonne to \u00a382.60, Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) confirmed. On 1 April 2015 landfill t ax increased in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from \u00a380 to \u00a382.60 per tonne as a result of a change in Finance Act 2014. This will again increase to 390 \u00a384.40 per tonne for disposals made, or treated as made, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on or after 1 April 2016, according to a HMRC briefing note. The lower rate of tax, which applies to less -polluting wastes listed in the Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 2011, is currently \u00a32.50 per tonne, having increased from \u00a32 per tonne on 1 April 20 08. This will increase to \u00a32.60 per tonne in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1 April 2015 as a result of a change in Finance Act 2014.This will increase again to \u00a32.65 per tonne for disposals of waste made, or treated as made, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on or after 1 April 2016. If WG is committed to reducing landfill and moving waste higher up the waste hierarchy then there must be merit in it setting a higher rate for re -unsalable or recyclable waste sent to landfill. CIWM Wales woul d therefore support WG having the ability to set different lower rates of tax. CIWM Wales feels WG needs to ensure that landfill waste disposal is properly priced in order to promote greater efficiency in the waste management market and the economy as a w hole; and to apply the 'polluter pays' principle to promote a more sustainable approach to waste management reducing waste production and recycling or recovering more from it. However, if WG were to do this it must be mindful of the need to have some consi stency between administrations. Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? There are a number of materials in the list given in appendix 1 for wh ich there are potentially uses for these higher up the hierarchy and the availability of the lower rate of landfill tax does not provide sufficient disincentive to landfill. If WG wants to achieve a higher level of recycling or recovery of these materials either the lower rate needs to be significantly increased or some of the materials should be removed from the list. Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a l oad of qualifying material? If thresholds are to be specified then they need to quantifiable and measurable. If this can't be achieved then there is little point in considering setting a threshold to define any level for small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material. Non-homogeneous waste will be very difficult to sample and define whether the threshold has been exceeded or not. Introducing such a definition as 'a small quantity' will add costs to landfill operators and a furthe r regulatory burden on both the operator and regulator. Therefore, any non -qualifying material in a load of material accepted for the lower rate should not be 391 allowed and the higher rate apply, this would increase the incentive to properly sort wastes prio r to disposal. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. Loss on ignition is a well -established laboratory test used in inorganic analytical chemistry, particularly in the analysis of minerals has already been implemented, from the 1st April 2015. It would be an easy test for producers of fines from waste treatment processes to conduct and to supply the necessary test results to enable such materials to be disposed of at the lower rate if applicable. It is unlikely that many of the fines materials produced from waste processing would then qualify for the lower rate and would close the door to abuses of the current system. Question 7: Are there any proble ms with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? Where there is a separate area within the site for sorting materials to remove items for recycling or recovery from th e wastes delivered into a landfill the current arrangements would appear to be workable through separate recoding of wastes deposited in these areas. It would be sensible to ensure that the permits for these sites include this arrangement and that the site s provide separate returns to the regulator for materials entering and leaving this part of the facility and that it is designated as a sorting and transfer activity within the permit. This might require the regulator (Natural Resources Wales) to review the permit in order to do so. The benefit of this would be that the landfill tax records would be comparable with the permit records and could provide an audit mechanism. Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credi t for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? CIWM Wales is not aware of any issue with the current arrangements. There is merit in having a degree of flexibility, for example extend the time per iod to allow for removal of materials if an innovative process is developed which can use material previously hard to recycle, to make new products. Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material enterin g a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? Subject to the response to question 7 above all waste materials entering the landfill site other than that which is specifically exempt should be subject to tax. This woul d be workable provided that the exemptions are fully specified. 392 Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? The receipt of suitable inert waste materials for lining the landfill, construction of drainage layer s, constructing site roads, daily cover and site capping and suitable material for restoration layers including compost should be exempt, but no other material. The material for landfill site lining and drainage layers has to be of specific engineering cha racteristics. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? Restricting the non -taxable activities to those listed a bove would clarify the position significantly. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. The listed exemptions as listed need further clarification in respect of filling of quarries, there now is a category of facilities referred to as deposit for recovery which defines the activity of stabilising of quarry walls for stabilisation where the original planning permission for the mineral extraction requires this. However, there m ay be quarries where the original planning application for mineral extraction requires the quarry to be reinstated to original levels and this should be regarded as a landfill and not deposit for recovery. For avoidance of doubt this should be defined with in the landfill tax legislation for Wales. Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. There are cases where sludge may be deposited in a landfill in terms of definitions within the landfill regulations and the removal of the water discount relief would remove an area where argument may be the case, it would also encourage producers of such material to remove more water from their wastes within their treatment process and produce a dr yer filter cake, thus saving the environmental costs of transporting more waste than is necessary. There should be flexibility built into this to look at how the Scottish approach is working and to allow for different techniques that maybe developed in the future. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? CIWM Wales has no suggestions to make here. Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obl igation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and 393 available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? This proposal would have significant benefits for record keeping at landfill sites, most large landfill sites have their own weighbridge but smaller inert landfill sites tend not to have such a facility, imposing a requirement for the wastes to be weighed at a weighbridge where there is one within close proximity would be beneficial but the definition of close proximity needs to be drawn by reference to the locations of public weighbridges in the environs of all landfill sites where they do not have their own weighbridge facility. This would enable small l andfill sites that do not have their own facility to comply with this requirement. This move would need to be advertised to the relevant audience. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to inclu de illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? Where the perpetrators of illegal deposit of waste can be identified the landfill tax should be payable by them under the court justice provisions, in cases where the waste producer is identifiable but not the person that deposited the waste the landfill tax should also be recoverable through the courts. The potential ability to recover landfill tax prior to the court process would also be advantageous, observation of how this is working in practice in Scotland would be useful. This may be difficult where several deposits have been made in the same location and care would be needed to ensure that the correct wastes are identified in the investigatory processes. Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? CIWM Wales is not aware of any issues. Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. CIWM Wales feels that while carrying out desk -based checks into returns or other documents to make sure that customers pay the right amount of tax at the right time are important. On site 'compliance checks' a re critical in determining that the correct information is being assessed. Where there appear to be issues then a full site audit of records relating to waste transfer notes would be appropriate to do. Provision of funding to Natural Resources Wales by div ersion of moneys from the Landfill Tax Communities fund to ensure effective compliance and enforcement of waste law, in particular waste misclassification, illegal waste sites and illegal exports would be beneficial. 394 Question 19: Are there any further act ions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? WG should consider the actions within its 'Fly-tipping Free Wales Our strategy for tackling fly -tipping' Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? While unable to say that there is clear evidence it is likely that tax avoidance does occur under the existing landfill tax system Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. Aligning the tax returns to the quarterly returns made to Natural Reso urces Wales permit returns would have benefits in terms of identifying the quantities and types of wastes accepted at landfill sites subject to the comments made in response to question 7 above and 22 below. This does not quite align to the financial year given that the returns are from the first day of the quarter and the financial tax year starts on the 6th April. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? The European Waste Catalogue (EWC) codes should be well known and used when dealing with Site Returns and Waste Transfer Notes to larger landfill operators and there should therefore be very little practical implications making it a requi rement that EWC codes are used in completion of the tax return? Thence given that the waste received into the landfill will have contained EWC codes and the landfill operators are required to use these codes in their returns to Natural Resources Wales (NR W) under their environmental permits there should be no practical difficulty in a requirement for them to be used in completing their landfill tax return. In fact because the EWC codes are used throughout the waste receipt system from waste transfer notes accompanying the waste in the delivery of the waste it would make auditing the quantities and types of wastes received relatively easy if that was required. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns inclu ding improving electronic and online support? Returns made to Natural Resources Wales for permit returns on quantities of wastes accepted under permits are commonly made through the e -mail of completed spreadsheets provided on the Natural Resources Wales' website, 395 Natural Resources Wales are also going to provide an electronic portal for such returns in the near future. It would be relatively simple for WG to introduce a similar system to the existing spreadsheets e -mailing system that Natural Resources Wa les currently provides. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? WG should look at the Scottish proposals and possibly implement something similar, again a degree of flexibility would be advantage ous. Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? CIWM Wales has no comments to provide. Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? CIWM Wales has no comments to provide. Question 27: Should Welsh Gover nment allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? As the tax should be explicitly linked to WG's environmental objectives revenue should encourages environmentally positive behavioural change. The challenge in using it to enhance community wellbeing is how WG will measure outcomes effectively? Landfill tax is structured in relation to environmental outcomes so that the more polluting the behaviour, the greater the tax levied. Although this objective (the 'polluter pays' principle) appears fair and reasonable, the imposition of environmental taxes can have an uneven environmental impact (for example, standard -rated LFT is charged on the weight of waste irrespective of its potential environmental effec t). Additionally, in order to reduce the impact on national competitiveness of burdensome carbon taxes, government has specifically legislated to relieve the burden for some businesses of these taxes through exemption or agreement, thus diluting the impact of the tax. There are additional areas where landfill tax revenues could benefit communities through alleviating the issues associated with abandoned and orphaned waste management facilities. It would be beneficial to all parties if a fund to deal with t hese types of facilities could be established by Welsh Government utilising funds from landfill tax. Establishing a fund or scheme to cover the full costs of clearing and remediating abandoned or orphaned sites should be a function of government and could be a sensible use of the tax receipts from landfill tax and any other similar taxes levied by governments on 396 waste management operations. The proportion of tax receipts from landfill tax and any other taxes levied on waste management that may be required t o establish such a fund need to be proportionate to the level of costs anticipated to cover the necessary works at known orphaned sites and sites at risk of falling into this category. These taxes were introduced to affect the decisions of waste producers and waste managers to drive wastes away from environmentally undesirable waste management options and have been effective in reducing the reliance on landfill in the UK. The use of a proportion of the receipts from these taxes to support a scheme to ensur e the clean -up and remediation of orphaned or abandoned waste management facilities would in effect be scheme co -funded by governments and the waste industry and would be a suitable use for such tax receipts. Decisions to draw on the scheme would need to be made through government or a government appointed body to manage such a scheme. Application to the scheme for funding remediation of abandoned or orphaned waste management facilities could be made by the landowner, local authority or regulator, but woul d need to be accompanied by a statemen t of the financial costs of the remediation, the environmental benefits that would accrue from such works and the reasons why the body or person is not in a position to fund the works themselves. Question 28: If the W elsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising waste crime should be fundable through moneys from landfill tax as noted in response to question 18 above as should remediation of abandoned or orphaned waste facilities, this funding should not be limited to locations in the environs of landfi ll sites. Supporting waste minimisation and diversion of wastes from landfill should also be fundable from landfill tax moneys, this funding should not be limited to locations in the environs of landfill sites. Biodiversity initiatives in the environs of l andfill sites should be fundable from landfill tax moneys as should initiatives to tackle poverty and deprivation in communities in the environs of landfill sites. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? 397 The landfill t ax moneys in its entirety should be used to support sustainable development and green growth in Wales through the Wales wide initiatives of supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising waste crime, remediation of abandoned or orphaned waste facilit ies, and supporting waste minimisation and diversion of wastes from landfill. A proportion should be allocated to a distributive fund managed by the WG to support community initiatives in the environs of landfill sites in Wales as outlined in the response to question 28 above. Question 30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? CIWM Wales has no comments to provide. Question 31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? CIWM Wales has no comments to provide. Should you have any query with regards to our response, please do not hesitate to contact us. Kind regards Celine Anouilh CIWM Regional Development Officer for Wales 398 Reference 117 Response to Welsh Government consultation on Landfill Disposal Tax This paper sets out ENTRUSTs response to Chapter 5 of the Welsh Government\u00a1\u00a6s consultation on Landfill Disposals Tax, which relates to Community Wellbeing and how landfill sites affect communities. Question 27 Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? 2.1 As the regulator of the LCF, we consider that a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax should be allocated to enhance the wellbeing of community's since 1996 over \u00a3 62m has been distributed from the LCF to fund projects, which benefit communities across Wales. 2.2 These projects include the creation of parks and play -parks, maintenance of village halls and churches (including the addition of disabled access), improvements to other community facilities such as theatres, sports facilities and nature reserves and projects for the protection and conservation of species and habitats. Questio n 28 If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) 3.1 We consider that the current objects of the LCF should be those which continue to benefit from this funding in Wales. These activities have already demonstrated their value to Welsh communities through the projects that have been delivered since 1996. Details of all LCF projec ts which have been undertaken in Wales can be found on our website \u00a1V www.entrust.org.uk - but we have highlighted some recent projects, and how they have benefitted communities, in Appendix A to this response. 399 Question 29 Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? 4.1 We believe any Fund in Wales should minimise the administration costs and so maximise the funding available to local comm unities and the environment. In determining a model to deliver this objective, we have borne in min d the likel y amount of funding available from a Welsh Landf ill Disposals Tax. We have also taken into consideration that the Office for National Statistics has classified the LCF as a private scheme. As a direct consequence of this status, project delivere rs are able to secure public funding to support their project s. If the current status of the Fund changed to a public scheme, project applicants may not be able to secure other public funding to support their projects. 4.2 We therefore consider that given the potentia l size of the Fund in Wales, we recommend that a single body is established to r egulate the Fund and distribute funding to local communities and environmental orga nisations. We believe that this arrangement could provide some of the following benefits: Minimise the administration costs and maximise the funding available to projects through economies of scale of only having one funding and regulatory body; Minimise the administration burden on project applicants through the implementation of o ne standardised applica tion form and project criteria; Ensure a fully transparent and accountable system is in operation for all of the Welsh Government\u00a1\u00a6s stakeholders; Ensure that individual Landfill Operators (LOs) would still be able to attain the current level of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) benefits that they gain from contributing to the current LCF scheme; and Ensure that the Welsh Government is provided with assurance that any funding diverted from general taxation delivers Value for Mo ney and is fully accounted for, including the provision of regular management information on the operation of the Fund Appendix A Project LCF contribution Project details including t he benefit to Welsh communities Maerdy Gateway Mining Memorial \u00a3100,000 The Trustees of Maerdy Archive Group in the Rhondda Fach Valley South Wales applied for funding in relation to \u00a1\u00a5Erecting the Winding Wheel\u00a1\u00a6, which was used at the pithead of Maerdy colliery which was the last mine to be closed down in December 1990. When people talk about the South Wales coalfields th ey almost invariably think of The Rhondda Valley the most intensively mined area in the world. 400 The project serves as a memorial to all those who were killed in explosions and accidents and restores a piece of Welsh mining heritage. Thompson Street Estate Sensory Garden (also known as Belvedere Park, Barry) \u00a340,000 Thompson Street Estate us a designated Communities First area. The estate suffers from high levels of deprivation and associated problems. As a result, individual and collective self esteem is low and residents are often unable to look beyond their immediate situation towards a more positive future. The Sensory Garden Project hopes to alleviate some of these problems through engagement with reside nts on both the design and creation of a public garden that will provide an opportunity for residents to learn sills, improve their potential for employment and increase the collective capacity of the community. Cwm Colhuw Nature Reserve (The Wildlife Tru st of South and West Wales) \u00a350,000 Cwm Colhuw is a 12 hectare nature reserve, near Llantwit Major. A good example of coastal calcareous grassland, which has suffered in recent years through neglect and therefore diminished in biodiversity value. The proje ct aims to undertake specific management for chough, reptiles and invertebrates, which will benefit the habitats of the reserve and all the other species using it. The project will also engage with academic institutions so that opportunities to undertake scientific research can be made more readily available. 401 Reference 118 The proposal to use landfill tax for general purposes is ridiculous. Wales is a beautiful country and gains socially, economically and culturally from the scenery and the historic landscape. Wild life and other local groups need this money for the benefit of us all R Jinkinson 402 Reference 119 Welsh Government (Number: WG24170) Name: Pamela Parr Organisation (if responding on behalf of that organisation): Fly Tipping Action Wales Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? No response Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. No response Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? No response Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? No response Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? No response Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. 403 No response Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? No response Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? No response Question 9: What would be the practical imp lications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? No response Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why ? No response Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? No response Question 12: Do you think th at any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. No response Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. No response Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? No response Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement 404 Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing a n obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? There is clarity over the tonnages of waste that is brought to site and the tax payable. It is an enhanced level of scrutiny and will help to cut down on the amount of tax evasion. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? This will act as a further deterrent and will hopefully lead to a decrease in the amount of fly tipping and illegal waste deposits. Household recycling sites operate free of charge for householder s so I'm not sure what implications this would have for waste found tipped by a member of public (as opposed to a business). Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? No response Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. There is a need for increased compliance activity on the groun d, as the paperwork/electronic records can be falsified or not submitted and without physical checks made on the ground, it could be difficult to prove non - compliance. Whilst staff are on the ground, they also pick up far more intelligence about illegal a ctivity as they are the eyes and ears talking to people and seeing what is going on first hand. Having that visible presence shows potential offenders that checks are being carried out and can help act as a deterrent. Question 19: Are there any further a ctions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? No response Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? No response Chapter 4: Administration 405 Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial y ear? Please explain your reasons. No response Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return?

No resp onse Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? No response Question 26: In you r view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? No response Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Yes Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance commun ity wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill 406 - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) The funding should go towards supporting compliance and enforcement of waste activities. Fly Tipping costs the tax payer in Wales around 2million pounds annually in clean -up costs but this is just on public land, the true cost of Fly Tipping in Wales is currently unknown. As the investigation of fly tipping is not a statutory duty, some of the Local Authorities re sponsible for tackling fly tipping do not take any enforcement action against offenders and will just clean up the fly tipping. The amount of prosecutions taken in Wales is very low equating to only 0.2% of incidents and with increased budget cuts in the Authorities, the amount of enforcement work carried out is unlikely to increase. This goes back to - The Eunomia Report on waste crime which states \"Whatever the level of penalties...they will not act as a deterrent unless offenders believe it is likely tha t they will be caught and prosecuted.\" Therefore as very few offenders are caught and prosecuted there is little deterrent and also there is no way of recovering the landfill tax that has been evaded. If a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax Revenue is i ntended to go towards enhancing community wellbeing, putting more money towards tackling fly tipping would be beneficial for the community as there are proven links between poor local environmental quality and crime (research paper produced by Keep Wales T idy). We are getting increasing requests for assistance with funding clean up's of waste tipped on common land but can't assist because we are not funded to issue grants to pay for these clean ups. As common land is classed as private Local Authorities don't clean up the fly tipping and as there is often no known land owner, fly tipping tends to get left attracting more tipping. If some of the Landfill Disposals Tax revenue could also be used for clean ups of this type it would be beneficial for the pu blic and farmers that use this land.

For the purposes of this response, we have restricted our comments to Chapter 5 (Community wellbeing) of the consultation document. WTSWW is a local nature conservation charity dedicated to the conservation of Wales' wildlife and natural habitats. WTSWW has a vision of an environment rich in wildlife for everyone and aims to rebuild biodiversity in Wales by engaging people with their n atural world. To help achieve this vision, WTSWW owns and manages over 80 nature reserves in South and West Wales, including the internationally significant offshore islands of Skomer and Skokholm as well as many U.K. designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Our work is supported by over 500 regular volunteers from the local community and over 9,000 members across Wales. Through the support of funds such as the Landfill Communities Fund (LCF), in 2014 alone, WTSWW was able to achieve the fol lowing for the environment and local communities: Lead 148 guided educational walks, attended by 1342 people Gave 58 talks, attended by 1300 people Organised 80 community events, attended by 2243 people Ran 32 training courses, training 300 people Support ed 5864 volunteer person days Organised 791 volunteer conservation workparties on reserves WTSWW strongly supports the continuation and enhancement of the LCF and believes that the funds have been a great success for both people and wildlife in Wales. WTS WW supports the use of taxes raised from environmentally 409 damaging activities to support biodiversity projects in communities that live with the adverse effects of those activities. It must be acknowledged that the LCF is one of the few funding streams in Wales that maintain a direct interest in outcomes for biodiversity and the environment. The fund has become increasingly essential to meet Welsh and European targets for biodiversity and to halt the continuing, and in some places, devastating loss of wildl ife in Wales. Biodiversity should be the primary activity to benefit from the fund in Wales, not least because benefitting biodiversity also benefits all the other activities cited in the consultation. Without the LCF, Welsh Government will lose one of the few mechanisms it has to reach its biodiversity targets and engage local communities with their environment. Therefore, I urge the Welsh Government to maintain this funding and also to increase the percentage of landfill tax that goes to funding wildlife projects to 10%. Yours faithfully Robert Jones Parry Conservation Manager Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales The Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) to fund charitie s such as the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) to undertake es sential projects to protect and enhance Wales' most important habitats and species (bio diversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements). This fund is needed to t ry to reverse the terrible loss of wildlife including 60% of UK species being in decline and more than 1 in 10 species in the UK be ing under threat of extinction. The wildlife projects funded by LCF will help W elsh Government to meet its key environment objectives and legal obligations including: halting and reversing the loss of wildlife by 2020 ensuring all of our most important, and protected, sites in Wales are in favourable condition by 2026 With financial support from the LCF, in the last four years alone, WTSWW has restored habitats on eight sites important for wildlife, from the Teifi Marshes nature reserve in Cardigan to Parc Slip nature reserve near Bridgend. LC F funds have directly supported WTSWW's work to save threatened species such as t he lapwing and marsh fritillary butterfly, protect scarce habitats such as limestone gr assland and create new habitats such as the wildlife -rich arable crops and wetlands. Carmel National Nature Reserve In 2012, The Grasslands Trust sadly went into liquidation, putting the future of their amazing Carmel National Nature Reserve into jeopardy. H owever, the then Coun tryside Council for Wales (CCW) quickly stepped in, and with substantial funding from GrantScape and CWM Environmental Ltd (who had previously funded much conservation work on the site through the Grasslands Trust), was able to purchas e the land from the owners, Tarmac. 410 In 2013, WTSWW took on a long term lease of the site from Natural Resources Wales (previously CCW). WTSWW also received a Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) grant of \u00a333,454 from CWM Environmental to restore and enhance the important habitats on this large (50 hecta res) nature reserve including a number of scarce species such as Lily of the Valley and Herb Paris, and a mixture of habitats including limestone grassland, ancient woodland and marshy grassland. Two kilometres of hedgerow was laid using traditional techniques as part of the project. Weekly voluntee r workparties were supported by Wildlife Trust Officer Rebecca Killa, and amongst other skills, volunteers learned new techniques such as scything to help manage the woodland clearings and protect their wildflowers. The LCF funds at Carmel have saved this site for wildlife and for th e local community, securing its future management, allowing us to work with many local voluntee rs, and ensuring it remains the popular re creational resource for dog walkers and wildlife enthusiasts that it has been for many years. Case Study 1: Management of Carmel National Nature Reserve (NNR) Poverty and Deprivation in Communities As well as helping to achieve Welsh Governm ent's environm ental objectives, WTSWW's work also demonstrates that these projects a lso produce direct benefits for communities who live with the adverse environmental i mpact caused by landfill sites. They help to inspire individuals and communities to connect with natu re. They also provide opportunities for people to volunteer enabling them to learn new skills whilst improving their health and wellbeing. The LCF has supported WTSWW to work with local c ommunities at our LCF supported sites and engage with approximately two hundred community volunteers and engag e with many mor e at community sessions such as guide d walks and wildlife events. By Gwarchod Natur ar Gyfer y Dyfodol Protecting Wildlife for the Future supporting the voluntary sector, significant added value is achieved for every pound of grant funding awarded. Volunteering for nature conservation is an ideal and proven way to improve people's health and wellbeing as it encourages local people of a ll backgrounds and abilities to work together outdoors for a common cause - their en vironment. This not only brings about a sense of achievement but also a greater und erstanding and appreciation for the environment and wildlife in their area. Conservation volunteering is a healthy form of exercise and outdoor recrea tion as well as playing a vital role in combatting loneliness and social exclusion. Many of the volunteers that have participated in LCF funded projects with WTSWW have gone on to form bonds of friendships outside of volunteeri ng. Additionally, volunteers trained through the project have joined o ther interest groups, continued with their local volunteering and in several cases have found employment in the environmental sector. 411 Parc Slip Nature Reserve In 2014, WTSWW received a Landfill Communities Fund (L CF) gran t of \u00a326,060 from SITA Trust to manage and c reate habitats for our breeding Lapwing population a t Parc Slip Nature Reserve. The Lapwing is an iconic farmland bird which has undergone drastic declines across the UK as a re sult of loss of breeding ha bitat. Today the lapwi ng is a U.K. and Wales priority species requiring urgent action. Through the LCF, WTSWW was able to undertake a series of habitat cr eation and management projects, ranging from pool and scrape creation, scrub clearance, cattle gr azing , predator fencing and the installation of cryptic nest sites such as shingle islands. In order to complete the work that was required to improve the ha bitat for Lapwing, WTSWW worked in partnership with local farmers and volunte ers who helped with scru b clearance and scrape creation that was taking place on site. These volunteers have come from all sorts of backgrounds, including students, retirees and those who just want to help out in their spare time. In total, 40 volunteers have donated their time and effort to the project, amounting to over 220 volunteer hour s, which has been an invaluable contribution to the p roject. Without the help of the volunteers, WTSWW would have been unable to complete as much of the fantastic habitat management works that hav e taken place this winter for Lapwing. Case Study 2: Volunteering for Nature Conservation at Parc Slip Nature Reserve In 2012, WTSWW received a Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) grant from Biffa Award to help restore the Cwm Colhuw Nature Reserve for people and wildlife. The project has ena bled WTSWW to create a longterm management plan for the nature reserve and implement the management to improve the condition of the calcareous grassland, coastal scrub and woodland h abitats. The grassland has been brought into favourable management by the installation of grazing animals and also by mowing and the regular removal of ragwort. Scrub has been cleared back from the meadows, exposing the Scheduled Ancient Monument for the first time in a number of years and invas ive species have been removed from the woodland. Amphibian hibernacula have been created on the reserve and a series of new bird boxes and bat roosts put up to benef it some of the species present. As well as restoring important wildlife habitat, the local community has also benefitted. Paths have been improved and new stiles and gates installed with regular litter-picks carried out on site. Local volunteers have been crucial to the project's success and wil l help WTSWW manage the reserve sustainably into the future. A regular series of bird surveys and community bat walks and moth trap events along with numerous talks and interactions with local groups has greatly increased people's awareness of the reserve and the wildlife that is present. A local councillor was selected to be a V olunteer Warden for the reserve and he has been an excellent link between the Wildlife Trust and the local community. Case Study 3: Community Engagement at Cwm Colhuw Nature Reserve 412 Combatting Waste Crime Biodiversity projects supported by the LCF are designed to benefit wildlife and natural habitats, but to also work with communities, businesses an d other local partners. WTSWW believes that engaging in local partner ships to undertak e biodiversity enhancement projects leads to longer more sustain able gains for the environment. Whilst working and volunteering with WTSWW on LCF supported projects, all stakeholders are given the opportunity to learn about their local environment and are encouraged to be part of the solution to help pr otect and enhance it for future generations. Educating local communities through eng agement and participation is an essential tool in helping to minimise waste crime as it has the ability to act as a means of prevention to the problem as well as a community cure. Brynna Woods and Llanharan Marsh Nature Reserve LCF funding was granted from Biffa Award to help increase the nature reserve' s biodiversity and to encourage the local community to get more actively i nvolved in the reserve's manageme nt. Prior to funding the nature reserve suffered from a number of anti -social activities and waste crimes, including, littering, dog fouling, offroad vehicles, vandalism and fly tipping from nearby allotments. The LCF proje ct recognised this and a concerted effort was made to engage w ith as many sectors as possible within the community to combat the various issues. Large community litt er picks were organised for the nature reserve involving local people, community councillor s, allotmenteer s and local schools. As well as helping to clean up the nature reserve it was a good opportunity for WTSWW to work with the community to show them the reserve and to educat e them on why the reserve is so import ant for wildlife and the area's cultural and natural heritage and ho w damaging litter can be to it. Workshops were organised so that teenagers previously known to be vandalising the reserve could take part in activities such as wood carving, carpentry, b uilding and habitat management. Key to this approach was the creation of an outdoor classroom on the nature reserve built by previously off ending teenagers for the use of younger pupils at the local school. Since its creation the outdoor classr oom has been used every week of school term b y the pupils and has received no vandalism. In addition, fly -tipping from the allotments has declined dra matically and many of the allotmenteers are now volunteers for WTSWW at the reserve. The project has been a shining example of how involving local comm unities can lead to better and longer lasting enhancements to the environment. Case Study 4: Combatting and Preventing Waste Crime at Brynna Woods & Llanharan Marsh Nature Reserve 413 Reference 121 A response to the Welsh Government's consultation on developing a Landfills Disposal Tax Written evidence submitted by FCC Environment FCC Environment: - Is one of the UK's leading waste and resource management companies helping thousands of businesses and communities waste less and recycle more and as a result is uniquely positioned to respond to this call for evidence. - Is part of the FCC group, one of the world's largest environmental services companies. This multi -national expertise and experience , working in markets with different legislation and policies further adds to its ability to provide a response. - Operates from more than 200 locations across the UK including landfills, EfW plants, household waste recycling centres, materials recycling facilities, and compost plants, all operated to ISO 14001 environment standards. - Provides waste processing services for residual and contaminated waste. Its infrastructure includes industrial waste treatment plants, asbestos disposal sites and a dedicated hazardous waste landfill site. Offers municipal and business waste solutions in cluding local collections and skip hire. - Believes every waste collection is an opportunity to reclaim valuable resources and improve the environment we all share. The company employs the latest recycling and green energy technology to ensure we recover as much resource as possible, minimise the use of landfill and drive the circular economy. Reason for submitting evidence: FCC Environment welcomes the opportunity to offer its perspective to the Welsh Government on its consultation to developing a Land fills Disposal Tax. As a result of its extensive experience in waste management in England the company is acutely aware of the opportunities and challenges the sector faces and is able to offer unique insight into the issue. FCC Environment is at the 'co al-face' of waste management in England and as such, is witness to the economic drivers of waste manag ement and the impact of policy. For this reason, FCC Environment feels it is able to provide the Welsh Government with evidence and comment that can help inform future work and Government policy to ensure a robust and efficient waste management industry. Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency 414 with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? As the consultation document comments, given an economic incentive waste will travel significant distances if a waste operator thinks there is a cost benefit to do so. All of the Welsh sites are within a commutable distance for waste to move either in to or out of Wales if the tax regimes are different. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. Yes. The tax is doing what it was intend ed to do and is moving waste away from landfill. At \u00a382.60/t this is already more expensive than many treatment options and the recent experience in the movement of waste as RDF to the continent demonstrates clearly that the tax is working and that if the infrastructure is available, the waste will move. It is up to local authorities and business to now deliver a network of alternatives treatments to deal with the waste that is falling out of landfill and avoid it's export as RDF. Question 3: Is there val ue in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? No. For the reasons set out in question 1, although lower rate material will not move as far, there is enough competition alon g the England/Wales border to suggest that it will if the financial incentives are big enough. If there are different rates of tax for different qualifying materials this will lead to further confusion and challenge of the applied rate and more bureaucracy and administration. Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? No Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a thresh old to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? There have been a number of attempts to clarify this but so far nothing has come forward that has worked. However, if the threshold is based on a tonnage percentage or by volume still leaves a lot of interpretation and how can you measure this practically on the tipping face of a landfill? Some clarification that sets a commo n threshold would be welcomed. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. 415 Yes. The introduction of the LOI test in management of waste fines is a welcome change and has delivered some consistency in the way all legitimate landfill co mpanies apply the tax giving both the landfill operators and waste processors some certainty about the likely costs of disposal. We would not like to see fines travelling in to Wales because there is a financial incentive to do so. Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? None, as far as we are aware. Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangement s for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? No comment to give. Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landf ill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? Modern landfill facilities are significant civil engineering projects and require a range of materials including virgin clay and stone to plastic membranes and pipework. As such, our belief is that tax should only be applied to waste materials entering the site and not to other materials used in the construction or management control of the site. And it is our belief also that all waste should be taxed at the same rate as a means o f deterring waste crime which is of concern to our sector (see recent DEFRA consultation.) Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? Engineering materials in landfill cell builds including clay, stone (alr eady subject to an aggregate tax levy), pumps, pipework and road building material should all be exempt. These materials are all products essential to the running of the facility and not actually wastes being disposed of. Materials used in the capping and restoration of a site should also remain exempt. All other exempt activities should be retained. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the pract ical implications of these? If a material is being used on site as a product and an essential item in order for the landfill to be operated and not for the purpose of permanent disposal, then it should be tax free. The definitions of what an essential 416 item in order to operate the landfill needs to be agreed and we suspect that this will cause further interpretation and challenge issues to those that have gone by under the current regulations. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemption s should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. No Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. No. Some industrial waste materials have no alternative but to be treated with a water solution to wash them or dilute them before disposal. If the tax is applied to water added to the waste, this cost will be passed back to the manufacturing industry. At a time when we are trying to support our manufacturing base in the higher tech chemical industries, this would be a blow for these businesses. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? No Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? All responsible landfill operators should use a weighbridge if not for the LFT implications but for their management control. We do not see this as being a problem for the industry. However, we would expect an y instances where it is impractical or impossible for the landfill operator to use a weighbridge to be notified to the Welsh Government in advance, and exceptional agreement obtained prior to disposal. We would also expect some flexibility in the event of weighbridge breakdown etc. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? FCC supports the principle of placing the tax burden on ope rators who deliberately avoid the tax by waste stockpiling or fly tipping. These operators distort the economics and make it difficult for legitimate businesses to compete against. Perhaps the tax could be levied against those companies who knowingly give their waste to these companies as well. So that if a load is fly tipped or illegally stockpiled, the tax is levied on both the operator and the company that gave them the waste. This 417 would require the right level of resource and collaboration with the EA t o locate and then bring cases against these companies. Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? The current regime imposes the financial penalties on the landfill operator only because LF T is applied at the point of disposal on the landfill. Some waste delivery operators attempt to take advantage of this and whilst putting as many controls in place to capture any mis -coded waste streams, the waste delivery operators should be penalised alo ngside the landfill company. This may encourage more responsible behaviour if they believe that some of the fines may come back to them Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. There is a need for more EA or HMRC activity on all landfill operators not just the largest companies to make sure that the rules of the LFT are being applied in the same way on every site. Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? We have no comment on this point. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? Yes, we are aware of some sites and we have provided evidence to this effect. Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. From a purely administrative viewpoint, it would be advan tageous for businesses to be allowed to continue using non standard periods. Not allowing this will lead to a relatively small amount of additional time required to produce the return, but may cause significant work internally in terms of budgeting/reporti ng and managing cash flows. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? 418 All FCC weighbridges use the EWC numbers when booking in wastes to their facilities. This should be a requirement on every site. It will add a relatively small amount of time in producing the return. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electr onic and online support? We have no comment on this point. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? Debt relief is appropriate on all bad debt for the landfill operator. Whilst we take all ca re in the customers that attend the site, bad debts do occasional occur. The LFT currently stands at \u00a382.60/t, the gate fee for the landfill operator is between \u00a310 -20/t so the LFT element is between four and eight times more than the gate fee the operator can earn from the waste. The landfill industry cannot cover this debt risk on the small element of gate fee it is receiving. Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax con text, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? No view on this. Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? No view on this. Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Yes. The landfill communities fund has delivered significant benefit to the communities around the landfill sites that FCC operate in Wales. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of wa ste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities 419 - Other (please specify) Through the Wren fund, FCC would like to see the continuation of biodiversity and environmenta l improvements alongside investment in local community clubs, playgrounds, heritage sites, village halls etc. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? We have no comment on this point. Question 30: Do you have any r elated issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? No 420 Reference 122 Dear Sir/Madam Landfill Disposal Tax Consultation Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this consultation. The LARAC response is contained below. The responses below are sent on behalf of the Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee (LARAC). LARAC is an association of around 75% of local autho rities across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Members are waste management and recycling professionals who co -ordinate and operate waste management services. Membership is drawn from all types of authority including statutory Waste Collectio n (WCA), Waste Disposal (WDA) and Unitary Authorities. Our response has been peer reviewed by members of LARAC's policy team and executive committee. LARAC members have also been invited to comment on the consultation through the members' discussion foru m on our website. All contributions received have been taken into account in drafting the response below. LARAC generally supports the proposal within the consultation. LARAC does however believe that the opportunity needs to be taken to reduce the tax b urden on local authorities if welsh local authorities are to have the economic resources to achieve their statutory recycling targets. Yours faithfully, Lee Marshall LARAC Policy Team Responses to Consultation Questions 1.29 Revenues received are th e result of the tonnages landfilled and the rate of tax paid. For most of the last decade, a rapidly increasing standard tax rate outweighed the effect of falling tonnages of standard rate material being landfilled, and therefore revenues rose. Falling ton nages of standard rate material are illustrative of the success of Landfill Tax as a policy instrument. This trend can be clearly seen in Chart 1 below, which shows tonnage declared per quarter for the UK by the different tax rates. Question One: How imp ortant is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? 421 LARAC believes that where possible consistency across the UK is preferable. This assists those organisations that op erate in different parts of the UK and so creates more efficient operations. Any increases in operating costs will be passed onto customers, including local authorities, who are struggling with reduced public funding. Question Two: Are the current standa rd and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. As outlined in paragraph 1.29 of the consultation document the high levels of the tax have meant that despite increasing recycling lev els significantly, welsh local authorities are still incurring severe tax liabilities through the landfill tax. LARAC accepts that the high levels have played a part in diverting waste away from landfill and achieving environmental aims LARAC also believes that in the current economic climate there needs to be a mechanism that enables local authorities to reduce their landfill tax liabilities. One way in which this could be done is for a different rate of tax applied to local authority collected household waste. Question Three: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? LARAC understands the reasoning outlined in the consultation document for the Welsh Government to retain the ability to set different lower rates of tax and would broadly support it subject to further input from relevant stakeholders. Question Four Are t here any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? LARAC does not propose any changes to this list but reiterates the point that household waste collected by local authori ties should attract a lower level of landfill tax than the standard rate. Para 2.18 Others argue that fully enforcing EU Council Decision 2003/33/EC on waste acceptance criteria would help steer waste companies towards better separate collection (in order to achieve high quality recycling) and away from a mixed waste collection approach. Applying the waste acceptance criteria would most likely significantly reduce the amount of non-qualifying waste in a qualifying load. Question Five: What would be the p ractical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? LARAC agrees that there is a danger of encouraging perverse behaviours if absolute limits are defined for the threshold . However LARAC would want to see regulations implemented in a clear, simple and transparent way and so would welcome guidance that is clear as possible that does not encourage actions that go against the ideals of the tax systems and the environmental out comes it hopes to achieve. Question Six: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. LARAC would support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition test but woul d urge Welsh Government to balance the practicality and cost of the test with the outputs it is designed to achieve. Question Seven: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? 422 LARAC is not well placed to provide evidence on this question. There does appear to be merits in aligning elements of the tax system with the permitting system from a regulation and operational point of view, as long as this does create efficiencies. Question Eight: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? LARAC has no view on this question. Question Nine: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? LARAC is minded to support the view of taxing all material entering a landfill site. Question Ten: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? Any activities that are classed as exempt would need to be done so on the basis that the material was being moved further up th e waste hierarchy from disposal. LARAC believes exemptions would need to be clearly and simply outlined. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non-taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be t he practical implications of these? None at present. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. LARAC's view is that the question allows for exemptions for Pet cemeteries and NATO waste which seems a bit over -complicated so maybe exemptions should be kept to an absolute minimum. Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water disco unt relief? Please explain your response. LARAC would welcome any moves to simplify the tax process and also restrict the possibility for abuse of the system. Therefore LARAC believes there is a case for reviewing the current water discount relief system. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? As already highlighted LARAC believes there is a very strong case for introducing a relief for local authority collected ho usehold waste. Given that recycling targets for household waste are statutory the landfill tax is no longer a policy driver for local authorities, the avoidance of fines is. Therefore introducing a lower rate of tax for household waste will not cause a slowdown in recycling rates, in fact the opposite. The reduction will free up valuable funds to be re -assigned to increasing recycling collections services and communications to encourage the public to recycle more of their waste. LARAC believes that without this sort of release of funds to local authorities here is a danger that the 70% target may be economically out of reach. The reduced funding for councils 423 means that public services are being squeezed and it is becoming harder t o justify the increased spend on waste and recycling services to residents at the expense of other council services. LARAC would accept that relief may come with restrictions that funds are reinvested back into recycling services to ensure they are not u sed for no waste services. LARAC is not opposed to this concept. Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? LARAC supports to use of accurate data within the wider waste management operations and also in the tax system. Use of real data reduces the potential for loss of tax r eceipts. Use of a weighbridge will also improve waste data in general that will have benefits in other aspects of waste policy and operations. LARAC accepts there may need to be allowances made in certain situations but would suggest that in the interest o f clarity all landfill sites be required to operate a functioning weighbridge. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? LARAC wo uld support the introduction of measures that enable local authorities recover the full costs of dealing with fly tipping in their areas. Fly tipping is a large cost to local authorities and so a system similar to that introduced in Scotland is supported. LARAC would welcome a review of the implications of the Scottish system to enable Welsh Government to finesse it according to how it has operated in Scotland. Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? LARAC has no views on the current penalty regime at this moment in time. Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the b enefits where possible. The information outlined in the consultation document indicates that there is a need for increased compliance activity to act as a suitable deterrent to illegal activity. This does need to be positioned at a level than then does no t become onerous on well managed and legal operators or introduce burdens and costs that are then passed on to customers of landfill sites. Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve co mpliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? LARAC would welcome the allocation of suitable resources for regulators before and during the early stages of the chan ges in the tax regime to allow positive and meaningful engagement with those affected by the changes. These resources are likely to ensure greater compliance and so higher tax revenues and so should be seen as an investment that will generate returns. 424 Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? LARAC does not have evidence on this question to submit at present. Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return pe riod with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. LARAC would support this proposal if it was shown that there are efficiencies to be gained from doing so from site operators. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? Whilst there might be some initial administrative burdens in relation to this proposal LARAC believes there could be benefits and efficiencies to be gained by usin g the European Waste Catalogue codes. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? LARAC supports the use of electronic systems where possible. Where poss ible LARAC would advocate utilising existing systems rather than the introduction of new stand -alone systems. LARAC would suggest that the suitability of the EDOC system should be explored as part of this process. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be o ffered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? LARAC would support a move to a narrower system similar to the one that has been introduced in Scotland. Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? LARAC has no comments on this question at this moment in time. Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in whi ch taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? LARAC has no comments on this question at this moment in time. Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposal s Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? LARAC supports the concept of enhancing the wellbeing of communities that are potentially impacted by the operations of landfill sites. However the large amounts of funds that remain unspent illustrat e that the capacity for projects within a relatively small geographical area is ultimately limited. LARAC believes it is time for the funds available for communities to be reduced and funds used to achieve wider resource goals and Welsh Government recycl ing targets. Funds should be used to support local authority recycling services and general communications on waste minimisation and recycling to both households and businesses. 425 Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising t he impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) As highlighted above LARAC believes there is a finite amount of projects that communities can allocate funds to. Therefore it makes sense to allow a broadening of the project types that are eligible for funding. However LARAC restate the opinion above that funds for communities should be reduced to allow funds to be utilised in wider recycling objectives by local authorities and others. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? LARAC would only support a change in admini stration if it could be shown to more effective and efficient. Any administrative scheme will incur costs and any new proposed scheme will need to be measured against the costs and outcomes of the current arrangements before any change is proposed. LARAC w ould expect such an exercise to be undertake and the results to accompany any proposal to change the administrative arrangements. 426 Reference 123 Landfill Disposals Tax Consultation May 2015 For the purposes of this response, we have restricted our comments to the Community Wellbeing section of the consultation. QUESTION 27: SHOULD WELSH GOVERNMENT ALLOCATE A PROPORTION OF LANDFILL DISPOSALS TAX REVENUE TO ENHANCE THE WELLBEING OF COMMUNITIES? The Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) has been a great success and has left its mark on community life and the natural environment. We strongly support the use of taxes raised from environmentally damaging activities to support wildlife and community project s as a form of environmental and social justice. WEL strongly supports the continuation and enhancement of the LCF . Under Object DA, the LCF is one of the few remaining funding streams that maintains a direct interest in outcomes for wildlife. Indeed, aga inst the wider backgrounds of austerity and a funding community rarely focussed on nature conservation, this fund is increasingly essential to continue work to halt the continuing, and in some places, devastating, loss of wildlife in Wales. As is widely re ported in the groundbreaking State of Nature Report 1, we are in a state of major and continuing decline in wildlife, with 60% of the species in the UK having declined over recent decades. We have quantitative assessments of the population or distribution t rends of 3,148 species. Of these, 60% of species have declined over the last 50 years 31% have declined strongly more than one in ten of all the species in the UK are under threat of disappearing from our shores altogether The LCF has: allowed important habitats to be restored to help safeguard Wales's rich, but drastically declining, biodiversity provided healthy green spaces for people to enjoy and connect with nature supported volunteering and skills development opportunities for local co mmunities 1 The State of Nature Report http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/news/2013/05/22/state -nature -60- uk-speciesdecline - groundbreaking -study -finds LCF-funded wildlife projects also allow Wales to meet its key environmental objectives and legal obligations: 427 halting and reversing the loss of wildlife/biodiversity by 2050 (with interim targets for 2020) ensuring all statutory designated sites (such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and Special Areas for Conservation (SACs)) are in favourable condition by 2026 (with interim targets for 2015) This fund helps the charities to contribute to these government obligations. For example: Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales 's (WTSWW) Gwendraeth Grasslands Project restored and enhanced Carmel Nation al Nature Reserve (NNR) SAC and SSSI; Plantlife has undertaken work to conserve nationally and internationally important lichen communities on the Gower peninsular through the control of invasive species; Buglife has carried out detailed invertebrate s urveys and habitat management works on brownfield sites within Swansea and Neath Port Talbot to conserve and raise awareness of the importance of this habitat and the range of rare and endangered invertebrates that they support; Coed Cadw/The Woodland Tr ust has developed the woodland and visitor centre at Plas Power near Wrexham, reaching out to communities close to the site and ensuring that these woods are very much part of the local woodland culture now and for the future; and Butterfly Conservation 's restoration of Median Farm, Carmarthenshire: fencing and installation of water supply has allowed this important Marsh Fritillary butterfly site to be grazed for the first time in years. The LCF helps Natural Resources Wales (NRW) to fulfil the Welsh Gov ernment's statutory duties to restore sites of national and international importance such as the Carmarthenshire Dunes SAC. The fund has also been used to deliver significant improvements under the Water Framework and Habitats Directives in respect of improvements to riverine habitat, water quality and biodiversity. Withdrawing this fund would mean that the Welsh Government will lose a much -needed mechanism to reach its biodiversity targets and will cause further loss of biodiversity in Wales. The fund helps to support the Well Being Goals in the Well Being of Future Generations Act 2015 especially in creating A Resilient Wales - \"A nation which maintains and enhances a biodiverse natural environment with healthy functioning ecosystems that support socia l, economic and ecological resilience and the capacity to adapt to change (for example climate change)\". Finally, the LCF is one way that the Finance Ministry can discharge their statutory duties to conserve and enhance biodiversity under the Natural Envi ronment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006, especially in meeting the requirement to take account of biodiversity and more particularly to conserve species and habitats listed under section 42 of that Act. The LCF also contributes to a number of other W elsh Government duties and obligations, including poverty alleviation , improving health and wellbeing , creating jobs, developing and teaching skills , and adapting to climate change . 428 QUESTION 28: IF THE WELSH GOVERNMENT ALLOCATES A PROPORTION OF LANDFILL D ISPOSALS TAX REVENUE TO ENHANCE COMMUNITY WELLBEING, WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES SHOULD BENEFIT FROM FUNDING, AND WHY? WEL recommends that biodiversity conservation must be the priority area for any future funding from the LCF . The LCF is one of the few funding streams for 'pure' biodiversity projects. It has supported, and should continue and expand, this delivery. If funding from the LCF is reduced or removed, the Welsh Government will not achieve its biodiversity obligations and targets as outlined at the top of page two of this response. Biodiversity as a whole is significantly underfunded . This is a key factor in Wales failing to hit the 2010 target to halt the loss of biodiversity 3. However, as the fund is likely to decrease in Wales as the numb er of landfill sites reduces, we would like to see the fund increase from the current 5.7% diversion rate to being ring -fenced at a minimum of 10%. However, given the social and environmental benefits that biodiversity conservation projects bring, perhaps significantly more of the tax should be diverted towards biodiversity conservation in order to meet the Welsh Government biodiversity objectives. WEL supports the Welsh Government's strategic wider environmental objectives (including climate change mitigat ion and resilience) as well as compliance, waste minimisation and tackling poverty. However, WEL believes that these objectives can and should be delivered through mainstream government policy and public spending. This will ensure that more funds within th is scheme remain available to empower communities and deliver biodiversity projects. As mentioned above, biodiversity -centred projects still help tackle poverty and deprivation in communities, and have benefits for public health and climate change mitigat ion. QUESTION 29: DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THE POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE MODEL? Considering the number of landfill sites in Wales is reducing to 10, WEL recommends that there is one Distributive Environmental Body (DEB) in Wales - this will help cut down administration and therefore more money should be directed at good causes. It is worth noting that all regulation builds in costs. However, DEBs and charities demonstrate correct procedure by being registered companies and/or charities and are thus sub ject to regular audits. Setting up a duplicate process would add complexity and administrative burden to charities, which would mean less money for good causes. Current regulation for project funding eligibility states that projects must be 'in the vicinit y of a landfill site'. In practice, however, this has often been interpreted as 10 miles as the crow flies. This inflexibility disadvantages projects that just fall outside this area and, in the long - term, could mean an exhaustion of good projects in the 10 mile radius. As the consultation itself acknowledges on page 44, there are relatively few sources of funding for biodiversity. If funding for species and habitat conservation and management relies on their proximity to a decreasing number of landfill si tes (even if related operations were added) this means that many species and habitats will continue to decline. 429 WEL recommends that sites within an approximate 20 mile radius of any new or disused landfill site (e.g. have a fuzzy boundary) should be eligi ble initially. However, we ask that consideration also be given to removing the vicinity test in order to allow LCF funds to be spent where there is the greatest conservation need and therefore likelihood of success. We would also like to see the definit ion widened from 'landfill sites' to 'landfill sites and related activities (such as depots and transfer stations)'. It must be recognised that funds committed through a contract are not easy to spend within short timescales (e.g. the Welsh Government's Nature Fund). Indeed, it is vital for the success of conservation projects to have funders who can commit to funding long term projects (3 -5 years). Reducing the length of projects means increased administration costs for both applicants and the Distributive Environmental Body. Furthermore, most environmental projects need several seasons to be implemented and to carry o ut effective monitoring. It is also vital to recognise that there is a big difference between 'unspent' funds and funds retained by a DEB that are already allocated for multiple - year projects, released on a yearly basis. Therefore, WEL recommends that the fund must continue to allow multi -year projects. It should also be recognised that this fund helps to unlock significant match funding (independent funding organisations and volunteer hours). It is therefore important that the fund continues to fund proje cts by 90% - this could be increased to 100% funding . We would encourage the Welsh Government to take the opportunity to look at other avenues for 'green taxation' and how these might be used to fund the Welsh Government's statutory nature conservation ob ligations. WEL Recommendations Biodiversity conservation must be the priority area for any future funding from the LCF The LCF should be increased to 10% of the Landfill Disposal Tax There should be one Distributive Environmental Body (DEB) in Wale s There should be no duplicate process set up that would add complexity and administrative burden to DEBs and charities, which would mean less money for good causes Because of the likely contraction of the number of landfill sites, WEL would ultimately like to see the removal of the location criteria. In the immediate future the eligibility criteria should be within 20 miles of a landfill site or related activities Biodiversity projects should be judged against their compatibility with meeting the Aichi targets, contribution to the Wales Biodiversity Action Plan and conservation of species and habitats that are listed under section 42 of the NERC Act 2006 The definition should be widened from 'landfill sites' to 'landfill sites and related 430 activities ' (such as depots and transfer stations) The LCF should continue to fund projects by 90% or increased to 100%. The LCF fund must continue to allow multi -year projects to reduce administrative burdens for applicants and the DEB, and to ensure that effec tive long -term projects can be implemented and monitored Welsh Government should take the opportunity to look at other avenues for 'green taxation' and how these might be used to fund Welsh Government's statutory nature conservation obligations. Wales Environment Link (WEL) is a network of environm ental, countryside and heritage Non-Governmental Organisations in Wales, most of whom have an all - Wales remit. WEL is officially designated th e intermediary body between the government and the environmen tal NGO sector in Wales. Its vision is to increase the effectiveness of the environmental sector in its ability to protect and improve the environment through facilitating and articulatin g the voice of the sector. 431 Reference 124 Welsh Government Consultation on: Landfill Disposals Tax (Number: WG24170) Consultation Response Form Name: Jon Eastwood Organisation (if responding on behalf of that organisation): Conwy County Borough Council Landfill Disposals Tax Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? It is important to maintain a consistent approach in order to av oid any concerns regarding where it would make economic sense for businesses and organisations to cross borders with their waste. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Yes Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? It would provide flexibility in the future to retain an ability to set lower rates if economic or environmental conditions dictated, or if the UK/Scottish Government were to consider changing tax rates in order to avoid any negative impact for Wales. Land fill Disposals Tax Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? No Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? It would be difficult to establish the quantity/weight of non -qualifying material coming through the gate as mixed waste if a threshold were to be defined, 432 therefore if any threshold is considered, it may have to be relatively low in order to deter qualifying material being purposely mixed with non -qualifying waste to reduce landfill tax. This may encourage the waste industry to separately collect material to be recycled . Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. Yes in principle - however clear guidelines and practicality would require to be considered further in ter ms of how often samples would be carried out and how it would be carried out. Landfill Disposals Tax Question 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? We do not operate a landfill site and act as clients, however it is envisaged that landfill sites would encounter operational challenges associated with creating a tipping area near existing weighbridges. Infrastructure development would req uire time to be planned and financed over a sufficient period of time. Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? --- Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? This may encourage resource recovery as a more e conomic option. ndfill Disposals Tax Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? There could be a debate if all material entering a site is taxable, should any bi - product be gained from operational activities (methane gas, metal extracted from 'mining' landfills) be taxed in full? It would be difficult to consider for current and closed landfill sites. 433 Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activiti es on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? No Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. No Landfill Disposals Tax Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. --- Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? --- Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a correspondi ng penalty for failure to do so? It would be rational that site operators would use a weighbridge where one is functional and available. Clarification would be required regarding definition of 'close proximity' with respect of using another sites weighbri dge. Landfill Disposals Tax Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? It may discourage illegal tipping of waste. Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how 434 might they be addressed? --- Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. It is assumed that increased inspection visits on the ground would act as a greater deterrent than desk -based regulation. Landfill Disposals Tax Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? --- Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? Not aware of any evidence. Chapter 4: Administration Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. It would be pra ctical to align tax return period in line with NRW Site Returns period Landfill Disposals Tax Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? It would be practical to use EWC codes for completion of tax returns as they are completed as part of waste transfer note and site returns in any case, therefore it could be used to cross -reference and audit waste movements. 435 Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? We do not operate a landfill site. Agree that it may not be economically practicable to develop an online returns solution based on the relativ ely low number of landfill operators. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? --- Landfill Disposals Tax Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and ap peals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? --- Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Dis posals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? --- Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Yes Landfill Disposals Tax Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising th e impact of waste Crime Yes, as Local Authorities/NRW dispose of collected fly -tipping and must pay landfill costs that should have been paid by the waste producer. - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill Yes - in particula r for communications campaigns aimed at businesses and producers of industrial waste that can assist with resource recovery and waste minimisation. 436 - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements Yes - it would be good to specifically promo te biodiversity initiatives and environmental improvement areas within areas in close proximity to landfill sites. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities Yes - agree that training opportunities and educational programmes should remain part of th e LCF. - Other (please specify) Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? In agreement that careful consideration will need to be given to the options of retaining existing features of the LCF including a tax credit elemen t, opportunities for landfill site operators to demonstrate their social corporate responsibility and match funding.

In relation to LDT, this translates into h ow to adopt legislation that supports Wales's zero -waste agenda while at the same time recognising the needs of operators who will not want major systems change. 1.5 Nevertheless it must be recognised that change will occur because there are going to be t hree landfill tax systems operating across the current territory of the UK. The question that arises is what changes should take place at inception of the Welsh system and what changes can conveniently be postponed to a later date. 2 Executive summary 2.1 We take the view that if LDT is to fulfil its role as a fiscal measure designed to encourage good behaviour and penalise poor behaviours, then it needs to be levied on what is actually discarded into landfill, not simply what enters the site. Specific exe mptions for site usage may be preferable to the current system. The tax structure needs to encourage recycling and re -use. 2.2 It is not only what goes into the ground that should influence the rate of tax but the extent of the damage caused by the waste. This may argue for more differential rates. 2.3 In designing Welsh LDT, we agree that there may be areas where it will be preferable to maintain consistency with England and Scotland. However, there are opportunities to modernise administration and make Welsh LDT operate more efficiently. The key issue is to minimise the administrative 438 burden for operators with activities throughout the UK and not seek to introduce changes where they are not warranted. 2.4 The creation of the Welsh equivalent of the Land fill Communities Fund should ensure that it is used to fund activities that further the development of waste reduction objectives. 3 Chapter 2: Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals 3.1 Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? 3.2 Although there are a limited number of landfill sites in Wales, one of the issues with a separate tax for Wales is likely to be any increased cost of compliance. Existing registered Welsh operators would face system changes, and those having sites across the UK would potentially have to deal with 3 totally different systems. Definitions and procedures should, where possible, be harmonised. 3.3 Adopting a system th at aligns closely with that of the rest of the UK is a pragmatic approach that also recognises the risk of waste tourism where disposals may be diverted across borders to a more generous tax regime. 3.4 Thus, while there may be pragmatic reasons for adopti ng legislation that is substantially similar to that of the legislation in the rest of the UK, we do not think that the legislation or the manner in which it is implemented needs to be identical especially where it may compromise the objectives of the tax such as Wales' Zero Waste Plan. 3.5 Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. 3.6 Whilst we do not comment on rates as such, we note that the EU legislation on waste contains several categories of waste ranging from inert waste through to highly toxic waste. We consider it anomalous that waste that is not inert but has relatively low impact on the environment should be taxed at the same level as more toxic waste. Although multiple rates have a bearing on the compliance cost, on balance we can see a case for rates that are aligned with the categories of waste contained in Council Decision 2033/33. 3.7 Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Gover nment having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? 3.8 We would welcome provision that would allow for the setting of additional differential rates to reflect the relative damage caused by different types of waste. Under the current UK rates structure there is a considerable difference between the rate that is applied to inert matter and other waste despite the fact that some of the other waste may create minimal environmental cost. While we do not co mment on rates as such it is appropriate to point out that this structure does not seem to fit with the objectives of the tax. 3.9 We remain of the view that tax rates should reflect the degree of damage caused by particular types of waste, its impact on the possible future reuse of 439 land used for landfill and the ability to recycle it. In this connection, we have previously noted that because EU environmental regulations already provide for the collection of extensive data about the nature and quantities o f waste, a system of rates linked to records that already have to be maintained should be the ultimate aim of the tax. 3.10 Q uestion 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considere d, and on what basis? 3.11 W e set out above comments regarding the alignment of rate bands with the EU assessment of waste categories. This is emphasised by the existing Landfill Tax (Qualifying Materials) Order 2011 not requiring waste to be inert to qua lify for lower rating, and, under the published treasury criteria for lower rating qualification, not all wastes that may qualify as inert are listed in the Order. We are of the view that the tax position should as far as possible mirror the requirements o f environmental legislation. However comments at question 1 above regarding divergence from tax rates applied in England are also applicable here. 3.12 Q uestion 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? 3.13 As pointed out in the consultation document the existing concept of a 'small quantity' is ambiguous and left open to interpretation. A specific qualification parameter would provide c ertainty for taxpayers but great care would be needed in wording of law and guidance to prevent misinterpretation and support a consistent approach. 3.14 Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill T ax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. 3.15 The current UK LoI testing regime only applies to materials arising from mechanical treatment plants. Potentially this could be extended over time to other mixes of qualifying materials where provenance is uncertain. We do also have some concerns over the sampling basis required and how HMRC will monitor and test compliance. However the existing LoI rules are in their early stages and at this point we consider that a similar Welsh provision would at least ma intain consistency with the rest of the UK, thereby reducing compliance costs and risk of waste tourism. 3.16 Q uestion 7: Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? 3.17 W e consider the option to restrict the taxable area to that identified within the site permit as having merit. This would enable further connection between tax and environmental law as well as simplifying the application of principles established by existing case law eg exclusion of permanent site engineering works from the tax. 3.18 Q uestion 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landf ill site and if so, how might these be addressed? 440 3.19 Th e current credit arrangements appear to be satisfactory, however developments in the sector may lead to the economic viability of recovering usable materials from previous landfill disposals. Extens ion of the credit rules to cover such extraction would encourage such recycling and re -use. 3.20 Q uestion 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifi cally exempt) is subject to tax? 3.21 W e are of the view that what should be taxed is not what enters the site but what ultimately is actually discarded by way of landfill. The purpose of the tax is in part to reflect the cost of use of scarce or limited resources (land) in the price of products. A tax based on actual use should help ensure that this is done. A tax based on what enters the site is likely to tax waste that may be recycled, acting as a potential additional cost to recycling and missing an opportunity to incentivise good behaviour. 3.22 Ho wever it may be possible to sensibly deal with use of material on site by taxing all material entering the site (and see 3.18 above) and the setting of specific exclusions or exemptions to relieve desirable activities. 3.23 Q uestion 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? 3.24 As well as the existing exemptions we consider that various on -site engineering and other activities should also be exempt in line with the principles set by existing case law. This wold include areas such as permanent engineering and capping activities. Aligned to a revised definition of site this would assist in removal of contentious areas within the existing law that have led to a plethora of litigation over recent years. In addition we would like to see tax exemption for site restoration work by the environmental agencies and local authorities that may arise from work to clear and restore sites as a result of illegal dumping or the insolve ncy of a landfill site operator. 3.25 Q uestion 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? 3.26 Th e Scottish and English legislation on prescribed activities seeks to address the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of HMRC v Waste Recycling Group [2008] EWCA Civ 849. In England, this was believed to be a temporary measure pending review and overhaul of the existing l egislation. Nevertheless it remains in place and the lack of guidance on interpretation has led to ongoing difficulty for site operators and indeed ongoing litigation over the scope of the order. In our view, the use of materials should be considered in li ght of the precedent case law (see Q9 and 10). 3.27 Q uestion 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. 3.28 It may be pragmatic to start with the same current exemptions as England and Scotland but to provide for a mechanism to add or remove exemptions when appropriate. This is subject to the principle that exemptions should not be removed if they are necessary to the environmental objectives of the tax. 441 3.29 Q uestion 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. 3.30 W e consider that to fully achieve the Welsh Government's zero -waste objectives, what should be taxed is not the quantity of waste but the extent to which land th at could be better used is taken out of normal activity to dispose of waste. 3.31 Th is view suggests that a more appropriate tax base might be volume rather than weight. We recognise the pragmatic reasons why weight has been chosen to measure the tax base but in light of our view that it is the impact of waste that needs to be taxed, we have some difficulty in seeing why water, subject to conditions, should not be discounted. 3.32 Fo r example, it may be the case that some waste cannot be transported on its own and has to be transported in a liquid. Since water may significantly increase the weight of waste entering a site even though it is eventually removed, we do not think it is appropriate to remove an accepted means of measuring the actual waste that i s sent to landfill. We would accept that this should be provided that the water is subsequently removed in an acceptable way, ie complies with environmental regulations. 3.33 Q uestion 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? 3.34 An y new exemptions or reliefs run the risk of compliance costs and waste tourism. Nevertheless there may be materials for which the Welsh Government wishes to encourage clearance by consideration of e xemption eg relaxing existing exemption qualifying requirements for waste materials remaining from the mining industrial heritage. 4 Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement 4.1 Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? 4.2 Comments made in the LDT session at the meeting of the Welsh Government Tax Forum on 24 April suggested that all of the currently authorised landfill sites already have weighbridges. If that is the case, practical implications would only arise in the event of such a weighbridge being temporarily out of order. 4.3 In order to assess the practical implications of such an obligation, it would be necessary to establish the proximity and opening hours of alternative weighbridges and the impact on neighbourhoods of the journeys that might be involved. 4.4 Considerati on might be made to the introduction of a reporting requirement whenever a weighbridge was out of use for more than a limited period of time. That report could be shared electronically with the regular users of the particular landfill site so that they cou ld make appropriate alternative arrangements - for example by driving straight to the alternative weighbridge rather than having to be re -routed upon arrival at the site. 4.5 However, whilst it is desirable to use a weighbridge where feasible, we consider that adoption of the existing UK alternative measurement provisions should be considered for situations where weighbridge use is not available. 442 4.6 Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? 4.7 We are concerned that this could blur the distinction between the taxation of lawful activity and the application of criminal sanctions for unlawful activity. The interfaces between LDT, en forcement orders and criminal sanctions need to be properly thought through and regulated in order to avoid the extremes of either inadequate or excessive sanction and to ensure joined -up thinking that delivers the related but diverse objectives of LDT and the criminal law in respect of waste. To take an example, we think that it would be much more appropriate to apply criminal sanctions to unauthorised landfill activities than to apply LDT and related penalties as if there had simply been a failure to regi ster the site and comply with the taxation obligations. We do, however, appreciate that it might well be administratively simpler and more efficient to levy LDT and related civil penalties than to achieve a successful criminal prosecution. The risk of doub le taxation would, however, need to be addressed. As a matter of principle, if the user is required to remove all the waste from the unauthorised site to a licensed site, it is difficult to see why they should be taxed as if they had disposed of it twice. That does not, however, mean that the criminal sanctions that they incur for the unauthorised activity should be any less than at least what they would have incurred as LDT and any related civil penalty. If an illegal disposal resulted in the offender bei ng identified then if LDT were to be levied against them it may be simpler to require the offender to pay all the disposal charges (including LFT) levied by the site operator when the waste is moved to a licenced site. Either that or if the tax is charged directly to the offender as part of the penalty measures, then the relevant material would be exempt from further LDT when finally disposed. This is to prevent double taxation. It would also seem appropriate, as is the case in Scotland, that where illegal disposals are not identified to a particular offender and necessarily cleared to landfill by local authorities or other agencies, such material would be regarded as exempt from LDT when moved to a licenced site. 4.8 Question 17: Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? 4.9 The CIOT's Management of Taxes Committee has recently commented on HMRC Penalties: a discussion document sent to HMRC -policy/publicsubmissions/ 2015/HMRC_penalties_discussion_document ). 4.10 Q uestion 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. 4.11 LD T will be based around the site operations and accordingly we consider it important that the tax authorities, or other agencies that may be involved, are aware of and understand the requirements and operation of landfill sites to be able to effectively administer the tax. 443 4.12 Q uestion 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actio ns could be? 4.13 W e have no comment at this time. 4.14 Q uestion 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? 4.15 W e have no comment at this time. 5 Chapter 4: Administration 5.1 Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. 5.2 Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? 5.3 Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? 5.4 We have not commented on questions 21 -23 because it is felt that site operators would be better placed to comment. 5.5 Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? 5.6 We agree with the principle of offering bad debt relief and believe it should be available for non -payment of the debt rather than because the debt is regarded as irrecoverable ('written off'). The current UK 12 month nonpayment criteria is not consistent with VAT provisions (6 months). As both taxes are likely to be charged on the same invoice consideration should be given to aligning LDT requirements with VAT. 5.7 Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review o r appeal? 5.8 Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? 5.9 We have no comments regarding questions 25 and 26. Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing 6.1 Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? 6.2 The application of monies received from taxation is not strictly speaking a tax 444 issue. If it is proposed to create a Welsh equivalent of the Landfill Communities Fund, then we believe that consideration should be given to ensuring that it is used to fund activities that further development of waste reduction objectives and that administ ration costs should be minimised subject to the there being sufficient control to ensure that funds directed at projects are used as intended. 6.3 Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? 6.4 This concerns how monies received are applied and is not strictly a tax issue. However, in general we agree that given the purpose of the tax, the fund should be applied to further prevention of waste, recycling and reuse. 6.5 Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? 6.6 We have no comment. 6.7 Additional Questions Question 30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? 6.7 No 6.9 Question 31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? 6.10 No 7 The Chartered Institute of Taxation 7.1 The Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) i s the leading professional body in the United Kingdom concerned solely with taxation. The CIOT is an educational charity, promoting education and study of the administration and practice of taxation. One of our key aims is to work for a better, more efficient, tax system for all affected by it - taxpayers, their advisers and the authorities. The CIOT's work covers all aspects of taxation, including direct and indirect taxes and duties. Through our Low Incomes Tax Reform Group (LITRG), the CIOT has a p articular focus on improving the tax system, including tax credits and benefits, for the unrepresented taxpayer. The CIOT draws on our members' experience in private practice, commerce and industry, government and academia to improve tax administration and propose and explain how tax policy objectives can most effectively be achieved. We also link to, and draw on, similar leading professional tax bodies in other countries. The CIOT's comments and recommendations on tax issues are made in line with our chari table objectives: we are politically neutral in our work. The CIOT's 16,500 members have the practising title of 'Chartered Tax Adviser' and the designatory letters 'CTA', to represent the leading tax qualification. 445 Reference 126 446 447 448 449 Reference 127 Please find the Hanson UK LFT consultation response below. If you have any queries please feel free to contact me. Consultation Response Form Organisation Hanson UK About Hanson UK Hanson UK is a leading supplier of heavy building materials to the construction industry. We produce aggregates (crushed rock, sand and gravel), cement and cement -related materials. Our basic raw materials are used to make added value products: Crushed rock and sand is mixed with bitumen to make asphalt for road surfacing Sand, gravel and limestone is mixed with cement to make ready -mixed concrete Aggregates and cement are put into handy sized bags for selling through builders' merchan ts and DIY stores Our principal markets are the major conurbations in England and Wales and the central belt of Scotland. We have no production operations in Northern Ireland. Turnover for the UK business in 2014 was \u00a31.2 billion and we employ around 3,50 0 people in jobs ranging from specialist and professional managers through to production operatives. The location of our quarries is determined by a number of factors, not least geology and planning constraints. Where practical, our production sites are located close to core markets to reduce the costs and impact of transport. We operate a series of depots and wharves, supplied by road, rail and sea, to ensure the efficient transfer of aggregates and cement to areas of greatest demand and where local mater ials are not readily available. We operate a fleet of more than 1,200 vehicles to deliver our products, including 850 tippers and mixers operated by independent owner -drivers under a franchise agreement. We also have a fleet of four locomotives and 140 wa gons operated by our joint venture rail freight business Mendip Rail. Our diverse customer base includes public sector works, major infrastructure projects, local building and civil engineering contracts and DIY projects. We are part of the HeidelbergCeme nt Group, one of the largest building materials manufacturers in the world, the global market leader in aggregates which also has leading positions in cement, concrete and other downstream activities. The Group employs around 45,000 people at 2,300 locatio ns in 40 countries. 450 Our UK headquarters is in Maidenhead. Consultation response Please note that we have only responded to specific consultation questions which are relevant to our business. General comments Hanson UK is not a commercial LFT operator, h owever it is impacted by LFT regime and administrative compliance. We currently benefit from LFT exemptions and have a number of policies and procedures in place to ensure that these exemption conditions are adhered to at all times. We support that these e xemptions, or substantially similar exemptions, remain in place. If there is a risk that these exemptions are to be removed we would like to become more involved in the consultation process. We note that we currently do not deposit any exempt or taxable waste in our landfill sites in Wales. In certain circumstances certain owned land such as disused quarries etc are leased to commercial LFT operators (who are responsible for the LFT liability and compliance obligations). Subject to improvements commented on below it is important to maintain consistency with the UK regime in terms of structure and the basic rules in order to avoid a significant increase in the tax compliance burden, and different operating process and instruction for a UK wide bus inesses operating in Wales and England. Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? It would be extremely helpful to align EWC codes with the curre nt qualifying material list for ease of administration and compliance. The current UK system does not practically work - see previous UK LFT consultations and responses on this topic) Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? See previous UK LFT consultations and responses on this topic. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Land fill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. Due to the increased administration, Hanson UK commercial policy is not to accept fines. If the compliance obligation is reduced we may reconsider the position. 451 Question 9: What would be the practical im plications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? This would have a severe environmental and industry consequence as quarry restoration may not be economicall y viable. Question 10: What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? We would expect that, subject to certain conditions being met, that mining and quarrying waste, and filing of quarries, to be exempt. If these activities became taxable, it would cause a significant negative impact on the general environment and industry business in areas such as commercial quarrying exploitation and restoration activities. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clar ify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? Follow EWC codes (see question 4) Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please expla in your response. As per question 10, we would not want the removal of, or material negative change (eg increasing compliance burden) to the mining and quarrying waste, and filing of quarries, exemptions. Question 15: What would be the practical implicati ons of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? Weighbridges should not be com pulsory - this would create significant capex spend which would make non -commercial landfill sites unviable. Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. We would support aligning the tax return period to a single annual return for low level or exempt deposits as a practical step to reduce the current administrative burden. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? It would be extremely helpful to align EWC codes with the current qualifying material list (see question 4). Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns inclu ding improving electronic and online support? 452 We would support the ability to filed returns via email and for the return to be competed electronically as we agree that this should save time and reduce error. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? As UK system Ian Cotterrell Senior Tax & Treasury Manager 453 Reference 128 Hallo, Whilst I realise that you have to find an almost impossible amount of money from SOMEWHERE, I would beg you to allow the Wildlife Trusts to continue to benefit from the landfill tax so that they can continue to work their small miracles with welsh wildlife - as the old saying goes man (and for that matte r woman too) cannot live by bread alone. With best wishes from M Sadler 454 Reference 129 I understand that the Welsh Govt is thinking of removing this vital source of funding for environmental projects, and keeping the money for its main budget. This would be disastrous for organisations like the six Wildlife Trusts in Wales, which do so much good work using Landfill Tax funding. A year or two ago we were hearing a lot about The State of Nature Report, and how important it is to reverse biodiversity losses. How can environmental NGOs do their bit if they can't get funding? We have access to plenty of volunteers, but they are powerless without funding to pay for staff time, planning, tools, safety equipment etc. R G Gibbs 455 Reference 130 We wish to see the continuation of income generated from the Landfill Tax for use by the Landfill Community Fund. This fund, one of the few specifically designed for biodiversity and the local environment, has been shown to significantly benefit wildlife in Wales. For example, the deprived area of Blaenau Gwent has been enriched by the building of an Environmental Resource Centre at Ebbw Vale, where I was brought up, and the local community is now able to join in a wide variety of studies and activities for all ages, leading to a greater appreciation of the diverse nature to be found in a previously heavily industri alised place. What a marvellous opportunity for local people, and those from further afield, and what an important part of the regeneration of Ebbw Vale. And in Monmouthshire, where we now live, projects such as the re - introduction of water voles at Magor Marsh, and meadow management at Pentwyn Farm and Great Traston have also been made possible through this fund. Only last week we were privileged to have a sighting of the rare water vole at Magor Marsh during an evening visit. The success of these schemes has made such a difference to communities and their enjoyment of their environment. As more and more scientific evidence is proving the importance of nature to everyone's health and wellbeing, please do not stop this great scheme. However well inte ntioned the new proposals may be, once monies are absorbed in a central fund without strict ring -fencing they will never have the impact they could and should have. The present system works extremely well - please do not change it. K Oliver and B Udpa 456 Reference 131 Although not wanting to make any specific responses to the questions raised in the consultation I would ask that the following general comments be considered. As an industry we are always concerned that when Welsh Government look to change UK legislation to be specific to Wales that it will result in development being made more difficult or less attractive in Wales. With this in mind we would also request that any changes in costs do not financially disadvantage Welsh compan ies or development in Wales. Although it is accepted that Wales is devolving there is and always will be cross boundary development, resources and supply chain issues.

There is considerable added value to money allocated to charitable organisations as much of the activity is undertaken by volunteers who have a precise knowledge of the specific needs. The linking of a landfill tax to direct community benefit is an important feature of generating public support for the tax and its objective of reducing landfill. Q28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime. - Supporting waste minim isation and the diversion of waste from landfill. - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements. - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities. - Other (please specify).: Initiatives to increase biodiversity and improve the environme nt are positive measures which benefit a wide sector of Wales. There is increasing recognition of the health benefits gained from a healthy environment. Gwent Wildlife Trust has benefited large sectors of the population of Gwent both by providing an opport unity for volunteers to experience nature at first hand and by protecting and caring for attractive wildlife habitats which people can visit. Removal of this source of revenue would have a severely detrimental effect on the ability of Welsh Wildlife Trusts and other environmental organisations which have an uncertain funding base to deliver their considerable benefits. Compliance and enforcement issues should be a matter of the law, not funded by this tax. Tackling poverty is altogether too vague an issue f or specific linkage to landfill tax. Q29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model?: Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make?: Q31: Do you have a ny comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment?: Responses to consultations may be made public - online or in a report. If you would prefer your response to be kept anonymous please tick the box:: (Unchecked) 460 Reference 133 Developing a Landfill Disposals Tax Consultation Response About: Gwent Wildlife Trust (GWT) was established in 1963 and is a registered charity. It is a member of the largest voluntary organisation concerned with all aspects of the protection and enhancement of our na tural heritage - the Wildlife Trusts Partnership. With over 10,000 members, GWT aims to protect and enhance the wildlife of Gwent, and encourage public enjoyment and awareness of local wildlife for all with its vision of an environment rich in wildlife for everyone. We work to inspire people about the natural world and to encourage individual action for wildlife. Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Gwent Wi ldlife Trust agrees that a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax should be allocated to enhance the wellbeing of communities. We also advocate that not only should the specific focus of the fund remain on biodiversity delivery, but that a higher percentage of tax returns should be diverted towards this scheme (e.g. currently the LCF is funded by 5.7% of the Landfill Disposals Tax, we recommend that it is increased to 10%). Projects that are enabled through the Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) contribute sign ificantly to Welsh environmental objectives such as halting biodiversity loss, ensuring favourable condition for SSSIs, SACs and SPAs, creating resilient ecosystems and providing accessible natural greenspace. LCF projects deliver an enormous quantity of added benefits. On a broad scale, biodiversity delivers ecosystem services that positively affect our health and wellbeing. Individual projects provide jobs, training opportunities for the unemployed, volunteering opportunities, community resources, educat ional facilities and much more. For example, Veolia funded a restoration and enhancement project at Gwent Wildlife Trust's Great Traston Meadows nature reserve, where much of the work was carried out by a substance misuse support group - giving them skills and much needed confidence. Whilst there are concerns regarding unspent funds and high administrative costs, we believe that these can be addressed through monitoring and regulation. As a recipient of LCF funding, we have strict reporting schedules and claims procedures to ensure tha t money is spent where it's most needed. It is also important to note that there is a difference between unspent funding, and funding that is allocated, but held for release at certain stages of a long term project. And whilst excessive administrative cost s are to be avoided, it is 461 important to recognise that administrative support is essential - for office space and IT, and supervision and management of staff. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? Gwent Wildlife Trust supports funding for biodiversity initiatives, and would not like to see this diluted by broader objectives. In the current econom ic climate, as a charity we are finding it ever more difficult to fund our work, our members cannot afford to be as generous, and there is increased competition for fewer grants. Natural Resources Wales is facing funding cuts. Lack of funding was identifie d as a key factor in Wales' failure to meet the 2010 target to halt biodiversity loss. The Landfill Communities Fund is one of very few that grants are specifically dedicated to biodiversity. At a time when our wildlife is in crisis, there needs to be fu nding allocated to protecting our ecosystems. As already stated, LCF projects bring social and economic benefits in addition to their environmental focus. Areas with high biodiversity and natural green spaces are associated with better physical and mental health, stronger sense of place and community and even higher house prices. Question 29 : Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? Gwent Wildlife Trust supports the use of Distributive Environmental Bodies, as these have the expert ise to support applicants and are regulated by being registered companies. We would support a relaxation of the eligibility criteria from within 10 miles of a landfill site, to within approximately 20 miles of a landfill site or site for other waste relat ed activities (such as waste transfer stations). More projects would be able to benefit, as the current restriction runs the risk of exhausting the provision of projects in closer proximity. Good grants schemes, in our experience: Take a long -term approac h, recognising that certain activities are seasonal, and that environmental change is slow - 3 to 5 year projects are more valuable tools for environmental work than 1 year projects Support the continuation of existing successful projects, as well as new initiatives Work with existing plans, frameworks and partnerships, such as LBAPs 462 Are flexible, both in their decision making and in terms of managing grants Provide for reasonable administrative and management costs Accept applications on a continual cycle, or fix their application and decision schedules well in advance, allowing applicants to plan accordingly Require strict, but not onerous, reporting, against clear objectives Sorrel Jones, Conservation Officer Ian Rappel, CEO Gwent Wildlife Trust 463 Reference 134 Neath Port Talbot Council for Voluntary Service (Neath Port Talbot CVS) Neath Port Talbot CVS is the County Voluntary Council and a Charitable Company set up to promote, support and develop the Third Sector in Neath Port Talbot. It has over 500 member organisations and is in touch with over 1,000 Third Sector organisations ope rating in Neath Port Talbot covering various communities of interest, public services and geographical communities (from small local groups covering smaller wards and deprived communities to large national organisations). Some are wholly volunteer -led and run, and others employ a workforce. All of these organisations have an impact on local government and Welsh Government agendas, and we recognise the value and contribution of the sector in meeting the future challenges of the Programme for Government. As an infrastructure organisation, our role in supporting the development of communities and building community resilience is clear. We provide capacity building, support and guidance to third sector organisations, helping them to develop, plan for growth and sustainability, to deliver services, opportunities and activities that positively impact on, and improve outcomes for, citizens and service users. We also have an important role in engagement and representation. Our aim is to promote the development of a local third sector that is effective and efficient, informed and influential; a sector which is able to improve and achieve positive outcomes for local people. The organisation has strong partnership links locally and regionally and works in a number of strategic areas, such as Health, Education and Learning, Regeneration, and Children and Young People. As part of this work and its key representative function, Neath Port Talbot CVS facilitates a range of third sector forums and networks, which engage the sector in Neath Port Talbot in order to gather the views of the sector and to feed these views into key decision -makers and delivery partners. The organisation also promotes a range of messages to its staff and to the wider community through its newsle tters, website and social media. Neath Port Talbot CVS has made this consultation document available on its website and through its general information services. Neath Port Talbot CVS welcomes the paper and some of the ideas and key features presented; the direction of travel outlined in the document is positive. The Community Wellbeing chapter is of most relevance to us and the sector. Many organisations in Neath Port Talbot have a nd continue to benefit from LCF funding. The current process can be confusing with different operators 464 using different Environmental Bodies and in turn there are significant differences between application forms and processes. We would welcome a more sta ndardised process for Wales, it is also very concerning that significant sums of money are currently being held by these bodies that should be spent in communities. The current objectives are fairly specific, it would be helpful if these could be broade ned, as currently some organisations with good projects are excluded from applying. Welsh Government should continue to allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities. If Welsh Government allocates a pr oportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing it should support the following two priorities as minimum: Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements Whatev er administrative model is favoured we would welcome further consultation on this model. When deciding on the administrative model it is key that the requirements on organisations that are wishing to apply for these funds are clearly outlined at an early stage. Carys Miles Community Capacity Building Officer Neath Port Talbot Council Voluntary Service Cyngor Nedd Port Talbot 465 Reference 135 CORY ENVIRONMENTAL Landfill Disposal Tax Consultation Thank you for your invitation to take part in the consultation on the Landfill Disposals Tax and for the careful consideration you have shown in the process to date. We very much appreciate your pragmatic approach in wanting to improve upon the system curr ently in place, yet not making unnecessary changes. As one of the UK's leading resource management, recycling and energy recovery companies, Cory Environmental is experienced at working with businesses and local authorities to provide cost effective waste management solutions. Whether it is through reuse, recycling or energy recovery, our tailor made solutions coupled with the dedication of our 1400 staff in the UK, help us understand the legislative framework and make the most of waste as a resource. This year our Chief Executive Officer, Peter Gerstrom is the Chairman of the Environmental Services Association (ESA), the trade association for the waste management industry in the UK and this gives a wider industry perspective on policy, legislation and mar ket trends. Our comments are based on our experience of providing a tax -collecting service for HMRC and our specific knowledge of landfill and wider waste management operations across the UK. Cory operates two landfill sites in Wales, Hafod Landfill near W rexham and Tir John in Swansea, both of which are permitted to accept a range of inert materials and non - hazardous waste and will continue to play a part in the implementation of the Landfill Disposals Tax. Tax Rates and Taxable Disposals We consider there to be merit in the inclusion of a middle rate band specifically to accommodate fines containing more than 10% LOI arising from waste treatment facilities. Our experience of implementation of the LOI testing regime to differentiate between inactive an d active waste is positive, however there is evidence that wastes subject to the testing can give results of either markedly less than 10% LOI or in a range 20 -30% . The mid -range could be defined as >10% LOI and <30% LOI. Our view is that a mid -range tax rate would have the benefit of capturing the higher range organic content of these fines without the imposition of a heavy penalty on the waste treatment operators that produce them. A mid -466 range tax could assist in supporting the local waste treatment an d recycling facilities in Wales and at the same time provide local landfill sites with a material suitable as a waste cover material. We note from our involvement in discussions with the Welsh Government that concern has been expressed about the potential for differences in the tax regime between England and Wales to distort markets and create waste tourism. We consider that the risk of this type of waste being be attracted into Wales as the result of the introduction of a mid -range tax bracket to be ver y low because of the small number of significant producers of MRF fines in England and the distances between them and potential receiving landfill sites in Wales (There are only 7 MRF's in NW and 3 in SW England licensed to accept>25Ktpa waste and loc ated within 25 miles as the crow flies to the nearest landfill sites in Wales ) and mid to long term commercial and intra -company agreements tying certain producers to specific outlets ( eg MRF output from 5 plants in Manchester are contracted to EfW at Ineos and NES in Avonmouth to its own EfW) In conclusion we consider that the introduction of a mid -range tax band would provide valuable support to the waste treatment sector in Wales enabling it to manage materials in the Welsh economy, continue to provide local jobs in the waste industry and play an increasing role in the Welsh Government's Towards Zero Waste Strategy. We note that raising the lower band of landfill tax is under consideration. We do not support the raising of the tax rate for inactive w aste. Inactive wastes play an important role in the operation of landfill sites to high standards of environmental control as daily cover and in sub -cap waste layers to form a stable platform for the installation of the landfill cap. Across Cory landfill sites between 2013 and 2014 we recorded a reduction of 11.7% in the quantity of inactive waste received, a notable reduction given the apparent upturn in construction industry activity and before the introduction of the latest inflation -linked increase in the tax to \u00a32.60. We support the use of the LOI test to differentiate between the tax classifications. The test is relatively quick, easy and inexpensive and reduces grounds for dispute. The guidance from HMRC for its implementation was rather late in its issue and a little unwieldy, but the use of the test itself gives much needed clarity. Compliance and Enforcement 467 We support the proposal for the requirement for all waste to be weighed immediately prior to landfill by a weights and measures compliant weighbridge. If a weighbridge is not available on site it would be fair and reasonable to expect a public or other compliant weighbridge to be used. The benefits to enforcement and to the equable treatment of all landfill operators far exceed an y potential slight inconvenience to a very small minority. We support the levy of a sum equivalent to the landfill tax charge at the standard rate against waste producers carrying out the illegal deposit of waste on land. The introduction would serve as a suitable punishment for those choosing the wholesale disregard of environmental and public health protection and attempted evasion of tax and would serve as deterrent to others. We would not expect the change significantly to affect small scale fly-tipping activity which because of its small scale, disparate nature and low return on effort invested in enforcement is likely to continue in some measure. We support the use of revenue raised from landfill tax in NRW's and Welsh Government's enforcement of waste crime. We would expect the close working relationship of the two bodies to provide an effective combination of recording and monitoring which should release funds for additional personnel to enforce against large scale illegal waste activities and to target enforcement at fly -tipping hotspots. Administration We agree that a simple electronic return in a spreadsheet format would work well. It could easily accommodate records of tax categories linked to EWC codes. Where a given waste code relates to differ ent tax categories then these can readily be recorded. A return frequency and timing to coincide with the NRW waste returns would be straightforward to implement and would assist in effective monitoring and enforcement. We support the proposal for retenti on of debt relief. Our experience has shown that no matter how strict the credit control system or how diligently it is implemented, there is always a proportion of customers who fail to pay promptly for a wide variety of reasons. We consider it would be inappropriate and unfair for the landfill operator whose role is simply to provide a tax collection service to the tax raising body to be penalised for a failing of the waste producers. Consistent with the Welsh Government's aim to streamline and reduce adm inistration where possible, we would suggest that landfill disposals tax debt relief becomes operative within 6 months in line with VAT debt relief. 468 We welcome the Welsh Government's collaborative approach to the development of the Landfill Disposals Tax and its stated intention to put in place a system designed to be effective and to avoid disputes. We would expect the outcomes of current disputes with HMRC to inform, shape and add clarity to the drafting of the Landfill Disposals Tax in Wales. Community Wellbeing Cory is active in its support of the Landfill Communities Fund and has been a vehicle for the distribution of \u00a3Ms to thousands of projects in communities in close proximity to landfill sites. The current arrangements not only distribute money, bu t also help to forge links in communities between the waste industry operators and the communities in which they work. The community cohesion aspect is important and is something that should be retained in any alternative model the Welsh Government adopts. If the Welsh Government considers widening the range of qualifying criteria to include waste recovery projects and tackling poverty then the percentage of funding contribution may need to be adjusted to meet additional demand. Closing Comments We note tha t the legislation is planned to be introduced in Wales in April 2018 and that there is an aspiration of zero waste to landfill by 2025. The lead in time will therefore serve as a useful monitoring period during which the Welsh Government can work with HMRC and landfill operators to refine its projections of likely income from the tax and if necessary modify its regulations accordingly. We trust that our comments in this response will be helpful in your development and drafting of the legislation and look f orward to further discussions as you work towards implementation of the legislation in 2018. Yours sincerely Jenny Doyle Senior Project Manager 469 Reference 136 MPA submission to Welsh Assembly Government \"Consultation on Landfill Disposals Tax\" Thank you for informing the Minerals Products Association of the WAG Consultation on landfill disposals tax. The Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, dimension stone, lime, mortar and s ilica sand industries. With the recent addition of The British Precast Concrete Federation (BPCF) and the British Association of Reinforcement (BAR), it has a growing membership of 450 companies and is the sectoral voice for mineral products. MPA membershi p is made up of the vast majority of independent SME companies throughout the UK, as well as the 9 major international and global companies. It covers 100% of GB cement production, 90% of aggregates production and 95% of asphalt and ready -mixed concrete pr oduction and 70% of precast concrete production. Each year the industry supplies \u00a39 billion of materials and services to the \u00a3120 billion construction and other sectors. Industry production represents the largest materials flow in the UK economy and is als o one of the largest manufacturing sectors. MPA supports the initial scope of the consultation and the creation of a Landfill Disposal Tax in Wales. Current Exemptions from Landfill Tax The majority of our members' sites are restored under a landfill permit. This activity is currently exempt from tax by the Landfill Tax (Site Restoration and Quarries) Order 1999 (SI 1999/2075) - A. Qualifying material used for the purposes of restoring to use a landfill site or part of a landfill site - provided for b y the insertion of a new Section 43C into the Finance Act 1996; B. Qualifying material used for the purpose of filling new, existing or former quarries - provided for by the insertion of a new Section 44A into the Finance Act 1996. At present the materia l used in these exemptions is listed in the Landfill Tax (Qualifying Material) Order 1996 (SI 1996/ 1528) and reflects the list of material accepted in an inert landfill site. Prior to the exemptions operators were unable to secure suitable wastes in adequate quantities to achieve the restoration objectives. This led to operators being unable to fulfil the planning conditions and so new extractions could not begin. The net res ult was recognised by Government, regulators and industry alike as being detrimental to the principals of sustainable development and good environmental practice. Consequently, exemptions from landfill tax were 470 introduced in late 1998 to address the short comings of originally enacted regulations. We are aware that both the exemptions and the qualifying list could be amended through the consultation process resulting in unintended constraints in the industry's ability to beneficially restore mineral operat ions. Restoration Process At the end of the working life of a quarry it must be restored in accordance with the agreed planning conditions. It is frequently a requirement of planning conditions that quarries are restored on a progressive basis, so that r estoration takes place on part of the quarry while extraction continues elsewhere in the quarry. In these circumstances an inability to source inert materials for the progressive restoration would mean that planning conditions were not being adhered to and therefore prevent the operation of the quarry. To restore a quarry an operator will either apply for a environmental permit for deposit of waste for recovery through the Environmental Permitting Regime or a disposal permit through the Landfill Tax regime . Depending on the individual case the site will either be determined as recovery or disposal by the appropriate authority. Currently we believe that approximately 10 -15million tonne of inert material is used quarry restoration. If this material was ch arged at the inert rate it would be very costly to the industry. Considering this, without the current exemption from landfill tax our members would not be able to restore their sites, therefore, breaching planning conditions and putting the supply of agg regates to the market at risk. The exemptions were provided for environmental advantages. There are no adverse impacts from restoring quarries in this manner, and in all cases the environmental credentials of the site is improved after restoration. It is inevitable that much of this restoration work will require the use of inert materials. Questions 1. How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? As the m ajority of Welsh landfills are located near to the border, it would make sense that some sort of consistency is maintained between landfill rates. The reasons for this include ensuring consistency and anti -competitive practices with waste being disposed i n the cheapest country. 2. Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. No comment 3. Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? 471 No comment 4. Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? No comment 5. What would be the practical impl ications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? A percentage of a total load could be used to define \"a small quantity\". 6. Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. We would consider that it would be beneficial to observe the introduction of the LOI test in England first and then consider the introduction of a Welsh LOI test. 7. Are there any problems with the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? No comment 8. In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material per manently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? No comment 9. What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subj ect to tax? A minerals site is progressively restored and may be done so with a number of permits in place, such as a permit for the management and deposit of Mining Waste, a landfill permit and perhaps a permit for the permanent deposit of waste for recov ery. Conflict may arise between these permits where the activity is within the same vicinity, depending on what is classified as the \"landfill site\". Obviously, tax should not be payable on waste deposited for recovery purposes or mining waste. 10. What activities would you expect to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? 11. Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non-taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? 472 12. Do you think that any of the current exemptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. We have explained the reasoning and need for the exemption for quarry restoration to remain in our opening statement - we would welcome further discussions on t his and the general way in which quarries are restored. 13. Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. No comment 14. Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, wh at should they be and why? No, we can not think of any new exemptions which should be introduced. 15. What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of the site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? We agree with the introduction of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where there is one available to the site. 16. What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? No comment 17. Are there any issues with the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? No comment 18. Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk-based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. No comment 19. Are there any further actions the Welsh Government migh t take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? No comment 20. In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? 473 No comment 21. Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. No comment 22. What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? No comment 23. How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? No comment 24. Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? No comment 25. Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or appeal? No comment 26. In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? No comment 27. Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disp osals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? We would consider it beneficial to local communities for a proportion of LDT revenue to be allocated to them. 28. If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Supporting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements 474 - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify) No Comment 29. Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? No comment I hope that you will consider our comments carefully. Please do let me know if I can be of further assistance. Yours sincerely, Nicola Owen Environment and Waste Policy Executive Mineral Products Association 475 Reference 137 Glandr Cymru - the Canal & River Trust in Wales 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 Reference 138 Dear Sir or Madam Tax Devolution in Wales - Landfill Disposals Tax We welcome the opportunity to comment on the proposed replacement in Wales from April 2018 of Landfill Tax (LFT) by a new tax to be called Landfill Disposals Tax (LDT). Generally we consider that the introduction of a new landfill tax to replace that in operation in England presents the Welsh Government with an opportunity to address and improve some aspects of what has become an increasingly complex tax. However, the potential for 'waste tourism' to impact upon the level and nature of waste material being placed in Welsh landfill sites will make wholesale changes to the tax high risk. Our responses to specific questions are set out in the Appendix. Yours faithfully Daniel Lyons Mike Trotman Tax Policy Group Deloitte LLP 487 Chapter 2: Tax rates an d taxable disposals Question 1: How important is it that the Welsh Government maintains consistency with the UK Government and Scottish Government on Landfill Tax rates and why? We believe that consistency with the Landfill Tax rates in England particularl y will help minimise 'waste tourism' where waste producers and waste operators move material between tax regimes in order to reduce tax costs. While we recognise that transport costs would also be a significant disincentive to bulk movement of waste materi al, landfill capacity in Wales is mostly located near the England/Wales border so the cost of transport may not significantly deter waste tourism if the LDT rates are substantially different from those in England. Question 2: Are the current standard and lower tax rates (explained in paragraph 2.2) set at an appropriate level for Wales? Please explain your response. Through the Landfill Tax escalator the differential between the standard and lower rates of tax has increased from \u00a35 per tonne when Landfill Tax was introduced on 1 October 1996 to \u00a380 per tonne on 1 April 2015. This policy has been widely held as the primary reason for encouraging investment in alternative waste treatment. In both England and Scotland the tax rates are set to increase in line with inflation (RPI) until at least 2019 -20 suggesting that both Governments take the view that further encouragement to invest in alternative technologies is no longer required. We see no reason to believe that the nature of the waste industry in Wales o r the nature of waste itself is significantly different from that in either England or Scotland such that it demands different LDT rates - for the foreseeable future. We are also mindful of the fact that the waste industry in the UK is dominated by relatively few waste operators with operations in all parts of the UK. Introducing rates that differ from England (in particular) will serve to hinder administration and management of the tax by these operators and in doing so increase the risk of non - complianc e. Question 3: Is there value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different lower rates of tax (explained in paragraph 2.10 - 2.11) and why? In spite of our response to question 2 we believe that the Welsh Government should have the powers to vary rates independently of those in England or Wales in order to react to possible future changes in the waste environment in Wales. The need to vary rates may come about for a variety of reasons including: developments in treatment technology; discov ery that some waste materials have greater potential to pollute than previously believed; changing revenue requirements of the Welsh Government, and; changes to rates applied in England and Scotland. The Welsh Government must have powers to enable it to react quickly to these and other incentives to change rates. Disposals Tax Question 4: Are there any changes to the list of materials qualifying for the lower tax rate (Appendix 1) that should be considered, and on what basis? 488 Power to vary the availabili ty and application of a lower rate of tax is important if the Welsh Government is to deliver its overall policy intent with regard to waste management. For landfill tax the criteria that HMRC is required to consider when determining whether material qualif ies for the lower rate may have resulted in the lower rate being applied according to the nature and source of the material only and has failed to recognise that some potentially hazardous or polluting material may be better received at a licensed landfill for treatment than fly -tipped or deposited in unregulated sites. Where the standard rate of tax is a particular disincentive to harmful waste being taken to landfill, the policy intent of the Welsh Government may be better achieved if bringing such materi al to landfill (for treatment prior to deposit in the void) is encouraged by the application of a lower rate. We recognise that the qualifying criteria for the lower rate in England is already very complicated and difficult to administer, so the introduct ion of further criteria in pursuit of the objective outlined above would add to this complexity. Also, as with many other aspects of LDT, the potential for waste tourism would have to be seriously considered before any significant variations to the tax in England and Scotland are introduced in Wales. Question 5: What would be the practical implications of introducing a threshold to define 'a small quantity' of non -qualifying waste in a load of qualifying material? For Landfill Tax whether the amount of no n-qualifying material is a 'small quantity' is a decision that must be taken on a load by load basis. HMRC has not been prescriptive about how this should be assessed so the test applied by site operators has been subjective, often comprising a visual exam ination of each load as it passes the weighbridge and/or when it is deposited at the working face of the landfill site. It seems to us that introducing a specific threshold of non -qualifying material that could be ignored - such as 10% - would only provid e additional certainty if the test of this threshold is also more formal. We suspect that it would be impractical and expensive for site operators to weigh the qualifying and non -qualifying elements of each load, but in the absence of doing so the test wou ld remain subjective. Question 6: Would you support the introduction of a Welsh Loss on Ignition (LoI) test when Landfill Tax is devolved? Please explain your reasons. The advantage of the test is that it would allow a more informed decision to be taken about whether fines qualify for the lower rate. However, we recognise that the test will introduce an additional administrative burden to the industry and to any revenue authority required to monitor its application. x Question 7: Are there any problems w ith the existing arrangements for defining the area in which a taxable disposal takes place, and if so, how might these be resolved? We believe that the administration of the tax is best served if its calculation is integrated with the other systems used by operators to manage their activities on site. In our experience site operators have billing systems that are linked with weighbridg e operations and which calculate tax values at the same point. Changing the definition of the taxable area to be more closely aligned with definitions in 489 environmental permits may aid compliance testing but the change in the tax point that would accompany it may demand a substantial IT systems upgrade. Question 8: In your view, are there any issues with the current arrangements for credit for landfill material permanently removed from a landfill site and if so, how might these be addressed? Current arrang ements require that HMRC must be notified of the intention to remove material for re -use before it is deposited in landfill. Also credit is available only where the material is removed with one year of being deposited (five years if water had been added to the material before being discarded). It seems to us that such a restrictive regime may dissuade operators from recycling material where its useable qualities are unknown when it was discarded to landfill but become known at a later date - perhaps becaus e of technical developments in the recycling industry. We understand that any tax credit must be closely monitored to prevent abuse and the HMRC's regime currently requires the claimant to have evidence of the weight of material removed, the use to which it was put and the date of that use. All of these proofs are available to the operator only after the material has been removed from the landfill. As the evidence supporting entitlement to the credit is available only after removal and in light of our view that pre -notification of removal is a disincentive, we feel that the policy intention might be better served if credit is more readily available with a less restrictive regime where operators are allowed to seek credit wit hout having notified HMRC before depositing the material. Question 9: What would be the practical implications of legislating on the basis that all material entering a landfill site (other than that which is specifically exempt) is subject to tax? We bel ieve that it would be difficult to maintain that the tax is wholly focussed on environmental objectives if non -waste items such as plant and machinery are brought within the scope of the tax. Also, unlike where waste material is taken from customers, opera tors may be unable to directly charge on the tax they incur on site equipment taken onto the landfill site. Such a measure may have an impact on the support required from the waste sector. Landfill Disposals Tax Question 10: What activities would you expec t to be exempt (not subject to tax) and why? The basic concept of a landfill tax is to increase the cost of waste incurred by the producer of that waste and incentivise the diversion of waste to other more environmentally friendly uses. Recycling and reus e is likely to take place before material reaches landfill so tax exemptions for any landfill tax should be limited. Question 11: Do you have any other suggestions for how we might clarify the taxable and non -taxable activities on a landfill site and what would be the practical implications of these? 490 Case law has led to further clarification of what is meant by 'waste' in the context of landfill operations. HMRC has necessarily had to try to differentiate between material which occupies a landfill for ope rational purposes and material that has no long -term use on the landfill and is destined to become part of the landfill proper in the near future. In our view it is very difficult and not entirely desirable to try to make this determination by reference to the intention of the original waste producer or of the site operator, so an operational definition along the lines of that followed by HMRC may be the only practical and enforceable option available. Question 12: Do you think that any of the current exe mptions should be removed or modified? Please explain your response. There are few exemptions currently and they appear to be quite narrowly defined. It is important that the Welsh Government has powers to manage the application of these exemptions and to introduce new exemptions where doing so would help meet the Welsh Government's aims. Landfill Disposals Tax Question 13: Is there a case for removing or modifying the water discount relief? Please explain your response. As detailed in the consultation document, the banning of liquid waste going to landfill by the EU Landfill Directive should have the effect of generally reducing the moisture content of waste going to landfill. However, it remains the case that some waste processes and some forms of waste transport necessarily result in increased water content in the waste materials produced or transported. Also we believe it could be seen as inequitable if different loads of similar waste material attract significantly different levels of tax as a consequence of different treatment or transport solutions. Question 14: Do you think there is a case for introducing any new exemptions or reliefs, and if so, what should they be and why? We see no case for introducing new exem ptions or reliefs at this stage. Doing so could have the effect of encouraging waste tourism. However the Welsh Government should have powers to do so in future to react to developments in technology and changes in the waste treatment industry generally. Chapter 3: Compliance and Enforcement Question 15: What would be the practical implications of placing an obligation on landfill site operators to use a weighbridge where one is functional and available on the landfill site or within close proximity of t he site, with a corresponding penalty for failure to do so? Operators should be encouraged to adopt methods and technologies to accurately assess the weight of material they place in landfill. We understand that this is a requirement of other regulations, permits and planning permission too. Where an operator can reasonably use a weighbridge then they should be encouraged to do so, however, introducing penalties for not doing so would introduce further complexities in the management of the tax and may achi eve little improvement in compliance. Where operators understate the weight of material taken to landfill and 491 under declare tax as a consequence, there are already powers to assess for that undeclared tax and to impose penalties and interest. Question 16: What would be the practical implications of extending the definition of landfill sites to include illegal deposits of waste within the scope of the tax? The strategy pursued by the Scottish Government of extending the definition of a landfill site to inc lude any location in Scotland where an unauthorised disposal is made is a novel approach to the problem of fly -tipping and illegal disposals. It sends a clear message that fly -tipping and illegal waste disposal will be treated very seriously and we endorse that view. However, for this activity to be subjected to the tax (twice) it remains the case that those involved with this illegal or unregulated activity must first be identified. We understand that the Welsh Government and local authorities are active ly addressing this situation and it may be the case that the threat of imposing tax on the disposed material will have a deterrent effect, but we are less sure that any revenue will actually be raised by this measure. Question 17: Are there any issues wit h the current penalty regime and if so, how might they be addressed? We believe that the penalty regime in operation for landfill tax is fairly robust and should be adopted. Question 18: Is there a need for increased compliance activity on the ground, rather than desk -based? If yes, please explain your view and provide evidence/explain the benefits where possible. It is a characteristic of landfill tax that the key decisions concerning liability and value are very difficult to verify once taxable material is deposited in the landfill void. Often physical examination of material for tax compliance purposes can only take place during the short period of time between depositing the material at the working face and the covering of that material by more waste. We understand that site visits by HMRC have had some success in identifying under declared tax but the cost of such an exercise and the fact that it is very difficult to extrapolate findings beyond the deposits examined suggest that this approach s hould be used on a limited, targeted basis. Landfill Disposals Tax Question 19: Are there any further actions the Welsh Government might take to use its new tax powers to improve compliance and enforcement and minimise the impact of Landfill Disposals Tax evasion? If yes, please describe what those actions could be? We make no suggestions in this area. Question 20: In your view, is there evidence of tax avoidance within the existing Landfill Tax, and what is the nature of this? We make no suggestions in this area. 492 Chapter 4: Administration Question 21: Would you support aligning the tax return period with the financial year? Please explain your reasons. We support measures that simplify financial reporting procedures for taxpayers. Other indirect taxes including VAT allow taxpayers to adopt tax periods that better fit with their management and financial reporting timetables, enabling them to make more efficient use of systems and resources and in doing so minimise risk of error. We would support si milar flexibility for LDT. Question 22: What would be the practical implications of making it a requirement that European Waste Catalogue codes are used in completion of the tax return? We understand that operators may have a duty to use EWC codes to cla ssify waste streams but the process of correlating this data with LDT data may be time consuming and expensive. While there may be benefits in aligning LDT with EWC codes it seems to us that this would be a very substantial change in the design of the tax and should therefore be considered only after detailed examination. Question 23: How might the Welsh Government simplify and modernise the filing of tax returns including improving electronic and online support? We support the simplification of filing ta x returns through improving online availability and support. A paper facility should continue to be made available. Question 24: Should bad debt relief be offered and if so, in what circumstances is it appropriate? Arguably the availability of a reasonable bad debt relief regime aids compliance of operators concerned about the ability of carriers or waste producers to pay disposal fees. Compared to other indirect taxes - particularly VAT where the debt needs to be only 6 months old to qualify for relief - a waiting period of 12 months is more restrictive. However, unlike VAT where relief claimed by a supplier is usually matched by a corresponding tax adjustment by his customer, LDT bad debt relief is funded entirely by HMRC until or unless the operator's customer makes a late payment. We support the continued availability of bad debt relief for LDT and recognise the case for introducing a requirement that the operator's customer must be formally insolvent before the operator can claim the relief. Landfill Disposals Tax Question 25: Have you any comments on the operation of the current internal reviews and appeals provisions in a Landfill Tax context, including in particular the people eligible to seek a review or app eal? We make no suggestions in this area. 493 Question 26: In your view, are there any exceptional circumstances in which taxpayers might be able to postpone payment of Landfill Disposals Tax until the conclusion of their appeal? We believe that where a taxpayer has suffered hardship and is able to provide acceptable evidence of hardship then there should be provision for a dispute to be heard without the tax having to be paid. Where an operator has received payment from the customer of disputed tax then it may be much more difficult to establish and support a case for hardship. Chapter 5: Community Wellbeing Question 27: Should Welsh Government allocate a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance the wellbeing of communities? Continuing the practice of recycling some landfill tax revenues into environmental projects is wholly justifiable for an environmental tax. However the complexity of the process to make these funds available without risk of abuse and the reduced level of funds that w ill be available through LDT present challenges. Question 28: If the Welsh Government allocates a proportion of Landfill Disposals Tax revenue to enhance community wellbeing, which of the following activities should benefit from funding, and why? - Suppor ting compliance and enforcement and minimising the impact of waste crime - Supporting waste minimisation and the diversion of waste from landfill - Biodiversity initiatives and wider environmental improvements - Tackling poverty and deprivation in communities - Other (please specify ) We make no suggestions in this area. Question 29: Do you have any thoughts on the possible administrative model? We make no suggestions in this area. Additional questions Q30: Do you have any related issues which we have not specifically addressed or other comments that you would like to make? We provide no further comments at this stage but would be happy to comment further as proposals progress. Q31: Do you have any comments on the initial Regulatory Impact Assessment? We have no comment on this area. 494 Reference 139 I understand that the WAG plans to use funds from Landfill Tax to supplement general funds instead of giving it to local wildlife groups, as they do at present. This leaves me incensed. Local groups in my area of North east Wales (Wrexham) have achieved so much through hard work and enthusiasm and deserve your support, not disengagement. This comes on the day that UK protection of wildlife sites has been recogn ised by the EU as being \"poor.\" I would welcome an explanation. Yours faithfully G Gittins 495 Reference 140 eiddoch yn gywir, H James 496 Reference 141 The key issues to consider here are: a) Are there good reasons to vary the landfill tax rates levied in Wales from those planned to be levied in England? b) What costs are there from there being different rates of tax? I address (briefly) (a) in my response to question 2, below. In regards to (b), the main issue is the scope for behavioural response. As recognised in paragraph 2.7, differences in tax rates could lead to 'waste to urism'. For instance, lower rates in Wales than England could lead to increases in the amount of landfill being transferred from England to Wales. On the one hand, this could mean the lower taxes \"pay for themselves\" through the additional revenues associa ted with higher landfill volumes. On the other, it would mean more waste being placed in landfill in Wales (and the resulting environmental damage). The converse would be true if rates were higher in Wales. Variations in either direction could mean additio nal pollution associated with longer journeys to landfill. The scale of this behavioural response will indeed be linked to haulage costs - which should be analysed. 2) As I understand it, the rates of tax were initially set with reference to the local externalities associated with landfill. The lower rate has not kept pace with inflation. The standard rate has increased by a factor of more than 10 (from \u00a37 to \u00a380 per ton ne), to far beyond the cost of local externalities, and indeed, estimates of total externalities (including CO2). The initial rationale for the tax seems to have been abandoned, with it now being used to (a) generate revenue and more importantly (b) as per haps the main policy instrument to incentivise a shift from landfill to recycling (and, as a side -effect, to waste -to-energy and other incineration) in order to meet EU directives. There does not seem to be good economic -environmental reasons to set the standard rate of tax at such high levels. But reducing rates substantially would involve revenue cost; could cause 'waste tourism' to Wales, and could undermine the strategy for incre asing recycling to which the Welsh and UK governments are committed to as part of the EU (although the EU directives are not that sensible!). So while there seems little justification for the existing standard rate, reducing it to levels more appropriate g iven the level of externalities involved would have real practical challenges. 3) There is obvious value in the Welsh Government having the ability to set different rates for different sub -classes of waste through secondary legislation as this would pro vide flexibility in policymaking. This would need to be traded off against the requirement for legislative oversight. 28) As mentioned at the meeting on landfill tax, I think one needs to think what the purpose of any community/charitable funding is: 497 a) Is it to help local communities affected by the local externalities of landfill? In which case some type of fund which can be used at the discretion of local community groups for a range of activities would seem appropriate. It is the local community facin g the cost, so they should decide how to spend the \"compensation\". b) Is it to fund wider initiatives across Wales? In which case some sort of thematic approach - e.g. the environment, waste crime, etc may make sense from a political economy perspective. Hope this is at least a little helpful (although mostly obvious stuff!), cheers, David 498 Annex A Wildlife Trusts Wales Letter Tax Policy and Legislation Division 2nd Floor East Welsh Government Cathays Park Cardiff CF10 3NQ Dear Welsh Government's consultation to the Landfill Disposals Tax I support the use of Landfill Community Fund (LCF) to fund charities such as the Wildlife Trusts in Wales to undertake essent ial projects to protect and enhance Wales' most important habitats and species. This fund is needed to try to reverse the terrible loss of wildlife including 60% of UK species being in decline and more than 1 in 10 species in the UK being under threat of extinction. The LCF is one of the very few funding streams that support projects with primary benefits for wildlife. However, these projects also produce direct benefits for communities who live with the adverse environmental impact caused by landfill sit es. These projects help to inspire individuals and communities to connect with nature. They also provide opportunities for people to volunteer enabling them to learn new skills whilst improving their health and wellbeing. The wildlife projects funded by LC F will help Welsh Government to meet its key environment objectives and legal obligations including: halting and reversing the loss of wildlife by 2020 ensuring all of our most important, and protected, sites in Wales are in favourable condition by 2026 Without the LCF, Welsh Government will lose one of the few mechanisms it has to reach these biodiversity targets. Therefore, I urge the Welsh Government to maintain this funding and also to increase the percentage of landfill tax that goes to funding wi ldlife projects to 10%.
