Pexels Right now, all the COVID-19 vaccines we have approved for use carry a good efficacy rate and immune profile. Pexels The mutations in the virus, for example, can surpass vaccine-generated antibodies, and also make them less effective in real-world settings. Pexels It is also rumoured that some vaccines may become less effective, or need booster shots if we face more variants in the coming future. Pexels We compare the efficacy rates of different vaccines available right now Pexels Covaxin has been found to be well-effective and has neutralizing antibodies against the Delta variant.As per the latest observations from phase II and III studies, the vaccine is 77.8% efficacious against symptomatic COVID risk. Pexels Covishield is currently the most administered vaccine in India, and extensively used abroad.While one dose of the vaccine offers limited immunity, data suggests that a prolonged vaccine gap suits it well, and carries an efficacy rate of 63.9%.The vaccine also mounts a stronger antibody count against variants. Pexels Pfizer is one of the most sought-after vaccines globally and expected to arrive in India soon.As per clinical trials, the vaccine is 60-70% efficacious against variants, while antibodies produced are lower than usual.It has also been found to be 88% effective against symptomatic illness. Pexels The mRNA vaccine make carries over 90% efficacy and is said to well-neutralize the Delta variant of the virus.Unlike other vaccines, it elicits a strong antibody response across all age groups.
