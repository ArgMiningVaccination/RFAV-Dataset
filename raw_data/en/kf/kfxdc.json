But with the help of chiropractic, you can be better prepared to naturally fight back. It all starts with boosting the immune system. Our body's immune system is directly linked to the nervous system. These systems communicate with each other to create optimal responses for the body to adapt and heal appropriately. When these systems aren't properly functioning, it can lead to a poorly coordinated immune system. When spinal misalignments (known as subluxations) occur, they can seriously disrupt the nervous system; we touched on some of the effects of spinal stress in our recent post [\"The Power Of Posture\"](/summit-chiropractic-center-1/the-power-of-posture). Immune Function & Subluxations So how do misalignments in the spine affect the immune system? To truly understand the impact of these disruptions it is first important to understand how interconnected the nervous and immune systems actually are. To put it simply: the nervous system is responsible for regulating the appropriate immune responses in your body. When the nervous system isn't functioning properly, your body struggles to maintain it's immunity. The immune system can quickly become weakened leaving the body more susceptible to infections and diseases ( [Disease Models & Mechanisms 2010](https://dmm.biologists.org/content/3/11-12/721)). The basis of chiropractic adjustments is to correct any spinal misalignments that could be irritating or stressing the nervous system. When corrected, the nervous system is able to function properly and keep the rest of the body in check... including the immune system. Boost Your Immune System During the cold and flu season, it becomes even more important to make sure that you are doing what you need to do to stay healthy. Regular chiropractic adjustments can be a great addition to your wellness routine because it helps give your body the natural boost that it needs to maintain good health year-round.
