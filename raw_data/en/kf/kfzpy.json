GOLDEN, MD The ongoing accomplishments of your University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) have been incredibly impressive. We are making wonderful progress toward our vision of advancing the health of people and populations in Wisconsin and beyond. While it is appropriate to view the school as a whole in this regard, we know that all institutional successes rely on individuals who advance a shared vision. In the feature story, you will read about several heroes\u2014a sampling of the countless faculty and staff members who have made an enormous impact in the war against COVID-19. Through their selfless actions, they have made vital contributions at the SMPH and UW-Madison, as well as in the regional, state and national arenas. Collectively, they have helped save lives and protect communities from even greater devastation from this horrible pandemic. You also will read about several faculty members who have received prestigious UW-Madison honors, including endowed professorships. The heroes in this case include those who earned the awards, as well as the many supporters who make this kind of recognition possible.I deeply appreciate the wonderful contributions of the Wisconsin Medical Alumni Association's (WMAA) president and board members, who donate their time and expertise to their alma mater. They provide wisdom and guidance to not only the WMAA, but by extension to the SMPH. In this issue of Quarterly , we introduce four new board members and the new president, Kyla Lee, MD '98, FACP\u2014who, for decades, has been a leader in training our medical students at Gundersen Health System, the home of our school's Western Academic Campus. Dr. Lee also has worked tirelessly to help plan and implement the ForWard Curriculum there. Several representatives of the WMAA joined SMPH leaders as we welcomed our newest cohort of medical students. At this group's White Coat Ceremony in August, we also recognized the amazing students, faculty members and a resident who were inducted into our chapter of the Gold Humanism Honor Society (GHHS). These individuals serve as highly visible role models and heroes for the incoming medical students and for the entire school community. (See coverage of the White Coat Ceremony on page 10 and the GHHS induction on page 34.) In separate articles, we highlight the compelling stories of an alumnus and a first-year medical student\u2014 Rom Stevens, Mar\u00eda Cecilia Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez, respectively\u2014whose personal journeys illustrate their dedication to serving others and advancing the Wisconsin Idea. Their stories exemplify our school's bedrock principles, which include fostering diversity and inclusivity and providing care for people and populations in great need. There is a \"golden opportunity\" for potential new SMPH heroes. We recently launched the first-ever joint capital campaign in partnership with our academic health system, UW Health. The Wisconsin Medicine\u2014The Future Needs Us Now campaign focuses on developing resources that will accelerate our progress in four major areas: medical research, education, patient care and health equity. We have set an ambitious, challenging goal: raising $500 million by the end of the campaign (2025) to support our vision of changing the future of medicine. In the article on page 12, you will see examples of the many ways to support this historic campaign. I write these reflections while enjoying the beautiful, brilliant display of colorful leaves outside my office window. I know that the future of this glorious institution is also beautiful, thanks to the brilliant faculty, staff, students, alumni and supporters who advance our shared vision and missions. On, Wisconsin! Robert N. Golden, MD Dean, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health Vice Chancellor for Medical Affairs, UW-Madison3 QUARTERLYIn August 2022, members of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health's (SMPH) incoming class of medical students brought renewed energy to the Health Sciences Learning Center. The Wisconsin Medical Alumni Association (WMAA) welcomed these 176 highly accomplished medical students with our Stethoscope Ceremony and Badger Cookout. We asked them to reflect on those who supported them on their journeys to becoming medical students and write brief notes of gratitude to some of those individuals. We added alumni to their lists of supporters as we presented each new student with a stethoscope. They were so grateful for the gift and the tangible way alumni reach back to encourage them. Thank you to everyone who donated one or more stethoscopes. As we prepare to share our new WMAA Strategic Plan, we are already implementing exciting new programs. There are myriad ways to get involved, including volunteering for one of our virtual alumni career panels, attending an event or joining the Student Alumni Partnership Program (SAPP). In September, we hosted gatherings for students in Green Bay, La Crosse and Milwaukee and launched information to equip alumni who have student loans. The WMAA also held a hybrid event at which Patrick McBride, MD '80, MPH, discussed the importance of mentors in his life, as detailed in his recent book, The Luckiest Boy in the World . This fall, during our first in-person Homecoming Weekend since 2019, we will celebrate several class reunions (see dates on inside cover) and showcase student organizations that are supported by the Office of Multicultural Affairs so alumni can learn from the students about their impactful work. Whether one of these events will be your first opportunity to reunite with classmates or a long-awaited 50-year reunion, we are rolling out that big, red carpet. Kyla Lee, MD '98, the new WMAA president, will be here to greet guests. An exceptional educator and leader, Dr. Lee directs medical student programs at Gundersen Health System/Western Academic Campus. My team is excited to work with her to fulfill our ambitious goals for the WMAA. We also thank Mark Fenlon, MD '84 (PG '87), for his unflappable leadership of the WMAA during his term as president. The WMAA Board of Directors and our team are here to serve you\u2014our alumni\u2014 and the SMPH. We want to celebrate your news in the Class Notes section of Quarterly , and if you have welcomed a new addition to your family, we will send your little physician- in-training a \"white coat\" bib. If you have ideas, questions or concerns, please contact me at sbrothschild@wisc.edu or the address on the back cover. I welcome the opportunity to connect with alumni. I would like to close with a message of gratitude. It is not possible to call out all alumni who have supported the school in recent months, but here are a few examples. Bret Bostwick, MD '11, Shannon Dean, MD '02 (PG '05, '08), Dial Hewlett, MD '76, and Rod Tarrago, MD '98 (PG '01), shared their professional journeys with medical students during an online alumni panel. James Jerzak, MD '83, one of 50 physicians across Wisconsin who teach in the SMPH's Ambulatory Acting Internship, concluded his last office visit\u2014number 161,185\u2014but continues to volunteer as a preceptor for medical students. Four alumni joined the WMAA Board of Directors (see page 18). The following alumni hosted events to welcome spring graduates to their hometowns: Elizabeth Jahns, MD '14, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Luke Lopas, MD '14, and Don Selzer, MD '96, Indianapolis, Indiana; Katherine Lucarelli, MD '19, and Ann Tran, MD '11, Chicago, Illinois; and Matt Mayer, MD '18, and Kate Penzenstadler, MD '15, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Further, Elizabeth Bensen, MD '92, began serving on the Quarterly Editorial Board, and three classmates\u2014 Charles Frinak, MD '77, David Howes, MD '77, and Ruth Rosenthal, MD '77\u2014 provided matching funds to create the SMPH Class of 1977 Scholarship Fund. There are so many ways our alumni serve and support the WMAA and SMPH. For all you do, I am grateful. Sarah B. Rothschild Executive director, Wisconsin Medical Alumni AssociationSARAH B. ROTHSCHILD TODD BROWN/MEDIA SOLUTIONSFEATURE STORYVOLUME 24 NUMBER 3 4Our Heroes of the Pandemic APPLAUDING SEVERAL FACULTY MEMBERS WHO SERVED LOCALLY, REGIONALLY AND NATIONALLYBY SARA BENZEL While the COVID-19 pandemic altered professional and personal lives for nearly everyone, people who work in health care, medical research and academic medicine have front-row seats. They have been called upon to adapt quickly to changing situations and community needs, while balancing the same uncertainties faced by the rest of society. University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) leaders appreciate the heroic efforts of its faculty and staff who are dedicated to education, scientific investigation, patient care, public health and health equity. Their efforts extend throughout Dane County, the state and the nation. Quarterly asked a sampling of SMPH faculty members to share their experiences related to the novel coronavirus and its ramifications on individuals, families and communities. As you read, think about this question: What would you do differently if you knew the pandemic would last this long?AZITA G. HAMEDANI, MD, MPH, MBA Founding chair, BerbeeWalsh Department of Emergency Medicine, SMPH How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? It necessitated a more cohesive and holistic approach to the clinical services we collectively provide. We had to make sure our faculty members were doing okay but also ask them to expand their scope. What did you do in response to the pandemic? I was asked to chair the State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee, sanctioned by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) to provide advice related to medical ethics and recommend policy for equitable and fair delivery of medical services. It was an honor to lead this group. Even when they disagreed, the members truly cared about advancing the best interests of Wisconsin residents. What's one experience from the pandemic that stands out to you? In a crisis, it is important to manage the emotions and storyline around the situation. You need to project confidence in a favorable future and ensure that serious work is getting done, but also build community so people feel they are in it together. In meetings I led, I made sure to ask an unexpected personal question that would result in some laughter. It's hard to be too upset with someone, take things too personally or not care about another person's viewpoint when you've laughed together. In a diverse stakeholder committee, that's especially important. What is the most important thing the pandemic taught you? Public health infrastructure and health literacy are areas in which we should invest so communication in times of public health QUARTERLY5crises can be more effective. We should learn from this experience and invest in better systems for the future. WILLIAM HARTMAN, MD, PHD Associate professor, Department of Anesthesiology, SMPH; anesthesiologist, UW Health How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? When COVID-19 hit, I felt that I might be able to help run clinical trials. This was the only way to bring cutting-edge treatments to our patients and, in turn, the world. We investigated therapies\u2014including convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies\u2014that could immediately give hospitalized people relief. Among other trials, we tested the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Running these trials has been the privilege of a lifetime. How were you responsible for communicating about the pandemic? I felt the need to talk to the people of Wisconsin and let them know what we were doing and why. I tried to educate people on how to be safe and the different therapies and vaccines that became available. While I never had any intention of being a television doctor, it was the most effective way to talk to people and reassure them. What do you recall most about your work during the pandemic? I found an incredible group of people in the Office of Clinical Research. They \"ran into the fire\" and always asked if there was anything more they could do to help. I also truly appreciate the people in the local and national media who told the story as it was evolving. What is the most important thing that the pandemic taught you? The biggest takeaway has been the goodness of people. From the professionals in the hospital to the researchers, to the volunteers, to the hundreds of children and adults who bravely became part of our vaccine trials. I will always be grateful for them and hope to live up to their example of selflessness. PETER D. NEWCOMER, MD '95 Senior associate dean for clinical affairs, SMPH; Grossman Chair in Healthcare Leadership; chief clinical officer, UW HealthHow did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? It was critical to coordinate and align diverse clinician leadership voices to create a unified approach for our organization. We also had to communicate effectively and regularly. How were you responsible for communicating about the pandemic? We worked to be a resource for the media. Also, it was vital that we provide resources to health system staff, answer questions and provide regular updates. I started a weekly clinician update, which I continue to this day with a brief operational and COVID-19 update to 2,200 physicians and advanced practice providers. What's one memory from the pandemic that stands out to you? I remember the incredible stress of the unknown early in the pandemic when our epidemiologists were predicting that we would not have enough beds and ventilators for our patients. I remember the kindness of our nurses as they provided comfort and companionship to patients who were sick with COVID-19 and isolated from their loved ones. I remember the happiness and relief related to the rapid vaccine development and then the complexity of an equitable rollout of those vaccines. What is the most important thing the pandemic taught you? I think it taught me more about flexibility and dealing with ambiguity than 20 years of working in a complex organization. When things are ambiguous, communication is key to successfully enacting changes and decisions. In the face of ambiguity, we are learning to build spaces with flexibility to serve multiple purposes. \u2014Continued on next page6 VOLUME 24 NUMBER 3ELIZABETH \"BETSY\" NUGENT, MSPH, CCRP Director of clinical trials development and accreditation, SMPH; chief clinical research officer, UW Health How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? We had to pivot to all things COVID-19 because we realized the only treatments and prevention for the novel coronavirus were going to come from clinical trials. Two weeks after we closed non-essential, on-site work at the SMPH, the Office of Clinical Research was opening the first COVID-19 treatment trial at University Hospital. We had to work much faster than we ever had, and most staff were working seven days per week for the first four months. Everyone pitched in, doing whatever tasks needed to be done to get patients enrolled and their treatment started. We also became part of a national consortium related to COVID-19 clinical trials. How were you responsible for communicating about the pandemic? I was called upon to give updates to the clinical community about our clinical trials to ensure them that they could quickly refer patients. We reached out to the hardest hit communities about clinical trials. We answered questions and combated misinformation.What's one experience from the pandemic that stands out to you? I think everyone felt very unsure and scared at the beginning, but when we started to have success with clinical trials preventing death and long hospitalizations, I remember seeing a change in everyone's faces. We had contributed to saving lives! Getting selected for multiple COVID-19 vaccine trials validated our academic medical center at the SMPH and UW Health as a leading research center. How did the pandemic change your perspective on the work you do? It reminded me of how much a group of mission-driven people can accomplish. DAVE O'CONNOR, PHD '01, AND SHELBY O'CONNOR, PHD '04 Professors, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, SMPH How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? DO: Due to our experience with the Zika virus, we started sharing in real time the important lessons we learned, galvanizing collaboration between basic science researchers and those working with animal models. We then pivoted to improve access to testing, especially in schools, and to track the spread of viral variants throughout the state. SO: It taught me how to engage with others to solve health-related challenges in our local community. In 2020, we developed a mobile saliva-testing program to collect samples and perform the tests outdoors and on site. Once rapid antigen testing became available, we then designed a program to train local K-12 school nurses and staff on how to perform them. After the Wisconsin DHS implemented widespread K-12 testing, we pivoted to the development of an air-surveillance program to capture viruses from the air in several locations. Now, we are continuing to use air surveillance in novel ways to learn about the spread of respiratory viruses in different settings. What did you do in response to the pandemic? DO: Shelby and I were participants in the AstraZeneca phase 3 vaccine study. We also participate in World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) groups that study different aspects of the pandemic. Locally, we work very closely with Public Health Madison and Dane County and local schools. SO: We have been working particularly closely with the local K-12 schools and other community entities to implement different testing and surveillance programs. What's one memory from the pandemic that stands out to you? DO: The teamwork that our group showed when setting up outdoor testing in the summer of 2020 was memorable. The cognitive dissonance of working with a SARS virus behind a bike shed, in 2020, was bonkers to me. SO: I remember sitting outside and pipetting liquids while sweat was dripping in my eyes. I never thought I would be testing for an infectious pathogen outside a bike shed. That was pretty nuts. Shelby O'Connor, PhD '04 (left), and Dave O'Connor, PhD '01, are married and have been combating COVID-19 in the community together.7 QUARTERLYWhat is the most important thing the pandemic taught you? DO: It taught me the fragility of systems that we take for granted. People are behind the systems that govern our daily lives, and when those people are stressed, the systems falter. Given the frequency of worrisome emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, figuring out how to fortify resilience in these systems is going to be vitally important. SO: I have learned that there are some wonderful, kind and generous people in our community. These people continued to give their all, even when the world felt like a dark cloud. Moving forward, I think our community needs to have that spirit of collective outreach because we will need to embrace it again when the next crisis comes our way. JEFFREY POTHOF , MD '06 Associate professor, BerbeeWalsh Department of Emergency Medicine, SMPH; chief quality officer, UW Health How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? I was part of a team asked to assess our pandemic readiness and determine what we needed to do to stay safe while continuing to provide remarkable care to our patients at UW Health. Most of 2020 consisted of rotating through the Hospital Incident Command Center as one of the medical branch officers. We'd review the metrics on pandemic trends to determine how we needed to respond. We worked with UW-Madison to manufacture our own hand sanitizer and face shields when we knew the supply chain would leave us short. Every day was filled with issues that needed to be solved with the speed and flexibility we were not accustomed to, but time after time, everyone at UW Health and the SMPH stepped up and exceeded everyone's expectations. What did you do in response to the pandemic? In addition to my work within UW Health, I served on the Waunakee School District's Medical Advisory Committee to help create a safe environment for children. I also was one of the first people in the United States to participate in the AstraZeneca phase 3 vaccine trial. Our research teams had worked tirelessly to secure UW Health as an enrollment site for that clinical trial. How were you responsible for communicating about the pandemic? Early on, many of us at the SMPH and UW Health felt strongly that our role in the pandemic included informing and educating our community and beyond about how to keep themselves and their families safe. This began small with a handful of media interviews, but it grew into more than 3,000 media stories with more than 1.5 billion views. What's one memory that stands out to you? I'll never forget the Sunday morning when our team met and made the incredibly difficult decision to postpone all non-emergent procedures at UW Health. This had never been done before, and despite the enormous financial cost to the organization, we made that decision because it was necessary to keep our staff and patients safe in that uncertain time.NASIA SAFDAR, MD, PHD (PG '00, '02) Associate dean for clinical trials (since September 2021), SMPH; research director, UW Clinical T rials Institute, SMPH and UW Health; medical director of infection control (until September 2021), UW Health How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? COVID-19 took priority, and everything else I do took a back seat. Almost every waking moment was spent developing, implementing and communicating COVID-19 protocols to our health care workforce. What did you do in response to the pandemic? I was a member of the State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee. I am a vaccination domain lead for the NIH's National COVID Cohort Collaborative. I also took on a bigger role in communicating to the public the importance of COVID-19 vaccinations and other preventive measures, and I served as a special advisor to the UW-Madison chancellor's COVID-19 Response Team. \u2014Continued on next page8 VOLUME 24 NUMBER 3What's one memory from the pandemic that stands out to you? When we saw the state's first COVID-19 patient, it was gratifying to see that our infectious disease protocols worked well\u2014 especially because the early days were fraught with having to make decisions in the face of the most ambiguity [about the novel coronavirus] that I've ever experienced. How did the pandemic change your perspective? I felt a very strong recommitment to my work in infection control and academia. AJAY SETHI, PHD, MHS Professor, Department of Population Health Sciences, SMPH; faculty director, Master of Public Health Program, SMPH; scientist, Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), UW-Madison How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? When the pandemic hit, I was responsible for shifting the Master of Public Health Program curriculum to a virtual format. I helped colleagues and students transition to online teaching and learning. I also helped restructure the new Public Health Residency Program into a remote program. The focus on my research shifted to COVID-19, particularly on questions that could help with the pandemic response. In the SHOW, we carried out studies to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence longitudinally as the virus spread in Wisconsin and to understand the impact of the pandemic on social determinants of health. I also worked with a team at the UW Carbone Cancer Center to help understand the impact of COVID-19 on the health and medical care of cancer patients in Wisconsin. What did you do in response to the pandemic? As a member of the UW Health COVID-19 modeling team, I helped project the number of cases, hospital and ICU bed needs, and deaths in Wisconsin. Our modeling helped inform resource allocation and utilization, as well as staffing needs. I served on several committees as an advisor to UW-Madison's University Health Services; this work related to outbreak response testing, quarantine protocols and evidence-based campus policies. Some organizations and businesses reached out to me to help them develop testing and risk-mitigation policies and protocols, and to provide vaccine education for their employees. How were you responsible for communicating about the pandemic? Relative to before the pandemic, my time committed to outreach increased tremendously. I engaged with media outlets, gave talks and served on panels about COVID-19, and fielded questions from community members. When I could, I offered clarity about emerging scientific knowledge and new public health recommendations. I became a go-to expert to help counteract misinformation about the virus and vaccines. What's one experience from the pandemic that stands out to you? One specific interview I did early in the pandemic has stayed with me. I was asked to comment on a study that someone had started to look at whether measles, mumps and rubella vaccine could protect against COVID-19. At the time, the scientific question being asked had some merit, but after doing some internet sleuthing, I learned that the study protocol was ill-conceived. My work led to the stoppage of an unethical study. I felt proud to contribute to that.PATRICIA T\u00c9LLEZ-GIR\u00d3N, MD (PG '00) Associate professor, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, SMPH; co-chair, Dane County Latino Health Council How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? Primary care physicians had to rapidly adjust. Some of us had to go help at the hospitals. We needed to work more efficiently to protect ourselves and the people we serve. Also, at the community level, my work tripled right away. What did you do in response to the pandemic? The Dane County Latino Health Council's mission is to support the well-being of the Latinx community. In my leadership role there, I was partially responsible for organizing the full COVID-19 response campaign. In this response, we advocated for testing and vaccine sites that are culturally and linguistically appropriate. We prioritized communication and education individually, in groups and in the media. For instance, we have a health education radio program\u2014the only all-Spanish radio station in Dane County\u2014and this proved to be the best way to get vital information to our community when the pandemic hit. I also assisted in securing financial support for families with 9 QUARTERLYundocumented individuals who did not qualify for other financial programs. What are some key takeaways from the pandemic that stand out to you? It has been difficult to see how our Latinx community has been impacted the hardest. People have been affected not only physically and mentally but financially, and it will take the community many years to recover. However, it was amazing to see how well-organized, collaborative and fast we were within our community. I am extremely grateful for the Latino Health Council, particularly my co-chair Shiva Bidar-Sielaff, as well as the leaders of other grassroots Latinx community organizations. How did it change your perspective on the work you do? It reinforced what I already knew and what my parents taught me: that we are here to serve, support and respect each other. Collaboration is crucial. We are all in this together! JONATHAN TEMTE, MD '87, PHD (PG '93) Professor, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, and associate dean for public health and community engagement, SMPHHow did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? Because I had training in pandemic response, respiratory virus surveillance, epidemiology and vaccine policy, I found myself in a weird comfort zone. My time is split between the SMPH Dean's Office and the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health. As my research is directed entirely at respiratory viruses, my team anticipated the pandemic's arrival and pre-emptively adapted our protocols, allowing us to continue our studies. What did you do in response to the pandemic? Initially, I was involved with the UW-Madison Campus \"Smart Restart\" efforts for safe reopening of campus for the fall 2020 semester. My research team also created and operated a faculty and staff SARS-CoV-2 surveillance system to help inform campus policy. I was recruited to serve on the State Disaster Medical Advisory Committee and helped develop the pandemic response for Wisconsin. I co-chaired Wisconsin's COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Subcommittee, which developed approaches to vaccine distribution once it became available. I also served as the American Academy of Family Physicians' liaison to the CDC's COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group, which was charged with developing vaccine policy options for the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. What's one memory from the pandemic that stands out to you? My family and I took a vacation very early in the pandemic. While away, I received a voicemail from a colleague who was having significant respiratory symptoms and could not get anyone to approve a COVID-19 test. The person's voice was desperate and haunting. We arrived back in Wisconsin in mid-March 2020 to a vastly different world than it had been when we left Madison.How did the pandemic change your perspective on the work you do? The pandemic underscored the tremendous undertaking of public health and medical science and, sadly, reinforced the limits of science. One can have incredible tools: vaccines, antivirals, testing and more. Yet, these measures fail in the face of misinformation. Good science relies on effective communication and good science literacy. RYAN WESTERGAARD, MD, PHD, MPH Associate professor, Department of Medicine, SMPH; chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for communicable diseases, Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) How did the pandemic change your roles and responsibilities? I joined the Wisconsin DHS as a state epidemiologist in August 2019 and was still learning the ropes in my new role when COVID-19 changed everyone's role in public health.

MD STUDENTS ARE GREETED WITH WHITE COATS, STETHOSCOPES AND BABCOCK ICE CREAM Christine Seibert, MD (left), associate dean for medical student education and services, helps Andrew Matta put on his new white coat.Incoming medical students pose with their new, symbolic white coats and receive a gift of a stethoscope from an alum. 11 QUARTERLYPHOTOS BY PATHUM KARUNARATNE, KRISTEN KOENIG AND TODD BROWN At the White Coat Investiture Ceremony on Friday, August 26, 2022, faculty and staff of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) upheld several traditions to welcome incoming medical students as they began their quest to become physicians. This rite of passage involves medical students donning their first white coat in a ceremony that emphasizes the importance of compassionate care for patients and communities. The coats are sponsored by the Wisconsin Medical Society.\"The ceremony is their first welcome to the profession of medicine,\" says Gwen McIntosh, MD '96, MPH, associate dean for students. \"The moment they put on their white coats, it becomes truly real that they are entering into an honored profession.\" Noting that it is clear the past few years have had an impact on these entering students, Dean Robert N. Golden, MD, told them, \"The COVID-19 pandemic has provided confirmation of the immense value of our school's innovative integration of medicine and public health, a model that is now woven into your curriculum in a way that will prepare you to lead the advancement of health for people and populations.\" Kathleen Shannon, MD, chair, Department of Neurology, imparted words of wisdom during her keynote address. And on August 31, the Wisconsin Medical Alumni Association hosted its annual Badger Cookout for the new medical students, complete with an appearance by Bucky himself and a sweet treat of UW-Madison's Babcock ice cream. Each new medical student received their first stethoscope as a gift from an alum.FEATURE STORYVOLUME 24 NUMBER 3 1213 QUARTERLYIn a philanthropic first, the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) and UW Health have launched a joint fundraising campaign called Wisconsin Medicine\u2014The Future Needs Us Now, with the goal of partnering with generous donors to help drive innovation and progress in four pillars: medical research, education, patient care and health equity. The groundbreaking campaign is as ambitious as it is visionary. By the end of 2025, leaders of the two organizations aim to raise $500 million from 100,000 donors to support programs and discoveries that will change the future of medicine. \"We are integrating medicine and public health, clinical care and research, a world- class health system and one of the world's greatest universities in an unprecedented partnership for one critical purpose: human wellness,\" says Robert N. Golden, MD, dean of the SMPH.Innovation is Part of Our DNA Changing the future of medicine is a big goal. But it's one that Golden sees as realistic. After all, he says, \"Our academic medical center has an amazing heritage of breakthrough discoveries and innovations in science and patient care. We've been the first in so many areas.\" Today, for example, doctors around the world remove skin cancer with a surgical technique invented at UW-Madison in the 1930s by Frederic Mohs, MD '34; Mohs micrographic surgery removes cancerous lesions without destroying the surrounding healthy tissue. Thousands of patients can thank the work of Fritz Bach, MD, who performed the first successful bone marrow transplant on the UW-Madison campus in 1968. And in the 1980s, Folkert Belzer, MD, and James Southard, PhD, revolutionized organ transplantation by developing the liquid solution that allows organs to be transported; this advancement made UW Health one of the premiere transplant centers in the world. \"Innovation and discovery are part of our DNA,\" Golden says. \"We are trailblazers.\" But when it comes to funding the discoveries that later generations will point to as game-changers, the rules of the game have changed. The number of applications for research funding is rising while the number of studies that receive funding is falling. Investigators must navigate a hyper-competitive environment, and federal programs often select research studies that already have demonstrated encouraging preliminary findings. As a result, many young investigators may have new, potentially revolutionary ideas, but only a small fraction receive traditional means of support. That's where philanthropy comes in. Not to replace federal support. Not to carry a study from conception to practice. But to lay the groundwork with transformational gifts that set great ideas on a sure path.The Future Needs Us Now CAMPAIGN PROMISES TO ENHANCE HEALTH CARE IN WISCONSIN AND BEYONDBY MASARAH VAN EYCK \u2014Continued on next 3Today's Dreams Become Tomorrow's Reality \"Think of it as a type of venture capital,\" Golden posits. \"Donors can provide essential 'launch funds' to kick-start research that can then be leveraged for federal grants.\" Adding that a $25,000 donation can become the gift that initiates a new discovery, he says, \"Philanthropy has transformed who we are and how we care for patients and families.\" Donations of any size can help UW-Madison researchers tackle conditions that confound and frighten people the most. Conditions like Alzheimer's disease\u2014the only disease among the nation's top 10 leading causes of death that has no disease-modifying therapy, no definitive way of preventing it and no cure. And every 65 seconds, someone in the United States develops it. (See more about Alzheimer's disease in sidebar article on the next page.) The SMPH and UW Health have already seen philanthropic impact at work with generous donors supporting the pillars of the campaign and key philanthropic needs of the medical institution. Take, for example, the following transformational gifts: A donation from the Centene Charitable Foundation aims to tackle pancreatic cancer. By bringing together researchers and clinical experts in a collective approach, the gift will \"serve as a catalyst for piloting innovative discoveries, whether in personalized cancer therapies, advancing state-of-the-art diagnostics or launching novel clinical trials,\" says the foundation's president, Keith Williamson. And the Diane Lindstrom Ovarian Cancer Research Fund , endowed in 2019 by Lindstrom's son and daughter-in-law, Erik Jacobsen and Christina Lightbourn, is helping to launch new research projects and support the doctors and scientists who are looking at ovarian cancer from fresh angles with new technologies. An economic historian at UW-Madison, Lindstrom fought through four reoccurrences of the disease. She participated in clinical trials and bravely explored new treatments alongside the doctors and researchers at UW Carbone. Meanwhile the charitable lead trust made by Melita Grunow supports the UW Carbone Innovation Fund and the Patient Experience Navigator Program. Having received a breast cancer diagnosis, Grunow GIVE TO YOUR AREA OF SUPPORT UW CARBONE CANCER CENTERAMERICAN FAMILY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WOMEN'S HEAL THUW HEAL TH TRANSPLANT CENTERINITIATIVE TO END ALZHEIMER'S \"We are integrating medicine and public health, clinical care and research, a world-class health system and one of the world's greatest universities in an unprecedented partnership for one critical purpose: human wellness.\" \u2014Robert N. Golden, MDQUARTERLY15was moved to make a legacy donation after her first meeting with her doctors at UW Carbone. She later decided to give a gift now rather than wait because, in her words, \"We know all too well that cancer does not wait for us to get around to treating it.\" Grunow's gift benefits today's patients in their battle with cancer, and it will improve the experiences of those to come. The Best of the Best Make a Difference Philanthropy also plays a critical role in recruiting and retaining superstar faculty and trainees. For example, gifts of named professorships allow the clinical experience of top-tier faculty to inform their research, as their insights advance clinical care. For example, Jeff and Lynn Bakiares bestowed a gift after the exceptional care they received at UW Health when Jeff Bakiares received a successful kidney transplant for which his wife was the living donor. They established the Virginia Lee Cook Professorship in Transplant Nephrology , named after their dear friend, to support academic work in transplant medicine. Now held by Didier Mandelbrot, MD, in the Department of Medicine, the professorship funds research on treatments for post-transplant viral infections, new methods to manage immunosuppression, and techniques for kidney donations \" A modern interpretation of the Wisconsin Idea recognizes that we live in a global village. This is a nationwide philanthropic effort\u2014not just about our community or even our state. Our contributions will help us change health care for the region and for the world.\" \u2014Alan Kaplan, MD -Continued on page 33For sports fans or not\u2014Matt Lepay's voice elicits nostalgic feelings about their time at University of Wisconsin-Madison. A local sportscaster, Lepay has announced UW Badgers basketball and football games on the radio for more than 25 years. His ubiquitous, excitable voice has filled Madison's sports bars, shops and newscasts. Now, Lepay is sharing his familiar voice in support of the Wisconsin Medicine campaign. In frank interviews and a series of public service announcements, he talks about the devastating toll that Alzheimer's disease and dementia has on far too many families\u2014including his own\u2014and how UW-Madison researchers have set their sights on ending this devastating disease. As is common for loved ones, Lepay says, his family struggled to accept the news when his mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. \"At one point, she asked me, 'Do you think I'll get better?'\" Lepay remembers. \"The question was heartbreaking.\" And although he wasn't surprised when he learned\u2014while covering a Brewers game at Yankee Stadium\u2014that his mother had succumbed to her five- year battle with the disease, the news \"hit like a ton of bricks.\" Today, Lepay and his wife, Linda Lepay, both members of the board of visitors for the UW Initiative to End Alzheimer's, are forthright about the emotional and financial impact the disease has on patients and their families. But they also stress reasons for hope. For current patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, the initiative is improving accurate diagnosis, treatment and care. And specialized education and outreach programs are supporting families and caregivers, and working to reduce health disparities in underserved communities. At the same time, UW-Madison researchers have undertaken the long-term goal of slowing, delaying and even preventing the disease. With nearly 5,000 Wisconsinites enrolled in Alzheimer's disease research studies at UW-Madison, for example, investigators have painstakingly traced the progression of the unique brain plaques and tangles associated with the condition. Still, questions about who gets Alzheimer's disease\u2014and why\u2014remain unanswered. For Lepay, \"anything that can accelerate the doctors and researchers finding a cure or at least finding a way to slow the progress\" would be a good thing. Linda (left) and Matt LepayTHE LEPAYS GIVE BACK16 VOLUME 24 NUMBER 3New REFLECTIVE STYLE GUIDES HER ACTIONSALUMNI NOTEBOOK Kyla Lee, MD '98, FACP (center), relishes the opportunity to mentor medical students. Pictured is the group that completed their rotation in 2022. Back row (left to right): David Alderman, license plate, PRAXIS, on the 1997 Toyota RAV4 Kyla Lee, MD '98, FACP , has owned since medical school aptly describes her approach for teaching and mentoring medical students. With Ancient Greek origins, the word \"emphasizes the importance of critically reflecting on practice, ensuring that practice is grounded in theory and ensuring that practice contributes to how we understand theory and the context in which we operate,\" according to the blog Sustaining Community . \"If we can have deep thinkers who figure out how to do things in the world, that's how we bring about change. And that has always been an important part of my journey,\" says Lee, an internal medicine physician at Gundersen Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin, who became president of the Wisconsin Medical Alumni Association (WMAA) in July 2022. Lee holds a clinical adjunct faculty position at her medical school alma mater\u2014the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH)\u2014and has been a member of the WMAA Board of Directors since 2013. She aims to help strengthen the SMPH's success, with an emphasis on cultivating relationships among students and alumni. The WMAA does this in many ways, such as supporting scholarships, boosting the efforts of student clubs and hosting events that foster interactions among medical trainees and alumni. \"I think it's important to promote an inclusive, diverse and collaborative educational environment that fosters the engagement of alumni from near and far, so our students have opportunities to help diverse and underserved populations thrive in Wisconsin and around the globe,\" she shares, adding that she advocates for medical students who struggle to fund their education. \"These are the reasons I'm passionate about my roles at the school and in the WMAA,\" Lee notes. At the Gundersen Health System/Western Academic Campus, she serves as the SMPH director of student programs; as part of this role, she leads Phases 2 and 3 of the traditional medical student programs, and she assists with training medical students in the school's Wisconsin Academy for Rural Medicine. When the SMPH began its curriculum transformation to the ForWard Curriculum, Lee served on the Curriculum Transformation Steering Committee and helped implement the curriculum at Gundersen. There, she is the Acute Care Block Phase 2 site director; Inpatient Acting Internship: Internal Medicine, Cardiology and Pulmonary Critical Care Phase 3 site director; Intern Prep Course site co-director; and Clinical Competency Committee chair for the Transitional-Year Residency Program. \"We're building compassionate physicians for the diverse communities we serve, and I want to continue to strengthen this,\" notes Lee. \"I feel fortunate to be part of this school that cares about the importance of medicine, public health and health equity.\" Lee knew at a young age that she would enter a helping profession because she \"was the kind of kid who rescued spiders\" ahead of her mom's vacuum cleaner. \"I credit my mom for fostering my affinity for learning and my love of animals and nature. Among other things, she took my siblings and me to nature centers and encouraged me to earn my Girl Scout First Class Award\u2014equivalent to an Eagle Scout rank\u2014even when others lost interest in scouting,\" says Lee, who grew up enjoying hobbies of camping, hiking and biking, which she now does on her e-bike with medical students, when schedules allow. Initially, Lee completed an undergraduate premedical curriculum and a master's degree in psychology at Harvard University. When teaching middle school in Boston and rural Vermont and Kenya, as well as college courses in South Africa, she realized that the students' lives were grounded in the reality of daily survival. \"While teaching science was extremely rewarding, it did not allow me to confront issues of deeper importance to me. I decided to attend medical school so I could focus on people one on one,\" she shares.Other factors in Lee's life\u2014including losing her grandmother to colon cancer while receiving home hospice care; hearing inspiring stories about her immigrant grandfather's friendship with Albert Schweitzer, MD, while her grandfather was working as an engineer in Africa; and witnessing her father's strong dedication to serving in the military\u2014also fueled her drive to become a physician. \"The UW School of Medicine and Public Health has a really special character. I had wonderful mentors, including Drs. John Harting and Dean Manning, who focused on interactive group work, and engaging teachers such as Drs. Patrick McBride and Paul Bertics. Their approaches spoke to me,\" reflects Lee. As a medical student, she earned scholarships in recognition of her academic excellence, clinical promise and exceptional concern for the comfort and welfare of patients. She also worked in an orthopedic biomechanics laboratory studying total joint replacement. After earning her medical degree, she completed an internal medicine residency at Gundersen Health System, where\u2014at the end of her residency\u2014she accepted a clinical position. Her love of teaching soon earned her a spot on the teaching faculty, and her role evolved into the positions she holds now. \"The classroom brings questions and knowledge to the table, and teachers who build an engaging environment for students create personal meaning around the information. I want them to own the knowledge so they can address medical problems and ask questions that could change the direction of research or care delivery in the future,\" says Lee. She continues, \"I underscore the importance of empathy and safety to help medical students become kind, resilient physicians to serve individuals, families and communities.\" Specifically, Lee encourages students to help address patients' pain, poverty, loneliness, anxiety, access to care, literacy concerns and discrimination. \u2014Continued on page 3218 VOLUME 24 NUMBER 3New WMAA Board Members DINGLE, FLOWERS, HONG AND KLOOSTERBOER BEGIN TERMS As of July 1, 2022, four University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) alumni\u2014Marvin Dingle, MD '15, Kristine Flowers, MD '94, Julian Hong, MD '14, and Thomas Kloosterboer, MD '82 (PG '86)\u2014 joined the Wisconsin Medical Alumni Association (WMAA) Board of Directors for their initial three-year terms.

This includes care in the catheterization laboratory, as well as the intensive care unit (ICU), where I also care for those without congenital heart disease. A recent case highlights how incredible pediatric anesthesia can be. A young patient was having open heart surgery, and we discovered he had a baby tooth hanging by a thread. To avoid having it come out accidentally, we removed it, and everyone in the operating room and ICU contributed to a tooth-fairy fund. The following day, the patient learned that the tooth fairy comes to visit in the cardiac ICU and pays a premium there\u2014he received $50! During medical school, I considered several specialties. Through guidance from great mentors, I realized I was drawn to pediatrics and high-acuity settings. A pediatric ICU attending encouraged me to explore a combined residency in pediatrics and anesthesia, including critical care. Thus, I did a combined residency in anesthesia at Brigham and Women's Hospital and pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital/ Boston Medical Center. I participate in several professional organizations. I find that attending national meetings is a great learning opportunity and helps me stay connected with colleagues and fellow Badgers across the country. Even though I have two very different clinical roles, each day I care for children who are facing challenging moments. As a parent, I have a lot of empathy for this experience and feel honored to help patients and their caregivers. I would tell a medical student that the opportunity to make an impact in pediatric anesthesia and critical care is enormous. Most children do really well, even when critically ill. Plus, spending time with pediatric patients is a lot of fun! \"ON CALL \"Three pediatric anesthesiologists tell Quarterly what they've been up to21 QUARTERLY JULIANE LEE, MD '94, MS, MBA LYNN M. RUSY , MD '87Enjoying the best of both worlds is how I describe my practice in pediatric anesthesiology and pain medicine at Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University School of Medicine. I spend four days per week in the operating room and one in the multidisciplinary pain clinic. There is no typical day in the operating room, but the acuity of care is high on most days. Even elective cases often involve medically complex patients. Most present some challenging element, but I find this extremely rewarding technically, intellectually and emotionally. I remember one multi- trauma patient who required more than 200 units of blood products in his first 48 hours of hospitalization. I cared for him during some early surgeries, and I provided acupuncture later during his hospitalization. A year later, in the hospital entrance, he called out to me by name. Amazed, I asked, \"Of all the people who took care of you, how do you remember me?\" He smiled and responded, \"You gave me acupuncture!\" This patient is a living miracle. In our pain clinic, I offer medical therapies and auricular acupuncture and acupressure. This safe, rapid and reliable nonpharmacological modality can effectively treat a variety of pain disorders while avoiding opioids. Results are exceptional and rewarding, and they restore hope for patients. Caring for our youngest, most vulnerable members of society is my tremendous privilege. I completed an anesthesiology residency and pediatric anesthesiology fellowship at the University of Illinois-Chicago. I earned my medical acupuncture certificate from Helms Medical Institute, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine. Remaining engaged and open allows me to continue growing and learning, which has led me to pursue additional education, including a master of business administration degree from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. I encourage medical students to consider pediatric anesthesiology and pain medicine because we have an opportunity to uniquely help patients as they heal and thrive. I am a professor of anesthesia at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and I have worked at Children's Wisconsin since 1994. I knew in medical school that I wanted to follow the path of my father, Ben F. Rusy Jr., MD '56, former chair of the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. At UW-Madison, I earned my undergraduate and medical degrees, and I completed an anesthesiology residency at UW Health. From there, I went to Boston Children's for a pediatric anesthesiology fellowship. Next, George Hoffman, MD, recruited me to join the Anesthesia Department at Children's Wisconsin, where I concentrate on pain management. When I joined Children's Wisconsin in 1994, the chronic pain clinic was located in one small room next to the recovery room, and it has grown into the Jane B. Pettit Pain and Headache Center, under the direction of Steven Weisman, MD, thanks to generous financial support from its namesake. The multidisciplinary center is staffed with physicians, pain psychologists, nurses and advanced practice nurses to serve pediatric patients with pain. My practice includes providing operating room anesthesia, overseeing patients after surgery and managing chronic pain in the clinic. I love the broad clinical challenges of my job. One day, I may be anesthetizing a teenager with scoliosis for a spine-fusion surgery, while another day I could be rounding on the wards to manage acute pain for postoperative patients. In clinic, I may be doing a Botox procedure for chronic migraine. I am board certified in medical acupuncture, on which I make presentations yearly at the American Society of Anesthesia meetings. I use medical acupuncture regularly on my chronic pain patients. Every day, I am able to help patients, whether it is providing safe anesthesia care or managing acute and chronic pain. I would tell a medical student that pediatric anesthesiology is a great specialty with incredible variety in the scope of care. You would never get bored!22 VOLUME 24 NUMBER 3WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU! med.wisc.edu/shareyournews Class of 2011 Matthew Lee has been named a co-director of radiology medical student education in the Department of Radiology at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health.

State epidemiologists play an important liaison role between federal agencies, such as the CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the local and tribal health departments where COVID-19 response activities are ultimately implemented. Together, we grappled with challenging questions about how to interpret or adapt CDC guidance locally, and how to work efficiently and equitably to allocate resources like vaccines and therapeutics. What's one experience from the pandemic that stands out to you? The Wisconsin DHS integrated into the State Emergency Operations Center, where I worked to foresee challenges six or more months down the road with a diverse team of \"big picture\" thinkers from numerous state agencies. We worked long hours under stressful conditions and forged friendships that I will always value.What is the most important thing the pandemic taught you? Trust is the resource that is most crucial for public health professionals' ability to prevent disease and protect our communities. While trust in science and in civic leaders has been in short supply in some areas, I believe that trust can be nurtured and restored when we lead with empathy, honesty and humility.Our Heroes of the Pandemic Continued from page 9 Shortly before masking was known to be important to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, a group of UW School of Medicine and Public Health and UW Health leaders gathered in the Health Sciences Learning Center to discuss pandemic-related policies and actions for the academic medical center.

Rosenberg, MD '57, died on July 22, 2022, at age 89, in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, near Princeton. Having grown up in Waunakee, Wisconsin, Rosenberg earned his bachelor's degree from UW-Madison and his medical degree from the SMPH\u2014both summa cum laude and accompanied by membership in Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA). After he completed residency and fellowship training at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, Rosenberg joined the Yale faculty as an assistant professor in 1965. He and colleagues conducted pioneering laboratory investigations into the molecular basis of inherited disorders of amino acid and organic acid metabolism. Within seven years, he became the founding chair of Yale's Department of Human Genetics. In 1984, he was named dean of the medical school. After 26 years at Yale, Rosenberg was appointed chief scientific officer of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS). Under his leadership, the company discovered and developed pharmaceuticals in cancer, cardiovascular disease, AIDS and infectious disorders. In 1998, he left BMS and joined the Department of Molecular Biology in Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, now called the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. After 16 years at Princeton, he worked as an upper school science teacher and scientist at the Princeton Day School until his retirement in 2018. Rosenberg's honors include election to the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences; receipt of the Borden Award from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Kober Medal from the Association of American Physicians, and the McKusick Award from the American Society of Human Genetics; and receipt of honorary doctor of science degrees from the SMPH and the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. He is a past president of the American Society of Human Genetics, the Association of American Physicians, the Funding First Initiative of the Mary Lasker Trust and the Association of Patient-Oriented Research. \"Throughout his career as a deeply committed and highly productive physician- scientist, Dr. Rosenberg continued to be a remarkably loyal alumnus to his alma mater in Wisconsin,\" says SMPH Dean Robert N. Golden, MD, adding that Rosenberg was the inaugural Dr. David de Harter and Diane de Harter Visiting Professor at the school's AOA ceremony in 2015. Rosenberg served as a national member of the Wisconsin Medical Alumni Association Board of Directors from 2013 to 2020. He received the association's Medical Alumni Citation\u2014Distinguished Alumni Award in 1982. Recalling his lifelong friendship with Rosenberg that blossomed as they attended the same academic institutions from grade school through medical school and their residencies, E. Richard Stiehm, MD '57, says, \"We enjoyed traveling together for ski trips, Badger football games and medical meetings. Leon made a major impact in the world, and we all will miss him dearly.\"Frederick C. Heidner II, MD '54 Phoenix, Arizona July 2, 2022 Lavern H.

Stevens, MD '82, U.S. Navy (retired) When the Russian Federation's military forces started a brutal attack against their peaceful Ukrainian neighbor on February 24, 2022, I was skiing in Colorado. Captain Robert Kerr, MD, U.S. Navy (retired), and I had planned to sail his 12-meter sailboat from Washington State to Alaska during May and June. However, when we learned that the Ukrainian Ministry of Health was seeking foreign doctors with war experience, Dr. Kerr and I realized we would not feel right going on a sailing vacation while innocent Ukrainian civilians and soldiers were dying in defense of democracy in Europe. As veterans of multiple combat tours in the Middle East, we have military medical skills that might be helpful to Ukrainian medical professionals, who had not had experience treating large numbers of war casualties. We canceled our sailing trip, and through a non-government organization, we contacted the First L'viv Medical Union. We flew to Germany and traveled by train to the western city of L'viv, Ukraine. We arrived at the city's historic train station after curfew (23:00-06:00), when no trams or taxis were available. All the signs and notices were written in the Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet. When Ukrainian volunteer drivers approached us, we explained we were medical volunteers needing a lift to our hotel, and a courteous young man drove us to our circa 1793 hotel. The next morning, we took a taxi to the hospital, presented our medical credentials and were welcomed by the CEO, hospital administrators and the chief of anesthesiology and critical care for the First L'viv Medical Union, which consists of L'viv Emergency Hospital with 1,000 beds, L'viv City Children's Hospital with about 400 beds, and City Hospital #8 with about 400 beds and a burn unit. These hospitals had been built during Soviet times and have been renovated to some degree to meet Western European standards. Our limiting factor was language. Although English is widely taught in schools, it has been popular only since Ukraine became independent of the Soviet Union on December 31, 1991. Therefore, most doctors and nurses over age 40 speak limited English, while those under 40 usually speak some English. Generally, Dr. Kerr and I paired with an English-speaking resident during rounds and in the operating room. Our Ukrainian language skills improved somewhat during our two months in L'viv. Fortunately, Latin medical terminology is internationally understood. The complex yet melodic Ukrainian language lends itself to a rich tradition of poetry and folk music, to which we were exposed daily. Each night in our hotel room, we studied the language using an online course. Gradually, we could read signs and form basic sentences, with much help from our Ukrainian friends. L'viv was well-patrolled by civilian and military police of the Territorial Defense Force, equivalent to the U.S. National Guard. The soldiers and police we met were professional, well-equipped, uniformed and attentive to security threats. However, the entire country is a war zone. Approximately three times per week, Russian cruise missiles were fired in the direction of L'viv. There had been civilian casualties from these strikes early in the war, but we were not aware of any local casualties during our time in the city. However, each week L'viv hospitals received many casualties via train from hospitals near the Donbas front in eastern Ukraine. Dr. Kerr and I gave more than 25 lectures and workshops on topics such as massive transfusion, whole-blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, HEALER'S JOURNEY Rom A. Stevens, MD '82 \" As veterans of multiple combat tours in the Middle East, we have military medical skills that might be helpful to Ukrainian medical professionals, who had not had experience treating large numbers of war casualties.\" \u2014Rom A. Stevens, MD '82 27 QUARTERLYchest X-ray interpretation, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military medical organization and point-of-care ultrasonography. We worked in the operating rooms and intensive care units (ICUs). Dr. Kerr took the lead in identifying funding from charitable sources and was able to purchase and see delivery of an anesthesia machine, blood warmers and body-warming devices. All the hospitals we visited had severe shortages of medications, including anesthetics and antibiotics. These were mitigated to some degree by pharmaceutical donations from many countries of the European Union (EU). The L'viv Emergency Hospital is planning to build a national rehabilitation center and bone marrow transplant center. City Hospital #8 is building a new burn ICU. Both are multi-year projects that will require massive external funding because the Ukrainian medical system is severely underfunded and understaffed; it would require much- improved salaries for the professional staff, as well as the addition of many more nurses and physical and occupational therapists, to bring the health care system up to Western European standards. Despite our language challenges, we made many friends among the doctors, nurses, physical therapists and hospital administrators in L'viv. We fell in love with this beautiful city with a rich history and many historical buildings and parks. We developed a deep admiration for the bravery and strength of the Ukrainian people as they defend their language, culture, religion and choice of a democratically elected government. Shortly after we departed L'viv, the EU accepted Ukraine and Moldova as candidate members. Ukrainians strive to be part of Europe and never again part of Russia. All the Ukrainians we met expressed sincere appreciation for the support of their country by member states of NATO, the EU, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. I think our most important contribution to the L'viv medical community was our presence that demonstrated the United States stands with Ukraine in the defense of democracy. We are working with specialty societies to find additional funding for Ukrainian hospitals and to get our Ukrainian colleagues the ability to access English-language specialty journals, which are unaffordable to most doctors there. Dr. Kerr and I also are working to obtain and ship current anesthesiology and critical care medicine textbooks to the First L'viv Medical Union. Many physicians we met feel they would benefit from courses in advanced trauma life support, point-of-care ultrasonography and fundamentals of critical care support. Providing such courses in Ukraine will require coordination with our specialty societies. Finally, we learned that the Danylo Halytsky National Medical University in L'viv would be interested in developing a long-term relationship with a U.S. medical school. Dr. Kerr and I found it difficult to leave Ukraine at the end of our two months there. I look forward to returning to L'viv and to our friends and colleagues who are struggling to care for victims of war while they also defend their country and work to improve their medical education and health care systems.

New WMAA President Continued from page 17 \"It's important to know what your patients are famous for\u2014cooking, fishing, volunteering\u2014and what they have faced on their life path,\" says Lee. She teaches students to incorporate patients' personal details in progress notes, such as, \"[The patient] is a delightful, hard-working farmer and truck driver who lost her father to a myocardial infarction and her mother to ovarian cancer as a child, so holidays are particularly hard.\" Lee notes that understanding things like patients' losses are important in delivering care for the whole person. During feedback sessions, students share how these lessons have made a difference; for instance, one medical student wrote, \"It helped me further develop a framework for addressing complex emotional reactions. I have been able to apply this framework in real-time during challenging patient interactions.\" Lee's passion for education is rivaled only by her commitment to excellence in patient care. Humble yet quick to offer examples of scenarios she shares with students, Lee describes an elderly patient whose children were out of town. The woman felt ill and needed cranberry juice, but she did not have a way to get it. \"She called me on a Saturday morning about her concern, and I delivered cranberry juice to her senior apartment,\" recalls Lee. \"I was touched that my patient would call me.\" Lee says she is grateful that Gundersen endorses patient-centered care and upholds \"small town\" values, such as encouraging house calls when necessary. She explains, \"Even though La Crosse is fairly large (population approximately 51,000) and Gundersen Health System is a big hospital that has a Level 2 trauma center and many residency programs, when you drive 20 minutes outside of town in any direction, you'll find small, rural towns. I take care of a lot of farming families.\" At a time when few hospitals in the nation had palliative care programs but the need was becoming evident, Gundersen supported Lee and five colleagues to receive coaching by the inpatient palliative care team at University of California, San Francisco. Now certified in palliative care in addition to general internal medicine, Lee furthers the reach of empathetic, end-of-life care by teaching others about the concepts. Over the years, the SMPH and WMAA have recognized Lee for her dedication to medical education. Among several teaching awards, she received the WMAA Sigurd Sivertson Medical Education Award in 2013, the SMPH Dean's Teaching Award in 2014, and the WMAA Clinical Science Distinguished Teaching Award five times between 2004 and 2020. She also was selected by the SMPH's MD Class of 2017 for induction into the Gold Humanism Honor Society, in which she received its Leonard Tow Humanism in Medicine Award. In her precious time away from work, Lee embraces many hobbies, mostly outdoors. \"I grew up out east, where I used to scuba dive and swim in the cold Atlantic Ocean and lakes,\" says Lee, who now prefers to dive in warm tropical waters. She does recreational shipwreck diving and night diving, has seen black coral at 100 feet and completed a certification dive around whale sharks. Lee also enjoys woodworking and construction projects, such as building live-edge tables as gifts, a staircase up the side of a hill at a friend's farm, and a bridge over a trout stream on another friend's property in northern Wisconsin. As she drives her 1997 Toyota to work every day, Lee hopes her students grasp the metaphor that it's important to \"take care of what we have, including each other and our communities.\" She concludes that she hopes this type of thinking will help her students make the most of what they've gained during their time at UW-Madison and beyond.33 QUARTERLYby living donors. Fittingly, Mandelbrot's research on ways to modify the dosages of anti-rejection medications, while still treating viral infections, has significantly improved Jeff Bakiares' quality of life. Further, through the endowed professorship, the couple is impacting the quality of life of other future transplant donors and recipients. Similarly, the Enid and Jerry Weygandt Professorship in Pediatric Critical Care is a gift from long-time donors to UW Health's American Family Children's Hospital. Awarded in 2020 to Peter Ferrazzano, MD, chief, Division of Pediatric Critical Care, Department of Pediatrics, the donation assures that advancements in care for critically ill children are possible, providing comfort and outstanding medical support to families in Madison and beyond. Gifts Support the Next Generation of Physicians Meanwhile, donations directed toward medical student education advance the SMPH's vision of outstanding health and health care for all. While it is one of the top U.S. medical schools and the first to integrate medicine and public health, the SMPH faces fierce competition from private medical schools with centuries- old endowments. Beyond allowing the school to recruit the best and the brightest, scholarships advance health equity by helping the SMPH ensure its student body includes those who are from underrepresented, and often underfunded, populations in medicine. \"We know that health outcomes are better when a patient is cared for by someone who looks like them and shares their life experience,\" says Golden. \"Our physician workforce needs to mirror the diversity of our patient populations.\" What's more, when students graduate with less of a debt burden, they can pursue what they really want to practice and where. Rural health, underserved populations and public health care all stand to benefit.This was the thinking behind the Edward, Dolores and Rosemary Schultz Scholarship Fund , established by Rosemary T. Schultz, MS '82, MD '85. Schultz says the scholarships she received as an SMPH medical student allowed her \"to live the life I dreamed, and that is the greatest gift anyone could wish for.\" She adds, \"My hope is that a more enlightened generation will make this world a better place.\" Wisconsin Medicine Looks to the Future Can preventing cancer be as simple as a vaccine? Could stem cells be used to cure blindness due to macular degeneration? Can we improve the health and well-being of every American through advancements in medical research and health-related policies and practices? Given that UW Health and the SMPH have partnered for more than 100 years on innovative treatments, research, education and compassionate patient care, nothing seems impossible. It's big. It's multifaceted. It's ambitious. But, at its core, the Wisconsin Medicine campaign is simple: supporting the partnership between two world-renowned medical institutions so the brightest researchers, clinicians, instructors and students can come together around the shared cause of human wellness. \"A modern interpretation of the Wisconsin Idea recognizes that we live in a global village,\" says Alan Kaplan, MD, chief executive officer, UW Health. \"This is a nationwide philanthropic effort\u2014not just about our community or even our state. Our contributions will help us change health care for the region and for the world.\"Wisconsin Medicine Continued from page 15 WAYS TO GIVE MILESTONE: Celebrate a moment like a birthday, wedding anniversary, cancerversary or transplantiversary by creating a fundraiser that will touch the hearts of many.

The society is sponsored by the Arnold P . Gold Foundation, an organization devoted to elevating the principles of humanism, compassion, integrity, respect and service in medicine. It recognizes rising fourth-year medical students who have demonstrated exemplary attitudes and behaviors characteristic of the most humanistic physicians. Fourth-year students are selected for induction by their classmates. These inductees then elect two faculty members and one resident to join them in the GHHS. The ceremony helps foster connections among the newest students in the MD program and those approaching their final year of medical school. \"One of the best aspects of your training here will be your interactions with each other, as well as with colleagues in other classes,\" SMPH Dean Robert N. Golden, MD, told all incoming medical students as he introduced the GHHS portion of the White Coat Ceremony in August 2022. \"Those in upper classes can serve as role models for you on your journey.\" At the ceremony, the SMPH inducted these people into GHHS:Fourth-Year Alexander John Phelan Id\u00e1rraga Calvin Lam Jonathan B.

The SMPH and WMAA presented the 2021 award to James T. Jerzak, MD '83, at a May 2022 reception in Green Bay, Wisconsin. A family physician at Bellin Health's Ashwaubenon Clinic in Green Bay, Jerzak and colleagues have trained medical students in the AAI and in summer electives. The Max Fox Award was created in 1969 through a gift from Herman Shapiro, MD '32, to honor its namesake, who served as a preceptor for more than 25 years. Presenting the award, Professor Emeritus Patrick M. McBride, MD '80, MPH, former associate dean for students, said, \"Dr. Jerzak is a high-energy clinician who is recognized regionally and nationally for his work in improving health systems.\" Jerzak has been the physician lead for Bellin's transformation to team-based care; he presents nationally on how team-based care is essential for reducing physician burnout and improving population health. McBride added, \"We are fortunate that he has shared his incredible knowledge and experience with our medical students for three decades. Our school is deeply indebted for his outstanding teaching. Students adore him, and several have joined Bellin Health!\" Former students and colleagues addressed Jerzak at the reception. Among them was Cynthia Lasecki, MD '93, who met Jerzak in her training as an SMPH medical student. After she completed a family medicine residency at the University of Utah, she was recruited by Jerzak to Bellin Health, where she has gleaned \"wisdom from the exceptional care he provides for his patients.\" Robert Mead, MD '84\u2014who has worked with Jerzak for 35 years\u2014addressed him by saying, \"When we came to Green Bay, we were among just a few board-certified family physicians in the area. ... You have had a huge influence that has rippled throughout the whole state.\" A native of Wausau, Wisconsin, Jerzak earned his bachelor's degree in bacteriology from UW-Madison and his medical degree from the SMPH\u2014including a preceptorship in Green Bay with Herbert Sandmire, MD '53. Jerzak completed a family practice residency at the Medical College of Wisconsin and served as chief resident. In 1986, he joined the West Side Clinic in Green Bay, and in 1996, he joined his current practice. He also is a clinical adjunct professor at the SMPH. \"My colleagues and I felt strongly that physicians have a duty to help train the next generation of physicians,\" said Jerzak. \"The years I have been involved in medical student education have been immensely rewarding and a highlight of my career.\" Jerzak has received the Wisconsin Academy of Family Physicians Educator of the Year Award and the WMAA's Sigurd Sivertson Medical Education Award.Max Fox Award JERZAK HONORED AS A MENTOR, COLLEAGUE AND FRIENDAWARDS Left to right: Jane Jerzak, James Jerzak, MD '83, Robert Mead, MD '84, Patrick McBride, MD '80, MPHHANNAH SHAW/WISCONSIN MEDICAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION36 young Mar\u00eda Cecilia Gonz\u00e1lez (right) poses with her grandfather, Francisco Gonzalez.Life Experiences Lead to ABREU GONZ\u00c1LEZ SHARES HER STORYa Career IN MEDICINE Kaine Korzekwa As Mar\u00eda Cecilia Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez begins her medical school journey as a member of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health's entering class of 2022, she has much to reflect on: her culture and language, larger-than-life grandfather, incredible mother and fascination with neurology\u2014plus the experience of a terrorist attack in Nice, France, while she was traveling there. Each of these factors has punctuated her journey and slowly but surely set her on a path to be the first in her family to train as a physician. And she's doing so at a school far from her homeland. Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez's maternal grandfather was a great influence. His health issues from a rare form of skin cancer exposed Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez to the health care system. She recalls one of his surgeries, which required the removal of nearly his entire cheek and replacement with skin from his thigh. \"I remember being amazed at what medical professionals could do,\" she recalls. \"I was more than happy to help him and put cream on his wound. He told me I had to be a doctor. And I said, 'Yes, I am going to be a doctor and take care of you,' but I didn't know anything about the training or how long it would take to get into medicine.\" When Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez was in 10th grade, her grandfather passed away, and her desire to become a doctor temporarily faded. But that started to re-emerge a couple of years later in 2016 while she was on an international trip with other high school students in Nice, France. It was Bastille Day\u2014a French holiday filled with parades, dancing and other celebrations, and after a fireworks display, she continued to hear loud noises and saw people running in all directions. She sought refuge in the storage closet of a shoe store and\u2014not knowing what would happen\u2014she sent a text message to her mom to say she was afraid that the message may be her last.Hours later, safely back at her hotel watching television, she learned that a cargo truck had driven through the crowd before police began firing shots. Watching the first responders on TV, her desire to help people through medicine rushed back. Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez reflects, \"After my grandfather passed away, I began to question\u2014Do I really want to be a doctor? Or was this just something we came up with together?\" She continues, \"I struggled for a while, but I began to realize it is a blessing to be able to help others. My experience seeing those first responders help people in France made me realize this is what I want to do.\" Her grandfather's influence continued when she started her undergraduate education. He had gone to a Catholic Jesuit high school in Puerto Rico and later attended\u2014of all places\u2014Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, also a Jesuit institution. Knowing nothing about Wisconsin and never having been to the Midwest, Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez decided to take the same leap her grandfather had in the 1960s. At Marquette, Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez excelled academically and discovered a love of biology, particularly neurology, and overcame a learning disability to discover a talent for teaching and mentoring. She put in more than 500 volunteer hours at a Milwaukee hospital, filling her resume with activities she was passionate about. She also learned that she likely lived in the same dorm as her grandfather because her grandmother recalled the building name from letters he used to write. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez began to see how health disparities were causing members of the Latinx and Black communities to die from the novel coronavirus at higher rates than other populations. This showed how valuable integrating public health can be, and it opened her eyes to a career in medicine that she had never thought of. She says the SMPH's emphasis on this intersection of medicine and public health was a huge draw. Because she wants to return to Puerto Rico to practice medicine, Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez knew this kind of training would be valuable. In addition, she says it was the only school that put her in touch with the Office of Multicultural Affairs even before she decided to matriculate. \"The people I met at UW-Madison knew I may feel different from the majority of the student population and wanted to make sure I felt accommodated and had a sense of community before I even joined,\" Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez shares. \"I thought this was so important and reflected the school's health equity and public health missions.\" Although she is living more than 2,000 miles from Puerto Rico, she still carries with her the memory of her grandfather and support of her mother, who Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez refers to as \"another incredible role model\" and says she has taught her how to persevere through any challenge. \"Thinking about being in Wisconsin was weird for me at first because it seemed so far away from my island,\" says Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez. \"But I knew I was deciding to go to Marquette because of my grandfather, and I ended up loving it. And now that I am attending the UW School of Medicine and Public Health, I've always thought he has been with me, guiding me. Staying in Wisconsin, I still feel connected to him.\"After her White Coat Ceremony in August 2022, Mar\u00eda Cecilia Abreu Gonz\u00e1lez (center) posed on the UW-Madison campus with her mom (left) and sister. VOLUME 24 NUMBER 3RESEARCH ADVANCES38 A current cancer diagnosis posed a significant risk for severe outcomes (ICU admission and death) over the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the second-largest study of COVID-19 patients in the United States, funded by the National Cancer Institute. Prior COVID-19 vaccination significantly reduced the risk of death among cancer patients who develop COVID-19. Published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention and led by University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health researchers, the study included 104,590 inpatients at 21 U.S. health systems. Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 1, 2020, through September 30, 2021, 6.8 percent had a current cancer diagnosis while 6.5 percent had a past history of cancer. Leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, prostate, breast, lung/bronchus and digestive cancers were examined; all except prostate cancer were associated with a higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality compared with no current or past cancer history. Stronger associations were noted for metastatic and hematologic cancers relative to non- metastatic solid tumor cancers. \"An encouraging finding was that individuals with a past history of most types of cancer who were hospitalized with COVID-19 were not at higher risk for severe outcomes,\" says senior author Wendy Slutske, PhD, professor, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health. The increased risk of current cancer on severe outcomes from COVID-19 were constant across 2020 and 2021. This is despite the introduction of vaccines and improvement in treatments. According to study co-author Michael Fiore, MD, MPH, MBA, professor, Department of Medicine, being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 is among the most important actions cancer patients can take to reduce their heightened risks from the disease.Two of the most common cancer-causing genetic changes\u2014previously thought to be separate and regulated by different cellular signals\u2014work in concert, according to a study at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH). Researchers have focused on finding drugs that block one or the other to treat cancer but understanding the cooperative effects may lead to better treatments. Cells muster a protein, p53, which acts inside the nucleus to respond to stress, but mutations of the gene that produces p53 are the most frequent genetic abnormalities in cancer. Mutations activating the cellular pathway PI3K/Akt are also often implicated in cancer. A team led by Richard A. Anderson, PhD, professor, and Vincent Cryns, MD, professor, Department of Medicine, has discovered a link between the p53 and PI3K/Akt pathways, which may make promising targets for new cancer treatments. Findings were published in Nature Cell Biology . Mo Chen, PhD, associate scientist and first author of the study\u2014supported by the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense and Breast Cancer Research Foundation\u2014used chemotherapy drugs to stress cancer cells and damage their DNA during replication. She discovered that enzymes that are part of the PI3K/Akt pathway bind to the mutated p53 in the cell nucleus and attach lipid messengers to p53, showing the two are directly linked. Instead of entering the process that removes damaged cells, the cancer cells repaired their damaged DNA and went on promoting cancer growth. Current treatments that target PI3K may not work because they operate on IPMK rather than the enzyme in the newly discovered pathway. Rendering IPMK inactive keeps p53 proteins from activating the Akt pathway and prevents the pathway from benefitting cancer cells, making IPMK a promising drug target. Cancer Diagnosis Poses Significant Risk for Severe COVID Outcomes Unexpected Link Between Common Cancer Drivers May Yield More Effective Drugs THIRDMAN/PEXELSQUARTERLY39 QUARTERLYThe monoclonal antibody drug mepolizumab decreased asthma attacks by 27 percent in children and adolescents who have a form of severe asthma, are prone to asthma attacks and live in low-income urban neighborhoods, according to a clinical trial sponsored and co-funded by the National Institutes of Health. The majority of trial participants were Black and/or Hispanic\u2014populations that have been under-represented in clinical trials and are at greatest risk for morbidity and mortality from asthma. Findings were published in The Lancet . The research team, led by Daniel Jackson, MD '03 (PG '10), professor, Departments of Pediatrics and Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH), analyzed gene activity in cells from participants' nasal secretions to understand how mepolizumab works and to link these mechanisms to its clinical effect, a major advance of the study. \"We know medications like mepolizumab have revolutionized treatment for adults with severe asthma, but data has been limited on the efficacy of this therapy for children and diverse populations,\" notes Jackson. \"Our findings confirm that mepolizumab is effective in reducing the number of asthma exacerbations in children, albeit to a lesser extent than was observed in the adult trials, and will help to inform and improve asthma treatment. This study also highlights the importance of evaluating treatment responses in children and diverse populations.\" Study co-leaders include William W. Busse, MD '66 (PG '70), honorary fellow and professor emeritus, SMPH and UW-Madison, and Matthew C. Altman, MD, associate professor, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, and associate scientist, Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason in Seattle. The study was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-funded Inner City Asthma Consortium.A study at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) reveals how photoreceptors grown from stem cells might extend axons to contact neurons. This could benefit treatment of blinding retinal diseases, including age- related macular degeneration. People living with these now-uncurable diseases lose vision due to destruction of rods and cones. Neuroscientists' ability to manufacture lab-grown photoreceptors from stem cells has advanced considerably, but transplanting them remains challenging. Once transplanted, photoreceptors must grow axons to connect with existing neurons to transmit signals to the brain.Researchers showed that stem cell-derived photoreceptors can grow axons but lose the ability within 80 days. They also found that mobile helper cells can assist photoreceptors later. \"Understanding how photoreceptors make these connections brings us closer to being able to transplant stem cell-derived photoreceptors to cure blindness,'' says Timothy Gomez, PhD, professor, Department of Neuroscience, and senior author of the study, published in Cell Reports . Sarah Rempel, PhD (PG '21), who led the study, collaborated with a team led by co-author David Gamm, MD, PhD (PG '02, '03), professor, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, to generate retinal organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells. As the organoids developed, the photoreceptors began to produce cone cells around day 30 and rod cells around day 70. Then the team saw that recently generated cone photoreceptor axons could elongate toward their targets until about day 80, but rod photoreceptors lacked the ability to extend. The researchers, who are members of the McPherson Eye Research Institute, also discovered conditions under which older lab-grown photoreceptor cells could extend axons to make connections and how they can be pulled along for the ride.
