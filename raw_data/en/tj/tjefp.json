As a jazz trumpeter, Ruvolo once toured with Sinatra and Ray Charles but after a bout with cancer in 1980, he joined the alternative medicine movement and began treating his fellow performing artists. Today, the gold-walled waiting room of his holistic healing center tends to fill up with high-wattage Broadway dancers, Carnegie Hall musicians, Metropolitan Opera singers, and Lincoln Center conductors who come to ensure that their bodies and souls are in peak-performance condition. Ruvolo offers a variety of means towards that end: An on-staff osteopath provides hands-on care to alleviate injuries of all sorts; a chiropractor can realign off-kilter spines; and a Native American esthetician uses elixirs of her own formulation to make skin glow again. Ruvolo himself specializes in treating skin, stress, and digestive disorders using acupuncture as well as acupressure and herbal medicines. Treatments are by-appointment-only andthanks to such a strong following in the artistic communitycan be hard to come by. "}
