Therapeutic Class Overview Anticonvulsants INTRODUCTION Epilepsy is a disease of the brain defined by any of the following ( Fisher et al 2014): At least 2 unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring > 24 hours apart; 1 unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after 2 unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; Diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome. Types of seizures include generalized seizures , focal ( partial ) seizures , and status epilepticus (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC ] 2018 , Epilepsy Foundation Greater Chicago 2020). Generalized seizures affect both sides of the brain and include: Tonic -clonic (grand mal) : begin with stiffening of the limbs, followed by jerking of the limbs and face Myoclonic: characterized by rapid, brief contractions of body muscles, usually on both sides of the body at the same time Atonic: characterized by abrupt loss of muscle tone; they are also called drop attacks or akinetic seizures and can result in injury due to falls Absence (petit mal) : characterized by brief lapses of awareness, sometimes with staring, that begin and end abruptly; they are more common in children than adults and may be accompanied by brief myoclonic jerking of the eyelids or facial muscles, a loss of muscle tone, or automatisms. Focal seizures are located in just 1 area of the brain and include: Simple : affect a small part of the brain; can affect movement, sensations, and emotion, without a loss of consciousness Complex : affect a larger area of the brain than simple focal seizures and the patient loses awareness ; episodes typically be gin with a blank stare, followed by chewing movements, picking at or fumbling with clothing, mumbling, and performing repeated unorganized movements or wandering; they may also be called epilepsy\" or \"psychomotor epilepsy\" Secondar ily generalized seizures: begin in 1 part of the brain and spread to both sides Status epilepticus is characterized by prolonged, uninterrupted seizure activity . Seizure classifications from the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) were updated in 2017. The ILAE classification of seizure types is based on whether the seizure has a focal, generalized, or unknown onset; has a motor or non -motor onset; and whether the patient is aware or has impaired awareness during the event (for focal seizures). Additional classification details may also be used (Fisher et al 2017A, Fisher et al 2017B ). There is variation between the ILAE classifications and many of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved indications for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). For example, a \"focal aware\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"simple partial seizure,\" and a \"focal impaired awareness\" seizure corresponds to the prior term \"complex partial seizure.\" A number of epilepsy syndromes have also been described; these are defined by groups of features that tend to occur together such as having a similar seizure type, age of onset, part of the brain involved, and electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (Epilepsy Foundation 2013). An example is a childhood epilepsy syndrome called Lennox -Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by several seizure types including tonic (stiffening) and atonic (drop) seizures. In LGS, there is a classic EEG pattern seen and intellectual development is usually impaired ( Epilepsy Foundation 2020 ). Epilepsy management is focused on the goals of 1) controlling seizures, 2) avoiding treatment -related adverse effects (AEs), and 3) maintaining or restoring quality of life. Management options vary based on the seizure type. It is usually appropriate to refer patients to a neurologist to establish the epilepsy diagnosis and formulate the management strategy (Schachter 2019). A correct diagnosis is essential to proper treatment selection. For example, absence seizures are commonl y confused with complex partial seizures. However, drugs that reduce absence seizures are generally ineffective for complex partial seizures, and the most effective drugs for complex partial seizures may be ineffective against or even increase the frequency of absence seizures (Epilepsy Foundation Greater Chicago 2020). 36 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 2 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased patient adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. When combination therapy is needed, it is recommended to select products with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. There is little comparative clinical data to support the use of specific combinations ( Schachter 2019). Several broad classes of AEDs are available, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, hydantoins, and miscellaneous agents (see Table 1). Cannabidiol (Epidiolex) was FDA- approved in June 2018 for use in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome (FDA news release 2018). It was the first FDA -approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and the first approved drug that contains a purified substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. In July 2020, cannabidiol was FDA -approved for the treatment of seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older ( Epidiolex prescribing information 2020, FDA news release 2020 ). The age range for the indications of treatment of seizures associated with LGS or Dravet syndrome was also expanded to include pediatric patients 1 year of age and older (Epidiolex prescribing information 2020) . Initially designated as a schedule V controlled substance, cannabidiol has been descheduled and is no longer classified as a controlled substance. Stiripentol (Diacomit) capsules and powder for oral suspension were FDA -approved in August 2018 for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older taking clobazam. In June 2020, fenfluramine oral solution (Fintepla) was approved for the same indication without the requirement for concomitant clobazam ( Fintepla prescribing information 2020). Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) received an expanded indication in April 2018 for use in partial - onset seizures associated with TSC . This product is a kinase inhibitor that also has several oncology indications. Midazolam nasal spray (Nayzilam) was approved in May 2019 for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age ( Nayzilam prescribing information 2019). In January 2020, diazepam nasal spray (Valtoco) was approved for the same indication in patients as young as 6 years of age (Valtoco prescribing information 2020 ). Several of the AEDs are used for addi tional indications beyond the management of epilepsy, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and several types of neuropathic pain. These additional indications are listed in Table 2; however, this review primarily focuses o n the use of AEDs for the management of epilepsy. Additionally, brands and formulations FDA-approved and marketed only for non -epilepsy indications are not included within this review; these include gabapentin tablets (Gralise ), extended -release management of postherpetic neuralgia and treatment of moderate -to-severe restless leg syndrome, and pregabalin extended- release tablets (Lyrica CR), FDA - approved only for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral hypnotic s Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Overall, the anticonvulsants have demonstrated efficacy for their FDA -approved uses. Clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy of the anticonvulsants for the treatment of epilepsy is described in the prescribing information for the individual products, particularly for anticonvulsants more recently approved by the FDA. However, the prescribing information for some older, conventional proved products (eg, phenobarbital) do not contain efficacy data in their prescribing information. No single AED is clearly the most effective. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited, and trials have generally not shown significant differences among drugs in terms of efficacy. However, the quality of the data is limited and generally derived from short -term trials ( Karceski 201 9). When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Combination therapy may be associated with decreased patient adherence to therapy and an increased incidence of AEs and drug interactions. (Schachter 2019). Most patients with epilepsy are treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy ( Nevitt et al 2017). An evidence review summarized AED efficacy and effectiveness as initial monotherapy for epileptic seizures and syndromes ( Glauser et al 2013 ). This publication provides conclusions based on a review of 64 randomized trials and 11 meta -analyses. Conclusions include the following: As initial monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset seizures: Carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenytoin, are potentially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset are potentially efficacious/effective. As initial monotherapy for elderly adults with newly diagnosed or untreated partial -onset seizures: Gabapentin and lamotrigine are efficacious/effective. Topiramate and valproate are potentially efficacious/effective. 44 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 10 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

As initial monotherapy for adults with newly diagnosed or untreated precipitate or aggravate generalized -onset tonic -clonic seizures. For children with newly diagnosed or generalized tonic -clonic seizures: aggravate generalized -onset tonic -clonic seizures. As initial monotherapy for children with newly diagnosed or untreated absence seizures: Ethosuximide and valproate are established as efficacious/effective. vigabatrin may precipitate or aggravate absence seizures (based on scattered reports). As initial monotherapy for children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes Carbamazepine oxcarbazepine, and sulthiame (not available in the United States) are potentially efficacious/effective. For patients with newly diagnosed JME: absence, myoclonic, and in some cases generalized tonic -clonic seizures. There has also been a report that lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures in JME. There is a lack of well -designed randomized trials in epilepsy, particularly for generalized seizures and in the pediatric population. A Cochrane systematic review evaluated the efficacy of AED monotherapy for epilepsy ( Nevitt et al 2017). The treatment of partial -onset seizures (simple partial, complex partial or secondarily generalized) or generalized tonic -clonic seizures with or without other generalized seizure types. This network meta- analysis showed that for the primary outcome, the time to withdrawal of allocated treatment: For individuals with partial seizures , levetiracetam performed better than carbamazepine and lamotrigine; lamotrigine performed better than all other treatments (aside from levetiracetam); and c arbamazepine performed better than gabapentin and phenobarbital. For individuals with generalized onset seizures, valproate performed better than carbamazepine, topiramate and phenobarbital. For both partial and generalized onset seizures, phenobarbital seems to perform worse than all other treatments. For the secondary outcome, time to first seizure: For individuals with partial seizures , phenobarbital performed better than both carbamazepine and lamotrigine; better than valproate, gabapentin, and lamotrigine; and phenytoin performed better than lamotrigine. For both partial and generalized seizure types, phenytoin and phenobarbital generally perfor med better than other t reatments . Few notable differences were shown for either partial or generalized seizure types for the secondary outcomes of time to 6 -month or 12- month remission of seizures. Overall, direct evidence and network meta- analysis estimates were numerically similar, and effect sizes had overlapping confidence intervals. Data for individuals with generalized seizures are still limited and additional randomized trials are needed. The relative efficacy for generalized (n = 7 studies) or absence seizures (n = 3 studies) was evaluated in a systematic r eview and network meta -analysis (Campos et al 2018) . The outcomes analyzed were seizure freedom and withdrawal due to inefficacy. Compared to valproate, phenytoin had a lower odds of seizure freedom (odds ratio, 0.50; 45 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 11 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Lamotrigine had the highest probability of seizure freedom and valproate had the highest probability of withdrawal due to inefficacy in these patients . For absence seizures, ethosuximide and valproate were found to have a higher probability of seizure freedom compared to lamotrigine. A meta -analysis estimated the comparative efficacy of achieving seizure freedom with 22 antiepileptic drugs and placebo in children and adolescents (Rosati et al 2018) . For the treatment of newly diagnosed focal epilepsy (n = 4 studies), point estimates suggested superiority of carbamazepine and lamotrigine; however, this was not statistically significant. For refractory focal epilepsy (n = 9 studies), levetiracetam and perampanel were more effective than placebo in mixed comparisons. Ethosuximide and valproic acid were more effective than lamotrigine for absence seizures. The authors concluded that better designed comparative studies with appropriate length of follow -up, well -defined outcomes, and reliable inclusion criteria are needed to validate these results. A meta -analysis compared monotherapy with carbamazepine or phenytoin in children and adults with focal onset seizures (simple or complex focal and secondarily generalized ), or generalized onset tonic -clonic seizures (with or without other generalized seizure types). Results demonstrated that the time to treatment failure (primary outcome) did not significantly differ between treatment groups. The time to first seizure after randomization and 6- month and 12- month remission were also similar between groups ( Nevitt et al 2019). Approximately 20 % to 40% of patients with epilepsy can be considered refractory to drug treatment, referred to as drug- resistant epilepsy. Treatment of drug -resistant epilepsy may include additional anticonvulsant drug trials, epilepsy surgery, vagal nerve stimulation, and dietary changes (the ketogenic diet) ( Sirven 2018 ). Combination AED regimens are an option for the treatment of drug -resistant epilepsy. However, robust clinical evidence of suitable combinations of AEDs has been difficult to generate due to the large number of possible combinations of drugs and doses. Examples of combinations for which there is some evidence of efficacy include valproate plus lamotrigine for partial -onset and generalized seizures, valproate plus ethosuximide for absence seizures, and lamotrigine plus topiramate for various seizure types; however, even this evidence is fairly limited. In general, when considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with different mechanisms of action, and to be mindful of the overall drug load to minimize AEs. Two -drug therapy should be attempted before considering addition of a third drug, and higher numbers of drugs should be avoided as they are asso ciated with a very low likelihood of additional seizure reduction ( Kwan et al 2011). A meta -analysis examined the efficacy of newer AEDs (eslicarbazepine, brivaracetam, perampanel, and lacosamide) vs levetiracetam as adjunct ive therapy for uncontrolled partial -onset seizures. Most patients in this meta- analysis were on at least 2 other AEDs at the time of treatment. In this analysis, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and brivaracetam were non -inferior to levetiracetam in terms of efficacy, but all newer AEDs except brivaracetam had worse tolerability profiles than levetiracetam at high doses ( Zhu et al 2017). A network meta -analysis examined refractory partial -onset seizures while using monotherapy ( Zhao et al 2017). The efficacy outcomes studied were 50% responder rate and state of seizure freedom. The authors concluded that topiramate, levetiracetam, pregabalin, and oxcarbazepine were preferable for their relatively high efficacy and low risk of AEs. Rufinamide was the least preferable medication due to its low efficacy and high risk of AEs. A network meta- analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 newer AEDs for treatment of refractory partial - onset epilepsy with or without secondary generalization ( Hu et al 2018) . The primary outcome was seizure freedom, which was defined as a 100% seizure reduction in the maintenance or double- blind treatment period of the trial. Safety was assessed by the withdrawal rate due to treatment -emergent AEs. Based on results of 54 studies that evaluated the efficacy outcome, the most effective agents included tiagabine, brivaracetam, and valproic acid, and the least effective agents included rufinamide, lamotrigine, and zonisamide. Products with favorable safety included levetiracetam, brivaracetam, and perampanel, while those with the least favorable safety included retigabine (not available in the United States), oxcarbazepine, and rufinamide. The authors stated that agents with the best outcomes in term s of efficacy and safety include d levet iracetam, vigabatrin, valproic acid, and brivaracetam. Cann abidiol (Epidiolex) was approved in June 2018 for use in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with LGS or Dravet syndrome ( FDA news release 2018). It is the first FDA- approved drug for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and is the first approved drug that contains a purified substance, cannabidiol, derived from marijuana. Its approval for these 2 indications was based on 3 placebo- controlled trials in patients refractory to other treatments. 46 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 12 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Cannabidiol , along with use of other agents , demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( Thiele et al 2018; Devinsky et al 2018; Devinsky al 2017). In July 2020, cannabidiol was FDA -approved for a third indication, treatment of seizures associated with TSC, and the age range for all 3 indications was aligned to include pediatric patients 1 year of age and ol der (FDA news release 2020, Epidiolex prescribing information 2020 ). In a placebo -controlled trial of 224 patients with TSC and seizures inadequately controlled with 1 concomitant AED, cannabidiol resulted in a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( Epidiolex prescribing information 2020). To date, no comparative trials have been published. Everolimus tablets for oral suspension (Afinitor Disperz) received an expanded indication for adjunctive use in TSC - associated partial -onset seizures in April 2018. Results of a randomized, double-blind, place bo-controlled study of 366 patients with inadequately controlled seizures on 2 or more AEDs demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo ( French et al 2016). In August 2018, the FDA approv ed a second drug, stiripentol (Diac omit), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Two multicenter placebo- controlled studies evaluated the addition of stiripentol to clobazam and valproate therapy in patients 3 years to less than 18 years of age with Dravet syndrome. Responder rates (seizure frequency reduced by 50%) with respect to generalized tonic- clonic seizures were significantly lower with stiripentol compared to placebo ( Diacomit prescribing information 2018) . In May 2019, a nasal spray formulation of midazolam (Nayzilam) was approved for the acute treatment of cluster seizures in adults and adolescents. In one randomized controlled trial in patients with seizure clusters while receiving a stable AED regimen, the proportion of patients who experienced treatment success (seizure termination within 10 minutes and no recurrence for the next 6 hours) was significantly higher with midazolam nasal spray compared to placebo (53.7% vs 34.4%, p = 0.0109) with similar tolerability ( Detyniecki et al 2019). Cenobamate was approved in late 2019 and its efficacy has yet to be compared to other AEDs. The approval of this agent was based on 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies that enrolled 655 adults with partial -onset seizures with or without generalization who were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 other AEDs. The results of these trials demonstrated that cenobamate significantly reduced the frequency of seizures occurring in a 28 - day period. In the first trial, the median percent change in seizure frequency from baseline was -55.6% with cenobamate and -21.5% with placebo. In the second trial, the median percent change ranged from -36.3% to - 55.3% with cenobamate and was -24.3% with placebo (Xcopri package insert 2019, Krauss et al 2020). In June 2020, the FDA approved a third drug, fenfluramine (Fintepla), for use in the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. Two randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled studies evaluated fenfluramine in patients 2 to 18 years of age with Dravet syndrome who were in adequately controlled with 1 to 4 other AEDs. In both trials, fenfluramine significantly reduced the frequency of convulsive seizures occurring in a 28- day period as compared to placebo. In the first trial , in patients not receiving stiripentol , fenfluramine at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day demonstrated a 62.3% greater reduction in mean monthly convulsive seizure frequency (MCSF) over 14 weeks compared with placebo. In the second trial , in patients who were receiving a stiripentol -inclusive AED regimen , fenfluramine at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day showed a 54% greater reduction in MCSF over 15 weeks compared with placebo ( Fintepla package insert 2020, Lagae et al 2020, Nabbout et al 2019). A 2019 randomized controlled trial of children and adults with benzodiazepine -refractory convulsive status epilepticus compared the efficacy of intravenous levetiracetam (n = 145 patients), fosphenytoin (n = 118), or valproate (n = 121) in this setting. Results demonstrated that each agent led to seizure cessation and improved alertness by 1 hour in approximately 50% of patients, with no significant differences between groups ( Kapur et al 2019). A meta -analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam vs phenytoin as second -line treatment for benzodiazepine- resistant status epilepticus in children and adults. The efficacy outcomes included seizure cessation and seizure recurrence within 24 hours. The authors did not find a significant difference in efficacy between levetiracetam and phenytoin in the overall population or in the subgroup analysis of pediatric patients. AEs were similar across both groups except for a higher incidence of cardiac instability, reported mainly as hypotension, in the phenytoin group (DeMott et al 2020). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs I: treatment of new -onset epilepsy. American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( French et al 2004A, Kanner et al, 2018A ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on treatment of new -onset epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs. The 2004 publication summarizes the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, 47 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 13 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. tiagabine, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with newly diagnosed partial and generalized epilepsies. The r ecommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: Patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who require treatment can be initially treated with standard AEDs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate. Choice will depend on individual patient characteristics. Lamotrigine can be included in the options for children with newly diagnosed absence seizures. The 2018 recommendations include the following: As monotherapy in adult patients with new- onset focal epilepsy or unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures: Lamotrigine use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Lamotrigine use should be considered and gabapentin use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency in patients aged 60 years. Levetiracetam and zonisamide use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabatrin appears to be less efficacious than carbamazepine immediate -release and may not be offered; furthermore, the toxicity profile precludes vigabatrin use as fi rst-line therapy . Pregabalin 150 mg per day is possibly less efficacious than lamotrigine 100 mg per day . There is insufficient evidence to consider use of gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or topiramate over carbamazepine. There is insufficient evidence to consider use of topiramate instead of phenytoin in urgent treatment of new - onset or recurrent focal epilepsy, unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures, or generalized epilepsy presenting with generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Data are lacking to s upport or refute new-onset epilepsy. Data are lacking to support or refute use of newer AEDs in treating unclassified generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Ethosuximide or valproic acid should be considered before lamotrigine to decrease seizure frequency in children with absence epilepsy. An exception would be if there are compelling AE -related concerns with use of ethosuximide or valproic acid. The guideline does not address newly approved agents including cannabidiol, everolimus, or stiripentol. Efficacy and tolerability of the new antiepileptic drugs II: treatment of refractory epilepsy . American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Kanner et al 2018B , French et al 2004B ). A 2018 update to the 2004 guideline focuses on management of treatment -resistant epilepsy with second and third generation AEDs . The 2004 publication s ummarizes the oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and zonisamide for the treatment of children and adults with refractory partial and generalized epilepsies. Recommendations from the 2004 guideline include the following: It is appropriate to use gabapentin, levetiracetam, with refractory epilepsy. Oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and lamotrigine can be used as monotherapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Topiramate may be used for the treatment of refractory generalized tonic -clonic seizures in adults and children. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate may be used as adjunctive treatment of children with refractory partial seizures . Topiramate and lamotrigine may be used to treat drop attacks associated with LGS in adults and children. Recommendations from the 2018 guideline include the following: As adjunctive therapy in patients with treatment -resistant adult focal epilepsy (TRAFE): Immediate -release pregabalin and perampanel are established as effective to reduce seizure frequency. Lacosamide, eslicarbazepine, and extended- release topiramate should be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Vigabat rin and rufinamide are effective for decreasing seizure frequency, but are not first-line agents . 48 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 14 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Ezogabine (no longer marketed) use should be considered to reduce seizure frequency, but carries a serious risk of skin and retinal discolorat ion. Clobazam and extended -release oxcarbazepine may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. As monotherapy in patients with TRAFE: Eslicarbazepine use may be considered to decrease seizure frequency. Data are insufficient to recommend use of second - and the other third- generation AEDs. For add- on therapy for generalized epilepsy, immediate- release and extended -release lamotrigine should be considered as add -on therapy to decrease seizure frequency in adults with treatment -resistant generalized tonic -clonic seizures secondary to generalized epilepsy. Levetiracetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency as add -on therapy for treatment -resistant generalized tonic -clonic seizures and for treatment -resistant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Rufinamide is effective to reduce seizure frequency as add -on therapy for LGS . Clobazam use should be considered as add -on therapy for LGS . For add- on therapy in pediatric patients with treatment -resistant focal epilepsy: Levetiracetam use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (ages 1 month to 16 years). Zonisamide use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (age 6 to 17 years). Oxcarbazepine use should be considered to decrease seizure frequency (age 1 month to 4 years). Data are unavailable on the efficacy of clobazam, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, perampanel, rufinamide, tiagabine, or vigabatrin.

Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society ( Krumholz et al 2015; reaffirmed in 2018 ). This practice guideline makes recommendations based on a consideration of the evidence for prognosis and treatment of adults with an unprovoked first seizure. Recommendations include the following: Adults presenting with an unprovoked first seizure should be informed that the chance for a recurrent seizure is greatest within the first 2 years after a first seizure (21% to 45%). Clinicians should also advise such patients that clinical factors associated with an increased risk of seizure recurrence include a prior brain insult such as a stroke or trauma, an EEG with epileptiform abnormalities, a significant brain- imaging abnormality, or a nocturnal seizure. Clinicians should advise patients that, although immediate AED therapy, as compared with delay of treatment pending a second seizure, is likely to reduce the risk of a seizure recurrence in the 2 years subsequent to a first seizure, it may not improve quality of life. Clinicians should advise patients that over the longer term (> 3 years), immediate AED treatment is unli kely to improve the prognosis for sustained seizure remission. Patients should be advised that their risk for AED AEs ranges from 7% to 31% and that these AEs are predominantly mild and reversible. Immediate AED therapy after an unprovoked first seizure is likely to reduce seizure recurrence risk. A reduction in risk may be important, particularly for adults, for whom seizure recurrences may cause serious psychological and social consequences such as loss of driving privileges and limitations on employment. However, immediate AED treatment is not well accepted and is debated. Decisions should be based on weighing the risk of recurrence against the AEs of AED therapy, and should take patient preferences into account. It is accepted that when a patient has a second or additional seizures, an AED should be initiated because the risk of subsequent seizures is very high. Evidence -based guideline: treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults. Guideline Committee of the American Epilepsy Society (Glauser et al 2016 ). This publication provides conclusions and a treatment algorithm based on a structured literature review of randomized trials of anticonvulsant treatments for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes. A total of 38 trials were included. For treatment in the adult population, conclusions included the following: Intramuscular (IM) midazolam, intravenous (IV) lorazepam, IV diazepam (with or without phenytoin), and IV phenobarbital are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. IV lorazepam is more effective than IV phenytoin in stopping seizures lasting at least 10 minutes. 49 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 15 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. There is no difference in efficacy between IV lorazepam followed by IV phenytoin, IV diazepam plus phenytoin followed by IV lorazepam, and IV phenobarbital followed by IV phenytoin. IV valproic acid has similar efficacy to IV phenytoin or continuous IV diazepam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in adults about the efficacy of levetiracetam as either initial or second therapy. In adults with status epilepticus without established IV access, IM midazolam is established as more effective compared with IV lorazepam. No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrated between lorazepam and diazepam in adults with status epilepticus. For treatment in the pediatric population, conclusions included the following: IV lorazepam and IV diazepam are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Rectal diazepam, IM mida zolam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes. Insufficient data exist in children about the efficacy of intranasal lorazepam, as initial therapy. IV valproic acid has similar efficacy but better tolerability than IV phenobarbital as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. Insufficient data exist in children regarding the efficacy of phenytoin or levetiracetam as second therapy after failure of a benzodiazepine. In children with status epilepticus, no significant difference in effectiveness has been established between IV lorazepam and IV diazepam. In children with status epilepticus, non- IV midazolam (IM/intranasal/buccal) is probably more effective than diazepam (IV/rectal). Conclusions included the following (age not specified): Insufficient data exist about the comparative efficacy of phenytoin and fosphenytoin. Fosphenytoin is better tolerated compared with phenytoin. When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred based on tolerability, but phenytoin is an acceptable alternative. The overall treatment algorithm directs that: A benzodiazepine (IM midazolam, IV lorazepam, or IV diazepam) is recommended as the initial therapy of choice in the first phase of treatment (5 to 20 minutes after the beginning of the seizure). Although IV phenobarbital is established as efficacious and well tolerated as initial therapy, its slower rate of administration positions it as an alternative initial therapy. For prehospital settings or where first -line benzodiazepine options are not available, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are reasonable initial therapy alternatives. In the second phase of treatment (from 20 to 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure), reasonable options include fosphenytoin, valproic acid, and levetiracetam. There is no clear evidence that any of these options is better than the others. Because of AEs, IV phenobarbital is a reasonable second -therapy alternative if none of the 3 recommended therapies are available. There is no clear evidence to guide therapy in the third phase of therapy ( 40 minutes after the beginning of the seizure) . Evidence -based guideline update: medical treatment of infantile spasms. Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Go et al 2012; reaffirmed in 2018) This publication provides updated recommendations for the treatment of infantile spasm s. The literature review included an evaluation of 26 published articles on this topic. Recommendations include the following: Evidence is insufficient to recommend the use of prednisolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone as being as effective as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for short -term treatment of infantile spasm s. Low-dose ACTH should be considered as an alternative to high -dose ACTH for treatment of infantile spasms. ACTH or vigabatrin may be offered for short -term treatment of infantile spasms; evidence suggests that ACTH may be offered over vigabatrin. 50 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 16 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Evidence is insufficient to recommend other therapies (valproic acid, vitamin B6, nitrazepam [not ketogenic diet, or novel/combination therapies ) for treatment of infantile spasms. Hormonal therapy (ACTH or prednisolone) may be considered for use in preference to vigabatrin in infants with cryptogenic infantile spasms, to possibly improve developmental outcome. A shorter lag time to treatment of infantile spasms with either hormonal therapy or vigabatrin may be considered to improve long -term cognitive outcomes. There is a lack of sufficient randomized trials to provide definitive answers to key questions related to treatment of infantile spas ms. Practice parameter: treatment of the child with a first unprovoked seizure. Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society ( Hirtz et al 2003; reaffirmed in 2018 ) This parameter reviews published literature relevant to the decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescent experiences a first unprovoked seizure and presents evidence- based practice recommendations. Treatment during the neonatal period is not addressed. Recommendations include the following: Treatment with AEDs is not indicated for the prevention of the development of epilepsy. Treatment with AEDs may be considered in circumstances where the benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure outweigh the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial AEs. The majority of children who experience a first unprovoked seizure will have few or no recurrences. Treatment with AEDs after a first seizure as opposed to after a second seizure has not been shown to improve prognosis for long - term seizure remission. Treatment has been shown in several studies combining both children and adults to reduce the risk of s eizure recurrence; however, there is a relative paucity of data from studies involving only children after a first seizure. Summary of recommendations for the management of infantile seizures . Task force report for the ILAE Commission of Pediatrics ( Wilmshurst et al 2015). This publication recommends an approach to the standard and optimal management of infants with seizures. When possible, recommendations are evidence- based; however, when no evidence was available, recommendations are based on expert opinion and standard practice. Recommendations/findings include the following: There is no indication for initiation of chronic AEDs for simple febrile seizures. However, in the acute treatment of febrile seizures, it is important to treat seizures lasting 10 minutes or longer. In an otherwise healthy infant, a policy of \"wait and see\" is reasonable after the first afebrile seizure. However, this is a rare event and close monitoring is essential. Treatment options with established or probable efficacy include the following: Focal seizures: levetiracetam stiripentol or situational seizures: carbamazepine There is no clear evidence supporting an optimal duration of treatment; this is dependent on seizure type. Guidelines on neonatal seizures . World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO 2011). This d ocument was prepared based on a systematic review of the literature and involved cooperation between the WHO, the ILAE, and the International Bureau of Epilepsy (IBE). Recommendations include the following: Phenobarbital should be used as the first -line ag ent for treatment of neonatal seizure s and should be made readily available in all settings. 51 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 17 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. In neonates who continue to have seizures despite administering the maxim um tolerated dose of phenobarbital, either a benzodiazepine, phenytoin, or lidocaine may be used as the second-line agent for control of seizures (use of phenytoin or lidocaine requires cardiac monitoring). In neonates with a normal neurological examination and/or normal EEG, stopping AEDs may be considered if the neonate has been seizure -free for > 72 hours; the drug(s) should be reinstituted if seizures recur . In neonates in whom seizure control is achieved with a single AED, the drug can be discontinued abruptly without tapering the dose. In neonates requiring > 1 AED for seizure control, the drugs may be stopped one at a time , with phenobarbital being the last drug to be withdrawn. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epilepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence - based review): teratogenesis and perinatal outcomes. Quality Standards Subcommittee and Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009A ; reaffirmed in 2013; Update in progress ) This publication summarizes evidence for selected issues regarding the clinical management of women with epilepsy (WWE) who are pregnant or plan ning to be pregnant . Recommendations include the following: If possible, avoidance of the use of valproate as part of polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy should be considered to decrease the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs). If possible, avoidance of the use of valproate monotherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy may be considered to decrease t he risk of MCMs. To reduce the risk of MCMs, the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy should be avoided, if possible, compared to the use of carbamazepine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of polytherapy with valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, should be considered, compared to polytherapy without valproate. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of valproate during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, may be considered, compared to the use of phenytoin or lamotrigine. To reduce the risk of MCMs, avoidance of the use of AED polytherapy during the first trimester of pregnancy, if possible, compared to monotherapy should be considered. Limiting the dosage of valproate or lamotrigine during the first trimester, if possible, should be considered to lessen the risk of MCMs. Avoidance of the use of valproate, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and facial clefts , and may be considered to reduce the risk of hypospadias. Avoidance of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of specific MCMs: cleft palate for phenytoin use, posterior cleft palate use, and cardiac malformations for phenobarbital use. Carbamazepine exposure probably does not produce cognitive impairment in offspring of WWE. Avoiding valproate in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, should be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Avoiding phenytoin and phenobarbital in WWE during pregnancy, if possible, may be considered to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Monotherapy should be considered in place of polytherapy, if possible, for WWE who take AEDs during pregnancy to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, should be considered compared to carbamazepine to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. For WWE who are pregnant, avoidance of valproate, if possible, may be considered compared to phenytoin to reduce the risk of poor cognitive outcomes. Valproate has the most data showing an association with risk from in utero exposure. If a change from valproate to another AED is planned, it is prudent to make this change well before pregnancy. Although many of the recommendations in this parameter suggest minimizing AED exposure during pregnancy, for most WWE, discontinuing AEDs is not a reasonable or safe option. Discontinuing AEDs may expose the mother and fetus to physical injury from accidents due to seizure activity. Practice parameter update: management issues for women with epilepsy - focus on pregnancy (an evidence - based review): vitamin K, folic acid, blood levels, and breastfeeding.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society ( Harden et al 2009B ; reaffirmed in 2013; Update in progress ) This publication summarizes evidence for selected issues regarding the clinical management of WWE who are pregnant or planning to be pregnant . Recommendations include the following: placenta may be factored into the clinical decision regarding the necessity of AED treatment for a woman with epilepsy. Monitoring of lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and phenytoin levels during pregnancy should be considered. Monitoring of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine (as monohydroxy derivative) levels during pregnancy may be considered. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute a change in phenobarbital, valproate, primidone, or ethosuximide levels related to pregnancy, but this lack of evidence should not discourage monitoring levels of these AEDs during pregnancy. Valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine may not transfer into breast milk to as great an extent as primidone, levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Although many of the AEDs were shown to cross the placenta or enter breast milk, studies were limited in duration and did not systematically evaluate neonatal symptoms. Guidelines also support the use of AEDs for several common non- epilep sy indications: The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society state that AEDs with established efficacy for migraine prevention include valproate, divalproex sodium, and topiramate; carbamazepine to y effective ( Silbers tein et al 2012; reaffirmed in 2015; Update in progress ). An American Academy of Neurology guideline for pediatric migraine prevention noted that children and adolescents with migraine receiving topiramate are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a reduction in migraine or headache day frequency, whereas there was insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of extended -release divalproex sodium for reducing frequency (Oskoui et al 2019). The American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine, and American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation state that, for relief of painful diabetic neuropathy, pregabalin is established as effective, and gabapentin and valproate are probably effective ( Bril et al 2011; Update in progress ). A retired guideline from The American Academy of Neurology states that gabapentin and pregabalin are of benefit in reducing pain from postherpetic neuralgia ( Dubinsky et al 2004; retired February 27 , 2018 ). American Psychiatric Association guidelines describe the key role of AEDs in the management of bipolar disorder, including the following (Hirschfeld et al 2002 ): First-line pharmacological treatment for more severe manic or mixed episodes is either lithium plus an antipsychotic or valproate plus an antipsychotic; for less ill patients, monotherapy with lithium, valproate, or an antipsychotic may be sufficient. For mixed episodes, valproate may be preferred over lithium. Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are alternatives. First-line pharmacological treatment for bipolar depression is either lithium or lamotrigine. When an acute depressive episode of bipolar disorder does not respond to first -line medication treatment, the next steps include adding lamotrigine, bupropion, or paroxetine. The initial treatment for patients who experience rapid cycling should include lithium or valproate; an alternative is lamotrigine. The medications with the best empirical evidence to support their use in maintenance treatment include lithium and valproate; possible alternatives include lamotrigine, carbamazepine, or oxcarbazepine. Note: This guideline was published in 2002 and cannot be assumed to be current; however, AEDs continue to be recommended for both acute (mania or hypomania) and maintenance phases of bipolar disorder (Post 2017, Stovall 2018 ). SAFETY SUMMARY Tolerability and safety are as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment (Schachter 2019). 53 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 19 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients. The contents of the therapeutic class overviews on this website (\"Content\") are for informational purposes only. The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Common AEs among AEDs include the following (Fintepla prescribing information 2020, Schachter 2019): anxiety , nervousness, insomnia aggression, irritability, hyperactivity depression, mood alteration confusion ataxia blurred or double vision Examples of r are but serious AEs include the following ( Schachter 2019, individual package inserts ): suicidal ideation and behavior (AED s as a cla and cardiac arrest (phenytoin) abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signals in infants (vigabatrin) intramyelinic edema (vigabatrin) serotonin syndrome (fenfluramine) significant including hypertensive crisis (fenfluramine) A number of AEDs carry boxed warnings related to potentially serious AEs; these include the following: Carbamazepine: Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including TEN and SJS, have been reported. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA -B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA -B gene. Patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations (across broad areas of Asia) should be screened for the presence of HLA -B*1502 prior to initiating treatment with carbamazepine. Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported. If a patient exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops. Clobazam, c lonazepam , clorazepate, diazepam , and midazolam : Concomitant use of benzodiazepine s and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Concomitant prescribing should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative 54 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 20 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. treatment options are inadequate, and patients should be followed for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Felbamate: Use is associated with a marked increase in the incidence of aplastic anemia. Felbamate should only be used in patients whose epilepsy is so severe that the risk of aplastic anemia is deemed acceptable. Routine blood testing cannot be reliably used to reduce the incidence of aplastic anemia, but it will in some cases allow detection of hematologic changes before the syndrome declares itself clinically. Felbamate should be discontinued if any evidence of bone marrow depression occurs. Cases of acute liver failure have been reported. Felbamate should not be prescribed for anyone with a history of hepatic dysfunction. Treatment should be initiated only in individuals without active liver disease and with norm al baseline serum transaminases. It has not been proven that periodic serum transaminase testing will prevent serious injury, but it is generally believed that early detection of drug -induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery. Serum transaminases should be monitored at baseline and periodically thereafter. Felbamate should be discontinued if either aspartate aminotransferase (AST ) or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) become increased to 2 times the upper limit of normal, or if clinical signs and symptoms suggest liver failure, and should not be considered for retreatment. Fenfluramine: Use of serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity (eg, f enfluramine) is associated with valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Echocardiogram assessments are required before, during, and after treatment with fenfluramine, and the benefits vs risks of initiating or continuing treatment with this product must be considered based on echocardiogram findings. Due to the risks of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, fenfluramine is available only through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program ( FDA REMS 2020 ). Healthcare providers who pres cribe fenfluramine and pharmacies that dispense the product must be certified. Each patient must be enrolled in the REMS program. Prescribers must ensure that periodic cardiovascular monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of valvular heart disease and/or pulmonary hypertension to the fenfluramine REMS program. Fosphenytoin and phenytoin: There is a cardiovascular risk associated with rapid IV infusion rates. The rate of administration should not exceed recommendations, and careful cardiac monitoring is required. Lamotrigine: Cases of life -threatening serious skin rashes, including SJS and TEN, and/or rash-related death have been caused by lamotrigine. Benign rashes are also caused by lamotrigine; however, it is not possible to predict which ras hes will prove to be serious. Lamotrigine should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. Perampanel: Serious or life -threatening psychiatric and behavioral AEs including aggression, hostility, irritability, anger, and homicidal ideation and threats have been reported. Patients should be monitored for these reactions and for changes in mood, behavior, or personality. The dose should be reduced if these symptoms occur, and it should be discontinued if symptoms are severe or worsening. Valproic acid and divalproex sodium : Hepatoto xicity, including fatalities, have been reported, usually during the first 6 months of treatment. Serum liver tests are required and patients should be monitored closely. There is an increased risk of valproate - induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with mitochondrial disease. Valproic acid and divalproex sodium are contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by polymerase gamma (POLG) gene mutation s, and in children < 2 years of age who are suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder. There is a risk to fetuses exposed in utero, particularly neural tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased intelligenc e quotient (IQ). Valproate should not be given to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition, and women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Pancreatitis, including fatal hemorrhagic cases, has occurred. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. 55 Data as of August 4, 2020 KM-U/KS-U/AKS Page 21 of 28 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Vigabatrin: Vigabatrin can cause permanent bilateral conc entric visual field constriction, including tunnel vision that can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin may also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Baseline and periodic vision assessment are recommended. However, this assessment cannot always prevent vision damage, and once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. Vigabatrin should be withdrawn from patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit. Due to the risks of vision loss, vigabatrin is available only through a REMS program (FDA REMS 2020). Healthcare providers who prescribe vigabatrin and pharmacies that dispense the product must be specially certified. Each patient must be enrolled in the REMS program. Prescribers must ensure that periodic visual monitoring is performed and report any AE suggestive of vision loss to the vigabatrin REMS program. Everolimus is an antineoplastic, immunosuppressant agent associated with several AEs. The most common AE that occurred in trials for TSC-associated partial -onset seizures was stomatitis. More serious AEs include: non-infectious pneumonitis -converting enzyme inhibitor) renal failure impaired wound healing myelosuppression reduced immune response with vaccination hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia embryo -fetal toxicity DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION General dosing information is provided in Table 3.

These products vary in terms of their indications for specific seizure types and indications other than epilepsy. Overall, the anticonvulsants have demonstrated efficacy for their FDA -approved uses. When possible, monotherapy with a single AED is the preferred treatment approach. Patients who are refractory to monotherapy may be treated with combination therapy. When considering combination therapy, it is recommended to combine medications with different mechanisms of action and AE profiles. Comparative efficacy data for the management of epilepsy are limited. Tolerability and safety are as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. Both systemic AEs and neurologic AEs commonly occur. Some AEDs are associated with rare but serious AEs, and careful patient selection and monitoring are required. Epilepsy management can be complex and is often performed by neurologists. A variety of AEDs should be available to allow clinicians to select the most clinically appropriate agent for individual patients. Anticonvulsants are also established as effective for several non- epilepsy indications, including (but not limited to) bipolar disorder, migraine prophylaxis, and neuropathic Eisai Inc.; April 2020.

Endnotes A. There were two major Phase 2/3 trials that the FDA assessed when determining Evrysdi's clinical efficacy and subsequent approval (SUNFISH and FIREFISH). SUNFISH only enrolled patients with SMA Types 2 and 3 and FIREFISH only enrolled patients with SMA Type 1. [2-3] B. This is the definition that the clinical trials SUNFISH and FIREFISH used. Also consistent with clinical guidelines. [2 -7] C. FIREFISH required patients to have 2 copies of SMN2, and SUNFISH only enrolled patients with 2-4 copies of SMN2. [2 -3] D. Invasive ventilation or tracheostomy was an exclusion criteria in both the SUNFISH and FIREFISH trials. Use of non-invasive ventilation beyond use for naps and nighttime sleep was only an exclusion criteria in FIREFISH. [2-3] E. MFM-32 was included in Evrysdi criteria but not Spinraza because Spinraza did not study MFM -32 as an endpoint. Baseline motor score standards was only used as an inclusion criterion for SUNFISH. Revised upper limb module (RULM) entry item A (Brooke score) equal to or greater than 2 AND MFM-32 (Item 9) scores equal to or greater than 1 were required. As this was only for the SUNFISH trial and only applied to some of the motor scores, it was deemed unnecessary to include as a criterion. [2] F. A recent European ad-hoc consensus statement on SMA stated that there currently is no published evidence that the combination of two disease modifying therapies (e.g., Evrysdi and Zolgensma) is superior to any single treatment alone. Both FIREFISH and SUNFISH excluded patients that were on concomitant or previous treatment with either SMN2 -targeting antisense oligonucleotide, or gene therapy (e.g., Spinraza or Zolgensma). JEWELFISH is an ongoing open label phase 2 trial that included patients previously treated with another SMA targeted therapy (e.g., Zolgensma, Spinraza). JEWELFISH is scheduled to be completed in December 2024. [2-3,10-11] 4 . References 1. Evrysdi prescribing information. Genentech, Inc. South San Francisco, CA. August 2020. 2.

Therapeutic Class Overview Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Agents INTRODUCTION Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a serious neuromuscular disease characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, leading to progressive muscular atrophy and weakness ( Genetics Home Reference 2020, Mercuri et al 2018 [a]). SMA is caused by an inherited genetic mutation, and is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality (Bodamer 2020). SMA is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. The overall incidence is between 4 and 10 per 100,000 live births, and 1 person in 50 to 90 is a carrier of a mutation that can cause SMA ( Bodamer 2020 ). The SMN1 gene is responsible for the production of SMN protein, which is ubiquitously expressed in all cells throughout fetal and post -natal development. Deletion or mutations in the SMN1 gene lead to a shortage of the protein . Without this protein, motor neurons degenerate and nerve impulses are not carried between the brain and muscles , resulting in characteristic muscle weakness and impaired movement (Bodamer 2020, Finkel et al 2018, Genetics Home Reference 2020 ). There is also a modifying (or \"backup\") gene called SMN2 , which generates a smaller amount of functional SMN protein. The number of SMN2 gene copies varies among individuals, and patients with a higher number of SMN2 gene copies tend to have a less sever e SMA type (Bodamer 2020, Calucho et al 2018). There are several forms of SMA with varying degrees of severity and ages of onset ( Bodamer 2020, Genetics Home Reference 2020, Glascock et al 2018, , Rao et al 2018). In SMA type 1, untreated patients have severe weakness and hypotonia and never gain the ability to sit unsupported. Patients with SMA type 1 typically have an onset of symptoms between the age of 0 and 6 months, and have a typical lifespan of < 2 years without permanent ventilation. Patients wit h SMA type 2 (intermediate), 3 (mild), or 4 (adult -onset) experience a later onset and less severe symptoms usually characterized by varying degrees of muscle weakness. Type 0 (prenatal) is the rarest and most severe form, with ne wborns typically living for < 6 months. SMA type 1 is the most common form, affecting approximately 58% of patients. Type 2 and type 3 occur in approximately 29% and 13% of patients, respectively, and type 4 is less common (< 5%) ( Food and Drug Administration [FDA] medical review 2 016). Mothers may notice a decrease of fetal movement in late pregnancy, and some experts classify prenatal onset as type 0 SMA, which is very rare (Bodamer 2020, FDA medical review 2016). Management of SMA has historically been limited to supportive measures, focusing on providing nutrition and respiratory assistance and preventing or treating the complications of weakness. Nonpharmacologic treatments include physical therapy, spinal bracing, chest physiotherapy, and respiratory support ( Bodamer 2020, Finkel e t al 2018, Mercuri 2018[a] ). In December 2016, Spinraza (nusinersen ) became the first FDA- approved product for the treatment of SMA. The FDA granted nusinersen Fast Track designation, Orphan Drug designation, and Priority Review ( FDA 2016 ). Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Nusinersen binds to sites within SMN2 pre-mRNA, promoting inclusion of exon 7 in SMN2 mRNA transcripts and increasing production of full -length, functional protein (Finkel et al xioi; referred to as onasemnogene abeparvovec), approved by the FDA in May 2019, is the second FDA- approved product for the treatment of SMA . Onasemnogene abeparvovec was granted Priority Review by the FDA, and received Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug designations ( FDA 2019 ). Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a gene therapy that uses a viral vector to deliver a copy of the gene encoding the human SMN protein. The virus enters the nucleus of neurons and forms an episome (a DNA molecule that replicates independently of chromosomal DNA). The episome is transcribed and translated to produce the missing SMN protein. Evrysdi (risdiplam), approved by the FDA in August 2020, is the third FDA- approved product for the treatment of SMA. Risdiplam was granted Priority Review by the FDA, and received Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations. Risdiplam is a splicing modifier that increases exon 7 inclusion in the SMN2 mRNA transcripts, thereby increasing production of full -length SMN protein ( Evrysdi prescribing information 2020 ). 76 Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 2 of 10 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

The use of onasemnogene abeparvovec in patients with advanced SMA (eg, complete paralysis of limbs, permanent ventilator dependence) has not been evaluated. Information on indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and safety has been obtained from the prescribing information for the individual products, except where noted otherwise. CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec -xioi) The safety and efficacy of onasemnogene abeparvovec were evaluated in 3 clinical trials, START, STR1VE and SPR1NT. START was a phase 1, open- label trial of 15 patients with SMA type 1 who had 2 copies of SMN2. Two cohorts were treated: 3 patients in cohort 1 received a low dose of Zolgensma, while 12 patients in cohort 2 received a high dose of Zolgensma. After 24 months of treatment, all patients in cohort 2 were alive and none required permanent ventilati on (described as 16 hours per day of required ventilatory support for 14 consecutive days in the absence of acute reversible illness or perioperative change). One patient in group 1 reached a pulmonary event at 28.8 months of age. Patients also had improvement in meeting certain motor milestones, with the majority gaining the ability to sit unassisted, roll over, and achieve head control. Gains in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP -INTEND) were also noted ( Al-Zaidy et al 2019, Mendell et al 2017) . Ten of the 12 patients in cohort 2 enrolled in the START long -term follow -up (LTFU) study. As of December 31, 2019, all 10 patients were alive and free of permanent ventilation, no previously -achieved motor milestone had been lost, and 2 patients gained a new milestone of standing with assistance. There were no new treatment -related serious adverse effects (AEs ) and no AEs of special interest during the LTFU study. Some of the patients in the LTFU study have received subsequent therapy with nusinersen ( multicenter trial in the U.S that evaluat ed the safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in patients with SMA type 1 who were < 6 months of age at the time of gene therapy, with 1 or 2 copies of SMN2 and who had bi-allelic SMN1 gene deletion or point mutations. Data as of March 8, 2019 (median duration of follow- up, 10.2 months) show ed that of 20 patients who reached 10.5 months of age or discontinued the study prior to 10.5 months of age, 19 (95%) were surviving without permanent 77 Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 3 of 10 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Of 15 patients who had reached 13.6 months of age or discontinued prior to 13.6 months, 13 (87%) were surviving without permanent ventilation (Day et al 2019 ). According to updated data provided by the manufacturer in March 2020, 20 of 22 patients (91%) met the co- primary endpoint of event -free survival at 14 months, and 13 of 22 patients (59%) met the co -primary endpoint of functional sitting for 30 seconds at 18 months of age. Sustained improvements in CHOP -INTEND scores were also noted (Novartis 2020 [a]). SPR1NT is an ongoing, Phase 3, open -label, single -arm, multicenter trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zolgensma in pre- symptomatic patients with SMA and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 who were 6 weeks of age. The primary outcome measure for patients with 2 copies of SMN2 is independent sitting for 30 seconds by 18 months. The primary outcome measure for patients with 3 copies of SMN2 is standing without support for at least 3 seconds by 24 months (Avexis 2019, Strauss et al 2019). As of December 31, 2019, 14 patients with 2 copies of SMN2 and 15 patients with 3 copies of SMN2 had been treated. In the 2- copy cohort, 8 patients so far were able to sit independently for 30 seconds (range, 5.7 to 11.8 months of age), and 4 patients were able to walk independently. Of the patients with 3 copies of SMN2 , 4 patients were able to stand alone without support for 3 seconds (9.5 to 12.4 months of age) and 3 patients were able to walk independently (12.2 to 15.1 months of age). Patients in both cohorts who had not achieved these milestones yet were still within the normal age development window for these milestones ( Novartis 2020[a] ). Zolgensma is still being studied in a number of trials in pursuit of expanding patient populations. Of note, the STRONG trial is a Phase 1 trial investigating intrathecal delivery in children with SMA type 2 aged 6 months to 5 years (Clinicaltrials.gov 2020 ). Based on their review of data from STRONG, the FDA has notified the manufacturer that they recommend a pivotal confirmatory study to supplement the STRONG data in order to s upport a regulatory submission for intrathecal use ( Novartis 2020[b]) . Spinraza (nusinersen) Key clinical supporting the safety and efficacy of nusinersen include ENDEAR, CHERISH, and NURTURE . The pivotal trial ENDEAR (N = 121) was a 13-month , Phase 3, randomized, sham -controlled, double- blind, multicenter trial in patients 7 months or younger who had an onset of SMA symptoms at 6 months of age and had homozygous deletion or mutation of SMN1 and 2 copies of the SMN2 gene ( Finkel et al 2017 ). At interim analysis, a higher proportion of patients treated with nusinersen had a motor milestone response than those in the control group (41% vs 0%, p < 0.001 ), prompting early termination of the trial . The final analysis showed that 51% of the nusinersen -treated group had a motor milestone response, compared with no patients in the control group. Motor milestones reached included achievement of full head control (22%), ability to roll over (10%), ability to sit independently (8%), and ability to stand (1%). A co-primary endpoint of event -free survival also favored nusinersen vs placebo (61% vs 32% ; p = 0.005). Patients in the nusinersen group also had a 63% lower risk of death compared with the control group (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.77; p = 0.004). CHERISH (N = 126) was a Phase 3, randomized, sham -controlled, double- blind, multicenter trial in patients aged 2 to 12 years with later -onset SMA. The primary endpoint was the least -squares mean change from baseline in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale- Expanded (HFMSE) score at 15 months of treatment (Mercuri 2018[b ]). In the pre-planned interim analysi s, there was a significant improvement in the H FMSE from baseline to 15 months in the nusinersen group vs the control group (mean difference in change, 5.9 points; 95% CI, 3.7 to 8.1; p < 0.001 ). Results of the final analysis were consistent with results of the interim analysis. In the final analysis, 57% of the children in the nusinersen group vs 26% in the control group had an increase from baseline to month 15 in the HFMSE score of at least 3 points ( p < 0.001), and the overall incidence of AEs was similar in the nusinersen group and the control group (93% vs 100%, respectively). The NURTURE study is an ongoing, Phase 2, open -label , single -arm trial to evaluate the use of nusinersen in patients w ith SMA and 2 or 3 copies of SMN2 who were 6 weeks of age and asymptomatic at the time of treatment initiation The primary endpoint was time to death or respiratory intervention (invasive or non -invasive for 6 hours per day continuously for 7 days or tracheostomy) . At an interim analysis published in 2019, 25 patients had been enrolled, of whom 15 had 2 SMN2 copies and 10 had 3 SMN2 copies . At the time of the interim analysis, 4 participants (16%) had utilized a respiratory intervention. All patients were alive and none required permanent ventilation. Efficacy was further supported by the achievement of motor milestones by HINE -2 and motor function by CHOP -INTEND. Of note, all patients achieved the milestone of \"sitting without support\" and 23 of 25 patients (92%) achieved \"walking with assistance\" (De Vivo et al 2019 ). 78 Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 4 of 10 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. In June 2020, the manufacturer reported updated data noting that all children treated pre -symptomatically were alive and none required permanent ventilation after up to 4.8 years of continuous treatment . In addition, patients continued to maintain and make progressive gains in motor function. The study has been extended by an additional 3 years to allow the collection of continued data ( Biogen 2020). The FDA -approved indication for nusinersen does not limit its use to certain ages or SMA types. The FDA medical review noted that the underlying cause of SMA (a shortage of SMN protein) is common to patients with all SMA types, and it is reasonable to expect that nusinersen should provide clinical benefits in all SMA types . Open- label studies included patients 2 to 17 years of age with 2 to 5 SMN2 copies and symptom onset corresponding to types 2 and 3 SMA; these results plus the initial summary of the sham -controlled trial in later -onset patients support the conclusion that nusinersen provides clinical benefits to patients with types 2 and 3 SMA and allow reasonable extrapolation to these populations. Given the invasive nature of nusinersen administration, patients with milder forms of SMA (type 4) may need to weigh potential benefits, risks and discomfort, and relative symptom severity to make individual treatment decisions ( FDA medical review 2016). Evrysdi (risdiplam) Evidence for the safety and efficacy of risdiplam is available from results of 2 clinical trials, FIREFISH and SUNFISH . Both stu dies ar e still ongoing. FIREFISH is a 2-part, Phase 2/3, open- label, multicenter, dose- escalation study assess ing the safety and tolerability of risdiplam in infantile- onset SMA type 1 patients aged 1 to 7 months . In part 1, 21 infants were assigned to group A (n = 4) receiving a low dose or group B (n = 17 ) recieiving a high dose that was adjusted up to the recommended dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day . Of the infants who were treated with the recommended dosage of risdiplam 0.2 mg/kg/day, 7 of 17 ( 41%) were able to sit independently for 5 seconds as assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler development Third Edition (BSID -III) after 12 months of treatment, a milestone beyond that expected in the natural history of the disease. Additionally, 90% of patients (19/21) were alive without permanent ventilation (and reached 15 months of age or older) ( Evrysdi prescribing information 2020) . The most common AEs included pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, diarrhea , vomiting, pneumonia and constipation ( Evrysdi AMCP Dossier 2020). The manufacturer announced 2- year data for FIREFISH part 1, noting t hat an estimated 88% of patients were alive and required no permanent ventilation after 2 years . Patients continued to achieve motor milestones, including 59% (10/17) sitting without support for 5 seconds, 65% (11/17) maintaining upright head control, 29 % (5/17) turning over, and 30% (5/17) standing either supporting weight or with support. No new safety signals were identified ( Genentech 2020). Part 2 is a pivotal single- arm study evaluating the use of risdiplam in 41 infants with SMA type 1 for 24 months . Infants received risdipla m at a dose of 5 mg once daily for patients with a body weight 20 kg or 0.25 mg/kg for patients with a body weight < 20 kg. The primary outcome is the proportion of infants sitting without support for 5 seconds after 12 months on treatment a s assessed by BSID -III. A primary analysis at 12 months (November 2019) showed that 12/41 infants (29%; 90% CI , 17.8% to 43.1%) were sitting without support for 5 seconds. After 24 months in part 2, infants will continue in a open -label extension phase (Evrysdi AMCP Dossier 2020). SUNFISH is a 2 -part, double- blind, placebo- controlled trial in children and young adults age d 2 to 25 years old with SMA type 2 and 3 ( Evrysdi AMCP Dossier 2020). Part 1 (N = 51) was a dose -finding phase evaluating safety and tolerability of risdiplam. Patients received risdiplam or placebo for a minimum of 12 weeks, followed by open-label use of risdiplam at the dose selected for Part 2. Exploratory results at 12 months showed improvements in motor function compared to natural history . In Part 2 , 180 patients were randomized (type 2, 71%; type 3, 29%) to risdiplam or placebo for 24 months followed by an open -label extension period. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in motor function measure 32 scale (MFM -32) at month 12; the average baseline MFM -32 score was 45 in the risdiplam group vs 47 in the placebo group. The primary analysis showed a statistically significant 1.36-point increase from baseline MFM -32 score in the risdiplam group (95% CI , 0.61 to 2.11) compared to a -0.19- point change in the placebo group (95% CI, -1.22 to 0.84). The most common AEs that occurred in > 10% of risdiplam -treated patients and more commonly than with placebo were fever , diarrhea, and headache. The most common serious AE in the risdiplam arm was pneumonia in 9 patients. There was a trend for more grade 3 to 4 AEs in the risdiplam group. A dditional studies of risdiplam are ongoing ( Evrysdi AMCP Dossier 2020). JEWELFISH is a Phase 2, open -label, exploratory study investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of risdiplam in 174 patients 6 79 Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 5 of 10 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

RAINBOWFISH, which is currently enrolling patients, is a Phase 2, open- label study evaluating the use of risdiplam in pre- symptomatic SMA patients up to 6 weeks of age at the time of treatment initiation. Other studies A recent observational cohort study showed benefit of nusinersen for adults aged 16 to 65 years with SMA. A clinically meaningful improvement (defined as an increase of 3 points or more in the HFMSE score compared to baseline) was observed with nusinersen treatment at 6 months in 35 of 124 patients (28 %), at 10 months in 33 of 92 patients (36%) , and at 14 months in 23 of 57 patients (40 %) (Hagenacker 2020 ). A Cochrane review of 2 randomized controlled trial s assessed the safety and efficacy of drug therapies (nusinersen and riluzole) designed to slow or stop the progression of SMA type 1. Riluzole is not indicated for the treatment of SMA. Authors concluded that intrathecal nusinersen probably prolongs ventilation free and overall survival in i nfants with SMA type 1. Additionally, a greater proportion of infants treated with nusinersen achieved motor milestones. In the riluzole trial, 3 of 7 children treated with riluzole were still alive at the ages of 30, 48, and 64 months, whereas all 3 children in the placebo group died. None of the children in the riluzole or placebo group developed the ability to sit, which was the only milestone reported in the study ( Wadman et al 2019). A Cochrane review of 14 randomized controlled trial s evaluated the efficacy of various drug treatment s, most of which are not indicated for the treatment of SMA, to slow the disease progression of SMA types 2 and 3. The trials evaluated gabapentin, hydroxyurea, nusinersen, olesoxime, valproic acid/acetyl -L-cartinine. Treatment varied from 3 to 24 months. Overally, no treatment showed a clinically important effect on motor function in SMA types 2 or 3, except for intrathecal nusinersen, which showed a 3.7 -point improvement in motor function in children with SMA type 2 based on the HFMSE scale with moderate quality evidence (Wadman et al 2020 ). CLINICAL GUIDELINES SMA Newborn Screening Working Group. Treatment algorithm for infants diagnosed with SMA through newborn screening ( Glascock et al 2018) Clinical and preclinical data indicate that early treatment will be critical in order to modulate the rapid, progressive degeneration seen in SMA, particularly SMA type 1. Animal studies also show that the best results occur when drugs are given as early as possible. Recommendations for the use of SMN -upregulating treatment for patients with a confirmed positive result for SMA on newborn screening are based on the number of SMN2 copies, as follows: 1 SMN2 copy: probable SMA type 0. Treatment is recommended if the patient is truly pre -symptomatic. If symptoms are present, physician discretion is recommended. (Most patients with 1 copy of SMN2 will be symptomat ic at birth.) 2 SMN2 copies: probable SMA type 1. Treatment is recommended. 3 SMN2 copies: probable SMA type 2 or type 3. Treatment is recommended. 4 SMN2 copies: probable SMA type 3 or type 4. Waiting to treat is recommended; patients should be monitored and treated upon the onset of symptoms. (The committee was divided on this recommendation .) In patients with 4 copies of SMN2 , who are not immediately treated with a disease -modifying therapy for SMA, the following key recommendations are made: Infants identified as having 4 SMN2 copies should be referred to someone who can identify their exact copy number (some commercial laboratories report the result only as \" 4\"). Routine follow -up care should ideally occur every 3 to 6 months until the patient reaches 2 years of age, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. This would ensure the detection of very rare cases in which children with 4 SMN2 copies have SMA type 1 or 2. Certain follow -up assessments recommended include electromyography (EMG), compound muscle action potential (CMAP), myometry, physical examinations, and motor function scales. The working group acknowledges that the future availability of new FDA -approved therapies will prompt the need for additional consideration by physicians and patients, as each drug will present unique benefits, risks, and burdens. 80 Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 6 of 10 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Part 1: recommendations for diagnosis, rehabilitation, orthopedic, and nutritional care ( Mercuri et al 2018[a]) and Part 2: pulmonary and acute care; medications, supplements, and immunizations; other organ systems; and ethics (Finkel et al 2018). The following recommendations outline aspects associated with supportive pharmacological care: Over the last decade, the approach to treating the pulmonary manifestations of SMA has become more proactive, with introduction of therapies earlier in the disease process. Respiratory support should be the highest priority. Management may include airway clearance, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and tracheotomy ventilation in select patients. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should not be used routinely. European ad -hoc consensus statement on gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (Kirschner et al 2020 ). With the recent approval of Zolgensma, many patients could be eligible for the gene therapy with the broadly defined approved indication. However, clinical trials studied very specific patient groups for gene therapy (eg, SMA type, age and weight), thus individual treatment decisions should be made on a case -by-case basis. T he statement of 11 points highlights 3 areas including selection criteria, structural requirements for administration, and generation of additional evidence. Key points are as follows: Selection criteria: Traditional SMA types (0 to 4) alone are not enough to define patients who would most benefit from gene therapy. Age at onset, disease duration, and motor function status are key factors that predict response to treatment in symptomatic patients, whereas treatment decisions for presymptomatic patients should primarily be based on SMN2 copy number. Although the approval of Zolgensma is based on clinical trials in patients 6 months old weighing less than 8.4 kg, it is indicated in patients up to 2 years old. However , little is known about the safety and efficacy in older and heavier patients; in these cases nusinersen is available as a treatment option. When administered after the age of 6 months and/or in advanced stages of the disease, caregivers should be made aware that there are no published data on efficacy and safety. It is important for physicians to discuss the benefit/risk ratio and to carefully manage parents' or patients' expectations . In patients presenting with severe symptomatic disease, there is a high risk of living with severe disability despite the use of gene therapy. Palliative care is recommended as an alternative treatment option in these patients. There is no evidence that combination therapy (eg, Zolgensma plus nusinersen) is superior to any single treatment alone. Before more evidence is available, combination of both approved therapies should not be part of routine care. Structural requirements for administration: P roviders performing gene therapy should have broad expertise in the assessment and treatment of SMA according to international standards. The ideal time between diagnosis and initiation of a disease modifying treatment should be no longer than 14 days. This is particularly important in infants due to the progressive nature of the disease. Generation of additional evidence: Data regarding safety and effectiveness should be collected for all treated patients. Institutions using Zolgensma should be adequately equipped with resources to safely administer the therapy and provide care and long- term monitoring. The statement suggests that patients weighing 13.5 kg may be best treated with Zolgensma in a clinical trial setting only.

CONCLUSION SMA is a serious neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem. Clinical features include progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. SMA is caused by an inherited genetic mutation affecting the SMN1 gene, causing a deficiency of the critical SMN protein. Several subtypes of SMA exist, with varying severity and ages of onset. 82 Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 8 of 10 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Zolgensma has the potential to significantly improve the disease course of SMA with a 1- time IV dose. Published efficacy data are limited to approximately 15 patients, all of whom had SMA type 1 and 2 copies of a modifying gene, SMN2 . Zolgensma is a gene therapy that uses a viral vector to deliver a copy of the gene encoding the human SMN protein. The main safety risk s include elevated transaminases and potential acute serious liver injury. Nusinersen has demonstrated efficacy in patients with SMA types 1, 2, and 3 and in pre -symptomatic patients; however, nusinersen requires intrathecal dosing several times per year throughout the patient's lifetime. In pivotal trials, risdiplam improved motor function in people living with SMA over a large range of ages and levels of disease severity including types 1, 2, and 3. Risdiplam helped infants survive longer without the need for permanent ventilation and sit without support for 5 seconds , a key motor milestone not normally seen in the natural course of the disease. Risdiplam is an oral medication that is administered by the patient/caregiver, compared to intrathecal (nusinersen) and IV ( Zolgensma ) which require a healthcare professional. The specific place in therapy for each SMA agent, including the potential role for sequential treatment, requires further study. APPENDIX Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler development Third Edition (BSID -III) (Evrydsi dossier 2020 ) BSID -III is intended for children age 1 to 42 months. The assessment is completed over 30 to 90 minutes and measures 5 developmental domains: adaptive behavior, cognition, language, motor, and social -emotional. Raw scores of each successfully completed item are converted to subtest scaled scores and to a composite standard score. The scores determine the child's performance compared with typically developing children of their age. While it is not a disease- specific measure, the BSID -III has high reliability and validity. Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) (Spinraza dossier 2016) Expanded version of the original 20 -item Hammersmith Func tional Motor Scale that incorporates 13 items from the Gross Motor Function Measure assessment. Consists of 33 items evaluating the child's ability to perform activities. Each item is scored on a 3- point scale, with a score of 2 for \"performs without modification,\" 1 for \"performs with modification/adaptation,\" and 0 for \"unable to perform.\" The total score can range from 0 (all activities failed) to 66 (all activities achieved). A clinically meaningful change has been estimated to be a 3- point change at 6 months. Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) (De Sanctis 2016, Spinraza dossier 2016, FDA Medical Review 2016, Together in SMA 2016) Measures functional ability and achievement of motor milestones. Contains 26 items; total possible score is 78. Healthy -term infants should have a median score 67 at 3 months and 70 at 6 months. At 9 or 12 months, scores 73 are regarded as optimal. Section 1 is based on the neurological exam (postures, cranial nerve function, reflexes, tone, and movements) . Section 2 (HINE -2) evaluates development of motor function based on 8 items (head control, sitting, voluntary grasp, ability to kick in supine, rolling, crawling, standing, and walking); each item is scored between 0 and 2 to 4, for a maximum score of 26. Section 3 evaluates the state of behavior (consciousness, social orientation, and emotional state). Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM -32) (Evrydsi dossier 20 20) MFM- 32 is typically used in people older than 6 years ; however it has been validated in children as young as 2 years old. The assessment typically takes around 30 to 40 minutes to complete. Each item of the MFM is scored using a 4 - point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 3, based on the subject's maximal abilities without assistance. The score s on each of the 32 items are summed and converted to a 0 to 100 total score; the lower the total score, the more severe the impairment. Upper Limb Module (ULM) (Spinraza dossier 2016) Designed to assess upper limb functional abilities in patients with SMA, including young children and patients with severe contractures in the lower limbs. Consists of 9 upper limb performance items that reflect activities of daily livi ng. The total score ranges from 0 to 18 points, with higher scores indicating greater functional abilities. An increase of 2 points is considered clinically meaningful. 83 Data as of September 22, 2020 RLP/AKS Page 9 of 10 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Therapeutic Class Overview Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) Agents INTRODUCTION Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is 1 of 4 conditions known as dystrophinopathies, which are inher ited, X-linked myopathic disorder s due to a defect in the dystrophin gene that results in the primary pathologic process of muscle fiber degradation. The hallmark symptom is progressive weakness ( Darras other 3 conditions include: Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) , which is a mild form of DMD ; an intermediate presentation between BMD and DMD; and DMD -associated dilated cardiomyopathy, which has little or no clinical skeletal or muscle disease (MDA 2019) . DMD symptom onset is in early childhood, usually between the ages of 2 and 3 years old. The proximal muscles are affected first, followed by the distal limb muscles. Generally, the lower external muscles will be affected before the upper. The affected child may have difficulties jumping, walking, and running (MDA 2019) . The prevalence of DMD ranges from 1 to 2 per 10,000 live male births ; female -manifesting carriers are rarer, but can present with a range of symptoms that vary in their severities (Birnkrant et al 2018, Darras 2018[a] , Emflaza Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Medical Review 2017). The clinical course and lifespan of patients with DMD is relatively short. Individuals are usually confined to a wheelchair by age 13, and many die in their late teens or twenties from respiratory insufficiency or cardiomyopathy . Although survival until adulthood is more common now, very few patients survive past the 3rd decade ( Darras 2018[a] ). Glucocorticoids (GCs) including predni sone and deflazacort . Their beneficial effects include improving motor and pulmonary function, reducing the risk of scoliosis, delaying loss of ambulation (LoA) , possible delay of cardiomyopathy progression, and improving overall survival (Shieh et al 2018). Though not FDA -approved for DMD, prednisone is used off-label and considered a main drug of treatment . There are 3 FDA-approved agents for DMD which will be the focus of overview: 13% of patients with DMD carry the mutation for which eteplirsen is a potential therapy ( Birnkrant et al 2018). About 8% of patients with DMD carry the mutation for which golodirsen is a potential therapy ( Sarepta news release 2019[b] ). Three potential new therapies for DMD are in the emerging pipeline with ongoing Phase 3 trials . Translarna (ataluren), an investigational new drug developed for DMD caused by nonsense mutations, was not approved by the FDA in October 2017. In a complete response letter (CLR) for the new drug application (NDA), the FDA requested additional evidence of effectiveness from w ell-controlled clinical trials. In February 2018, the FDA denied an appeal from the manufacturer and suggest ed that the currently enrolling Study-041 could serve as a confirmat ory post -approval trial required in connection with the accelerated approval framework (PTC Therapeutics news release 2017, PTC Therapeutics news release 2018). Golodirsen, developed for the treatment of DMD in patients with mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping, was also rejected by the FDA in August 2019. A CLR raised concerns over the risk of infections upon injection of the therapy and the possibility of toxicity to the kidneys. However, on December 12, 2019 the drug was granted accelerated approval in patients with confirmed mutation amenable to exon 53 skipping ( Sarepta news release 2019[a], 2019[b] ). Casimersen, developed to treat DMD in patients with mutations amenable to exon 45 skipping , is awaiting FDA Table 1.

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY There has been considerable experience using Emflaza ( deflazacort ) and other corticosteroids for the management of patients with DMD. A number of observational studies have been conducted to assess the long-term effects of corticosteroid use on muscle strength, the ability to walk, and on weight gain, among other outcomes. Overall, these studies concluded that patients taking steroids were significantly more functional and performed better on testing v s untreated patients and confirm ed the prolongation of ambulation from a mean of 10. 0 years in individuals treated with less than 1 year of corticosteroids to a mean of 11. 2 years in individuals treated with daily prednisone and 13.9 years in individuals taking daily deflazacort (Balaban et al 2005, Bello et al 2015, Kim et al 2015 ). A Cochrane systematic review of 12 randomized controlled trial s (RCTs ) (N = 667) found that they provided moderate quality evidence for treatment with corticosteroids in patient s with DMD. Compared to placebo, corticosteroids improved muscle strength and function (including respiratory muscle strength and function) for 6 months, with continued evidence of benefit at 1 year. There is no evidence other than from non- randomized tria ls to establish the effect of corticosteroids on prolongation of walking ( Matthews et al 2016 ). The safety and efficacy of deflazacort for the treatment of DMD were demonstrated in 2 pivotal trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s (Angelini et al 1994, Emflaza Formulary Submission Dossier 2017, Griggs et al 2016) (N = 196) was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of deflazacort and prednisone v s placebo in boys aged 5 to 15 years old with DMD. For the first 12 week s of the study (ie, Phase 1), patients were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day, deflazacort 1.2 kg/mg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, or placebo) . For the remainder of the study through week 52 (ie, Phase 2), patients initially randomized to placebo were re-randomized to 1 of the 3 active treatment s (deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day, deflazacort 1.2 kg/mg/day, or prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day) . For the primary efficacy endpoint, all treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in muscle strength vs placebo from baseline to week 12. During Phase 2, only the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day group maintained a statistically significant improvement in muscle strength vs prednisone -treated patients ; however, both deflazacort groups outperformed the prednisone group by week 52 (secondary efficacy endpoint) ( Griggs et al 2016). In the opinion of the FDA, the result s for the change from week 12 to week 52 w ere not interpretable. The larger increase in muscle strength score from week 12 to week 52 in the deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day group was mostly due to a lower score at week 12 in this group. Because the groups were not comparable at week 12, the comparison s of the treatment effect from week s 12 to 52 were not considered meaningful ( Emflaza FDA Summary Review 2016). 100 Data as of December 17, 2019 RLP/AVD Page 3 of 7 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. At week 52, patients taking prednisone had significantly more weight gain than both deflazacort groups. The most frequent adverse effects (AEs) reported were: Cushingoid appearance, erythema, hirsutism, increased weight, headache, 2-year, Phase 3, DB, PC, MC, RCT (N = 29) was conducted to evaluate the change in muscle strength from baseline to 2 years or LoA, whichever occurred first, in boys aged 5 to 11 years old with DMD and symptom onset before age 5. By year 2, the study failed to show a statistically significant result for change in muscle strength, possibly because of a limited number of patients remaining in the placebo arm (12 patients vs 3 patients). The median time to LoA was statistically significant for deflazacort vs placebo (63.0 months [95% CI: 35.1 to vs 13.6 to 54.6], p = 0.0052) (Angelini et al 1994). Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) was evaluated in 3 clinical studies in patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. Study 201 was a 24- week , Phase 2b, DB, PC, RCT (N = 12) that evaluated eteplirsen's ability to induce dy strophin production (surrogate endpoint) and improve distance walked on the 6- minute walk test (6MWT, clinical outcome) in boys aged 7 to 13 years old that were stable on corticosteroid treatment for at least 6 months. Patients were randomized to week ly intravenous (IV) infusions of 30 or 50 mg/kg/wk eteplirsen or placebo for 24 week s (n=4/group). Placebo patients switched to 30 or 50 mg/kg eteplirsen (n = 2/group) at week 25. Study 202 was a 212 - week , ongoing Phase 2, open- label ( OL), MC extension study ; all 12 patients who participated in Study 201 c ontinued treatment in Study 202 ( Mendell et al 2013). The Study 201 authors concluded that at week 24, dystrophin -positive fibers increased by 23% from baseline in patients treated with 30 mg/kg eteplirsen, with no significant increases in the placebo group ( p 0.002). Greater increase s continued to occur by week 48 (52% and 43% in the 30 and 50 mg/kg groups, respectively). The authors also concluded that 6 ambulation- evaluable patients taking eteplirsen demonstrated an increase in the 6MWT (67.3 m, p 0.001) v s placebo. The average dystrophin protein level after 180 week s of treatment with eteplirsen was 0.93% of the normal dystrophin level in healthy subjects (Exondys 51 prescribing information 2018). The FDA noted that for the week 180 analysis, archived pre treatment muscle biopsy samples were available for reanalysis from only 3 patients in Studies 201/202, and samples from controls were also obtained from different muscle groups than the eteplirsen treated patients ; therefore , the true change in dystrophin was difficult to estimate (Exondys 51 FDA Summary Review 2016) . In contrast to the conclusions of Mendell et al, the FDA found no significant difference in the change in 6MWT distance between patients treated with eteplirsen and those treated with placebo in Study 201. Additionally, Study 202 failed to provide evidence of a clinical benefit when compared to the external control group (primary endpoint, week 48) (Exondys 51 FDA Summary Review 2016). A confirmatory P hase 3, 144-week , OL, MC study (PROMOVI) was conducted in 109 ambulatory males between ages 7 to 16 years old on a stable dose of corticosteroids for at leas t 24 week s. Patients in the treated group (DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping) received once week ly IV infusions of 30 mg/kg eteplirsen for 96 week s, followed by a safety extension (not to exceed 48 week s). Patients in t he untreated group did not receive treatment. The primary outcome was change in 6MWT distance from baseline to 96 week s (Alfano et al 2019 ). Results at 48 week s (N = 13) showed a median increase in dystrophin levels from 0.16% at baseline to 0.44% (p < 0.05). The median increase after 48 week s was 0.1%. The study completed in 2019, and full results are pending. Vyondys 53 (golodirsen) was granted accelerated approv al based on a 2- part clinical study (FDA news release 2019, Sarepta news release 2019[b], Vyondys 53 prescribing information 2019 ). Part 1 was a DB, PC, dose -titration study (N = 12). Patients were randomized 2:1; 8 patients received 4 escalating dose levels of golodirsen IV (ranging from 4 mg/kg/week to 30 mg/kg/week) for 2 weeks at each level , while 4 patients received placebo. Part 2 was a n OL study that included the 12 patients from Part 1, plus 13 additional treatment -na\u00efve patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping. Patients were given golodirsen at a dose of 30 m g/kg/week . Results showed that dystrophin levels increased (on average) from 0.10% of normal at baseline to 1.02% of normal after 48 weeks of treatment (mean change in dystrophin of 0.92% of normal levels , p < 0.001). This study only evaluated a surrogate endpoint ; a clinical benefit of golodirsen was not esta blishe d. An ongoing, confirmatory Phase 3 trial (ESSENCE) is currently being conducted to assess whether golodirsen improves motor function in patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skippin g. 101 Data as of December 17, 2019 RLP/AVD Page 4 of 7 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

CLINICAL GUIDELINES DMD Care Considerations Working Group: Diagnosis and management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, part 1: diagnosis, and neuromuscular, rehabilitation, endocrine, and gastrointestinal and nutritional management (Birnkrant et al 2018 ). Physiotherapy and treatment with GCs is the mainstay of DMD treatment and should continue after LoA. The benefits of long- term GC therapy have been shown to include LoA at a later age, preserved upper limb and respiratory function, and avoidance of scoliosis surgery. Recent studies confirm the benefits of starting GCs in younger children, and the consensus is to begin steroid regimens before significant physical decline. Recommended starting doses include p rednisone or prednisolone 0.75 mg/kg/day, or deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day. Patients should be reassessed at regular intervals to monitor functional decline and consider therapy updates. American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Practice guideline update summary: Corticosteroid treatment of D MD (Gloss et al 2016 ). The ideal time to start and stop therapy is not currently known. In children with DMD, prednisone should be offered for improving strength and pulmonary function. Prednisone may be offered for improving timed motor function, reducing the need for scoliosis surgery, and delaying cardiomyopathy onset by 18 years of age. Deflazacort may be offered for improving strength and timed motor function and delaying age at LoA by 1.4 to 2.5 years. Deflazacort may be offered for improving pulmonary function, reducing the need for scoliosis surgery, delaying cardiomyopathy onset, and increasing survival at 5 to 15 years of follow -up. Deflazacort and prednisone may be equivalent in improving motor function. Prednisone may be associated with greater weight gain in the first years of treatment than deflazacort. Deflazacort may be associated with a greater risk of cataracts than prednisone. The preferred dosing regimen of prednisone is 0.75 mg/kg/day. Over 12 months, prednisone 10 mg/kg/ week end is equally effective, with no long- term data available. Prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day is associated with significant risk of weight gain, hirsutism, and Cushingoid appearance. Calcium and vitamin D intake are optimized and encouraged in clinical practice, as these children ha ve several risk factors for low bone density and fractures, such as chronic corticosteroid use and decreased weight -bearing activities . The American College of Rheumatology Task Force osteoporosis guideline recommends calcium and vitamin D supplementation for patients taking corticosteroids (any dose with an anticipated duration of 3 months) in order to maintain a total calcium intake of 1200 mg/day and vitamin D intake of 800 IU/day through dietary sources, supplementation, or both. SAFETY SUMMARY Emfl aza (deflazacort) Contraindications Hypersensitivity to deflazacort or to any components of the formulation: Instances of hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy. Warnings and precautions of deflazacort are similar to those of other corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) and include alterations in endocrine function, immunosuppression and increased risk of infection, alterations in cardiovascular/renal function, gastrointestinal perforation, behavioral and mood disturbances, effects on bones, ophthalmic effects, avoiding certain vaccinations, serious skin rashes, effects on growth and development, myopathy, Kaposi's sarcoma, risk of serious AEs in infants because of the benzyl alcohol preservative, thromboembolic events, and anaphylaxis. The most common AEs ( 10% and greater than placebo) with deflazacort use were Cushingoid appearance (33% with deflazacort vs 12% with placebo), increased weight (20% vs 6%), increased appetite (14% vs 2%), upper respiratory Exondys known at this time.

Hypersensitivity reactions : Reactions including pyrexia, flushing, cough, dyspnea, bronchospasm, rash, urticaria, and hypotension have occurred in patients. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, appropriate medical treatment should be instituted , and slowing of the infusion or interruption of eteplirsen therapy should be considered. The most common AEs (incidence 35% and higher than placebo) were balance disorder and vomiting. Vyondys 53 (golodirsen) No contraindications known at this time. exfoliation , have occurred in patients receiving golodirsen. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, appropriate medical treatment should be instituted and slowing of the infusion or interrupti on of golodirsen therapy should be considered. Renal toxicity: Based on animal data, golodirsen may cause renal toxicity. Renal function should be monitored; creatinine may not be a reliable measure of renal function in DMD patients. The most common AEs (incidence 20% and higher than placebo) were headache, pyrexia, fall, abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, cough, vomiting, and nausea. DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Table 3 .

See the current prescrib ing information for full detail CONCLUSION GCs remain the mainstay of therapy for DMD, and are currently recommended for all patients . The benefits of long- term GC therapy have been shown to include LoA at a later age, preserved upper limb and respiratory function, and avoidance of scoliosis surgery (Birnkrant et al 2018). Emflaza (deflazacort) tablets and oral suspension are indicated for the treatment of DMD in patient's 5 years of age . The efficacy and safety of deflazacort were demonstrated in 2 pivotal DB, PC, MC, RCTs conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Results show ed that daily use of either deflazacort or prednisone was effective in preserving muscle strength over a 12 -week period ( Griggs et al 2016). 103 Data as of December 17, 2019 RLP/AVD Page 6 of 7 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping; this includes only about 13% of the overall patient population. Similarly, Vyondys 53 (golodirsen) is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping; this includes only about 8% of the overall patient population. These indications were approved under accelerated approval based on an increase in dystrophin in skeletal muscle observ ed in some patients treated with eteplirsen or golodirsen. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials (ie, PROMOVI , ESSENCE) . Methodological flaws in the study designs etepliren were brought to light during the FDA review process and have called into question whether the production of dystrophin is high enough to provide a true clinical benefit for patients with DMD.

Therapeutic Class Overview Neuropathic Pain and Fibromyalgia Agents INTRODUCTION Neuropathic pain is commonly described by patients as burning or electrical in nature and results from injury or damage to the nervous system (Herndon et al 2017 ). Management of neuropathic pain may prove challenging due to unpredictable patient response to drug therapy ( Attal et al 2 010). Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain with unknown etiology and pathophysiology. Patients typically complain of widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, cognitive disturbance, psychiatric symptoms, and multiple somatic symptoms ( Goldenberg 2 019). Fibromyalgia is often difficult to treat and req uires a multidisciplinary, individualized treatment program (Goldenberg 2 018). This review focuses on medications that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and/or post -herpetic neuralgia (PHN). The products variety pharmacologic classes, including anticonvulsants, serotonin- norepinephrine (ER) opioids, and topical analgesics. As such, these agents hold additional FDA -approved indications that are outlined in Table 2; however, clinical information included within this review will not address the use of these agents for these additional indications ( Prescribing information: Cymbalta 2020, Lyrica Inhibitors (SNRI s) Diabetic Neuropathy Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes will eventually develop neuropathy. The high rate of diabetic neuropathy results in substantial patient morbidity, which includes recurrent lower extremity infections, ulcerations, and subsequent amputations (Feldman 2020[a] ). The condition is categorized into distinct syndromes based on the neurologic distribution, although syndromes may overlap in some patients. The most frequently encountered diabetic neuropathies include distal symmetric polyneuropathy, al 2020[ b]). The 3 main components to the management of diabetic neuropathy are glycemic control, foot care, and pain management ( Feldman et al 2020[ b]). Optimal glucose control is important for the prevention of diabetic neuropathy. Clinical trial evidence demonstrates that rigorous blood glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes reduces the occurrence of diabetic neuropathy. In contrast, the role of glycemic control in established diabetic neuropathy is uncertain. Limited evidence suggests that neuropathic symptoms may improve with intensive antidiabetic therapy ( Feldman et al 2020[ b]). Patients with diabetes should be counseled on the importance of daily foot care, including the inspection of feet for the presence of dry or cracking skin, fissures, and plantar callus formation. Regular foot examinations by a healthcare provider are also important (Feldman et al 2020[ b]). A small proportion of patients with diabetic neuropathy will experience painful symptoms, and in some instances the condition is self -limited. When treatment is necessary, options include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, capsaicin cream, lido caine patches, alpha -lipoic acid, dinitrate topical spray, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( Feldman et al 2020[ b]). Fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia is a chronic functional illness marked by widespread musculoskeletal pain for which no alternative cause can be identified. Fibromyalgia patients often experience neuropsychological symptoms of fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, and depression ( Clauw et al 2009 ). 109 Data as of August 7, 2020 RR-U/SS -U/KAL Page 2 of 13 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Patients with fibromyalgia have pain that is typically above and below the waist on both sides of the body and involves the axial skeleton (neck, back, or chest). The pain attributable to fibromyalgia is poorly localized, difficult to ignore, severe in its intensity, and associated with a reduced functional capacity (Crofford 2015 ). The prevalence of fibromyalgia in the general U .S. population is estimated to be 2% to 3% and increases with age (Goldenberg 2019) . It is more common in women than in men, with a ratio of approximately 9:1 (Crofford 2015). There is an increased prevalence of other syndromes associated with pain and fatigue, including chronic fatigue syndrome, temporomandibular disorder, chronic headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, and other pelvic pain syndromes in fibromyalgia patients (Clauw et al 2009, Crofford 2015 ). PHN PHN refers to the persistence of the pain of herpes zoster beyond 4 months from the initial onset of the rash. Among patients with acute herpes zoster infection, the major risk factors for P HN are older age, greater acute pain, and greater rash severity . The duration of PHN is highly variable among individuals and may persist for months, years, or life (Bajwa et al 2019). PHN, as well as acute herpetic neuralgia, can be a severe condition associated with profound psychological dysfunction, including impaired sleep, decreased appetite, and decreased libido ( Bajwa et al 2019). Prevention of PHN involves either treatment of acute herpes zoster infection or use of a vaccine ( Bajwa et al 2019 ). Although evidence suggests that antiviral therapy hastens resolution of lesions and acute neuritis of herpes zoster, it is unclear if it decreases the risk of P HN (Albrecht 2018). A number of treatment modalities have been evaluated in the management of PHN toxin, cryotherapy, and surgery ( Bajwa et al 2019). Table 1 .

CLINICAL EFFICACY SUMMARY Neuro pathic Pain Pregabalin demon strated significant improvements in pain relief, functional outcomes, and quality of life compared to placebo for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Commonly reported adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving pregabalin include dizzine ss, somnolence, infection, headache, dry mouth, weight gain, and peripheral edema (Dworkin et al 2003, Freynhagen et al 2005, Guan et al 2011, Lesser et al 2004, Moon et al 2010 , Rosenstock et al 2004, Roth et al 2010, Sabatowski et al 2004, Semel et al 2010, Sharma et al 2010, Skvarc et al 2 010). Tapentadol ER demonstrated superiority over placebo in alleviating pain and improving quality of life in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Tapentadol ER is associated with significant improvements in pain intensity scores, responder rates, and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Commonly reported AEs in patients receiving tapentadol ER include nausea, vomiting, and constipation ( Schwartz et al 2011). Duloxetine demonstrated consistent superiority over placebo in alleviating pain, improving functional outcomes, and improving quality of life in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Specifically, duloxetine is associated with significant improvements in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) , Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Severity, Short Form -36 Health Survey (SF -36), Pain -Related Sleep Interference, and Euro Quality of Life assessment (EQ-5D) scores. Commonly reported AEs in patients receiving duloxetine include nausea, somnolence, anorexia, and dysuria ( Armstrong et al 2007, Kajdasz et al 2007, Lunn et al 2014, Parsons et al 2016, Yan et al 2010). Head -to-head trials among the neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia agents are rare. In a 52- week, open- label trial comparing duloxetine to routine care (gabapentin, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine) for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, there were no significant differences observed between groups in EQ -5D questionnaire scores; however, results differed with regards to SF -36 subscale scores. In another trial, there were no significant between - group differences in SF -36 subscale scores; however, other subscale scores for physical functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vital ity favored duloxetine ( Raskin et al 2006 second demonstrated duloxetine to be noninferior to pregabalin for the treatment of pain in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy who had an inadequate pain response to gabapentin ( Tanenberg et al 2011 ). A post -hoc analysis of study patients who were taking concomitant antidepressants and those who were not taking antidepressants found duloxetine may provide better pain reduction in those patients who were not taking concomitant antidepressants ( Tanenberg et al 2014). Another head- to-head trial no significant differences between high-dose duloxetine or pregabalin monotherapy and combination duloxetine/pregabalin therapy, as measured by BPI Modified Short For m (BPI -MSF) average pain (Tesfaye et al 2013). Several large meta- analyses and systematic reviews have been conducted evaluating the neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia agents, which further support the safety and efficacy of these agents in FDA- approved indications ( Chou et al 2009, Derry et al 2019, Edelsberg et al 2011, Lunn et al 2014, Meng et al 2014 , Quilici et al 2009, Wernicke et al a meta -analysis by Quilici et al, limited available clinical trial data suitable for indirect comparison demonstrated that duloxetine provides comparable efficacy and tolerability to that of gabapentin and pregabalin for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain ( Quilici et al 2009). The efficacy of pregabalin in patients with neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury was established in 2 placebo -controlled trials, 1 of 12 weeks duration and the other of 16 weeks duration. Patients had neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury for at least 3 months or with relapses and remissions for at least 6 months. Patients were allowed to take opioids, non- opioid analgesics, antiepileptic drugs, muscle relaxants, and antidepressant drugs if doses were stable for 30 days prior to screening. Patients were also allowed to take acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during the trial. In both trials, pregabalin (150 to 600 mg/day) significantly improved weekly pain scores compared to placebo, and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 30 or 50% reduction from baseline in pain score ( Lyrica prescribing information 2 019, Siddall et al 2006 , Vranken et al 2008). The efficacy of capsaicin 8% in diabetic peripheral neuropathy was assessed in a placebo -controlled trial (Simpson et al 2016) . The primary endpoint, percentage reduction in average daily pain score from baseline through 8 weeks , was significantly improved with capsaicin 8% . Patients treated with capsaicin also had significant improvements in median time to treatment response and in sleep interference scores through week 8.

Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. From the agents included in this review, the agents that have several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta- analyses demonstrating their efficacy in the treatment of fibromyalgia include duloxetine, pregabalin, and milnacipran (Arnold et al 2007, Arnold et al 2008, Arnold et al 2009 , Clauw et al 2008, Crofford et al 2005, Hauser et al 2009[a], Hauser et al 2009[b], Hauser et al 2010, Lunn et al 2014, Mease et al 2 009, Mease et al 2010 , Russell et al 2008, Vitton et al 2004, Welsch et al 2018). A 2009 meta- analysis on the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome with antidepressants found that antidepressants were associated with improved health- related quality of life. The largest effect size for pain reduction was seen with the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline, followed by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, moclobemide and pirlindole (medium effect size). Small effect sizes were observed with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and milnacipran . The authors concluded that short -term treatment with amitriptyline and duloxetine could be considered for fibromyalgia -associated pain and sleep disturbances (Hauser et al 2009[a] ). In a meta- analysis of 5 RCTs , gabapentin and pregabalin reduced pain and improved sleep in patients with fibromyalgia. The pooled number- needed -to-treat to achieve 30% reduction in pain was 8.5. Anxiety, depressed mood, and fatigue were not improved with gabapentin or pregabalin treatment ( Hauser et al 2009 [b]). Results from another 2010 meta- analysis noted that duloxetine, milnacipran , and pregabalin have short -term (up to 6- month) efficacy data. The authors concluded that the choice of medication may be dependent on the occurrence of key symptoms of fibromyalgia syndrome and the specific AEs that are associated with each drug ( Hauser et al 2010). A systematic review of 6 randomized trials involving 2249 patients concluded that for the treatment of fibromyalgia, duloxetine 60 and 120 mg/day are effective with a similar magnitude of effect (low quality evidence). The effect in fibromyalgia may be achieved through a greater improvement in mental symptoms than somatic physical pain (Lunn et al 2014). A 2016 network meta -analys is of 9 RCTs (N = 5140) indirectly compared duloxetine, pregabalin, and milnacipran in the treatment of fibromyalgia. The probability of achieving > 30% improvement in pain scores was numerically highest with duloxetine 60 mg, followed by pregabalin 300 mg, milnacipran 100 mg, and milnacipra n 200 mg. While the aforementioned treatment groups each demonstrated superior ity over placebo, difference s between active treatments did not achieve statistical significance ( Lee et al 2016). A systematic review and meta -analysis of 18 randomized trials involving 7903 patients concluded that duloxetine and milnacipran provided a small incremental benefit over placebo in pain reduction and provided no clinically relevant benefit over placebo in improving health- related quality of life or in reducing fatigue. Dropout rates for duloxetine and milnacipran due to AEs were higher than placebo ( Welsch et al 2018). Duloxetine is approved for treatment of fibromyalgia in patients age 13 years and older . Pediatric approval was supported by findings of a 13- week, placebo -controlled RCT (N = 184) of patients age 13 to 17 years with juvenile fibromyalgia (Upadhyaya et al 2019). The primary outcome, mean change in BPI average pain severity, was not statistically differ ent between groups; however, significantly more duloxetine- vs placebo -treated patients had a treatment response of 30% reduction (52% vs 36%) and 50% reduction (40 % vs 24%) on BPI average pain severity. PHN In patients with PHN, treatment with lidocaine 5% resulted in significant pain relief compared to placebo ( Galer et al 1999, Galer et al 2002, Meier et al 2003 ). In addition, treatment with lidocaine 5% was associated with higher rates of patient preference, less use of rescue medication, and decreases in allodynia and neuropathic symptoms compared to placebo ( Galer et al 1999, Meier et al 2003). An open- label trial evaluating lidocaine 5% for the management of PHN supports the findings of placebo- controlled trials ( Katz et al 2002). Lidocaine 1.8% was approved via the 505(b)(2) pathway with no new efficacy trials. However, in a single -dose, crossover study conducted in 53 healthy volunteers, lidocaine 1.8% topical system demonstrated equivalent exposure (AUC) and peak concentration (C max) of lidocaine to lidocaine 5% patch. In addition, based on a clinical study in 54 subjects, 47 subjects (87%) had adhesion scores of 0 ( 90% adhered) for all evaluations performed every 3 hours during the 12 hours of lidocaine 1.8% administration, 7 subjects (13%) had adhesion scores of 1 ( 75% to < 90% adhered) for at least 1 evaluation, and no subjects had scores of 2 or greater (< 75% adhered) (ZTlido prescribing information 2018). In patients with PHN, treatment with capsaicin resulted in significant pain relief compared to low do se capsaicin 0.04% (Backonja et al 2008, Derry et al 2017, Irving et al 2012). Treatment with capsaicin was associated with improvement in 113 Data as of August 7, 2020 RR-U/SS -U/KAL Page 6 of 13 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

PGIC , reduction in numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) scores, and reduction in neuropathic symptoms compared to low - dose capsaicin for up to 12 weeks of treatment (Backonja et al 2008, Derry et al 2017, Irving et al 2012). The long-term tolerability and safety of capsaicin was also demonstrated in a 52- week study, which found that repeat treatment with capsaicin (30 and 60 minutes) in addition to the standard of care therapies ( antidepressants, antiepileptics, and/or opioids ) was well tolerated with no negative functional or neurological effects when compared to standard of care therapies alone (Vinik et al 2016). Gabapenti n also demonstrated superiority over placebo in alleviating pain, improving functional outcomes, and improving quality of life in patients with PHN. Treatment with gabapentin significantly improved average daily pain and sleep, short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF -MPQ), Patient and Clinician Global Impression of Change, SF -36, and Prolife of Mood States (POMS) scores in RCTs . Commonly reported AEs in patients receiving gabapentin include d somnol ence, drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia, peripheral edema, and infection ( Rice et al 2001, Rowbotham et al 1998 ). In a trial comparing release combination therapy, combination therapy achieved better analgesia at lower doses of each agent compared to monotherapy with either agent in patients with PHN. Combination therapy was most commonly associated with constipation, sedation, and dry mouth ( Gilron et al 2005). Within these clinical trials, doses of gabapentin of up to 3,600 mg/day were evaluated ( Gilron et al 2005, Rice et al 2001, Rowbotham et al 1998). In 2 placebo- controlled trials, gabapentin ER achieved significant improvements in average daily pain and sleep interference scores ( Irving et al 2009, Wallace et al 2010). In one of these trials, a larger proportion of patients receiving gabapentin ER reported 50% reduction from baseline in average daily pain scores compared to placebo ( Irving et al 2009 ). In general, treatment with gabapentin ER was well tolerated; dizziness, headache, somnolence, and peripheral edema were the most commonly reported AEs (Irving et al 2009, Wallace et al 2010). Another placebo- controlled trial concluded that gabapentin ER may be particularly effective in patients with PHN presenting with sharp, dull, sensitive, or itchy pain ( Jensen et al 2009). Within these clinical trials, doses of gabapentin ER of up to 1,800 mg/day were evaluated (Irving et al 2009, Jensen et al 2009, Wallace et al 2010). The efficacy of gabapentin enacarbil ER (1200, 2400, and 3600 mg/day) was established in a randomized, placebo - controlled, 12 -week trial in adult patients with a documented medical diagnosis of PHN for 3 months ( n = 371) and significant pain, as demonstrated by a minimum baseline 24- hour average Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale score 4 on the 11 -point scale. Treatment with gabapentin enacarbil ER significantly improved the mean pain score and increased the proportion of patients with 50% reduction in pain score from baseline at all doses evaluated. A benefit over placebo was observed for all 3 doses of gabapentin enacarbil ER as early as Week 1 and was maintained at Week 12. Additional benefit of using dose s of gabapentin enacarbil ER > 1200 mg/day was not demonstrated ( Zhang et al 2013 ). Results of a second, published, placebo- controlled trial confirms these findings. Reported AEs were similar to those of gabapentin and gabapentin ER (ie, dizziness, headache, and nausea ) (Backonja et al 2011 ). A meta -analysis trials evaluating gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil ER, and gabapentin ER was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of all gabapentin formulations for management of PHN. Although gabapentin was found to be superior to placebo in terms of pain reduction, global impression of change, and sleep quality, patients taking gabapentin were significantly more likely to experience AEs such as dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, ataxia, and diarrhea ( Meng et al 2014). Pregabalin demonstrated consistent superiority over placebo in alleviating diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain and PHN -related pain. Two noncomparative, open- label trials evaluating pregabalin for the management of PHN support the findings of placebo- controlled trials (Ogawa et al 2010, Xochilcal -Morales et al 2010 ). In one of these noncomparative trials, long -term treatment of PHN with pregabalin (52 weeks) was found to be safe and effective ( Ogawa et al 2010). Patients with PHN who were transitioned to pregabalin from gabapentin demonstrated no significant difference in pain scores, based on a visual analog scale, with pregabalin compared to gabapentin . However, in a subset of patients who required an increase in the dosage of pregabalin to improve the analgesic effect after the transition, significant improvement in pain scores was observed (Ifuku et al 2011). Support for efficacy of pregabalin ER in PHN and diabetic peripheral neuropathy was based on the efficacy of pregabalin in these indications and 1 clinical trial in PHN ( Lyrica CR prescribing information 2020). In this trial, pregabalin ER demonstrated a significantly longer time to loss of therapeutic response compared with placebo over a 13-week randomized withdrawal phase in a phase 3, double- blind, randomized trial (Huffman et al 2017). CLINICAL GUIDELINES Diabetic Neuropathy 114 Data as of August 7, 2020 RR-U/SS -U/KAL Page 7 of 13 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx. It is intended for internal use only and should be disseminated only to authorized recipients. The contents of the therapeutic class overviews on this website (\"Content\") are for informational purposes only. The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. The 2011 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines, which were reaffirmed in 2016 [update in progress 2020] , recommend the following: If clinically appropriate, pregabalin should be offered for treatment. Gabapentin and sodium valproate are other anticonvulsants that should be considered for treat ment ( Bril et al 2011). Amitriptyline, venlafaxine, and duloxetine should be considered for treatment; there is insufficient evidence available to recommend one of these agents over another. Combination therapy with venlafaxine and gabapentin may be utilized for a better response. Dextromethorphan, morphine sulfate, tramadol, and oxycodone should be considered for treatment; there is insufficient evidence available to recommend one of these agents over another. With regards to other pharmacologic options, capsaicin and isosorbide dinitrate spray should be considered for treatment, while lidocaine patch may be considered. The 2020 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline acknowl edges the lack of quality of life outcomes and recommend s that treatment decisions follow a trial -and-error approach (ADA 2020). Pregabalin, duloxetine, and tapentadol ER h ave been approved for relief of diabetic peripheral neuropathy; however, none of these agents affords complete relief, even when used in combination. Either pregabalin or duloxetine is recommended as initial pharmacologic therapy for neuropathic pain in diabetes. T he use of tapentadol ER is generally not recommended as a first or second-line therapy due to safety concerns such as high- risk for addiction, and the evidence for its use is considered weaker. Tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, and topical capsaicin are not approved for the treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, but may be effective and can be considered as treatment options. In general, other published guidelines support recommendations from the AAN and ADA concerning the use of the neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia agents in the management of diabetic neuropathy ( Dworkin et al 2007, Handelsman et al 2015, Pop-Busui et al 2017). PHN According to the 2010 European Federation of Neurological Societies guideline on the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain, tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentin/pregabalin are recommended as first -line treatment for PHN. Topical lidocaine may be considered first line in the elderly, especially if there are concerns regarding AEs of oral medications. Capsaicin cream and opioids may be considered a second-line choice ; capsaicin patches are promising, but the long- term effects of repeated applications on sensation are unclear (Attal et al 2010). Fibromyalgia According to the evidence -based recommendations for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome from the European League Against Rheumatism, non -pharmacologic interventions should be considered first -line therapy for the management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Pharmacologic therapy should only be initiated if there is a lack of effect with non-pharmacologic therapies, and should be tailored to meet the patient's needs. Recommended pharmacologic agents to the 2012 C anadian guidelines for the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia syndrome, all classes of antidepressants are options for treatment of pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia. Anticonvulsants are also options, though the guideline does not recommend specific agents ( Fitzcharles et al 201 3). SAFETY SUMMARY The following key contraindications are included in the prescribing information: Concomitant use or use within the last 14 days of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated with tapentadol ER. Tapentadol ER is contraindicated in significant respiratory depression, acute or severe bronchial asthmas, or hypercarbia in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment, and in known or suspected paralytic ileus. Duloxetine and milnacipran carry a boxed warning for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior. There is an increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepre ssants. All SNRIs are not approved for use in pediatric populations. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely , especially during the initial few months of a course of drug the rapy and following changes in dosage. 115 Data as of August 7, 2020 RR-U/SS -U/KAL Page 8 of 13 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Patients should always seek the advice of a physician or other qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition. Clinicians should refer to the full prescribing information and published resources when making medical decisions. Duloxetine may increase the risk of bleeding events due to interference with serotonin reuptake. Concomitant use with aspirin and other antithrombotics may increase risk of bleeding. Tapentadol ER has a boxed warning for the potential for abuse, life- threatening respiratory depression, accidental exposure, risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome with prolonged use, and interactions with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other central nervous system depressants that can cause profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. The FDA requires a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for opioid analgesics, including tapentadol ER, to assure safe use of these medications. Tapentadol ER should not be abruptly discontinued in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation in these patients may result in withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Mixed agonist/antagonist or partial agonist analgesics should not be used concomitantly with tapentadol ER. Gabapentin, pregabalin, and pregabalin ER carry warnings regarding the risk of anaphylaxis and/or angioedema after the first dose or during therapy. Gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil , pregabalin, and pregabalin ER carry warnings regarding the risk of respiratory depression when co- administered with CNS depressants, including opioids, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Topical lidocaine products have a warning for excessive dosing/overexposure, increased absorption on non-intact skin, risk of overexposure with external heat sources, and hypersensitivity reactions. Methemoglobinemia has been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Topical capsaicin carries warnings for severe irritation with unintended exposure, pain associated with application, and temporary reductions in sensory function. The following monitoring parameters are recommended with treatment: Monitor for clinical worsening of depression, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior with duloxetine, ER , duloxetine, or milnacipran should be monitored for signs of serotonin syndrome when used concurrently with duloxetine or milnacipran should not be used with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (eg, MAOIs , linezolid, and methylene blue). Monitor for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction during tapentadol ER therapy. Patients should also be closely monitored for 72 hours after initiating tapentadol ER treatment and monitored throughout treatment due to an increased risk of respiratory depression. Patients receiving tapentad ol ER , duloxetine, capsaicin , or milnacipran should have their blood pressure monitored prior to initiating treatment and periodically throughout treatment. Monitor for worsened seizure control in patients with a history of seizure disorder with the treatment of tapentadol ER, duloxetine, or milnacipran . Patients receiving tapentadol ER should be monitored for signs and symptoms of worsening biliary tract dise ase, including acute pancreatitis. In general, oral neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia agents are commonly associated with central nervous system -related AEs (eg, dizziness, drowsiness, somnolence). Peripheral edema and weight gain may also occur with use of these agents. Caution is advised when prescribing pregabalin concomitantly with opioids due to risk of CNS depression.

Clinical trials support the use of the neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia agents for their FDA -approved indications. Available data demonstrate that neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia agents provide relief from pain; some studies have demonstrated improvement in functional outcomes and quality of life. Direct comparisons among the various agents are rare, and consistent benefit of one agent over another has not been demonstrated. According to the available literature, tricyclic antidepressants and duloxetine demonstrate an ability to provide pain relief in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy. While pregabalin and valproate have both demonstrated usefulness in the management of diabetic neuropathy, available literature suggests that the utility of gabapentin is less certain. There is minimal evidence evaluating the use of topical lidocaine and capsaicin for the management of painful diabetic neuropathy. Strong opioids have demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo; however, prescribers may consider this 117 Data as of August 7, 2020 RR-U/SS -U/KAL Page 10 of 13 This information is considered confidential and proprietary to OptumRx.

Of the neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia agents included in the review, capsaicin, duloxetine , pregabalin, pregabalin ER, and tapentadol ER are approved for the management of diabetic neuropathy. For the management of PHN, available literature demonstrates that tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, topical capsaicin, botulinum toxin, and lidocaine are more effective compared to placebo ( Bajwa et al 2019). Of the neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia agents included in this review, gabapentin , and capsaicin are approved for the management or relief of pain associated with PHN. For the management of fibromyalgia, available literature demonstrates that amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, duloxetine, gabapentin, milnacipran, and pregabalin are all appropriate treatment options. The choice of therapy is guided by specific symptoms, comorbidities, and patient preference ( Goldenberg 2 018). REFERENCES Albrecht MA. Treatment of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent host.
