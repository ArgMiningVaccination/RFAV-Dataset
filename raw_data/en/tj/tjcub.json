However, it is clearthat the art of healing and the strength of the doctor-patientrelationship play a vital role in improving the well-being ofpatients. This is exemplified by the placebo effect, wherethe attitude of the doctor can make an appreciable differ-ence to the psychological response of the patient who feelsthe need to be understood and listened to empathically. Bymaximizing the role of the physician healer, there is consid-erable scope for bridging the gap left by the impersonalityof medical science, while at the same time increasing theGP's effectiveness. Keywords: general practice; placebo effect; doctor-patient relationship; patient beliefs; patient attitude. Introduction GENERAL practice, we are told, is in the middle of an identity crisis. On the premise that we are failed consultants, some have suggested that we should become 'mini-specialists'. In asimilar vein, it is said that we are working beneath our skills andthat much of our work could be done by nurse practitioners. Yetour potential skills in diagnosis, the bedrock of general practice,have never been so great. Our credibility as therapists has beenfurther enhanced by a newly-won biomechanical understanding,effective treatments, and the ability to apply evidence-basedmedicine. So, is there something missing in the analysis of thosewho say that general practitioners (GPs) should change their role,and are we simply failing to recognize it? The answer is a bit ofboth: the 'something' that is missing is our role as physicianhealers. The powerful healer Historically, the therapeutic credibility of the doctor was basedupon his skills in diagnosis and predicting the course of disease.This was translated into therapeutic success by medications andprocedures, which were largely placebos. The active ingredientwas usually the healing effect of the doctor-patient relationship.The extent of this healing effect has been quantified in a largenumber of placebo studies, which have given a consistent aver-age placebo response of between 30% and 40%. 1For instance, significant placebo responses have been recorded in the treatmentof hypertension, 2,3heart failure,4peptic ulceration,5multiplesclerosis,6tinnitus,7pain,8-10migraine,11depression,12,13panic disorders,14and even schizophrenia.15The strength of the pla- cebo effect may depend to some extent on the sort of placebothat is given, 16,17 and ranges up to a staggering 60% to 70%18,19 for operative interventions. It has even been shown that strictcompliance with placebo medication can halve subsequent mor-tality. 20,21 Clearly, the doctor is an important variable and his attitude and motivation will affect both the placebo response and compliance.22,23Psychoneuroimmunology24is beginning to explain why placebos should heal patients and how the mind canaffect the body in this way. Until recently, the placebo effect has been regarded as a nui- sance effect in medical research. Indeed, its study in the context of double placebo-controlled trials has given the mistaken impression that it is a fixed quantity in the clinical situation.However, in the surgery, the placebo effect becomes the healingeffect of the doctor, which will vary according to his skills and which may extend beyond simple good common sense and old- fashioned bedside manners. 25 The GP can exploit the placebo or non-specific healing effect of the consultation, whether prescribing inert medication, active medication,26or indeed no medication at all.27The effect just happens to be much more visible when a placebo is given, but ispotentially there in every consultation. Compatible with modern medicine? Modern GPs have negative feelings about the explicit use ofplacebos, although they almost universally use them in some cir-cumstances. 28They may frequently do so as part of a 'folie \u00e0 deux' (when neither doctor nor patient realize that the medica- tion is, in fact, a placebo) and when the placebo effect is likely to be all the greater. For instance, retrospective analysis of treat-ments that were once thought to be effective and now found to bebogus suggest a 70% placebo effect when such treatments were at their zenith. 29This could explain what is happening when GPs give low doses of antidepressants to good effect when psychia-trists say they could not be having any beneficial effect at thissub-therapeutic level. They work, but, if they are placebos, canwe say that they are effective? The paradox of evidence-based medicine, which should improve our therapeutic credibility, is that it will remove many treatments that work for the benefit ofour patients in this way. Similarly, exploiting the placebo effect or refining our skills as physician healers may conflict with the modern culture of hon- esty and openness. Few doctors would feel that it was necessaryto mention every possible gloomy diagnosis at a patient's firstconsultation. On the other hand, should the physician suggestthat a treatment will help when there may be only a 50% chance that it will? Should he improve a patient's self esteem by sug- gesting that he has more ability than a neutral observer mightjudge? Should he deliver kind words at a dying man's bedside,which will help a family's grief and possibly be remembered for- ever, when they do not truly reflect his thoughts at the time? Within the therapeutic relationship, it could be argued, a positiveoutlook 30is both desirable and ethical, provided that the doctor is sincere and answers direct questions truthfully. The flow of ourpatients towards complementary therapists suggests that patientsThe physician healer: ancient magic or modern science?

The patient's view Our patients want to be recognized, appreciated, and understood.31Personal care appears to be important, and research suggests, for instance, that patient satisfaction is greater in prac- tices with personal lists.32Sceptics may question who needs these relationships, inferring that the doctor may be fulfilling his own rather than his patient's need. They are assuming that sick patients are simply their normal selves plus symptoms that needfixing. However, it seems that we are frequently changed by our symptoms. 1,33Disease interferes with our ability to function nor- mally.34Patients who are changed by their symptoms and illness- es in this way may temporarily need the hope, reassurance, and comfort of a skilled physician healer.35They need something more than just accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment \u2014 something well recognized by complementary practitioners.36 Hippocrates put it thus: 'some patients, though conscious thattheir condition is perilous, recover their health simply through their contentment with the goodness of the physician'. 37 The differences between GP and patient expectations were illustrated in a recent consumer report,38which showed that the top three priorities of patients were to have a doctor who listens and explains clearly, who allows sufficient time for consultation, and with whom they are able to get an appointment. Two of thetop three priorities for the GPs were to involve patients in treat- ment decisions and to offer up-to-date treatment options. It seems that the GPs wanted to be expert practitioners of modern medicine, while their patients were looking for physician healers. An area for research? If our intrinsic therapeutic role is so important, why has it not been better researched? It is odd that we should know so much about the pharmacology of modern drugs but so little about the psychopharmacology of what Balint referred to as the drug 'doc-tor'. 39Some might advise caution in studying the physician heal- er role too closely, on the premise that if you try to explore and understand the magic then the magic will be lost. It is also possi- ble that, if there were to be accepted text books and formal semi- nars on how to be a successful physician healer, then GPs mightbegin to resemble second-rate thespians aping a received formula in a visibly contrived fashion. This may not matter to the significant minority of patients who inexplicably respond best to placebos when they know that they are on them, 40though others will require a more subtle approach. Nevertheless, in theory, if a patient understands his doctor's methods and why he is effective in this role, then there is no rea- son why this should diminish that effectiveness, provided that he is genuine and sincere. For example, patients undergoing system- atic de-sensitization for a phobia under a psychologist may bewell aware of what treatment is going to be given, its mecha- nisms, and its theory, but such knowledge does not diminish the effectiveness of that therapy. It is, therefore, legitimate to explore the physician healer role as a means of improving our therapeutic efficacy. The ingredients of a successful physician healer How can we maximize our placebo effect in the consultation andmake the therapeutic relationship more effective? The rule bookssay that if a man wishes to impress a woman he should approach from the front, smile all the time, maintain eye contact, and carryout a number of well-documented manoeuvres. Are there similarrules for being a successful physician healer? Healing, they say,is an art and not a science, but we are beginning to see that it isalso a science and a very complex one at that. The doctor-patient relationship is clearly the central ingredient, but there are no fixed rules. Research suggests, for instance, that patients prefertheir doctors to dress formally. 41Generally, this shows respect for the patient, adds to the status of the doctor, and thereby mayhelp the 'placebo therapeutic response'. All the same, it isinevitable that there will be a minority of patients who willrespond better to a casually dressed doctor, and others who will respond differently depending upon their personal circumstances at the time. Rules can, therefore, only be guidelines, but it is pos-sible to generalize about some of the skills required of an effec-tive physician healer. Availability, approachability, and continuity are greatly valued by patients, 42and all of these are important in the development of a therapeutic relationship. Several studies in general practice have confirmed the importance of simply giving time,43-45and this appears to be an important component in the success of com-plementary medicine where practitioners spend more time perconsultation with their patients than the average GP. 31Time is a precious commodity for the modern GP, but spending time on making patients better and being more actively involved in their ongoing treatment may save time later. Important skills include the ability to listen and empathize.30 Empathy and understanding are interlinked as it is only by aprocess of identifying fully with a patient's predicament that theGP can begin to understand him. Patients have a strong desire tobe understood, 46which we must respect if we also wish to gain their trust.47Trust itself is an essential ingredient of the therapeu- tic relationship. Providing hope and reassurance are frequentlyimportant. On a cognitive level, a good physician healer willneed to communicate in a way that is appropriate to the languageand culture of the patient. Conversely, at other times, he mayneed to stir the emotions of his patients, make them laugh, and occasionally be a master of rhetoric. 48Inspirational doctors are as important as inspirational teachers, and a skilled physician healermay change a patient's perception of his disease, real or imag-ined, and thereby improve symptoms in the short-term and possi-bly affect physiological processes in the longer term. The ethical use of suggestion 49-54is very much a part of the physician's art, influencing expectation and thereby outcome. The power of suggestion is such that it can cause allergic reac- tions55and reverse the normal expected effect of a given drug.56 Like his forebears and present day complementary practitioners,the physician healer will be skilled at personalizing treatment 57-60 by way of compensating for his science, which relies uponabstraction. He will aim for general effects such as restoring lost self esteem to patients who may be as unable to cope with them- selves as they are with their illnesses. Another long-term skill isthe ability to induce a positive illness attitude and coping style,which may change the course of a patient's life as well as his ill-ness. Such skills have been shown to improve clinical status in anumber of diseases, 61including cancers62,63and coronary artery disease.64 A difficult role The role of the physician healer is as complex as our patients andour consultations with them, but this should not stop us from try-ing. It is unlikely that this part of our work will ever be describedin terms of flow charts and treatment guidelines, which may be 310 British Journal of General Practice, April 1999D M Dixon, KG Sweeney and D J Pereira Gray Discussion paperBritish Journal of General Practice, April 1999 311D M Dixon, KG Sweeney and D J Pereira Gray Discussion paper useful and appropriate in other aspects of our job and which make them easier. The sheer difficulty of this role makes it allthe more exciting, challenging, and important. Therapeutics inthis sense requires the same advanced skills as diagnosis in gen-eral practice. Not surprisingly, it has been said that 'some of the best brains should be in general practice because it is, of all the branches of medicine, the most difficult to do well'. 65 Conclusion Balint39and his successors offered GPs an analysis of general practice, which made consultations infinitely interesting andcomplex. The Fortunate Man 66offered GPs, in a different way, an inspiring vision of a role that was creative, fundamental, andromantic. Both works described the physician healer of over 30 years ago. Few GPs now apparently regard themselves as fortu- nate men, and there is a shortage of doctors wishing to enter gen-eral practice. They are told that they should be primarily clini-cians and businessmen. Thus, a role that seems to have little explicit clinical value, and one that is neither assessed nor paid for, has become irrelevant among the competing demands ofmodern general practice. The physician healer may be fulfillinghis human contract but his work will never be part of the corecontract. Yet it seems that the physician healer is now poised to rise again like the phoenix, not on a wave of nostalgia, but becausemodern science demands it. Placebo research and psychoneu-roimmunology are beginning to clarify a role in which caring isno longer an act of compassion or indulgence but has everything to do with curing or, in the preferred modern term, 'effective- ness'. The modern GP, therefore, needs to develop skills as aphysician healer in order to bridge the gap left by the imperson-ality of his medical science. In so doing, he should increase histherapeutic credibility, make his diagnoses seem more reliable, his medicines more effective, and, possibly, his work more satis- fying. Those who would have us become mini-specialists, or hand over most of our work to nurse practitioners, see general practice as simply a question of making the right diagnosis and issuing the correct treatment. In reality, consultations are far more com-plex, vague, generous, and difficult to measure. For instance, theconsultation frequently is itself the treatment. 28Our increasing skills in information technology, health promotion, and organiz- ing health services are important but they are not the essence of general practice, which will always be about diagnosis, therapy,and healing. The physician healer is not an anachronism but amodern necessity. References 1. Beecher HK. The powerful placebo. JAMA1955; 159:1602-1606. 2. Beutler JJ, Attevelt JT, Schouten hypertension.
