The nutrients it provides have specific benefit for increasing fertility. There are two stages to making this delicious smoothie: first make a base tea, then let the tea cool and blend in the remaining ingredients. Maca is a root vegetable shaped like a turnip. It is found 12,000 feet above sea level in the high Andes of Peru and Ecuador. For more than two thousand years, native Peruvians have used maca root as food and medicine to promote fertility, endurance, energy, vitality, and virility. According to modern research,maca increases energy, endurance, oxygen in the blood, physical strength, neurotransmitter production, and libido. It supports the endocrine system, the adrenals, and the thyroid. It typically improves one's mood and also helps to support healthy hormone production. Royal Jelly is a nutrient-dense substance that comes from young worker bees. It is rich in amino acids, lipids, sugars, vitamins, and proteins. It contains high levels of vitamins D and E, and also has plenty of iron and calcium. All of these nutrients are essential for optimal health, so it is easy to see how royal jelly is an amazing fertility booster. While a number of different superfoods have proven to be very effective at helping increase fertility, royal jelly is the reigning Queen. Spirulina is rich in many vitamins and minerals that improve overall health. It is known to nourish the endocrine, nervous, and immune systems, and to regulate metabolism and repair tissue. Spirulina's ability to increase fertility is thought to be due to its high protein content which can improve the quality of a woman's eggs -- particularly beneficial for women aged 35 and over. Shatavari is a member of the asparagus family. In Sanskrit, shatavari means \"healer of a thousand diseases.\" According to Ayurveda, shatavari is often taken to promote female fertility, lactation, and libido, and can also be used to enhance male fertility.
