The three COVID-19 vaccines currently approved by the FDA\u2014manufactured by [Pfizer-BioNTech](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html), [Moderna](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html), and [Johnson & Johnson's Janssen](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/janssen.html)\u2014are proven to be highly effective at preventing severe illness and death. Because the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is being organized on a state-by-state basis, it's important for people to be knowledgeable about when and how they can receive their vaccines. Be sure to investigate your state's plan so that you can protect yourself and others. In addition, as a result of advocacy by the ADA and other groups, in March 2021 the CDC moved to prioritize all Americans living with diabetes for COVID-19 vaccination, marking an important step forward for our community. The CDC now recognizes that people with Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes are equally at risk, and most states prioritize both groups equally for access to vaccines. Even so, if you have not been vaccinated, you should check the rules and availability in your state. Find your state Montana Ohio Oklahoma "}
