One limitation of standard cell culture is a reliance on non-physiological nutrient levels, which can influence cell metabolism and drug sensitivity. A general assessment of how physiological nutrients affect cancer cell response to small molecule therapies is lacking. To address this, we developed a serum-derived culture medium that supports the proliferation of diverse cancer cell lines and is amenable to high-throughput screening. We screened several small molecule libraries and found that compounds targeting metabolic enzymes were differentially effective in standard compared to serum-derived medium. We exploited the differences in nutrient levels between each medium to understand why medium conditions affected the response of cells to some compounds, illustrating how this approach can be used to screen potential therapeutics and understand how their efficacy is modified by available nutrients.

ABSTRACT To produce a diverse antibody repertoire, immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Igh) loci undergo large-scale alterations in structure to facilitate juxtaposition and recombination of spatially separated variable (VH), diversity (DH), and joining (JH) genes. These chromosomal alterations are poorly understood. Uncovering their patterns shows how chromosome dynamics underpins antibody diversity. Using tiled Capture Hi-C, we produce a comprehensive map of chromatin interactions throughout the 2.8-Mb Igh locus in progenitor B cells. We find that the Igh locus folds into semi-rigid subdomains and undergoes flexible looping of the VH genes to its 3' end, reconciling two views of locus organization. Deconvolution of single Igh locus conformations using polymer simulations identifies thousands of different structures. This heterogeneity may underpin the diversity of V(D)J recombination events. All three immunoglobulin loci also participate in a highly specific, developmentally regulated network of interchromosomal interactions with genes encoding B cell-lineage factors. This suggests a model of interchromosomal coordination of B cell development.

METHODS: This is a cohort study of 7,623 patients transplanted between 2005 and 2016 at four major transplant UK centres. The diagnosis of glomerulonephritis (GN) in the allograft was extracted from histology reports aided by the use of text-mining software. The incidence of the four most common GN post-transplantation was calculated, and the risk factors for disease and allograft outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 214 patients (2.8%) presented with PTGN. four most common forms of post-transplant GN. Living donation, HLA DR match, mixed race, and other ethnic minority groups were associated with an increased risk of developing a PTGN. Patients with PTGN showed a similar allograft survival to those without in the first 8 years of post-transplantation, but the results suggest that they do less well after that timepoint. IgAN was associated with the best allograft survival and FSGS with the worst allograft survival. CONCLUSIONS: PTGN has an important impact on long-term allograft survival. Significant challenges can be encountered when attempting to analyze large-scale data involving unstructured or complex data points, and the use of computational analysis can assist.

ABSTRACT Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inborn error of immunity characterised by opportunistic infection and sterile granulomatous inflammation. CGD is caused by a failure of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. Mutations in the genes encoding phagocyte NADPH oxidase subunits cause CGD. We and others have described a novel form of CGD (CGD5) secondary to lack of EROS (CYBC1), a highly selective chaperone for gp91phox. EROS-deficient cells express minimal levels of gp91phox and its binding partner p22phox, but EROS also controls the expression of other proteins such as P2X7. The full nature of CGD5 is currently unknown. We describe a homozygous frameshift mutation in CYBC1 leading to CGD. Individuals who are heterozygous for this mutation are found in South Asian populations (allele frequency = 0.00006545), thus it is not a private mutation. Therefore, it is likely to be the underlying cause of other cases of CGD.

ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: CGD is caused by defects in any of the 6 subunits forming the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex 2 (NOX2), leading to severely reduced or absent phagocyte-derived ROS production. Almost 50% of patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) have IBD (CGD-IBD). While conventional IBD therapies can treat CGD-IBD, their benefits must be weighed against the risk of infection. Understanding the impact of NOX2 defects on the intestinal microbiota may lead to the identification of novel CGD-IBD treatments. OBJECTIVE: To identify microbiome and metabolome signatures that can distinguish patients with CGD and CGD-IBD. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study of 79 patients with CGD, 8 pathogenic variant carriers and 19 healthy controls followed at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH CC). We profiled the intestinal microbiome (amplicon sequencing) and stool metabolome, and validated our findings in a second cohort of 36 CGD patients recruited through the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC). RESULTS: We identified distinct intestinal microbiome and metabolome profiles in patients with CGD compared to healthy individuals. We observed enrichment for Sellimonas spp. and Lachnoclostridium spp. in CGD stool samples. Despite differences in bacterial alpha and beta diversity between the NIH CC and PIDTC cohorts, several taxa correlated significantly between both cohorts. We further demonstrated that patients with CGD-IBD have a distinct microbiome and metabolome profile compared to patients without CGD-IBD. CONCLUSION: Intestinal microbiome and metabolome signatures distinguished patients with CGD and CGD-IBD, and identified potential biomarkers and Nat Med. 2023 Aug 28. doi: 10.1038/s41591-023-02503-4.

In a phase 2, open-label, randomized clinical trial with sequentially enrolled stages at 22 US sites, we assessed safety and immunogenicity of a second boost with monovalent or bivalent variant vaccines from mRNA and protein-based wild-type, Beta, Delta and Omicron spike antigens. The inhibitory dilution (ID50 titers) with 95% confidence intervals against different SARS-CoV-2 strains. The secondary outcome assessed safety by solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs), unsolicited AEs, serious AEs and AEs of special interest. Boosting with prototype/wild-type vaccines produced numerically lower ID50 titers than any variant-containing vaccine against all variants. Conversely, boosting with a variant vaccine excluding prototype was not associated with decreased neutralization against D614G. Omicron BA.1 or Beta monovalent vaccines were nearly equivalent to Omicron BA.1 + prototype or Beta + prototype bivalent vaccines for neutralization of Beta, Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4/5, although they were lower for contemporaneous Omicron subvariants. Safety was similar across arms and stages and comparable to previous reports. Our study shows that updated vaccines targeting Beta or Omicron BA.1 provide broadly crossprotective neutralizing antibody responses against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants without sacrificing the Cell Rep. 2023 Aug 24;42(9):113013. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2023.113013.

ABSTRACT 2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG) is a byproduct of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and is readily detected in the tissues of healthy individuals. 2HG is found in two enantiomeric forms: S-2HG and R-2HG. Here, we investigate the differential roles of these two enantiomers in cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cell biology, where we find they have highly divergent effects on proliferation, differentiation, and T cell function. We show here an analysis of structural determinants that likely underlie these differential effects on specific -ketoglutarate (KG)-dependent enzymes. Treatment of CD8+ T cells with exogenous S-2HG, but not R-2HG, increased CD8+ T cell fitness in vivo and enhanced anti-tumor activity. These data show that S-2HG and R-2HG should be considered as two distinct and important actors in the regulation of T cell function.

Online ahead of print. ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: The biology of Plasmodium vivax is markedly different to that of P. falciparum; how this shapes the immune response to infection remains unclear. To address this shortfall, we inoculated human volunteers with a clonal field isolate of P. vivax and tracked their response through infection and convalescence. METHODS: Participants were injected intravenously with blood-stage parasites and infection dynamics were tracked in real-time by quantitative PCR. Whole blood samples were used for high dimensional protein analysis, RNA-sequencing and Cytometry by Time Of Flight (CyTOF), and temporal changes in the host response to P. vivax were quantified by linear regression. Comparative analyses with P. falciparum were then undertaken using analogous datasets derived from prior controlled human malaria infection studies. RESULTS: P. vivax rapidly induced a type I inflammatory response that coincided with hallmark features of clinical malaria. This acute phase response shared remarkable overlap with that induced by P. falciparum but was significantly elevated (at RNA and protein level) leading to an increased incidence of pyrexia. In contrast, T cell activation and terminal differentiation was significantly increased in volunteers infected with P. falciparum. Heterogeneous CD4+ T cells were found to dominate this adaptive response and phenotypic analysis revealed unexpected features normally associated with cytotoxicity and autoinflammatory disease. CONCLUSION: P. vivax triggers increased systemic interferon signaling (cf P. falciparum), which likely explains its reduced pyrogenic threshold. In contrast, P. falciparum drives T cell activation far in excess of P. vivax, which may partially explain why falciparum malaria more frequently causes severe disease.

ABSTRACT During B cell maturation, transitional and mature B cells acquire cell-intrinsic features that determine their ability to exit quiescence and mount effective immune responses. Here we use label-free proteomics to quantify the proteome of B cell subsets from the mouse spleen and map the differential expression of environmental sensing, transcription, and translation initiation factors that define cellular identity and function. Cross-examination of the full-length transcriptome and proteome identifies mRNAs related to B cell activation and antibody secretion that are not accompanied by detection of the encoded proteins. In addition, proteomic data further suggests that the translational repressor PDCD4 restrains B cell responses, in particular those from marginal zone B cells, to a T-cell independent antigen. In summary, our molecular characterization of B cell maturation presents a valuable resource to further explore the mechanisms underpinning the specialized functions of B cell subsets, and suggest the presence of 'poised' mRNAs that enable expedited B cell responses.

ABSTRACT T cell function and fate can be influenced by several metabolites: in some cases, acting through enzymatic inhibition of -ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, in others, through post-translational modification of lysines in important targets. We show here that glutarate, a product of amino acid catabolism, has the capacity to do both, and has potent effects on T cell function and differentiation. We found that glutarate exerts those effects both through -ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase inhibition, and through direct regulation of T cell metabolism via glutarylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 alters CD8+ T cell differentiation and increases cytotoxicity against target cells. In vivo administration of the compound is correlated with increased levels of both peripheral and intratumoural cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. These results demonstrate that glutarate is an important regulator of T cell metabolism and differentiation with a potential role in the improvement of T cell immunotherapy.

Using three Achromobacter clinical isolates from two species, we show that the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) is required to induce cell death in human macrophages by inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis. Macrophages deficient in the or NLRP3 undergo pyroptosis upon bacterial internalization, but those deficient in both NLRC4 and NLRP3 do not, suggesting either sensor mediates pyroptosis in a T3SS-dependent manner. Detailed analysis of the intracellular trafficking of one isolate indicates that the intracellular bacteria reside in a late phagolysosome. Using an intranasal mouse infection model, we observe that Achromobacter damages lung structure and causes severe illness, contingent on a functional T3SS. Together, we demonstrate that Achromobacter species can survive phagocytosis by promoting macrophage cell death and inflammation by redundant mechanisms of pyroptosis induction in a T3SS-dependent manner.

ABSTRACT Suboptimal responses to a primary vaccination course have been reported in the elderly, but there is little information regarding the impact of age on responses to booster third doses. Here, we show that individuals 70 years or older (median age 73, range 70-75) who received a primary two-dose schedule with AZD1222 and booster third dose with mRNA vaccine achieve significantly lower neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus compared with those younger than 70 (median age 66, range 54-69) at 1 month post booster. Impaired neutralization potency and breadth post third dose in the elderly is associated with circulating \"atypical\" spike-specific B cells expressing CD11c and FCRL5. However, when considering individuals who received three doses of mRNA vaccine, we did not observe differences in neutralization or enrichment in atypical B cells. This work highlights the finding that AdV and mRNA COVID-19 vaccine formats differentially instruct the cell response.

ABSTRACT Assessment of the genetic similarity between two phenotypes can provide insight into a common genetic aetiology and inform the use of pleiotropy-informed, cross-phenotype analytical methods to identify novel genetic associations. The genetic correlation is a well-known means of quantifying and testing for genetic similarity between traits, but its estimates are subject to comparatively large sampling error. This makes it unsuitable for use in a small-sample context. We discuss the use of a previously published nonparametric test of genetic similarity for application to GWAS summary statistics. We establish that the null distribution of the test statistic is modelled better by an extreme value distribution than a transformation of the standard exponential distribution. We show with simulation studies and real data from GWAS of 18 phenotypes from the UK Biobank that the test is to be preferred for use with small sample sizes, particularly when genetic effects are few and large, outperforming the genetic correlation and another nonparametric statistical test of independence. We find the test suitable for the detection of genetic similarity in the rare disease context.

Identification and targeting of new molecular regulators of the innate activity are warranted to control the disease. Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) regulate both cell survival and inflammatory signaling. We investigated effects of IAP inhibition by second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetics (SMs) on innate responses and cell death to pathogen-associated molecular patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and Likewise, LPS (but not muramyl dipeptide or E. coli) induced TNF- was inhibited in CD and control PBMCs. The SM effect was partially reversed by inhibition of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). The effect was mainly cell death independent. Thus, IAP inhibition by SMs leads to reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines and may be considered in the efforts to develop new therapeutic strategies to control CD.

ABSTRACT of transcription factors at proximal promoters and distal enhancers is central to gene regulation. Identifying regulatory motifs and quantifying their impact on expression remains challenging. Using a convolutional neural network trained on single-cell data, we infer putative regulatory motifs and cell type-specific importance. Our model, scover, explains 29% of the variance in gene expression in multiple mouse tissues. Applying scover to distal enhancers identified using scATAC-seq from the developing human brain, we identify cell type-specific motif activities in distal enhancers. Scover can identify regulatory motifs and their importance from single-cell data where all parameters and outputs are easily interpretable.

We find that loss of TLR4 function unexpectedly increases phagocytosis of non-opsonised cryptococci by murine and human macrophages. The increased phagocytosis observed in Tlr4-/- cells was dampened by pre-treatment of macrophages with oxidised-LDL, a known ligand of scavenger receptors. The scavenger receptor, macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) (also known as SR-A1 or was upregulated in macrophages. Genetic 75% decrease in phagocytosis of non-opsonised cryptococci, strongly suggesting that it is a key non-opsonic receptor for this pathogen. We go on to show that MSR1-mediated uptake likely involves the formation of a multimolecular signalling complex involving FcR leading to SYK, PI3K, ERK1/2 activation to drive actin remodelling and phagocytosis. Altogether, our data indicate a hitherto unidentified role for TLR4/MSR1 crosstalk in the Clin Immunol. 2023 Aug 12. doi: 10.1007/s10875-023-01563-y.

Online ahead of print. ABSTRACT We compared the serologic responses of one versus two doses of a variant vaccine (Moderna mRNA-1273 Beta/Omicron BA.1 bivalent vaccine) in adults. A two-dose boosting regimen with a variant vaccine did not increase the magnitude or the durability of the serological responses compared to a single variant vaccine "}
