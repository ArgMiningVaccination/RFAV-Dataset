Stress | Mate mharahara Key points about stress - Stress (mate mharahara) is your body's natural reaction to a threat or an excess demand. - Some stress is good for you and helps motivate you to get something done. But when you are under too much stress for too long, it affects your health and wellbeing. - Learning how to manage stress is a key life skill. Stress is our body's natural reaction to a demand or threat. It triggers your body's fight, freeze or flight response, which causes a surge of hormones that would have helped our ancestors to run away from the stressor or fight it. It is supposed to be a short, sharp response to danger. But if you feel stressed a lot of the time, you put a lot of pressure on your health. Stress can come from many sources such as health issues, relationship problems, work, financial issues, deadlines, exams or unrealistic expectations you put on yourself. What causes stress for you may not be stressful for someone else. Some stress is helpful as it can motivate you to meet a deadline or get things done.
