At [Mass Ave Chiropractic](https://www.massavechiro.com) in Indianapolis, our team, which includes our esteemed chiropractor Joe Kielur, DC, has taken treatment of neck and back pain one step further with our DRS Protocol, which is an innovative and advanced treatment that's been proven to alleviate chronic neck and back pain. Why neck and back pain are so common Your spine is made up of a series of bones referred to as vertebrae, which are each separated by a cushiony, yet tough, disc. The bones and discs protect your spinal canal, support much of the upper weight of your body, and allow you to twist, lift, and bend your back. Unfortunately, those tough, cushiony discs that separate each of your vertebrae dry out as you get older, making them more susceptible to damage that results in a slipped or [herniated disc](https://www.massavechiro.com/services/herniated-disc) and [Posterior facet syndrome](https://www.massavechiro.com/services/facet-syndrome) - Failed back surgery These conditions can result in back pain, numbness and tingling in your extremities, and reduced quality of life. Treatment for these neck and back conditions usually includes medication, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery. But we have a better solution for your chronic neck and back pain that may help reduce your need for medication and serve as an alternative to surgery: the [DRS Protocol](https://www.massavechiro.com/contents/the-drs-protocol). What is DRS Protocol treatment? The DRS Protocol, which stands for decompression, reduction, and stabilization, is an innovative treatment that uses a number of safe and effective modalities to alleviate your pain. It was designed by a team of medical specialists, including neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, chiropractors, physiatrists, osteopaths, and physical therapists. The primary treatment behind DRS Protocol is axial/decompression. During this treatment, we apply axial force to the area of your back or neck causing your pain. This axial force changes the intradiscal pressure from positive to negative, which allows the influx of blood, nutrients, water, and oxygen to your diseased disc. The influx of fluids automatically rehydrates the disc and the nutrients help repair any disc damage to prolong disc health. Ultimately, the DRS Protocol reduces pressure inside your disc, improves blood flow to the area, begins the healing process, reduces your pain, and improves your mobility.
