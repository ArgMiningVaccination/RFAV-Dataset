Coleman, DC's Expert Contributions [How should I lay with lower back pain?](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/How-should-I-lay-with-lower-back-pain) Hi there, improper sleeping positions can cause you to wake up with an upper neck ache. Sometimes having double pillows causes a stretching of the upper neck muscles leading to a spasmodic-type feeling or stiffness. This can occur laying on the back. If you try using one pillow versus two it can help alleviate some of the muscle soreness upon waking. Laying on the left side is best, with a pillow between the knees, and on the back is second in my opinion. Always remember doing proper stretching techniques after awakening is a key component in relieving pain and stress.
