HOWEY INDIANAPOLIS - For David McIntosh, Muncie is still home, even though he has an apartment in Pendleton, part of the new 5th CD. But as the new maps were being debated in an Indiana House Elections Committee hearing Wednesday afternoon, the former congressman was on the phone indicating his heart and political future are in the new 6th CD next door. \"Muncie was always our home,\" said McIntosh, who prac - tices law in Washington, D.C., but appeared poised for a comeback. \"We still consider Muncie our home. We'll wait for a decision from Mike.\" That was in reference to U.S. Rep. Mike Pence, who is expected to announce a gubernatorial run sometime in May. If he does, it would be the impetus for the circle that saw McIntosh hand off the district to Pence in 2000 when McIntosh decided to run for governor.

There was Democrat Gov. Thomas R. Marshall, who tried to reform state and legal government only to earn the rebuke of the U.S. Supreme Court for doing so. And, to a lesser degree, there was Gov. Paul McNutt, the Depression-era Democrat who was able to round up the ran - dom array of state departments and agencies and bring about some order, thanks to the overwhelming majorities from the landslide FDR 1932 election (getting most of it done on his first day in office). I suppose you might in - clude Gov. Doc Bowen, but his work was mostly confined to property tax reform. As Speaker, Bowen almost derailed the \"radical\" Unigov plans of L. Keith Bulen and Mayor Dick Lugar. And, of course, there's Gov. Mitch Daniels, who is extensively reshap - ing Indiana education, though, like Marshall, he ultimately may fail to bring local government out of the 19th Century. Surveying Gates, Schricker, Craig, Handley, Welsh, Branigin and Whitcomb shows all were moderate centrists. So were Orr, Bayh, O'Bannon and Kernan. Which brings me to Congress - man Mike Pence. He is, unabashedly, a Chris - tian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order. Watching him speak to Howard County Republicans in Ko - komo last month, really emphasized to me how conservative he is. The speech seemed like something you'd expect to hear at the Vanderburgh Right to Life dinner. There is no ques - tion that Pence sees himself as a defender of life, taking God's divine mission. Pence will serve Him above all. He urged all Republicans to walk on the path of glory. I'm not being flip here. Taking the pro-life position is a highly principled one. Pence has embraced it as much as Frederick Douglass or Sojourner Truth did with abolition. Like Truth, Pence is prepared to hit the trails to bring life out of the darkness. When Pence speaks to Repub - lican groups, the reaction is vivid and emotional. There are shouts of \"amen\" on key points. There are standing ovations. The Howard County GOP produced a short film with Pence's voice-over intonations and soaring rhetoric along with aviary shots of Indiana, in Pence's parlance, over the \"amber waves of grain.\" It is splen - did political filmsmanship that the congressman is now using at other Lincoln Day speeches he's giving as a lead up to his expected gubernatorial announcement. There is no question that Pence commands the pro-life, evan - gelical Republican base, with the more mainstream party regulars getting swept up in the emotion. His sta - tion with Hoosier Republicans was so secure that it forced Lt. Gov. Becky Skillman - who in the 2008 Howey- Gauge Poll was extremely popular with the GOP base - out of the race. And this would all be well if a candidate could win the Indiana gov - ernorship with just Republican voters. While Statehouse Demo - crats are in a state of shock after seis - mic losses last November that came, in large part, because of a national wave, Pat Bauer's stacist meander - ing during this legislative session, and the new Congressional and legislative maps that were unveiled on Monday, the fact is that in order to elect an Indiana governor, you have to win a majority of that 25 percent pool of independent voters and a slice from the opposite party. Evan Bayh twice won a significant slice of Republican voters while dominating the indepen - dents. Gov. Daniels won some Demo - crats - including an unprecedented 20 percent of the African-American vote - while dominating the independents. There are two elements that should give pause to some Republi - cans and Pence himself. One is the HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 3 emerging candidacy of former Democratic House Speaker John Gregg, who apparently is just days or weeks away from getting into the gubernatorial race. If a Democratic consultant could forge a dream candidate, it would be John Gregg. He is larger than life (though he's slimmed down in recent years), affable, a fabulous public speaker and sto - ryteller, pro-life, pro-gun, calls Southern Indiana his base, and is conservative on the social issues. A Gregg candidacy might not make too many inroads into the Pence evangeli - cal constituency on the GOP right, but he will not be an anathema to them. Gregg would likely be able to bring the various Democratic constituencies to - gether, particularly if he forges a ticket with Senate Minority Leader Vi Simpson or former 7th CD candidate Woody My - ers (who could probably write a $2 million check to jump - start a campaign). That brings us to the key constituencies that are needed to win gubernato - rial races: independents and women. In coming election cycles, that will also include the emerging Latino bloc. In the October 2008 Howey-Gauge Poll, Gov. Daniels polled 57 percent of the female vote and 64 percent of independents. In the 2008 election results, Daniels carried 20 percent of the African-American vote, compared to 7 percent in 2004. Daniels polled 24 percent of the Democratic vote, com - pared to 13 percent in 2004. He won among whites 61- 36 percent, among 18-to- 21-year-olds, 51 percent; and carried 67 percent of those 65 and older. Daniels carried 58 percent of the male vote, 56 percent of the female vote. Following his 56-42 percent 2000 loss to Gov. Frank O'Bannon (who upset heavily favored Republican Stephen Goldsmith in 1996), Republican nominee David McIntosh told HPI, \"The key to winning is to win the ticket- splitting Republicans and split the independents. We were behind with independents and not winning the ticket-split - ting Republicans.\" And this gets us to the past week in Washington. Pence was in the vanguard of those favoring shut - ting down the federal government. He was willing to do so over the issue of defunding Planned Parenthood. Some see this as a card that House Speaker John Boehner suc - cessfully used to get $38 billion in cuts from the budget from President Obama. Pence said on ABC's \"This Week\" that Boehner got a \"good deal,\" but then said he would vote against the compromise because Planned Parenthood would still get about $300 million in federal funding, though the Hyde Amendment prohibits any of that money being used for abortion. Pence and Right to Life allies argue that such federal funding frees other non-fed funding for abor - tion. By late last week, Senate Democrats had opened a new front on this initial federal budget skirmish: it became a \"war on women.\" And Mike Pence was its General Grant. Pence's Little Round Top defense of life and his willingness to shut down the government earned high praise from his base and the Tea Party, which didn't think the final budget deal was nearly enough. But Pence already has those voters. As a gubernatorial candidate, he will likely be able to mobilize them in robust numbers. But his willingness to shut down the government turns off a lot of independents, just as the Indiana House Democratic walkout did. In an American Viewpoint Poll for Indiana Republicans, almost 70 percent of the independents opposed the walkout. I suspect a similar number would not find a federal government shutdown palatable. Watching NBC and ABC evening news on Friday, the man-on-the- street interviews were critical of the shutdown, particularly military families, moderates and independents. All thought the circus in Washington was crazy. Polling tended to bear out those reactions. A CNN survey conducted over the weekend suggests that Obama's approach convinced the public: 54 percent of Americans approved of how the Presi - dent handled the budget negotiations, while 45 percent did not. Meanwhile, 44 percent of Americans approved of how congressional Republicans performed, while 54 percent disapproved. For congressional Democrats, the numbers were exactly the same as for Republicans. In a Pew Research Center/Washington Post poll, 72 percent of people said Obama bore some blame for the near-shut - down, compared to 82 percent who blamed Democratic leaders in Congress and 81 percent who cited GOP leaders. The Pew/Washington Post poll also showed other bad news for all parties involved. Asked to define how they viewed the process, the most popular word employed by those polled was \"ridiculous,\" followed by \"disgusting.\" It's important to understand Pence's political trajectory. He lost two challenges to U.S. Rep. Phil Sharp back in 1988 and 1990. He won what is now the 6th CD when U.S. Rep. McIntosh handed it off to him on his way to the 2000 gubernatorial race. Like Pence is now, McIntosh was wooed by Hoosier Republicans to get into the 2000 governor race, had the pro-life, evangelic base, and then Rep. Pence's Planned Parenthood issue was a topic on Jon Stewart's \"Daily Show.\"HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 4 upsetting him in the crowded 2010 5th CD primary, but his new district is problematic for an aging pol who got only 29 percent of the 2010 primary vote and finds a potential chal - lenge from Brig. Gen. John McGoff. U.S. Rep. Joe Donnelly will have to make a decision on whether to seek a fourth term in the more Republican 2nd CD, where he lost Kokomo and a friendly chunk of LaPorte County while picking up very Republican parts of Elkhart, Wabash, Miami and Kosciusko counties. Donnelly on Wednesday reported raising a robust $363,000 as for - mer state Rep. Jackie Walorski has already announced after her 1 percent loss in 2010. That's why a U.S. Senate race is under consideration by Donnelly. In the new 7th CD, U.S. Rep. Andre Carson finds 4th CD U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita in his district, though Rokita can invoke the Mike Pence/Chris Chocola doctrine and run in the 4th CD anyway. The 4th, drawn up by Indiana Sen - ate Republicans, looks as if it were created for State Sen. Brandt Hershman, who lost a lackluster campaign to Rokita in the 2010 primary. Rokita almost instantly announced he was seeking reelection in the 4th. Carson's 7th, sans heav - ily African-American Pike Township and with an eroding Center Township population base, picked up the heavily Republican tier of townships in the south and might be in play. And then there are the 10 Indiana House seats where three sets of Republicans, three sets of Democrats - including three in one Indianapolis district - and four inter -party incumbent showdowns, tend to bear out to impartial observers that the pins and political maps were put aside in the name of fairness, communities of interest and compact - ness, a demand of the ultimate Decider, Gov. Mitch Daniels. Daniels didn't see the new maps until Monday \"when everyone else did,\" he told HPI. \"That was my pref - erence. So I want to hear the reaction of others and listen to any suggested improvements. But on first impression, yes,\" he said to our question about whether the maps met his preliminary requirements. Daniels called them a \"huge improvement on the 2001 gerrymander. They seem to be far, far better, and to meet any reasonable test of compact - ness and respecting communities of interest.\" That was the take of Julia Vaughn of Indiana Common Cause and the independent Volunteer Redistrict - ing Commission. She cited the 1 vote deviation per Con - gressional district and the 64,800-person Indiana House districts that were compact, united 113 cities and towns and 22 school corporations and told the House Committee, \"You did a good job right there. Overall I give you an 'A' for keeping your promise.\" Another commission member, for - mer State Rep. Bill Ruppel, who was defeated in the 2010 Republican primary, also lauded the committee for being \"basically politically blind.\" House map makers led by Koch and State Rep. Kathy Kreig Richardson avoided some obvious pitfalls. They didn't put House Minority Leader B. Patrick Bauer in a district with one of his colleagues. There were six GOP in - cumbents paired in the same district: HD50 Ways & Means Chairman Jeff Espich with Rep. Dan Leonard, HD68 with freshman Rep. Jud McMillin paired with Rep. Tom Knoll -never really got close to Gov. Frank O'Bannon, a pro-life, pro-gun, pro-death penalty Southern Indiana Democrat. Pence's electoral success has come in an overwhelming Republican 6th CD, where he has never been seriously challenged. This has allowed him to rise through the ideo - logically conservative ranks, where his silver tongue of broadcast pedigree positioned him as the darling of the evangelical right. He is so esteemed there that it nearly projected him into the 2012 presidential race. While many of Pence's supporters were infatuated with a run for the White House, they knew his resume was limited to manag - ing a Congressional office along with TV and radio shows. Being governor of Indiana would give him the executive experience necessary to run the United States of America. The danger for Pence is that throughout Hoosier history, Indiana governors have been mostly centrist, moderates. They may color outside the lines on issues like tax, education or government reform, but they mostly govern from inside the mainstream. I would not use the word \"radical\" to describe either Daniels or Marshall (whose portrait hangs over the governor's conference table today). Last week I wrote that Pence was taking a peril - ous course in the initial budget skirmish. A government shutdown could have been a master stroke of genius, but more likely would have been the kind of disaster that Newt Gingrich never fully recovered from. Now Pence is poised to run for Indiana governor outside the mainstream. He is an emotional politician who wears his religion on his sleeve and acts from the heart. Like McIntosh and Goldsmith, he will likely face a Southern Indiana Democrat who leans his way on social issues, but governs from the center. In a race for governor, Pence will likely enter as the early favorite. He will have an energized base. Gregg will use the GOP \"overreach\" on labor, women's rights and the shutdown to find a reinvigorated Democratic base. If the economy improves, the jobless rate goes down, President Obama's standing recovers, the 2012 Indiana governor's race will likely come down to independents and women. I think the 2012 Pence-Gregg showdown could be a battle for the ages. v Maps, from page 1HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 5 man, and HD25 where Rep. Don Lehe is paired with Rep. Rich McClain. The multiple Democrat districts include HD14 with Reps. Chet Dobis and Vernon Smith, HD96 with Reps. Van - essa Summers and Jeb Bardon, and HD99 with Reps. Ed DeLaney, John Day and Greg Porter. \"I thought the three- member districts had been abolished,\" DeLaney could be heard saying prior to Wednesday's hearing. A few minutes later, Koch announced that the House Democrats had asked for more time and will present their own maps on Thurs - day, but Speaker Brian Bosma told HPI he expected the maps to clear the House \"late Thursday or Friday.\" Porter was clinging to the remote possibility that the maps would go away. \"Right now it's just a proposal,\" Porter said on Wednesday. Bardon appeared to be prepared to \"step aside\" for Summers. Es - pich has said he will seek reelection and would easily vanquish Leonard, and Dobis and Smith appeared to be headed for an epic Lake County showdown. This came just months after Bosma awarded a committee chair to Dobis, who then walked out with most of his caucus. \"It's an unfortunate circumstance. It's not something I relish,\" Espich said. \"He's my friend, and we'll have to see what the people think.\" Both Dobis and Smith appeared ready to seek the district they now share. \"It's not a district I can't win. All of that, including the Glen Park area, are portions of districts that I've represented for years,\" Dobis said (NWI Times). Dobis and Smith both said they would prefer not to have to run against a fellow Democrat to keep their seat, but both said they'll run. \"I enjoy what I do, I want to continue to serve, so it will be up to the public,\" Smith said. Reske seemed resigned to life outside the legisla - ture, surveying the new district he shares with Rep. Bob Cherry, telling HPI minutes after the map unveiling, \"This looks like it's about 70 percent Republican.\" \"What they did was probably the model district from 10 years ago and they chopped it up as far as com - munities of interest, county lines, township lines, school districts,\" Reske said. \"It's divided between two different counties. I see four school districts now. If you look at the old district it was pretty square.\" And there are four interparty showdowns: HD20 with Republican Rep. Tom Dermody and Democrat Nancy Dembowski, HD37 with Republican Cherry and Democrat Scott Reske, HD60 with Republican Ralph Foley and Demo -crat Matt Pierce, and HD64 with Republican Bruce Borders and Democrat Kreg Battles. Borders was in a slight state of shock when he learned about a potential showdown with Battles. \"I think I start a few points down,\" Borders said. \"It will be hard, hard, hard. I'll just have to play it by ear.\" While no one had baseline projections, the leading school of thought is that Republicans would find tailwinds in 60 to 64 of the new seats, with a good chance of picking up new members in the eight seats with no incumbents. The new HD13 finds Attica Clerk-Treasurer Sharon Negele as a resident after she narrowly lost to State Rep. Dale Grubb last November. The new HD17 finds Frances Elert, who narrowly lost to Dembowski. There are other new open seats - HD24 in Boone and Hamilton counties, HD37 based around Fishers, HD47 in Johnson and Morgan counties, HD55 in parts of Fayette, Rush, Decatur, Frank - lin and Ripley counties, HD82 centered in Noble County - that all look like potential GOP pick - ups. The open HD86 in Pike and Washington townships in Marion County will likely be a swing dis - trict and HD100 around Irvington is a probable Democratic seat. Indiana CDs Here is HPI's initial analysis of Congressional and pivotal Indiana House seats: 1st CD: U.S. Rep. Pete Visclosky finds a district that unites the entire \"Marquette Plan\" lakeshore in Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties. It is the lone safe Democratic district. 2nd CD: The biggest Congressional loser could be Donnelly, which was anticipated. Donnelly finds himself los - ing Kokomo and picking up portions of Republican redoubts Kosciusko County along with Wabash, Miami and Pulaski counties, making it much more Republican. He keeps part of LaPorte along with St. Joseph, Elkhart, Starke and Marshall counties. Donnelly said he expects to decide \"in the coming weeks\" whether he will run for re-election or another office next year (Allen, South Bend Tribune). \"Even though it appears that politics played a role in the drawing of this map, I am confident that a Democrat can win in the new 2nd Congressional District,\" he said. \"President Obama performed well in this district in 2008, earning 49 percent of the vote. Also, it is not uncommon for a Democratic candidate in Indiana to outperform his or her nominee for president. I did it in 2008, outperforming then-Sen. Obama by 13 points, and I know it can be done again.\" HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 6 Walorski, a former state representative from Jim - town, announced last month that she will mount another congressional bid in 2012. She said she declared her candidacy early because she's not concerned with the 2nd District's shape. \"Whatever's in the district is fine with me,\" she said Monday. \"Whatever's out of the district is fine with me.\" Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, said the new 2nd District that Republicans have proposed likely would lean in favor of the GOP. But, he added, \"I think it's still a district that can be won by either party.\" In a statement put out in response to the proposal, Donnelly noted that the newly drawn district would have given President Obama 49 percent of the vote in 2008 and says he is confident that Democrats can still win it (Washington Post). \"As for my future plans, my decision will ultimately be based on how I can best serve the people of this great state,\" Donnelly said. \"I will soon be sitting down with my wife and children and expect to make a decision in the coming weeks.\" Donnelly's campaign announced its strongest fundraising quarter since taking office in 2007. He raised $363,288 in the quarter that ended March 31. \"I am grate - ful for the generous support I've received,\" said Donnelly. \"It takes a significant amount of money these days to win elections and only by winning elections will we be able to continue to pursue policies that benefit working and mid - dle-class families.\" Donnelly's strongest quarter before this one was the first quarter of 2007, when he raised approxi - mately $349,000. During the 2007-2008 cycle, Donnelly was a part of the DCCC's Frontline Program, which, among other things, supports members' fundraising operations. This cycle, Donnelly is not a part of the Frontline Program. Donnelly's supporters included a significant number of low- dollar donors. Seventy percent of the individual contribu - tions in the first quarter were $250 or less and over half of the individual contributions were $100 or less. 3rd CD: U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman loses parts of Elkhart and Kosciusko counties and picks up Huntington, Wells, Adams and Jay counties. HPI views this as slightly less Republican than the current 3rd and Stutzman should perform well here unless he finds a Democratic wave and a well-known, well-financed Democratic opponent. 4th CD: The old Frankendistrict is going away and the new 4th splays out from I-465 to the northwest, with Lafayette and the Indianapolis suburbs in Hendricks county forming the heart of its population. U.S. Rep. Todd Rokita is living outside of the proposed 4th CD, but quickly said he will seek reelection in the new district that runs from Mor - gan and Hendricks counties in the south up to Newton and Jasper counties and including the Lafayette area. \"Undoing the obnoxious gerrymander of a decade ago is a real challenge,\" said Rokita, who as secretary of state ignited the Rethinking Redistricting campaign that appears to have greatly influenced the new maps. \"While I am still reviewing the maps, I absolutely will be running for reelection in the 4th Congressional district. In fact, this week I will be filing my first quarter fund raising report with the FEC which will show that I have over $374,000 cash on hand.\" Indiana Senate Republicans despise Rokita and may have created this district with State Sen. Brandt Hershman in mind. Her - shman is attending law school, would be up for reelection in 2012 and did not return HPI's calls as to what his political plans are. His 2010 primary against Rokita did not rise to expectations and he did not carry his home county. For now, Rokita is in the driver's seat. 5th CD: Rep. Dan Burton is signaling he will seek another term. Sources have told HPI that some on his staff were against reelection, but that his wife and brother - State Rep. Woody Burton - are encouraging him to seek another term. Messer told HPI on Tuesday that he would not move into the 5th CD from his home in Shelbyville, deep in the new 6th. \"We won't move,\" he said. \"We won't consider that as a family. While the law doesn't require us to live in the 5th, it is highly unlikely we would run there. We'll take a hard look at the 6th. Mike Pence and I are friends and we'll talk.\" While Burton may have dodged the Messer bul - let, his new district could present challenges. Burton loses Miami, Wabash and Huntington counties. He lost Grant County to Messer. And Burton has performed poorly in Hamilton and Marion counties over the past two election cycles with Messer and John McGoff performing well there. Burton does pick up Madison and part of Blackford County. Of the 2010 primary opponents, McGoff and Brose McVey appear to still be in the district. State Sen. Mike Delph lives in the district and is seen as a potential heir apparent to Burton when Burton decides to retire. Former Reagan speechwriter Peter Rusthoven recently moved to Zionsville (as have Steve Buyer and Mike Copher), though it is not HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 7 likely Rusthoven would challenge the incumbent. 6th CD: With Pence expected to run for governor, McIntosh is poised to become the frontrunner there. U.S. Senate candidate Don Bates Jr. and Wayne County Sheriff Matt Strittmatter are either planning or have announced their intentions to run. But clearly McIntosh, who repre - sented much of the district from 1994 to 2000, would be in a commanding position, particularly when he picks up an endorsement from Pence. Messer told HPI on Wednesday, \"We'll watch what happens.\" 7th CD: U.S. Rep. Andre Carson and his grand - mother, the late U.S. Rep. Julia Carson, avoided well- funded GOP challenges after Brose McVey ran a state-of- the-art campaign in 2002 and still lost by 13,000 votes. The Carson Show hasn't drawn a serious challenge since. That could change now that much of Pike Township is gone. The 7th picks up heavily Republican Decatur, Perry and Franklin townships. The district is home to a number of prominent Republicans who might look at the 7th if the baseline numbers dramatically improve. This one will be subject to further analysis. 8th CD: In the span of one week freshman U.S. Rep. Larry Bucshon lost Republican-leaning Warren, Put - nam and Fountain counties and picked up more Democratic Spencer, Dubois and Perry counties. He also found out he'll be challenged by Warrick County Democratic Chairman Terry A. White of Newburgh. White, a 57-year-old attor - ney, confirmed Thursday that he will run for the seat. \"I'm at the point in my life where I'm able to give back to the community a lot more,\" White told the Evansville Courier & Press. \"I've spent all my career basically protecting the rights and freedoms and safety of constituents (as an at - torney in general practice) in this area, and I just want an opportunity to do it on a larger level.\" This might actually be one of the most competitive CDs in the state, though we believe that Bucshon is more than capable of defending the district. \"If counties vote based on their historic tradition, I think you could see a very competitive election in the 8th in 2012,\" said Dan Parker, the chairman of the Indiana Demo - cratic Party (Evansville Courier & Press). 9th CD: Freshman U.S. Rep. Todd Young is one of the winners with the new maps. He finds a much more compact district with 13 counties as opposed to the sprawl - ing 20 counties in the old 9th CD that ran from the Ohio River in the east to Spencer County in the west. Young finds his Bloomington home in the new district that is bookended by the Indianapolis suburbs of Johnson County - about 25 percent of his district's population - to the north and the Louisville suburbs in Clark and Floyd counties to the south. The new district finds I-65 and SR37 as the main arteries, as opposed to the network of winding state highways that past congressmen had to traverse. With Clark, Floyd and Harrison counties becoming more Republi -can, Young should find this district very defendable. We are hearing that former congressman Baron Hill has closed his committee, though his hometown of Seymour is still in the district. Statehouse impact Here is what we are picking up from various quar - ters in the Statehouse: Black Caucus: Last week we reported that the House Black Caucus might be under fire with the new maps. Of that eight member caucus, three members - Porter, Summers and Vernon Smith - could face colleague opponents. Mike Delph: When you look at the new 5th CD, it is hard not to see a perfect district for Sen. Delph some day. No Denbo comeback: While former State Rep. Jerry Denbo testified before the House Election Committee on Wednesday, he said he is unlikely to run for the House again. He was there to testify about the splitting of French Lick into two districts. Denbo resides in the new HD74 held by Republican Rep. Sue Ellspermann. Blanton in Davisson district: Former State Rep. Sandra Blanton, defeated last November by State Rep. Matt Ubelhor, is now in HD73 held by freshman State Rep. Steve Davisson. Denbo said he expects Blanton to consider a challenge to Davisson. State Rep. Sheila Klinker loses a good part of West Lafayette and Purdue University. She calls her new district \"more Republican.\" Asked if she was planning to seek another term, she told HPI, \"I don't know. I think so.\" State Sen. Jim Buck is upset, sources say, that he lost Westfield in his new Senate district. Former House majority leader Russ Stilwell now resides in a district represented by State Rep. Ron Bacon. Stilwell was defeated in 2010 by Ellspermann. Bacon told HPI on Wednesday that his new district is more Republican than the one he ran in and he believes he can defend the seat. Bacon's upset of Stilwell was one of the biggest surprises on Election Night. Democrat Matt Pierce and Republican Ralph Foley will end up in a new 60th District, which includes much of Morgan County and northern Monroe County. \"This looks to be a good district for Foley,\" observed Cam Savage in the Capitol & Washington blog. State Rep. Peggy Welch finds herself in the new 61st District, which includes much of the People's Republic of Bloomington. Savage observed: \"This is essentially Pierce's old district. To the lefties in Bloomington, Welch is far too conservative. This looks to be a reliably Democrat district, but you can bet your patchouli Welch will have a primary foe from the hippie-professor- peacenik wing of her party.\" vHOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 8 Maps impact on the 2nd and 3rd CDs By MARK SOUDER PHILADELPHIA - The future of the 2nd and the 3rd districts was clear when the Republicans swept the 2010 elections. The Fort Wayne based district (the 3rd) was go - ing to be refocused on the Fort Wayne metro area. The 2nd District was going to become much more Republican. The only shock was the insult to Kosciusko County, a loyal Republican stronghold which was again treated with no respect by being divided into two districts. When the Democrats ger - rymandered the districts in 2008, moving incumbent Chris Chocola just outside the 2nd District and attempting to leave me just outside 3rd, it resulted in a fair amount of chaos. Along US 33 heading south into Goshen, you could travel in the 2nd District surrounded by the 3rd. About a third of the 3rd District was put in the South Bend/Elkhart television market. Mike Pence represented Wells and Adams coun - ties, closely connected to Fort Wayne, while the rest of his district flowed toward Indianapolis. Huntington County was attached to Dan Burton's district. It made no governing sense, only political sense for the Democrats to recapture the 2nd District. A second 2011 goal was to make it as hard as pos - sible for Joe Donnelly to retain his congressional seat. In spite of the Republicans' best efforts, it is not a slam dunk for Jackie Walorski to defeat him. Republican enthusiasm was high in 2010. South Bend Democrats were nowhere to be found. Donnelly slightly over-performed in Elkhart, even after voting for ObamaCare. Furthermore, the new district lines include other potential GOP candidates such as State Rep. Wes Culver (who ran in the caucus to replace me) and State Sens. Carlin Yoder and Ryan Mishler. Others could emerge as well. That said, Walorski is nearly a prohibitive favorite to win the nomination and election. The issues suggest it won't be a strong Democratic year in Indiana. Three wars, for example, tend to dampen the anti-war vote. South Bend has declined to around 100,000 in population (compared to over 250,000 in Fort Wayne). While I would never underestimate Donnelly in either race, I agree with most analysts that he will likely opt for the Senate, hoping for a wounded Republican candidate. St. Joseph County Prosecutor Michael Dvorak is a possible replacement but a big city base will not be an advantage. Mayor Kauffman of Goshen would be a long shot, but other than Donnelly, any Democrat would be one. Congressman Stutzman has a different problem. His base was in the rural north of the 3rd, not Allen County, which is one half the vote. Furthermore, choosing to live in Washington further weakened his district ties. With the recent news of the breaking of the administration's com - mitment to build the new Veteran's Hospital in Fort Wayne, plus uncertainty about the air base, his opposition to sup - porting GM, and lack of clarity on earmarking funds for the many defense contractors, an Allen County based candi - date could emerge in the primary or on the Democrat side to oppose him in the likely more difficult Republican year of 2014. Liz Brown and Ryan Elijah ran in the caucus against Marlin to replace me. Mayoral candidate Eric Doden ex - pressed interest in the seat as well. However, if Marlin works the district hard and fights for Fort Wayne jobs, the counties added back to the 3rd are also likely to prefer a Republican and unlikely to oust an incumbent. The only surprise big loser is Kosciusko County. Claiming it will have two congressmen is such a lie that anyone who uses it should not be taken seriously. Splitting one of Indiana's more populated counties into two parts results in making it one of the smaller counties in both districts, which reduces its clout. It is now attached at the edges of districts with major population centers far away and no local television. Kosciusko County is one of Indiana's greatest treasures. Home to our biggest natural lake, Wawasee, and 100 others, as well as the village of Winona, it is a statewide tourism attraction. Lake City Bank is the region's largest. Maple Leaf Farms is the worldwide leader in duck processing. Grace College anchors its education cluster. Creighton Brothers eggs, Explorer Vans, Miller's Merry Manor headquarters and Little Crow Foods (Coco Wheats) are among the county's employers. But Kosciusko is most known as the center of the worldwide orthopedics industry with three of the four largest companies in the world, and many suppliers. Kosciusko needs to be made whole in the final map. Consolidating it would have little impact on the 2nd or the 3rd. Any Republican who can't win in either district without half of Kosciusko doesn't deserve the nomination. What did they do to deserve being carved up? v Souder is a former Republican member of Congress from Fort Wayne. HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 9 Daniels' 'truce' has to begin in Indiana By MARK SCHOEFF, JR. WASHINGTON - If Gov. Mitch Daniels' call for a truce among Republicans on social issues is to become a reality, Indiana could be a good place to monitor whether it will become a reality. In the fierce battle over deficit and debt reduction in Washing - ton, the GOP has held the high ground for weeks. But Rep. Mike Pence (R-6th CD) was instrumental in taking the focus off of budget matters and turning it to divisive social issues just as congres - sional negotiators closed in on a deal for a fiscal 2011 measure. Shortly after Daniels, in a speech in the capital in February, eloquently explained the na - tion's fiscal crisis and outlined steps required to tackle it, President Barack Obama basically ignored the problem in his budget proposal. A week ago, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), chairman of the House Budget Committee, offered a budget resolu - tion for fiscal 2012 that would cut federal spending by $6.2 trillion more than Obama did in his blueprint and would re - duce the deficit by $4.4 trillion over the next decade com - pared to what Obama would do. Daniels and Ryan started a fiscal conversation that was amplified by the negotia - tions over the fiscal 2011 budget that concluded over the weekend with an agreement to cut current spending levels by $38 billion through the end of September. In sometimes tense talks with the White House and Senate Democrats to avoid a government shutdown, Republicans were able to cut spending by much more than Obama ever envisioned. Obama belatedly entered the budget discussion on Wednesday by laying out a plan that would reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 12 years but would leave the two biggest federal cost centers on autopilot - Medicare and Medicaid. Ryan was willing to take a political risk and ad - dress these hot-button programs. Republicans were dominating the fiscal dialogue until last Friday afternoon. For the first time in weeks, Democrats started to gain traction. They did it by refocusing the debate on social policy - zeroing in on the so-called policy riders that the House GOP was insisting be part of the fiscal 2011 agreement. The rider that caused the most controversy was one that would bar federal funding of Planned Parenthood and other health clinics under Title X. Pence was its cham - pion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., as - serted that Republicans and Democrats could settle their differences over spending. The problem was the social issues. \"But now the Tea Party is trying to sneak through its extreme social agenda \u2014 issues that have nothing to do with funding the government,\" Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor. He and other Democrats asserted that Republicans were trying to shut down the government over \"women's health.\" All day, Democrats spoke to a constituency - women and independents - that likely would be turned off by Republican attempts to mix social and fiscal policy. It's the group of voters who Daniels has suggested are crucial to bring on board if tough decisions are made to balance the budget. They are the folks who never listen to Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity. In the end, the riders were mostly excised from the fiscal 2011 agreement, a move that was hailed as a vic - tory by Democrats. Pence, however, is showing no signs of backing down. \"Let me say, first off, it's nonsense to say that Republicans were willing to shut down the government over (the Planned Parenthood rider),\" Pence said on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"What was clear here is that this administration and liberals in Congress were willing to shut the government down to continue to fund abortion provid - ers in this country. Why would I fight for it? Let me explain. I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. I also think it's morally wrong to take the tax dollars of millions of pro-life Ameri - cans and use them) to fund abortion providers.\" Pence's Hoosier House colleagues were with him, although for them the riders were as much a means as an end. Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-3rd CD) is strongly pro-life but also wanted to ring as much savings out of the fiscal 2011 budget as possible. \"You have to give us either cuts in spending or riders,\" Stutzman said in an HPI interview. Rep. Todd Rokita (R-4th CD) emphasized that he is pro-life in every circumstance. But he acknowledged that Democrats took advantage of the social issues. \"The riders have given Democrats a chance to cloud the anti- spending message,\" Rokita said in an HPI interview last week. \"It's a spending bill, not an abortion bill. We'll have plenty of time to fight those fights in a standalone bill.\" Indeed, separate votes were scheduled this week on riders that were taken out of the fiscal 2011 measure. The GOP, however, may face another challenge in staying focused on the budget-cutting theme if Pence and his allies push again to attach riders to the debt-limit bill that is likely to come up in Congress between Memorial Day and July 4. It will be another opportunity to convince indepen - dents that Republicans are all about fiscal responsibility - as long as they don't undermine that theme with social issues. Perhaps a truce is in order. v HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 10 HPI: So that's the next battle ground, right? Young: Indeed. HPI: When will average Hoosiers begin seeing the headlines on this next phase? Young: That depends upon you and many others in your profession, and I say that respectfully. There are many people, Congressman Ryan, myself and others who have been talking about this stuff for some time. I think we're starting to see a more detailed reporting of the ex - tent of our nation's fiscal challenges. We're starting to put these things in context. People are starting to understand that it is Medicare, Medicaid, your Social Security, and the interest on our debt that is the vast majority of our budget and increasingly becoming a larger portion of that budget, and that tough, responsible decisions are to be made now if we're going to address these things in a very compas - sionate way. HPI: Most freshmen don't get that kind of conspic - uous perch. Tell me about your relationship with Chairman Ryan. Young: I lobbied Chairman Ryan very heavily to sit on his committee. I told him I regarded our nation's un - funded liabilities as our greatest challenge. It is a national security challenge. It threatens the quality of life of all working Americans. It threatens our children and grandchil - dren. I think I've earned a large measure of trust from him from the beginning. As we put together this budget, I've been in very close consultation with him, working with him on the messaging of this budget and I think I've earned his trust. That's why he chose me. HPI: This began after you were elected? Young: After I was elect - ed. I had no prior relationship with him. He was aware of my cam - paign and the issues I ran on because, in part, due to the much publicized TV commercials used against me on some of the issues both he and I care deeply about. It was really right after the election when we went to Washington during some orientation periods when I first connected with him. We talked a little bit about economics and shared interest and I planted a seed. I lobbied members of the budget committee and it deliberated behind the scenes. You have several options in this crisis. You either jack up taxes, which I and most economists regard is at an unsustainable level that will constrain job creation, decrease incentives for future economic growth and make us uncompetitive internationally. Or you commence some sort of reforms right now in a very gradual way, reform these different entitlement programs - in a humane and responsible way - Y oung sees House frosh changing fiscal debate By BRIAN A. HOWEY INDIANAPOLIS - A week after appearing with House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan on the release of the Republican Budget Blueprint, and four days after averting a federal government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Todd Young sat down with Howey Politics Indiana to talk about the fiscal crisis impacting the United States. Young, who was elected last November, helped Ryan formulate the Medicaid block grants to the state propos - als. He met with HPI at the Rathskeller in Indianapolis. HPI: Give us an overview coming off the Friday night deal on the budget. Young: We changed the nature of the debate in Washington. It wasn't too long ago - frankly just months ago - when those representing us in Washington were dis - cussing how much money we ought to be spending. Now we're debating how much money we should be cutting. Those of us who campaigned on such things are encouraged by the fact that we changed that dynamic. It really didn't change until we passed the Continuing Resolution measures in recent weeks. The President's position, you'll recall, until the 2010 elec - tion was that we need to con - tinue to stimulate the economy with government infusions of tax dollars with borrowed mon - ey through quantitative easing - printing money. Then after the 2010 elections, his position was we need to hold the line on spending, or a spending freeze. Now he's conceded to spending cuts. The debate is where those cuts should oc - cur. I'm very encouraged that Republicans have caused the shift to occur and we've done it while only controlling one House of Congress. HPI: But the action has been over 12 percent of the budget. Young: That's right. We're only touching a small portion thus far. HPI: The tough stuff is coming. Young: For many of us it's already come. We've already gone on record taking some responsible action with respect to our unsustainable entitlement programs. HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Page 11 Thursday , April 14, 2011 and I guess the other option would be to do nothing. And that's really not an option because it will be forced by the bond markets as we become a credit risk. That will result in some very hasty, drastic and painful measures if we wait for the bond market to act. It's the choice of two futures, as Chairman Ryan puts it. HPI: On not raising the debt, I've heard even Republicans say they are not sure what the impact will be. Could it send things haywire? Young: There are two ways to read this situa - tion. It would be irresponsible not to take seriously those arguments. But one could very reasonably say by sending a strong signal to the markets there is now a substantial bloc in Congress that is finally serious about getting this debt under control that could be a positive thing. That could ac - tually increase confidence in our seriousness about paying off all these debts. What we need to do here is to demand spending concessions, and then on the back end of it we will raise the debt ceiling. There are some tactical ways of doing that like raising the debt ceiling for just a short time. That would allow us to monitor compliance with whatever deal has been struck. But if you do that you have to be prepared to vote against raising the debt ceiling again if we get off track. I'm not privy to the conversations our leader - ship is having now. But I take seriously the threat that you don't want to scare the bond markets. HPI: Most Hoosiers, most Americans, don't know much about the debt ceiling. How many times are we going to have to raise it through your first term? Young: It all depends on what you raise it to and how high you raise it. You could conceivably raise it to a high enough level that it wouldn't come up again this term. I don't anticipate that. There are many of us who want to find some device to hold others' feet to the fire to get finances back under control. The CBO's models break down in 2037 because of the unsustainable level of borrowing and spending at the federal level. That boggles the mind. HPI: Liberal commentators are casting the pro - posed Medicaid block grants as balancing the budget on the backs of the poor. How do you respond to that? Young: It is absolutely not true. This is a response from both Democrat and Republican governors across the nation who are asking for more flexibility for their states as they wrestle with the challenge of skyrocketing Medicaid costs. They just want the ability to more effectively and more efficiently manage those programs for their most vulnerable populations. I think we ought to give it to them. The Medicaid program ought to be preserved and, in fact, strengthened. Right now it is absolutely unsustainable. It is the responsible and moral thing to do if we want to have a social based precisely on what we want to do. I don't think those people in Washington - myself included - have a monopoly on wisdom. I think we should trust Hoosiers to do that. Furthermore, we are building on the very welfare reform efforts of the 1990s - Bill Clinton's popular reforms. This is just taking it to the next stage. He made reforms with respect to Aid to Families with Dependent Children. We propose changes to Medicaid, food stamps and housing assistance. We can learn from each state's best practices. We have 50 laboratories of democracy. When states inno - vate, other states can learn. HPI: Does it concern you, though Indiana is an obvious exception, that many states are deeply in debt and to give them billions of dollars of block grants that might be used to balance their budgets? Young: If the solution to each of our problems at the local or state level is just to hand it off to the next higher level, that's an argument for world government. HPI: I'm not even going to touch that one. Young: It's something I'm not advocating. I think government closest to the people is what we should aspire to. This is one of those areas where we can allow each state to tailor their Medicaid programs to the needs of their citizenry and move away from a one-size-fits-all model. I wouldn't characterize it as radical. I would call it evolution - ary. I think the radical thing would be to do nothing as we are heading off a fiscal cliff. This is the most predictable crisis. I think there will be a political price to pay for those who don't provide their own solutions. If we don't give states the tools to reform themselves, we are really pouring kerosene on the house fire. HPI: The presidential race on the Republican side is wide open. Are you encouraging Gov. Daniels to run? Young: At every turn. I am hungry for a big idea politician at the top of our ticket. We need Mitch Daniels or someone like him. No one else comes to mind right now. I want others to encourage him as well. Our country needs him. HPI: Anything you'd like to add? Young: I hope Republicans and Democrats can work together. I hope this does not become an ugly debate about the best solutions to get our country back on track. I think this is a very positive thing and hopefully we'll have an honest dialogue about the best solutions on these unsustainable programs and doing it in a very humane way. It takes all of us to do it. We need to minimize the demagoguery and distortion and act like adults and I look forward to doing that. HPI: You've seen your new Congressional district. What's your reaction? Young: I can't give you real detailed reaction. I guess it's a relief that my house is going to be in the district, I'm told, so that will minimize any stress or adjust - ment on my family. This isn't about me. The maps strike me as pretty fair and compact and compliant with the law. vHOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 12 Lugar opens big money lead over Mourdock By BRIAN A. HOWEY INDIANAPOLIS - U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar's reelection campaign appears to have opened a significant fundraising edge in the race against Indiana Treasurer Richard Mour - dock. The Friends of Dick Lugar (FDL), the campaign organization for U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar announced that it raised $973,853.44 in the first quarter of 2011 and has $3,008,605.07 cash on hand. \"I'm enthusiastic about a great campaign that our supporters are waging,\" said Lugar. \"We started this campaign months ago because I wanted to be clear about my intention to seek reelection in 2012.\" To date, FDL has 4,923 active individual donors in the 2012 cycle which represents 7,984 gifts from individuals, 88% of which are from Hoosiers. Contributions have been received from all 92 counties in the state. In addition, during the first three months of this year, FDL received contributions from 1,631 new givers for a total of 2,016 new givers for the cycle. In the same time period, FDL has collected 11,906 Hoosier signatures from all 92 counties of Indiana in support of Senator Lugar's ac - cess to the ballot. Mourdock spokesman Chris Conner told HPI the campaign wouldn't release numbers until Friday, but Mourdock himself said in Highland Wednesday night that he \"raised about $159,000.\" Mourdock told the NWI Times the money raised through the first quarter of this year was more than triple the amount he expected. Mourdock said although he is challenging the longest tenured Hoosier in the history of Congress, people in political circles aren't giving him \"a cold shoulder\" as he expected. The response has been \"quite the opposite,\" he said. If that margin holds up - and U.S. Rep. Joe Don - nelly raised almost twice as much - Mourdock will be under considerable pressure for a big 2nd quarter. Mourdock was critical of the budget deal that was hammered out the House Speaker John Boehner, Sen. Harry Reid and President Obama last Friday. In a Facebook post, Mourdock said, \"I've been asked 'would you vote for the $38 billion in cuts?' A fair question. The unequivocal answer is 'No.' It is too little. Our annual deficit is $1.65 tril - lion. That equates to $4.5 billion each day. By cutting $38 billion the Congress and President will eliminate the deficit spending for 8 days but for the other 357 days nothing changes. To those who deem that progress, I can only say, 'get real.'\" The Kosciusko Silent No More Tea Party will host a 3rd CD \"Senator Lugar's Roadmap To Retirement Rally\" Saturday on the Kosciusko County Courthouse lawn in Warsaw. The rally is from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., with keynote speaker Pat Miller from WOWO. The Post-Tribune reported that the Indiana Tea Party groups are divided about how best to move forward against Lugar. That division recently became public when leaders of the Elkhart-based Tea Party of Michiana Action Coalition, or TEA-MAC, issued a news release saying the group and some other Tea Party organizations disavow any affiliation with Hoosiers For Conservative Senate \u2014 a recently formed group with the stated purpose of electing a senator who reflects conservative values and adheres to the Constitution. TEA-MAC leaders say the leaders of Hoosiers For Conservative Senate are attempting to usurp the individuality of Tea Party members and groups by presenting themselves as the voice of the Indiana Tea Party movement. \"I, as a tea party person, have to question their intentions,\" TEA-MAC co-founder Peter Recchio said. \"Any - body who tries to speak for Tea Parties of Indiana is trying to become the Tea Party from Indiana, which doesn't exist.\" While Recchio supports the defeat of Lugar, who is viewed by some tea party activists as too moderate, he said he thinks some HFCS supporters haven't shown the six-term lawmaker the respect he deserves. Recchio also questions why HFCS hasn't endorsed Mourdock, the only Republican candidate who has announced that he will chal - lenge Lugar in the May 2012 primary. HFCS co-chairwoman Monica Boyer denies that she is trying to speak for all Indiana tea parties. She said 76 Tea Party groups met in January and most agreed to work together to ensure a conservative candidate runs against Lugar in next year's primary. \"We want to know exactly where he stands on the positions before we take that step of endorsing,\" Boyer said. Tom Grimes, a founder of the St. Joseph County Tea Party Patriots, was disappointed Recchio sent out the news release. \"I think it was a bad idea airing the dirty laundry,\" he said.

About 85 Democrats filled Traditions Banquet Hall on National Avenue for a buffet of roast beef, chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans and corn, as well as a heaping helping of hope that their party might retake control of the state political scene in 2012. That feeling, Gregg said, is shared across the state as Democrats are enthused about next year's elec - tion. \"The other party has done more to unify us than anyone else,\" he said to ap - plause. Gregg, who served as Speaker of the House, as well as in minor - ity and majority party roles during his tenure there, said he left politics about 10 years ago to focus on his children, the youngest of whom is now a junior in high school. \"This Republican-controlled legislature hasn't done one thing to create jobs,\" he said, noting that as he travels around the state the issue of jobs is at the top of Hoosiers' minds. With a stated unemployment rate of 10 percent, and a \"real unemployment rate\" closer to 16 percent, the economy should be topping priorities, he said.

Lee Hamilton, D-9th District, spoke to a crowd at the John Hamilton campaign headquarters. He endorsed his nephew, who is running against incumbent Mayor Mark Kruzan in the May 3 mayoral primary election. \"I believe, and I hope you believe, that John will be a terrific mayor of the city of Bloomington,\" Lee Hamilton said. \"Every job he's undertaken he's done very well.\" Lee Hamilton said John Hamilton has the most important qualities of a public of - ficial: passion, competence and integrity. \"You all know he has integrity. That's the number one quality for any Hoosier voter,\" Lee Hamilton said. \"Poll after poll after poll shows they want people with integrity.\" He also spoke about the importance of volunteers in John Hamilton's campaign. \"John will never have the opportunity to serve as mayor of Bloomington without you,\" Lee Hamilton said. \"He can work 24/7, but he cannot reach all the people. You have to help him. You are essential for John's election.\" Horse Race Status: Leans Kruzan Carmel Republican: Mayor (D) 2,068, Spiegelman (I) 2,557. Outlook: Republican candidates for Carmel mayor stuck to their talking points during Tuesday's debate (Indianapolis Star). Brainard said the city has a high quality of life, amenities such as the Palladium concert hall and low taxes. City Councilman John Accetturo kept coming back to what he considers a \"leadership crisis\" in the city, and he said he would promote more transparency in government. Internet business owner Marnin Spigelman several times accused Brainard of \"liberal borrowing and spending.\" Accetturo and Spigelman, carrying the same message of fiscal conservatism, hope to unseat the mayor during the May 3 GOP primary. Brainard is urging voters to look beyond the rhetoric to their lifestyle and low taxes. Accetturo and Spigelman point to the city's mounting debt, accrued during its massive redevelopment. Perhaps the mayor's largest project to date, the $175 million Center for the Performing Arts and its keystone attraction -- the Pal - ladium -- opened this year. While the mayor points to it as a success, his opponents see troubled waters, financially. The Constitutional Patriots endorsed John Accetturo for Carmel Mayor. According to its website, www.theconstitu - tionalpatriots.com, The Constitutional Patriots' mission is to 'promote faithfulness to both the U.S. and Indiana Con - stitutions, support sound fiscal policy, advance individual liberty and free markets, and help elect those representa - tives who will honor those goals'. Dwight Lile, spokesman for the group affiliated with the Indiana Tea Party said, \"We have chosen those individuals who have indicated they stand firmly on the bedrock principle of fiscally conservative government and who want Carmel to both succeed and grow in a responsible manner. All of these candidates will be a critical check and balance on the Executive branch.\" The May 3 primary will present voters in Indianapolis with choices familiar to most cities these days: candidates with messages of holding the line, doing more with less and leading the way back to better days (Sikich, Indianapolis Star). But cross the county line and you'll hear a difference. In smaller, more affluent cities such as Carmel, Greenwood and Westfield -- Republican strongholds where the reces - sion didn't hit as hard and winning the primary means you've won the election -- it's not about just finding a way to keep the libraries open and the buses running. Instead, longtime incumbents such as Carmel's Jim Brainard and Former House Speaker John Gregg (right) with former state rep Vern Tincher in Brazil last Friday.

Horse Race Status: Leans Winnecke, Douglas 13,097, Nixon 2,268. Outlook: Democratic Evans - ville Mayor Jonathan Weinzapfel's name appears nowhere on the May 3 primary ballot, but his leadership and legacy are dominating what has become a pitched battle to lead Evansville's majority party after he departs (Langhorne, Evansville Courier & Press). Grappling with each other for a Democratic mayoral nomination thrown up for grabs by Weinzapfel's decision not to seek a third term, Rick Davis and Troy Tornatta have offered sharply contrasting vi - sions of what it means to be a Democrat. Tornatta casts Davis' previous willingness to challenge Weinzapfel for renomination \u2014 and his support for Democratic challeng - ers to incumbent City Council Democrats \u2014 as a supreme act of disloyalty. Davis and the other insurgent Democrats are \"working to break apart the Democrat Party,\" Tornatta charges. \"Now, to me, you're either with us or agin' us. Rick wants to develop a totally different type of Democrat. He wants to have a totally different type of party,\" said Tornatta, a former Vanderburgh County commissioner who pledges to \"build on\" Weinzapfel's job creation efforts. \" ... I mean, the team starts with your mayor. And if you're running against your mayor, then you're running against the team.\" Davis takes umbrage at the notion that he is disloyal to the party because he backs Democratic candi - dates who are not part of a fraternity of elected officials and Weinzapfel loyalists. Elected county treasurer in 2008, Davis says he was willing to challenge Weinzapfel because Democrats asked him to. \"That's not Weinzapfel's seat; that's the people's seat,\" he said. Davis sees the mayoral primary as the party's chance to cleanse itself of the \"back - door dealings\" that he says have characterized Weinzapfel's administration \u2014 and turned off voters. \"I'm the one who said if I'm elected mayor, there will be no more Democratic caucuses in the mayor's office, and that a quorum of City Council members meeting in the mayor's office before a City Council meeting is a disservice to the community and will not be tolerated,\" Davis said. Tornatta charges that Davis is \"slating candidates to run against incumbent coun - cilmen.\" The incumbents are not above being challenged, Tornatta said, \"but you don't slate candidates. The slating's an issue.\" Tornatta also slammed Davis for promoting the John F. Kennedy Club of Vanderburgh County, a Democratic group that has hosted House Minority Leader Patrick Bauer 2010 Democratic secretary of state candidate Vop Osili and other party candidates. \"He didn't try to sell it to people, he just took this group and kind of undermined what the party was doing,\" Tornatta said.

Outlook: Calling his health paramount to politics, Gary Mayor Rudy Clay on Friday said he is ending his reelection campaign due to a prostate cancer diagnosis (NWI Times). \"Prostate cancer and the dynamics of a political campaign do not mix,\" Clay said at City Hall. \"I owe it to my family, myself and the great people of Gary to suspend this campaign for another term of mayor.\" Clay, 75, who said he plans to finish his current term, has served as mayor since 2006, when he was chosen by Democratic Party caucus to replace then-Mayor Scott King after his resignation. Clay then won election to the post in 2007. He had announced his re- election campaign in January, saying he was the right man for the job. On Friday, Clay said when the history books are written, he'll be remembered for leading the city. He HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 15 said his decision was based on the \"strong recommenda - tion\" of Dr. Walter Stadler, an expert in prostate cancer at the University of Chicago Medical Center. In a letter to Clay, Stadler wrote: \"Given your age and medical condition, and to avoid any potential reversal or harmful setback, it is my professional opinion that you give strong consideration to a less demanding routine when your current term as mayor expires.\" \"The decision to cease my campaign is most difficult and disappointing, but maintaining good health is my top priority,\" Clay said. \"I want to sincerely thank the God-fearing people of Gary who always supported and voted for me to serve my community as Indiana state senator, county councilman, county recorder, county com - missioner and mayor of Gary. I have faith that my support - ers will understand this decision and recognize there is no other option for me at this time.\" Horse Race Status: Likely Freeman-Wilson Hobart Democrat: Mayor Guthrie (R) 2,426.

Buzinec, who served for 12 years as Hobart's mayor, verbally attacked Mayor Snedecor during her opening statement citing his \"lack of financial discipline\" as part of the reason she was running against him for mayor (Laverty, NWI Times). \"I didn't know we were going for the jugular,\" Snedecor said. Snedecor defended the high legal and engineering fees Buzinec cited during his administration with similar expenditures she had made. \"Let's make this the truth, the whole truth and noth - ing but the truth,\" Snedecor said.

Outlook: New Albany Democrats will choose from \"A Common Man for the Common Cause,\" a man who says he's \"Making it Happen\" and one who promises \"A New Day and A New Direction\" when they pick a may - oral candidate in next month's primary election (Louisville Courier-Journal). Those are the slogans that greet visitors to the websites of Paul Etheridge, Irv Stumler and Jeff Gahan, respectively, as they seek the nomination to replace Doug England, the incumbent Democrat who is stepping down and running instead for an at-large seat on the city council. \"Common man\" Etheridge, 51, a retiree from the Indiana Department of Transportation, in an interview called himself \"a working class citizen\" who worked his way up from laborer to supervisor of the state highway opera - tion in Floyd County. \"My main goal is to reduce spending,\" Etheridge said. He said he'd start by reviewing all positions appointed by the current administration looking for places to cut and posts to combine, beginning with the deputy mayor post currently held by Carl Malysz. \"The deputy mayor is definitely going because we're not going to need one,\" Etheridge said. He added that he would win the city additional road funding from the state by mapping out and naming New Albany's more than 400 alleys and would focus on improving drainage throughout the city. Gahan, 48, as the city council president, said his vision of \"a new direction\" begins with making the city \"physically cleaner.\" He said \"there's litter and there's some areas of the city that are in poor condition\" and need cleaning up. \"It also refers to the conditions of our roads. I think we need to do a better job of paving more of the streets than what we have.\" New Albany also needs to be financially stronger, said Gahan, who represents District 6. \"I think we need to do a better job at borrowing less money and at the same time we need to end the practice of no-bid contracts\" for the sewer utility management and garbage service. Stum - ler, 75, a retired businessman, said \"the first thing we need to do in New Albany is create more and better jobs\" by helping existing businesses grow and attracting new ones.

Out- look: Buttigieg seems to have momentum and no doubt will show the best fund-raising results when the campaign finance reports come in later this week. Dvorak, long re - garded as a front-runner because of superior name rec - ognition, appears now to be in a close race with Buttigieg for the nomination, with Hamann trying to fight his way back into contention. Dvorak has much of the labor sup - port that is always a key factor in a Democratic primary. He firmed up that support by joining in the walkout of House Democrats. Rep. Craig Fry told HPI he's seen polling show - ing Dvorak ahead. Because the importance of the mayoral contest, with a new mayor to be elected, the South Bend Tribune Editorial Board is expected to give an unprecedent - ed endorsement in a mayoral primary. With a significant percentage of voters still undecided, that endorsement could become a factor in a close race.

HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 17 Business back to normal in legislature By LUKE MESSER SHELBYVILLE - We all know the old adage, \"the more things change , the more they stay the same.\" After a very unusual March, that adage accurately describes the most recent couple of weeks in the Statehouse. For the most part, business is back to normal. Most observers have been surprised by the frenetic pace of work accom - plished at the Statehouse in recent weeks. Speaker Bosma and President Pro Tem Long have been incredibly organized in managing the work load under difficult circumstances. But Minority Leader Bauer and the entire House Demo - cratic Caucus have contributed to the success as well. House Democrats clearly came back to work with a \"get after it\" attitude, most likely reflecting a desire to make sure their walkout is not blamed for a failure to deal with the state's biggest challenges. Whatever your opinion on whether the walkout won them any tangible policy victories (and I believe it won them none), the bulk of work accomplished since their return may make the walkout a distant memory by the next election cycle. With redistricting maps coming out this week, the question becomes: what's next? Most observers believe the 30+day walkout makes it nearly impossible for House Democrats to stage another walkout over district maps. However, that same conventional wisdom had the first walkout ending weeks earlier. Time will tell. For their part, Republicans promised districts that were less tortured, less political, and more focused on communities of interest. A quick glance at the maps shows that they delivered. Given the requirement that each dis - trict have a similar number of residents, there was no way to avoid a few peculiar shapes. However, the districts are clearly more compact than the maps from prior years. In the Senate, President Pro Tempore David Long aimed to keep more counties intact within a single Indiana Senate districts and to keep communities with similar inter - ests together. His maps succeeded in that effort. Before, only 48 of Indiana's 92 counties were in a single Senate district. Under the new maps, 52 counties would fall within a single district. The biggest surprise of the mapping process has to be the high number of House incumbents drawn into a district with another incumbent. Four districts have both a Democratic and a Republican incumbent, three pit two Republicans against each other, and three pit Democratic incumbents against each other. As a result, there will be at least eight open House seats with no current incumbent representative. Democrats argue that maps are political and de - signed to guarantee a Republican majority. However, the bipartisan nature of these multiple incumbent districts will make it very hard for that charge to stick. Moreover, over the past decade, House Re - publicans have routinely received nearly 200,000 more votes than House Democrats in each election cycle and yet routinely found themselves in nail-biting elections with the majority won and lost by no more than a few hundred votes. Under those circumstances, maps that ignore political considerations will almost certainly benefit House Republicans. There was no need to be overly political in their map making. This much is clear: if the current maps remain intact, 2012 will be the most exciting House election in a generation. Last year saw 18 new state legislators, and 2012 could bring a similar number. v Messer is a former Republican member of the Indi - ana House. B. Cry because Keith Olbermann isn't back. C.

HOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011Page 18 What is it worth? TV has the answer By MORTON J. MARCUS INDIANAPOLIS - The Price is Right is far different from Deal or No Deal. The latter is a game of chance - find the beauty holding the briefcase with a million dollars. Price requires you know the \"usual and customary\" charge for an item - a variant on the song \"How much is that doggy in the window?\" Discovering value emerged as a TV staple long before the recent economic tsunami. Could public television exist without Antique Road Show? Can you imag - ine HGTV without a program delv - ing into home prices? Before long the Blue Cross channel initiates a program where patients on a gur - ney, doped up with a sedative, get a chance to win a free procedure if they can Price the Operation! Let's think about this for a moment. We appear obsessed with value. We are outraged by prices at the gas pump and jump at the chance to buy anything advertised as 50 percent off. We purchase Christmas wrapping to hold in waiting for 48 weeks in anticipation of higher prices closer to the time of need. We delay buying the 52\" TV because we know the price will fall. We know a good price when we see it, and we know when the price is too good to be true. Price information fills our heads and occupies our conversations. But all these are private sector prices. We don't have any idea of prices in the public sector. What does it cost to fill that pothole? What would it cost to keep that pothole from recurring soon? How much does it cost to provide instruction for a learning-disabled child? What does it cost to try a person for possession of marijuana? Costs not prices are the issue when we talk about government. We do not ask the costs of corn flakes. We accept the price shown on the grocery shelf. We don't ask the cost of a Prius or an Explorer, but we will contest the price sticker on the window. With government we assume that the sum we pay is a close approximation of the cost. Government isn't supposed to make a profit. But what should be the price to park on a downtown street? The cost to government is trivial. Here we are thinking more broadly of the costs to others, the costs of not finding convenient parking or the costs of traffic congestion. Some government services are given away. No price (fee) is charged to park on most streets, to borrow books at the library, or for immunizing a child. The benefits of these services dominate our thoughts. Today many challenge the idea of \"free\" parking or a \"free\" library, believing that those who use the govern - ment resources ought to pay for the services they enjoy. Similarly there are those who, aside from questioning the value of vaccinations, would have the families of the inocu - lated pay for that protection. These are neither silly nor sinister thoughts. But they frequently discount the reasons for many essential government functions. First, it is often wise to separate services from the ability-to-pay for those functions. Second, many government activities have positive external effects. A public with good access to knowledge and art is of value to all. Similarly, a public immune to smallpox is a benefit to all. A fee standing between a citizen and a public service discourages use and reduces those universal benefits. We could have a better understanding of public sec - tor services by taking a clue from the private sector. Let's have our mayors, governors and legislators host public access TV programs called \"What Does It Cost?\" We and they might learn something of value. v Mr. Marcus is an independent economist, speaker, and writer. Holcomb speaks on Charlie FORT WAYNE - The Indiana Recount Commission should not be allowed to invalidate the results of last year's secretary of state election, according to the state's GOP chairman (Lanka, Fort Wayne Journal Gazette). Indiana Republican Party Chairman Eric Holcomb on Wednesday said Hoosier voters fairly elected Charlie White to office last fall. \"He won the election,\" said Holcomb, who was in Fort Wayne addressing the Downtown GOP Club. \"The votes counted. We'll move on from there.\" White is accused of committing voter fraud by intentionally voting in a precinct where he did not live in last May's primary. A Marion County judge last week sent a complaint by the state Democratic Party back to the re - count commission. The Democrats are asking the commis - sion to remove White from office because he wasn't legally registered and declare Democrat Vop Osili the winner. Holcomb on Wednesday said state Republicans felt there was a better way for White to handle the interim than staying in office under indictment, but he said he is willing to let the legal process run its course. vHOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 19 E.J. Dionne, Washington Post: One image per - fectly captured the absurd, irrational and wholly unneces - sary confrontation over whether to shut down the federal government on the basis of differences over a small part of the budget. During a tea party rally near the Capitol last Wednesday \u2014 \"rally\" being generous for a gathering of a few hundred people \u2014 Rep. Mike Pence, the Republican fire-eater from Indiana, declared that if Senate Demo - crats refused to accept \"a modest down payment on fiscal discipline and reform, I say, 'Shut it down!' \" And the crowd erupted, lustily and joyfully: \"Shut it down! Shut it down!\" As the shouting persisted, it became clear that the govern - ment of the most powerful country in the world was being held hostage by a band of fanatics who (1) represent a very small proportion of our population; (2) hate govern - ment so much that they relished the idea of closing its doors, no matter the cost; and (3) have neither respect nor patience for the normal democratic give-and-take between competing parties and points of view. In no serious country do threats to shut down the government become a routine way of doing busi - ness. Yet in our repertoire of dysfunction, we are on the verge of adding shutdown abuse to the abuse of the filibuster in the Senate. Republicans, however, were rewarded for going to the brink. Because so many on House Speaker John Boehner's side were eager for a shutdown and President Obama was so determined to avoid one \u2014 and to stay out of the spotlight until the final days \u2014 Boehner had the upper hand. Republicans have won two rounds since December: on tax cuts for the wealthy, and now on spending cuts. v Matt Tully, Indianapolis Star: Gov. Mitch Daniels needs to get in the race for president. Now. After danc - ing around the issue for months, and as he continues to increase his national profile, the will-he-or-won't-he ques - tions need to be answered. And the answer needs to be yes. That thought struck me last week as I watched NBC's Chuck Todd walk \"NBC Nightly News\" viewers through the results of a poll about the lackluster field of Republican presidential candidates. The thought struck hardest when Todd said businessman, celebrity and all-around goofball Donald Trump was in second place among the potential candidates. A whopping 17 percent of likely GOP primary voters selected Trump as the man they'd like to see win their party's presidential nomination. He trails Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who has been run - ning for president for a good chunk of this century, by a mere 4 percentage points. The bottom line is this: Many Republican voters are so desperate for a nominee, and so disillusioned with the rest of the field, that they are treating Trump as a serious candidate. I guess his campaign slogan can be: \"Hey, the country is facing bankruptcy, so why not elect a president who has been there and done that?\" It would appear the poll is the Fates' way of telling Daniels to dust off that old campaign RV and set the GPS for Des Moines. Once he is there, taking down the leading GOP candidates should be much easier than, say, privatizing welfare services. It's not only the Trump news that should have Daniels licking his chops as if there were a tenderloin sandwich in front of him. There's also Romney, a man with the trustworthiness of a ticket scalper outside Conseco Fieldhouse. Romney as the front-runner at this point is as wobbly a feat as my beloved Chicago Cubs being in first place in April. Then there's Michele Bachmann. Recently, I wrote two columns about the many reasons that Daniels both should and should not run for president. The idea that Bachmann is even being mentioned as a serious candidate for the GOP nomination outweighs every other point on those lists. In 2004, during his first campaign for governor, I spent many nights watching Daniels speak at county Republican dinners. After 16 years of Democratic control of the governor's office, the GOP faithful was energized. But night after night I saw Daniels step to the podium and decline requests that he offer a speech filled with partisan red meat. Rather, he talked about serious issues and the need to run a higher-caliber campaign. Donald Trump recently went on TV to rant about Obama's birth certificate. And he finds himself running a close second among the lineup of Republican presidential candidates. It's indisputable: Mitch Daniels needs to run for president. v Doug Ross, NWI Times: During his campaign for Indiana secretary of state, Republican Charlie White was dogged by accusations he committed voter fraud by lying about his address on a voter registration form. The voters elected him anyway. In doing so, they set up a sticky legal mess. It's a problem that still, after he has been in office a few months, remains unresolved. A grand jury indicted White last month on three counts of voter fraud, two counts of perjury and single counts of theft and fraud on a financial institution. White is accused, among other things, of serving on the Fishers Town Council while no longer living in his district, of voting under his ex-wife's address despite not living there at the time and of using his wrong address while filling out a mortgage application. Marion Circuit Court Judge Louis Rosenberg had a chance Thurs - day to help untangle this complicated situation but instead threw it back to the Indiana Recount Commission for a new hearing. He wanted to create \"an opportunity for the political system to regain credibility.\" That's in short supply. Politics aside, how many Hoosiers would believe the law would allow an illegal registration as a qualification to hold public office? vHOWEY Politics Indiana Weekly Briefing on Indiana Politics Thursday , April 14, 2011 Page 20 Obama outlines $4T in cuts WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama on Wednesday set a goal of cutting the U.S. budget deficit by $4 trillion, plunging into the debate over the nation's fiscal woes after accusations he has failed to lead on the issue (Associated Press). Obama, facing a 2012 re-election vote in which the nation's debt and deficit are major worries for Americans, promised in a speech in Washington to put the coun - try on a gradually improving fiscal path. He set a time-frame of 12 years or less to reach the goal of $4 tril - lion in deficit reduction and called for talks with Democratic and Republican lawmakers to hammer out a detailed blueprint. Obama warned that steadily rising debt could cost jobs and harm the economy and force the country to borrow more from other countries such as China. \"If our creditors start worrying that we may be unable to pay back our debts, it could drive up interest rates for everyone who borrows money -- making it harder for businesses to expand and hire, or families to take out a mortgage,\" he said. But he added: \"We can solve this problem.\" Obama also proposed: * Curbing deficits to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015, 2 percent toward the end of the decade * Ending Bush-era tax rates for the wealthiest Americans * Seeking $770 billion in savings by 2023 in cuts to non-security discre - tionary spending * Saving $480 billion in Medicare and Medicaid by 2023 and at least $1 trillion more by 2033. Gary gets final tax cap exemption INDIANAPOLIS - Gary prop - erty owners will continue paying the highest tax rates in the state -- but for only one more year (NWI Times). The Indiana Distressed Unit Appeals Board on Wednesday unanimously recommended tax levies for the city of Gary and three other Gary taxing units that translate into a 25 percent addition to the state's property tax rates. That means a Gary homeowner this year will pay a property tax rate of 1.25 percent of assessed value, with rental properties paying 2.47 percent and business and industrial properties paying 3.68 percent. The rates every - where else in Indiana are 1 percent, 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Gary Mayor Rudy Clay said DUAB's decision was in the best interest of the city. \"It will allow us to administer services to the people,\" Clay said. Just two years ago, Gary collected and spent more than $80 million in prop - erty tax revenue. Under the caps, the city would receive about $30 million. DUAB recommended a $40.8 million property tax levy for 2011. Voucher bill passes Senate committee INDIANAPOLIS - A plan to use state tax money to pay tuition for students attending private schools was approved on a party-line vote Wednes - day by an Indiana Senate committee (NWI Times). House Bill 1003, a key component of Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels' education agenda, is now set for a final vote in the Republican-con - trolled Senate next week. The Senate Education Committee amended the legislation to prohibit discrimination in private school admissions based on race, color or national origin and to clarify that state government cannot regulate the content of religious in - struction at private schools. If enact - ed, a total of 7,500 vouchers would be available for the 2011-12 school year and 15,000 vouchers in 2012-13.
