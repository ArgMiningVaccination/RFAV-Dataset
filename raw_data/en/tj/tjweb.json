It has been stated that the way out of the global pandemic is to vaccinate 70% of the world's population, but vaccination levels have remained very low, especially in low and middle-income countries. $50 billion in funding to enable low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) access to the COVID-19vaccine and to accelerate vaccination, and rich countries' reluctance to share vaccines. Increasing the vaccine supply will provide an important solution in ensuring equal access to the vaccine. R&D investment expenditures in healthcare and biotechnology are expected to have an impact on increasing the supply of high-tech vaccines. In the process from the development of the vaccine to its production, biotechnology companies may encounter financing problems. In this context, venture capital may be a solution to the solution of the financing problem and to increase the vaccine supply. In this context, the global increase in venture capital investments, which is an important method of financing innovation, and the direct support of the public to companies producing vaccine technologies, either alone or through public-private partnerships, will make a significant contribution to increasing the vaccine supply, which is a major problem in accessing COVID-19 vaccines. In this context, t can be suggested that the state provides investment, screening and advice (guidance) services in the field of innovation by funding companies directly as venture capitalists or through = volume number pages = {260 - 270}, doi = {10.18521/ktd.1022790}, title = {Equal Access to Vaccines within the Scope of the Health Policies Carried out in the COVID 19 Pandemic: A Financing Proposal}, key = {cite}, author = {Ayta\u00e7, Deniz} }| |APA||Ayta\u00e7, D.
