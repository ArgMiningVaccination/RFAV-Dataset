A two piece meditation set with a zafu and zabuton is all you need to start a meditation practice and create a dedicated meditation space in your home. All cushions are made from 100% cotton duck fabric, double stitched with heavy duty thread for extra strength and all zafus come with a carrying handle. All of our cushions are sewn and stuffed in the Pacific Northwest, either in Seattle or at our Vashon Island Workshop. For our meditation sets, you have a few choices: Zafu Fill We stuff our zafus with either kapok or buckwheat. Our kapok zafu is soft but firm to sit on, and the buckwheat zafu is a bit looser to allow it to mold to your body. All of our zafus have an opening that allows you to adjust the fill to your preference. Our round kapok zafu weighs about 2.5 lbs. and is approx. 14 in diameter and 8.5 high. Our round buckwheat weighs about 5.5 lbs. and is approx. 16 in diameter and 6 high. Our crescent zafu stuffed with kapok weighs about 2 lbs., and stuffed with buckwheat it weighs about 5 lbs. It is approx. 20 across, and 7 high. Take a look at [ this blog post](https://www.stillsitting.com/blog/how-to-sit-choosing-the-right-zafu/) for more information on how to choose a zafu. Zabuton Size The zabuton acts as the base for your meditation. It defines your meditation space, and cushions your knees. We have three sizes for you to choose from for your meditation set: small (30\" x 30\" x 3\"), large (36\" x 33\" x 3\"). Our medium works well for most people. The large is good if you are quite tall and need some extra leg room (6'2\" or taller). Our regular zabuton has three inches of loft, weighs about 4 - 7 lbs. depending on size, and is happy to be hauled around.
