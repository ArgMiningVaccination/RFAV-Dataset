Now, looking ahead to 2019, they are planning a series of women-only retreats - founded by women, led by women, inspired by women and empowering women. Maeve is a trained nurse and both founders are qualified Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda Practitioners and have combined these two approaches to create their retreat. Designed for women in transitional phases of life - from menopause to fertility issues to PMS - the goal is to ensure the body and mind are working together in balance. Their first retreat will be held in Finca Ses Set Cases in Mallorca, and we spoke with both Emilia and Maeve about what makes their retreats different in this saturated market place, why they only work with women and we learned their best piece of business advice. 1. Tell me about the process from first having the idea for your retreats to starting the business? How did the idea change over that time? We (Emilia Herting and Maeve O'Sullivan) studied Traditional Chinese Medicine together in London. On a self-care holiday to our now retreat location in Mallorca, we began talking about bringing our knowledge of Eastern medicine to beautiful places; we wanted to create a holistic, integrative health retreat where the focus was on the individual and not a one-size-fits-all package offering natural solutions for mental and physical wellbeing. Years went by, we finished our degrees, set up professional clinics in London, and later in Dublin and Hamburg - our respective home towns - and in 2016 on a holiday in Portugal, we decided it was time to get started. The following months we took a trip back to the island where we were introduced to Ingrid Reygers, our now Ayurvedic expert, chef and yoga teacher. Right away we all saw the power and wisdom that could be achieved by bringing the two most ancient healing systems together and integrating them into our western lifestyle. From there we started doing run throughs with family, friends and anyone who wanted to join. In May 2017 we officially kicked off and our Escapada journey began. 2. The retreat market is booming - how are Escapada retreats different than what is already on the market? We may know what is good for us but often struggle with the daily application of a healthy lifestyle. Whether it's due to an overwhelming amount of information out there or being completely confused as to what is right for you. This is where we want to step in, strip all confusion away and find out what you really need with a treatment plan that actually works for you and is completely personalised. We keep things simple, timeless and easy to apply by working through our four Escapada pillars - holistic treatments, mindful movement, nourishing nutrition and ultimate time off. 3. Maeve - how does your background in nursing influence the itineraries, treatments and programming on your retreats? Having a background in Western medicine teamed with Traditional Chinese Medicine gives me a powerful overview of the human body from a physical, emotional and spiritual level. It allows me to focus on topics with well-informed confidence and experience to create individualised retreat treatment plans with absolute care and knowledge that what we're offering to our clients is the best of the two medical systems. It also gives the guest confidence that they can talk freely about their conditions and medications, knowing that I have taken it all on board, understood and adapted to a natural medicine perspective. Working within Western medicine for over a decade now has given me the knowledge and experience to see its strengths and weaknesses. 4. Emilia - how does your background in Chinese medicine and Herbal Medicine impact the structure and programming on the retreats? The love and admiration for the medical profession has been passed down over four generations in my family. Exploring natural health solutions with my clients and seeing what positive changes we can make together, long term and without any side effects is what excites me the most in my day to day job. And integrating the rich ancient knowledge of acupuncture, nutrition and herbal medicine into our hectic western lifestyles, by offering health retreats, is seen as a relief to many of my patients, and our guests, as we strip away the unnecessary and focus on the basics. 5. Tell me a little bit about what guests can expect when they sign up for an Escapada retreat? Within a few hours of arriving at Escapada, everyone is given an extensive consultation (with Maeve or Emilia lasting over one hour), which allows us to get to know each guest and what they need and want from the escape. This forms the basis of your personalised retreat, allowing the expert team (practitioners, chef and nutritionist, instructors and massage therapists) to discuss relevant information, advising what works for each individual and creating a bespoke, plan for the duration of your stay. Your retreat plan, which is designed around the Escapada Four Pillars - Holistic Treatments, Mindful Movement, Nourishing Nutrition and Ultimate Me Time - is completely individualised, and will include a daily schedule of treatments, acupuncture, massages, meditation, yoga, meals, demonstrations (cooking, natural remedies) talks and most importantly, down time to simply relax and do as you wish. The Escapada team is on site all day so that we are on hand, at any moment for the guests; whether that's for a chat, discussion or advice. Guests are also given a journal to write in each day, and by the end of your stay this becomes a personal collection of thoughts, intentions, knowledge, and beautiful recipes from your Escapada experience. 6. Your retreats are women-only - did you ever consider not setting up the business in that way? In 2017 we started Escapada with retreats geared towards both male and female guests. However, as of 2019 we are launching our Women's Health & Wellness retreat series. We are an all-female team and the power that lies in women supporting women cannot be underestimated. There are so many taboo conversations around Women's Health that aren't happening, meaning women suffer in silence or just 'put up with' symptoms they may experience. 7. How do you both describe what you do at a dinner party? We do what we love the most; we work in Integrative Medicine. We get to spend time with wonderful friends and colleagues, and on top of it all, we get to travel to all of these stunning places to meet interesting, inspiring people from around the world who we share our knowledge with. 8. What has been the most unexpected thing you've learned or experienced while running this business? The most valuable aspect that we have learnt, is the importance of a solid business partnership. We have naturally developed roles within the business. There is a mutual respect and trust between us that continuously allows us to drive the business forward. 9. What next, what are your plans for growing and developing the business? We really want to focus on continuing to grow and develop each of our locations across Europe. In the last year, we have focused mainly on our Mallorca location, as this was our \"home\" where it all begun, but we'd love to focus more on Germany and Ireland, where we both live and love. We have learnt so much about the different cultures and attitudes across the countries we work with, so adapting and learning from that will be a big focus for next year. For us, it is about giving guests what they need, want and will see results from. "}
