This group\u2014 the Treatment Information Network, or \"tin\" (because everything aids must have an acronym)\u2014meets regularly to carry out joint activities that make everybody's work more efficient. Although Canadian aids service organizations ( aso s) widely share materials with each other, we felt that some great resourceswere slipping through the cracks. We wanted to (a) gather a largerpool of resources to share and use, and, (b) flag what is missingand most needed, as a kind of map for developing new materials.So we called up agencies from coast to coast and asked: \"Whatdo you use? What could you use?\" We gathered quite a collection. Many of the materials are well known and widely used\u2014we've highlighted some in previousissues. For this Positive Side , we present a few new jewels for you. Street Drug Interactions When asked for their wish list, many aso s said they need the dirt on drug interactions\u2014specifically between street/ recreational drugs and hivmeds. This info may seem hard to come by, but it is out there. Look no further: Medical Drug Interactions with Street Drugs : A resource by and for drug users. Not Canadian, but this little gem of a pamphletfrom Needle Exchange Emergency Distribution ( need )in Berkeley, California, is written in seriously street-smart, no- bs language\u2014 something drug users can relate to. For an onlineversion: www.berkeleyneed.org (click on \"resources\"). For more technical info, the Toronto Hospital Immuno- deficiency Clinic has produced extensive lists of drug inter- actions, including Postulated Interactions with Recreational Drugs .

These lists contain a lot of dense data\u2014you maywant to flag them to your health care provider or local aso . Don't forget catie 's own harm-reduction how-to for drug users: pre*fix: harm reduction for + users .

Newly Diagnosed? When someone's just been diagnosed with hiv, w e l l... y o u may know how it feels. The needs of newbies are widely varied,but at some point most people want a standard \"now that you'repositive\" reference guide. The challenge is finding the \"Goldi-locks\" version\u2014not too much info, but not too little. Since we allhave our own idea of what's just right, it's good to have a few 2 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005RESOURCES COMMUNITY CHEST options to choose from. Many respondents cited catie 's bilingual Managing Your Health as their \"bible\"\u2014the must- have resource for every pha's shelf. Here are a couple of other care guides specifically for Canadian hivnewbies: The hivCare Program at Windsor Regional Hospital offers up Think Positive: A Guide to Healthy Living . This six-module book- let covers lots of self-care issues, with significant sections on themedical aspects of hivinfection, treatment and managing health problems. At 38 pages, it's easy to swallow. Go to www.wrh.on.ca(under \"Programs & Services\" click on the \" hivCare Program\"), e-mail hivprogram@wrh.on.ca or dial 519.254.6115. Opening Doors to Self Care , from the Conception Bay North aids Interest Group in Newfoundland, is a very approachable guide to diagnosis, medication, nutrition, emotional care andmore. If I could turn back the clock to when I was diagnosed, thisbook would have been a real comfort, with its personal anecdotesand gentle, reassuring tone. At 116 pages, it's thorough but notdaunting . . . plus, there's a recipe for stuffed moose steak! A new printing is due out in late 2005.

Most people assume that my husband must be hivpositive. I've got news for them: He is negative and hiv plays such a minor role in our lives.Positive women do not rule out beingwith a positive partner but we don'thave to be limited solely to thatpopulation. 8We can live in the moment. hivis not a gift; if it is, get me to the return department. But it hasgiven me the insight to not dwell onthe past or worry about the future. Weare all going to die someday. I've beengiven the urgency of living each day tothe fullest, so I don't spend themthinking about the music I wantplayed at my memorial service. 9We do not have to settle. I am not damaged goods. I am an amazing, sexy, smart and attractivewoman. I can choose who it is I wantto be with. I do not have to be withsomeone who treats me poorly, doesnot have a job or a future or is just apoor match because I think no oneelse will be with me. We are happy. Being hivpositive does not have to intrude on my happiness. Mybirthright is a life of joy. Once I madepeace with the fact that \"I have a virusin my blood that causes trouble butfor many of us can be managed\" Icould get on with my life, which in-cludes lots of laughter, friends, familyand contentment. I am in the bonusrounds of life and loving every mag-nificent minute. River Huston is an award-winning poet, journalist and performer.

Only secondto that atrocity is the dental dam and Ireally don't need someone to use alatex glove to touch me. There is somuch more to sex than conventionalintercourse and oral sex. In the longrun, my sex life has improved becauseI've learned to communicate by talkingabout safe sex and exploring other op-tions such as toys, fantasy and outfits. 3We can have a full life including a career. This is a choice I can make. Treatment access has made it possiblefor me to have a future with plans thatinclude long-term career goals. 4We can give birth to HIV negative children. Medical knowledge has greatly re-duced the chances of passing on thevirus to my children and has given methe strong possibility of watching themgrow up and become adults. 5We are not the face of AIDS. I do not have to be the poster child for a disease. Whether I disclosepublicly or not, I am not defined by myillness. hivis a virus and I am much cuter than that. 6We still want romance. I need to be treated with respect, adoration and gifts. hivdidThere are so many assumptions about women with hiv: for example, that we're easy, addicts or have realpoor judgment when it comes to pick-ing a partner. Some and all of that maybe true for some of us, and so what?The point is, like any group, we areindividuals falling under the categoryof hivpositive women. We come from every walk of life, ethnicity, religionand socio-economic background\u2014which makes each story unique. Onething that's clear is that hivis a med- ical problem and not an adjective todescribe who any of us are. We are not heroes, courageous or brave. We're just trying to getthrough life the best way we can. A hero is someone who runs into a burning building to rescue a wheel-chair-bound woman or dives into thewater to save a child from drowning.I've been called a hero, courageousand brave from the beginning, butreally I've found that every woman I'vemet who lives with hivand doesn't let it define, destroy or devastate her lifeis just a strong woman living her life tothe best of her ability. When you makeme the hero you put me on a pedestal Iam sure to fall off of. 2We can still have great sex. But first I have to recover from everything they say is safe sex.

Read allabout the \"other\" health professionals intheir lives. DARRELL MARTIN ,38 Artist, New Glasgow, Nova Scotia Diagnosed with hiv:1991 I've been seeing my psychosynthesis therapist every other week for the past year .Ithink mental health plays a big role in someone who has an ill - ness. Your psyche is very important. Itaffects everything about you. Apsychosynthesis therapist is someone who really gets inside youand brings you out. She doesn't justnod her head and take notes. Shegestures and makes eye contact. W e share, grieve and talk about pain.Sometimes we do meditation andbreathing. During meditation thesound of her voice and what she's say-ing bring all these emotions to the sur - face. She says there' sno reason to feel afraid, intimidated or ashamed to let my emotions show\u2014if I feel likescreaming, crying or swearing, I should let it out. It really makes me feel so much better. Our sessions are in her living room. Isit on the couch, there' safireplace and it's a very relaxing, inviting envi- ronment. Another plus is that she's awoman. I get along with women betterthan men. I find a woman therapistvery nurturing. I've had male thera- pists and there always seemed to be tension and conflict and some level ofhomophobia. I've seen other therapists before but they didn't do a whole lot for me. Ihad so much bottled up inside and wasn't able to bring it out. I'd belly ache over minor situations and not getto the root of the problem. My currenttherapist has a way about her that's very sweet and caring, but there's no beating around the bush. She's very direct and she challenges me in a good way. She gets me to where I needtogo, if I choose to. For the longest time, I didn't trust anyone. I was cynical, bitter anddefensive. I had a lot of negativity in my life regarding my hivstatus. When Iwas diagnosed at 25,my life basi- cally stopped. I was downtrodden and started getting involved in bad rela- tionships. I felt suicidal. I was keeping secrets and held a lot of guilt andshame. My therapist has helped me letgo of that and learn to move on. She' s helped me heal some of my wounds. Imet my therapist through my part- ner. He suggested I see her becauseour relationship was falling apart.Actually, Iwas falling apart and getting into situations that weren't good forme. So, I gave her a call and I've beenseeing her ever since. Now I talk morewith my partner about my emotionsand feelings. Therapy has made me feel better about myself. My therapist is a realconfidence builder .I've learned to have some self-worth and self-esteem.It's really helped me get out there anddo some great stuff. I'd never shownmy artwork before because I never had the confidence, but last week I had my first show, which was great. At the end of the day, you have a choice: Y ou can live or you can die. I'm choosing to live. Now I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunneland I never thought I would. ROD MICHANO ,41 Public speaker/ hiveducator ,Toronto Diagnosed with hiv:1987 www.redskyhealing.com My traditional healer has helped me understand more about my illness byapplying it to an Aboriginal context and relating hivto the medicine wheel teachings. I started traditional healingin 1996 .One day, my cousin back 6 THEPOSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005CHATTY CATIE Doctor Who? DARRELL MARTIN \"My therapist is a real confidence builder.\" home in Pic River, Heron Bay, got a spiritual messagefrom my sister who hadpassed to the spirit world.My sister told her that I needed help,as I was beginning to get very ill. Thenext day, my cousin called and askedhow I was. She mentioned that a tradi-tional healer, Diane Longboat, wascoming to Pic River. I went there and offered her to- bacco\u2014one of the four most sacredmedicines Aboriginal people use. Byoffering tobacco, you're giving respectto our culture, to Mother Earth and tothe Creator for allowing us to have thisday. Diane explained that my cousintold her I have hiv. She was going to give me my traditional name througha ceremony, as part of my healing.Your traditional name comes from theCreator. It came to Diane right away\u2014Shining Thunderbird Eagleman. Diane doctored me and looked me over. She told me I needed to go to thesweat lodge. Days later I went to myfirst sweat lodge ceremony. My auntwas praying outside. She said when Iwent in I looked like an old, sickly per-son, but when I came out about anhour later, I looked reborn. I feltdiffer- ent, like I was alive again. Before I wentinto the lodge, I had no appetite, I couldbarely sleep, I had headaches all thetime. After I came out, I had a feast. Myheadaches were gone and for the firstnight in ages I had a good sleep. Soon after, I got very sick. I wound up in Casey House for six months,wasting and bedridden, and didn't goto the sweat lodge at all. I started com-bination hivtherapy and got horrible side effects\u2014you name it, I got it\u2014so Ihad to stop. The meds were reallydoing a number on my liver. But whenI combined the Western medicine withtraditional healing, I stopped gettingthe side effects. Using the sweat lodgeand doing traditional medicine todetoxify and cleanse my bodyallowed me to take the medsagain. Now I'm undetectableand experience very few, ifany, side effects or illness. I go to the sweat lodge once a month. My partner andI attend a lodge in Toronto 7 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEspecifically for Two-Spirit people, with Wanda White-bird, a traditional coun-selor Anishnawbe Health Toronto ( 416.360.0486 ). If I didn't have the lodge, I really think I wouldn't be here today. Thesweat lodge has gotten me through alot. It's like being back in your mother'swomb. You're cleansed\u2014it takes outall the toxins, especially after you'redoctored by a traditional healer. RANDY SAMPERT , 34 Chairperson of Living Positive, Fort Saskatchewan, AlbertaDiagnosed with hiv: 2002 My most important health careprovider is my general practitioner ( gp). When I moved back here from Vancouver last year, my original gp had lots of experience with hiv. But, unfortunately, he passed away lastFebruary, so I had to find a new gp while dealing with hivand Kaposi's sarcoma cancer. I interviewed one doctor who was taking on new patients. We discussedthe issues I was facing and I gave hima brief medical history. I was his firstpatient with hiv. In that meeting, he said, \"It sounds like you'll be a chal-lenge to work with, but I'm up for it.\"And he has been. There was a lot I needed to learn in terms of understanding the lab work,drug interactions and potential sideeffects. My gpand I were learning about all this at the same time. We dis-cussed potential medications that couldhelp me deal with peripheral neuro-pathy side effects. I would sometimesbring him information that I foundwhile researching on the Internet andwe'd discuss different options. Hefinally put me on amitriptyline to re-duce the pain from the neuropathy.This drug has started to give me back some of the quality of life that I'd lost. My gpis a compassionate doctor who spends extra time listening and talking to me, as he knows I've struggled with depression. He's there to help and sup- port me until I can get to see my psychologist. Whileapplying for medical disability I was feeling quite depressed, and the over-whelming bureaucracy led to furtherdepression. As usual, my gpwas there for me to lean on. After a year of chemotherapy, I am considered to have the cancer in re-mission. I can now get my life back inorder. BRADFORD McINTYRE , 53 aids awareness educator, Vancouver Diagnosed with hiv: 1985 www.PositivelyPositive.ca Along with my gpand aids specialist, my naturopathic doctor (nd) is a valued partner in addressing myhealth issues. My ndspends a great deal of time with me explaining myhealth condition and he gets to theroot cause of the problem. Often, hehas answers for me where my medicaldoctor does not! It is important to understand the immune system and what it needs tobe able to carry out its functions. It'snecessary to have knowledge aboutthe cells, nutrients and what the cellsrequire to be up and running to maxi-mum capacity. The digestive systemand organs all have their own needs tobe met. My ndteaches me and empha- sizes specifics in diet improvementand healthy lifestyle changes andapproaches, which recognize the im-portance of a healthy body, mind and spirit. There are few other physicianswho are able to take the necessarytime with me. Recognizing the ability of the body to heal hasprompted many people tochoose a naturopath. My ndhas played an important role in addressing diar-rhea, nausea, neuropathy,irritated skin and rashes,wasting, fatigue, loss of appetite, andimmune suppression. With the aid ofhomeopathic remedies and vitaminreplacement therapies provided by my nd, I have successfully boosted my immune system, reduced drug sideeffects and increased the efficacy ofthe hiv drugs. The neuropathy and my quality of life have improved innumerous ways! BRADFORD McINTYRE \"My naturopath gets to the root of the problem.\" RANDY SAMPERT \"My GP was there for me to lean on.\"ROD MICHANO \"The sweat lodge has gotten me through a lot.\"Sexual dysfunction: It is the elephant in the hiv clinic waiting room. We all know it's there (not moi, of course!), but we don't want to talkabout it. And why not? At some deep,dark level of our psyche, do we feelguilty about having sex? In spite of allthe efforts to make safer sex sexy, dowe still have fears about infecting ourloved ones? Do we feel that we shouldjust be grateful that we're alive? Ordoes the cheery sex-positiveness we'resupposed to maintain make it hard toadmit that being positive makes us feelnegative about ourselves, sexuallyspeaking? How we express ourselves sexually is an essential part of our identity. Andit's no surprise that hivcan have a sig- nificant impact on our experience assexual beings\u2014whether it's the impactof our diagnosis, which can leave usfeeling \"tainted\" or \"dirty\"; the impactof the disease itself on our health,emotions and stamina; or the pres-sures of disclosure, condom use and 8 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005safer sex. Or perhaps it's side effects, such as lipodystrophy or diarrhea,that have taken a toll on our body, self-esteem and body image. Sexual dysfunction in the context of hivis understudied in both men and women, leaving many gaps in our un-derstanding of this complex interac-tion. We know that sexual difficultiesare fairly common in the overall popu-lation. And research indicates that is-sues with desire, arousal, satisfactionand orgasm\u2014as well as erectile diffi-culties and problems with lubricationand pain during intercourse\u2014areeven more common in the context of hivdisease. The causes of sexual difficulties are well documented and the impressiveroster of experts interviewed for thisarticle helps to situate them in the con-text of hiv: stress, anxiety, depression, body image issues, alcohol and recre-ational drugs (including cigarettes), aswell as some prescription drugs, par-ticularly certain antidepressants andmeds used to treat high blood pres- sure, cholesterol and triglycerides.Research is beginning to ask whetherhighly active antiretroviral therapy( haart ) is a possible cause of sexual dysfunction in people with hiv/aids (phas). hivitself can wreak havoc with our hormones, and our hormones playan important role in regulating ourlibido. For instance, testosterone lev-els are known to be low in many hiv positive men. Four phas talked to The Positive Side about the challenges (and, in some cases, joys!) of enjoying ahealthy sex life with hiv. As they de- scribe, it's all a bit more complicatedthan the cause-effect relationship thatresearch seeks to tease out. For one,many of us had issues with sex evenbefore we became hiv positive, so it's difficult to know how much \"bag-gage\" we brought forward into ourdiagnosis. Consider, for example, thenumber of phas for whom childhood sexual abuse was an issue. TheseHave you lost that loving feeling? Sexual Healing by Darien Taylorexperiences affect how we construct our adult sexuality. Secondly, when we experience sex- ual problems, we experience them inthe context of our full and varied lives.So, it's challenging to pinpoint thesource of a sexual problem. Is itdepression, our meds, or the sheerexhaustion of working full-time at ademanding job that makes it so diffi-cult to summon that loving feeling atthe end of the day? Or is it all of theabove? Even the most rigorous inves-tigation of sexual problems\u2014with acounselor, therapist, gynecologist or hiv doctor\u2014can be challenged to come up with the cause, let alone thecure. In the end, this article probably raises more questions than answers.While it seems likely that hiv, its asso- ciated conditions and the drugs wetake to deal with these have some rela-tionship to sexual dysfunction, it alsoseems likely that it will take a longtime to characterize this relationshipmore accurately. In the meantime, given the signifi- cance of sexual function in terms ofquality of life, health care providersworking with phas should consider incorporating questions about sexualfunction into their patient interactions. And if you, as a pha, feel unsatis- fied about your sexual life, don't beashamed to look for solutions, bothcreative and clinical. Talk with yoursex partners and health care practi-tioners and check out the Internet oryour local sex toy store. If you don'thave someone to join you on yourerotic adventure toward sexual heal-ing, maybe this article will help youacknowledge that you're not aloneand encourage you to start out on thisjourney and see who you meet alongthe way.

Although she lamented the impact of hivon her sex life for many years, she would now prefer tocurl up in bed with a good book. 9 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEOne of the ways I'd describe myself is somebody who has sought to have a healthy sexual identity and a sexual life that can be celebrated. I think mostgay men and many PHAs have this as part of defining who we are. How is your health? It's the best it's ever been, and it continues to get better. (Lab work con- firms the felt experience.) Part of that is by incorporating a healthy erotic self,which deeply connects to just about every aspect of life. In terms of hiv, that began upon my diagnosis in 1988 (though I think I became infected in 1984). I was the executive director of the aids Committee of Ottawa and one of my jobs was to create programs for phas. We were fortunate to have Sequoia Lundy come here and create healing workshops for us. He'd been doing heal-ing work with gay men with hivin San Francisco and with the emerging Body Electric School in California. In 1989-90 , Sequoia introduced clothes-off workshops of light touch for gay men in Ottawa. This began my journey of learning about my body as atemple, as a sacred part of who I am, and learning to respect my body andtake care of it on multiple levels and in a holistic way. In 1991 , I got sick with pcp(Pneumocystis pneumonia) and went on sick leave. The few drugs that were around weren't effective enough at preventingmy immune system from collapsing. I dropped down to about 10T cells, had David Hoe , 62 Senior policy advisor on HIV/AIDSDiagnosed with HIV in 1988PHOTOGRAPH: AARON MCKENZIE FRASER\"My erotic health is multiple episodes of pcpand major organ failure. We all silently expected that I would die, but then along cameprotease inhibitors and my recovery began. Six monthslater I returned to work, rejoining others fighting aids and being part of the design of the new Canadian Strategy on hiv/aids . Now I'm on tenofovir (Viread), 3tc(Epivir) and Kaletra. I take testosterone in the form of gel andNucleomaxX powder to remedy the damage done by manyof the \"d\" drugs I used to take. I take a number of vitaminsand other supplements to counter the toxicity of my drugs 10 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005and to keep my body as energized and healthy as possible. I use aromatherapy oils to balance my energy. How has your sex life been since your diagnosis? When I was sick, my libido disappeared. I was dealing with energy loss, fatigue and illness. This is part of how thebody naturally redistributes its energy. I was more con-cerned with intimate touch of a caring kind\u2014a stroke,being held, having company around me. When my energystarted to return, so did my libido. It was a transitionalmoment to still be rather emaciated and sexually chargedagain. When well and wanting to be sexual, I started to en- counter all the shame and discrimination of being a sexualperson with aids. So, it's necessary to come to terms with shaming and to fight discrimination and fight for the rightto be sexual, but, more importantly, to develop a healthysexual identity within that toxic environment. And thataffects libido. Also, with body shape changes\u2014because our culture focuses on the physical form rather than the erotic form\u2014there is work to do in regard to oneself as a sexual, attrac-tive person. One of the things that shame, discriminationand doubt about self-attractiveness do is close down theheart centre, the place that sends out our openness orclosed-ness. When we close down that part of us, our eroticenergy gets trapped and doesn't become part of whatpeople feel when we're around, so we come across as beingdistant and cut off. The other thing is that the combination of hivand meds can change the body's sexual functioning. One of the thingsthat happened to me was the loss of ejaculation. Doctorswith whom I discussed this did not know how to handle it.Ejaculation is related to energy and trust and a number ofthings, so that was a big identity issue for me as well. It became very powerful for me to move into a school of the erotic arts and into a healing context where my sexualself as a person with hivis celebrated. It was incredibly astounding to come across an environment where sexualityand erotic health is taught and cultivated and participantsare challenged to explore and discover. That transformedall of those hivexperiences of sexual shame and discrimi- nation. The school had a very good political and health-oriented approach to hivand sexuality, which absolutely accommodated and promoted sexuality and erotic healthwithin a framework of hiv. Why is erotic health so important to you? My erotic health is as important as all other aspects of my health. I view this also from a spiritual place. The spiri-tual aspects of erotic life lay strongly in a belief system thatsexuality is holy and that the body has its own intelligenceand will guide us to states of pleasure that are meant to beand that are part of creation. Few of us have grown up withthis belief system. Many phas have energy problems, so accessing all energy sources\u2014including erotic energy\u2014is important. Iput a lot of attention into my breathing, especially into the8 Experts Talk Sex We're at a point now where we can say that most PHAs are going to have long lives, and that includes sex. How- ever, sex is a moralized aspect of life. There continues to be anattitude among some in the medical community that PHAs shouldn't have sex; for them, the idea of helping PHAs to have a good sex life is new. Difficulty with sexual function is a common issue raised by people at our HIVclinic and I see a wide spectrum of issues and conditions. After diagnosis, some people feel that sex is the enemybecause it caused them to contract HIV. They never want to have sex again. Sometimes people don't want to have sex becausethey're worried about infecting another person. Even many yearsbeyond diagnosis, a deep conversation will reveal that these atti-tudes are often still present and preventing them from having asatisfying sex life. Then there are PHAs who continue to have an active sex life after diagnosis but who in time lose their sex drive or sexual func-tion. This change may be caused by the attitudes mentioned aboveor by HIVitself (decreases in testosterone or problems with blood circulation), HIVmeds or other meds. It's a challenge to tease out the cause. People are reluctant to change their HIVmeds to see whether they're the cause of the sexual dysfunction\u2014they're more likely to try testosterone, Viagraor Cialis. Antidepressants and beta blockers (used to treat highblood pressure) can wreak havoc on sexual function. If I suspectthat's the case I try switching patients from one class to anotherthat doesn't have these effects. My conversations with patients about their sexual relation- ships are important. HIVplays a significant role in every single intimate relationship where it is present, and its impact on arelationship changes over time. As people sort through theirbeliefs and assumptions about their sexuality, it's great to seetheir eyes light up when a myth is debunked or a solution theycome up with is affirmed. Through talking to me or their partners,people do discover ways to make their sexual lives satisfying. PHAs can have great sex. You don't need to go through your life denying this part of yourself. But it can take a lot of work and it'simportant to talk with others\u2014health care professionals, coun-selors and other PHAs who have been there. Your comfort zone will be different from that of other people, and that's all right. You needto find the sex life that's right for you. \u2014Dr. Dale Guenter, Family physician at North Hamilton Community Health Centre, Teacher at McMaster University as important as all other aspects of my health.\"lower part of my body and pelvic/genital area. This is important for heightened erotic states and is intercon-nected with my meditation and physical exercise, whichkeep my body as something I respect and treasure andkeep my energy moving well. How has your sex life been affected by all this? When I have sex with somebody now, it's much more exciting and much more conscious. It's important for me tohave some kind of heart or personal connection with some-body and then to be very experimental and exploratory andto take time\u2014to make it magnificent and sensual and todiscover with somebody not in a rush what can be openedup within the body, to find out what is exciting, what ispleasurable, and to breathe. It means being able to ride thewave and to experience ecstatic forms of pleasure. Erotic health has taken me to a redefinition of what inti- macy is about. It is important to have intimacy with oneselfin order to be able to share it with other people. And eroticwell being does not have to be confined. For example, Ihave a couple of people in my life with whom I exchangeerotic massages. Like many gay men, I grew up believingthat the purpose of sex was to reach an ejaculation. Now Isee it much more in terms of sensual and erotic energy. Safer sex in large part has been characterized as less erotic. It's quite often characterized as don't . I've discov- ered that there are multiple possibilities of reachingintensely ecstatic states\u2014all of which I didn't know aboutbefore and all of which are completely safe. The wholenotion of \"barriers\" gets exchanged for \"permissions,\"\"possibilities\" and \"discovery.\" That's a big shift for me. It'snot important to me now to have such a limited concept ofwhat it is to be hiv, horny, excited, hot, ecstatic, safe, and sharing that with somebody. The whole notion of livingwith hivand being sexually active has shifted. Do you have any advice for people who would like to explore their erotic selves?Unplug the phone, create a sensual place at home, get some oils, and start stroking your body and breathingattentively and noticing the sensations . . . and go with that. There are a number of places in North America that do weekend workshops on erotic well being. Through BodyElectric, people can begin the journey that I began someyears ago. Within one weekend there's a transformation ofawareness. It took one day for me to increase my awarenessof improved meaningful erotic and sensual experience. There are a number of books on gay spirituality includ- ing sexuality. However, few of our health resourcesacknowledge and work with phas and our sexual healing. This is a huge, shadowy silence, especially because hivis intimately woven into our sexuality. What better people toexplore sexual heights than people with hiv.

Ellison. 11 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEOver the past 20 years I've worked with hundreds of PHAs, most of them gay men. Generally, I find that HIVtends to exacerbate whatever earlier existing emotional issues peoplehave about sex. People's feelings about sex are deeply rooted in their emotional lives. I find that drugs\u2014prescription and recreational\u2014are a big issue in terms of sexual functioning and HIV. Very little attention is paid to this connection with anti- HIVdrugs because the desired treatment effect\u2014antiviral activity\u2014is deemed so important andconsideration of side effects tends to be minimized. The correla-tion between HAART and sexual function is not clear to me. It's difficult to untangle all the different combinations that people aretaking and say, \"This drug affects sexual function this way.\" I see a lot of gay men\u2014positive and negative, on HAART and not\u2014 who have erection problems. Loss of erection is a commonproblem among men, which the marketing success of Viagraattests to. Right now there is a lot of crystal meth use among gaymen, and this also affects their ability to achieve an erection. Through talking with so many gay men, I've come to under- stand that anal penetration and HIVare linked together on an unconscious level. Anal penetration is connected to feelings ofharm, infection and humiliation of the bottom by the top. Condomshave a lot of meaning. They act as a concrete reminder of HIVand the potential lethality of the sex act. Many people also have doubtsabout the confidence they can place in condoms, which can tearand come off. And anal sex is perceived by gay men as a very inti-mate act. Violence, humiliation, death, love, intimacy . . . this very powerful, gruesome entanglement of conscious and unconsciousthoughts and feelings has an impact on gay men's sexual function. Then there's the issue of self-esteem and its relation to sexual function. Lipodystrophy, even very subtle cases of it, can makepeople feel self-conscious and unattractive, and this can impact ontheir sexual function. Another thing I've learned is that tops, positive or negative, often experience performance anxiety. Anxiety is anathema to anerection for physiological reasons. Anxiety has an effect on thesympathetic nervous system, causing blood vessels in the peri-phery, including the penis, to contract in order to better supply thecentral torso area with blood.

The thought doesn't even enter my mind. Nothing really turns me on. And it's gettingprogressively worse. I've been in a relationship since 1997 and my sex drive was great for the first two years or so, but then it slowlydecreased. So I went on testosterone shots, which workedfor six months. But then my sex drive was down to almostnothing, so I stopped the shots because why take them ifnothing's going to happen? Now I'm off all meds as we try to figure out what I'm resistant to. I'm hoping that my sex drive will come backwith my next hivregimen. Who knows, maybe new drugs will have different side effects than the ones I was on. I justhope I don't have to go back on testosterone and startplucking hairs out of my chin. What do you think is the cause of this problem? There's a lot of stress. Also, I've been on so many meds and there are side effects. How can you be sexual whenyou're afraid you're going to have diarrhea? To somedegree, mentally, I shut off that part of me. Even though my partner is understanding, things become tense and we don't talk for a while\u2014certainly notabout the issue\u2014and then we forget about it. I think that'spart of the problem, along with the meds, side effects andstress\u2014it's a combination of everything. It could also haveto do with age. Is it menopausal? We don't know. There 12 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005isn't much research on women with hivwho are my age. Why? Why can I not have sexual feelings? You would like to? Um hmmm! My partner is very handsome and I cer- tainly wouldn't want to lose him to someone who's moresexual than I am. He can tell me he loves me with all hisheart, but if there's no sex, the fear of him finding it some-where else is great. That's a fear I live with every day. I think about sex sometimes during the day\u2014\"Tonight I'm going to make a nice dinner and put candles on the table\"\u2014and by the time I get home, that thought is gone. Then thenext day I'll think, \"Why didn't I do that?\" I can't reallyanswer myself. I feel like I've let him down, but I also feel thatI can't give him something I'm not ready to do. Besides, itwouldn't be fair to him to lie and pretend to be in the mood. Was there a time in your life when you had a sex drive? Yes, before I became positive. My ex-husband gave hivto me, and his words still haunt me: \"Nobody will ever touchyou again.\" That made me feel dirty. As hard as I try to thinkthat I'm not a dirty person, those words keep coming back. Is there a fear of infecting your partner? Yes, even with using condoms that fear is still there. It's not rational. That may be another reason I'm not feelingsexual. Are condoms an issue for you? There are condoms in our drawer all the time. When we do have intercourse, we always use a condom. But inter-course happens maybe one out of every four times that wehave sex. Let's say, for instance, we had sex yesterday,which we didn't\u2014it could be another six weeks before wehave it again. Liz Welkert , 50 HairdresserDiagnosed with HIV in 1994 Isee HIVpositive women regularly for gynecological issues and I spend a lot of time talking with them about how to continue to have a healthy sex life. But I haven't seen any women with HIVwho presented with a specific, pri- mary complaint about sexual function. Usually, problems with sexual functioncome out as we're discussing or treating other complaints. HIVpositive women are more prone to gynecological problems than women without HIV. This is related to their degree of immunosuppression. Women with HIVare at risk for the following complications, which can affect their sex lives: GAbnormal Pap smears and menstrual problems: Painful, irregular, heavyor missed periods can impact on a woman's sex life. It's difficult to havesex if it causes pain. And women's feelings about their sexuality can beaffected negatively if they're bleeding heavily, because blood is linked intheir minds to the possibility of HIVtransmission. GOther sexually transmitted infections ( STIs), like gonorrhea and chlamy- dia, can result in a discharge, which may make women feel sexuallyunacceptable to their partners. Untreated STIs can result in pelvic inflam- matory disease, which can cause pelvic pain if scarring results. This canmake sex uncomfortable. GVaginal yeast and bacterial infections can create discharge, burning anditching, and, with bacterial vaginosis, a strong odour. Some women saythis odour is stronger after sex, which can be a turn-off for both partners. PHOTOGRAPH: AARON MCKENZIE FRASER sometimes during the day home, that thought is gone.\" Have you thought about seeing a sex therapist, either with or without your partner?I don't know if I want to go to a sex therapist. I was sex- ually abused as a child for 10years, and I don't want to go back to those memories. It's not easy to talk to someone Idon't know, particularly a man. I'm afraid of exposing my-self and these parts of my life to someone else. I'm afraid ofbeing judged. I'm afraid that memories and feelings mightcome out in the course of therapy that would ruin my rela-tionship with my partner. I don't want to draw my partner into the conversation for fear of embarrassing him. It's my issue. I know becausehe's my partner it's also his issue, but we've never reallydiscussed it. All I can say to him is, \"Honey, I don't under-stand it. I can't explain why I'm feeling this way.\" And Ireally can't. Have you ever watched porn together or used sex toys or tried anything like that?Yes, everything. Seeing pornographic pictures on the computer helps me fantasize but it doesn't make me wantto have sex with my partner. Is there a part of him that's afraid because you have hiv? Yes. I know he's afraid. We've tried Saran Wrap, we've cut the condom in half, but I think there's such a fear ofbecoming infected that he's not letting himself enjoy thatpart. I don't know if I'm in a rut, I don't know if this is part of what we hivpositive women go through. I'm hoping to hear from other people that I'm not the only one havingthese problems. I feel like I am the only one because I haveno one to talk to about it. I wish I had a girlfriend I could sitdown with and say, \"I just can't. Is there anything wrongwith me?\" 13 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEDoes your partner ever get frustrated? Very frustrated. We'll each be at our computers, and he'll say, \"Are you in the mood?\" and I'll say, \"Not really.Why don't you just go ahead and surf [on pornographywebsites]?\" I think part of him can't accept the fact that itdoesn't bother me. I go to bed at night and think, \"Why didn't I say yes to him?\" But then I wouldn't be truthful to myself. It's taken me50years to be true to me, and that's hard for me to change now. I have to do what makes me feel good inside and notalways worry about what makes other people feel good. Does your partner ever feel insecure, like you're not attracted to him?No. I don't think that's ever crossed his mind. I some- times feel that I'mnot attractive, because of my belly (from lipodystrophy, plus I've stopped exercising) and a huge scaron one of the cheeks on my backside from surgery. Thatsurgery was because my ex-husband raped me, so that stillplays in my mind. If I could chop off that scar, I would, justto feel a little more attractive. I hate it and it puts a damperon me feeling sexy because I know it's there. If I'm nakedand I turn around, I think, \"Oh, no, he's seeing the scar.\"And it'll never go away, so that will always be with me. What have you done to deal with the problems related to your sex drive and to some of the issues around things thathappened to you sexually?Not really a whole lot. I wouldn't know where to go or who to turn to. Have you talked to your doctor about any of this? Yes. I've told him that my partner wants sex and I'm not in the mood and my partner doesn't understand why. Hethinks my partner is being insensitive. I've worked with a number of PHAs in my practice and, interest- ingly, HIVitself has never been at the root of their problems. People often think that their problems will be \"cured\" by seeing a sex therapist. But a cure isn't always possible. What I can do ishelp an HIVpositive person with sexual dysfunction come to terms with and do the best possible job of managing the reality of theirhealth situation and its impact on their sex life and relationships. Before we meet, I have my clients do some preparatory home- work. I ask them to outline their problem and what would need tohappen in order for them to view it as resolved. Depending on theiranswers, I can provide them with current information about drugtherapies and interactions or I can engage them in a discussionabout their attitudes to sexuality and relationships. If you're experiencing sexual dysfunction, you don't need to feel alone and ashamed. Talking about your problems with anobjective, informed and empathic therapist can be transformative.My website (www.smartsextalk.com) is a useful resource for PHAs who have issues with sexuality and sexual function. There's a significant psychological impact that accompanies an HIVdiagno- sis. Many women acquire HIVthrough sex and often tend to step back from hav- ing sex after they're diagnosed. There are fears about disclosure and rejection. Although it's difficult to tease out the impact of HIVmeds, I feel that some side effects change women's sexual function\u2014lipodystrophy causes changesin the breasts and abdomen and can really affect one's body image. AlthoughI can't find a clear correlation between HIVmeds and changes in sex drive, side effects like nausea and diarrhea certainly make people not want to havesex. Also, some antidepressants cause changes in sex drive, and there is a lotof depression in women with HIV. We don't know a lot about menopause in HIVpositive women and its effect on sexual function. Women are only now living with HIVlong enough to go into menopause, and we're only recently beginning to see more HIVdiagnosed in older women. Menopause is a time of changes in libido, mood and sleeppatterns and can cause vaginal dryness, which can all impact sexual function. It's very important for HIVpositive women to have an annual exam with a Pap smear. Women with HIVwho have issues related to their sexual function should not hesitate to ask their doctor for a referral to a gynecologist, prefer-ably one who knows about HIV. \u2014Dr. Mark Yudin, Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Infectious Diseases, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto\u2014Dr. Pega Ren, Sex therapist, Vancouver14 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005I'm single. I've dated and been in relationships, but noth- ing really long term. I'm not the kind of person who goeslooking for a boyfriend. If it happens, it happens. I'm nottoo hung up on it. I find it difficult when I start datingsomebody because sometimes I just don't feel very sexual. A few years ago I met somebody in Germany. I liked him very much and we got along very well. He visited me a cou-ple weeks later. When he was here, I wasn't getting horny. Iwasn't able to get an erection. I think with gay men some-times if sex isn't pretty good fairly soon they lose interest. Ijust wasn't feeling sexual and I wasn't able to perform, andhe lost interest pretty quickly. I regret that because he wasquite special. It made me very insecure. I suppose the tendency would be to go for anonymous situations where there's no chanceof bonding in that kind of way, which isn't really what Iwant. So I went to my doctor. This was before sexual func-tion problems were discussed very often in the medicalcommunity with hivpositive people. I was embarrassed bringing up this problem with my doctor. I assume a lot ofmen are. When it comes to self-image maybe we put toomuch emphasis on our erections. I told my doctor: \"I'm 38. I'm with somebody I get along with, I've been honest withand I'm attracted to, and it's just not happening for me.That's not normal.\" My doctor agreed. He prescribedtestosterone patches, which helped make a difference\u2014there was a subtle improvement and no side effects. I smoke cigarettes, which doesn't help the situation. I was also having anxiety problems, and my inability to performseemed to do with that as well. I tend to be kind of a nervousperson. I've worked rather hard to be more comfortable withmyself, but I have other issues outside of hivand sex. Can we talk about that? Because it's not like life begins or ends with hiv\u2014we carry who we are into our diagnosis. So, tell me about that person that you are.I always had sexual hang-ups. I started becoming sexu- ally active in the early '80s. I had a very romanticized view of how things would be and I ended up with guys whowould cheat on me or lie to me, which was devastating. Itmade having relationships a lot more difficult, becausehere were people who supposedly cared for me who didn'ttreat me very well. I had trouble standing up for myself andI carried that for a long time. So I think my nervousnesswas already there, and hivexacerbated it. One good thing that came out of being hivpositive is that I work very hard at being more open and addressing these things. Has hivhad a negative impact on your sex life? After my diagnosis, it was almost like I became hyper- sexual but without necessarily acting on it. I just wasn'table to function in the same way. It was very weird. My sexdrive increased but my ability to get an erection decreased.I was nervous about sex as it was anyway, so then havingtrouble with sexual function and getting an erection justmade me more nervous and less open. So would you say your major sexual issue is your inability to get an erection?I'd say the issues are both physical (erection problems, loss of libido) and psychological (anxiety about erectionproblems, fear of passing on the virus, negative self-esteemdue to body shape changes). I'm part of an online group forgay positive men called gaypoz.org. Other positive men I'vechatted with online have told me that they have similarissues concerning sex. Working at BCPWA , I've noticed that a large percentage of the people who come in for consultations have at some point experienced sexual dysfunction\u2014from decreased libido to vaginal dryness to erectile dysfunction.The sexual challenges are often accompanied by a profound sense of inade-quacy or shame. Unfortunately, many people don't know that sexual side effects are com- mon and are often due to meds or stress. Shining the light of knowledge andacceptance on the issue is the first step toward minimizing negative associa-tions. There is strength in dispelling the stigma of sexual issues, and only byvoicing your concerns can you begin to get the help you need. I treat sexual dysfunction as part of the bigger picture. Through under- standing what imbalances exist in terms of nutrition, energy, lifestyle,metabolism and stress, treatment programs can be developed to treat thewhole person and alleviate the associated symptoms. Using varying combina-tions of acupuncture, homeopathy, nutritional supplementation, botanicalextracts and counseling can help with overall health and, by extension, sex-ual dysfunction. Alternative medicine can provide relief and support for thosesuffering with sexual challenges and, as an added bonus, improve the gen-eral health and quality of life of PHAs. Stephen Frey , 42 UnemployedDiagnosed with HIV in 1992 \u2014Dr. Jennifer Hillier, Naturopathic doctor, Vancouver PHOTOGRAPH: ANGELA DAVIES15 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEI've been working with PHAs for 13 years. Sometimes patients are referred to me specifically because of sexual dysfunction and sometimes this concern comes up in the course of therapy for other issues. I try to ensure that, first of all, my patients have a thorough physical assess- ment with a physician to rule out medical conditions that can impair sexualfunction (such as diabetes, heart disease, fluctuating hormone levels). A physi-cal checkup is very important because people often make assumptions aboutwhat is causing their sexual problem, and a checkup can identify a conditionthat the person may not have been aware of. If the patient is cleared medically, I work with them to identify possible psy- chological reasons for their problems. These may be behavioural, cognitive oremotional and may include such things as: substance abuse, unresolved griefand loss, concerns about HIVtransmission, and body image issues, especially if the person has lipodystrophy. Some of the issues are directly HIV-related and some are not. Depression and anxiety can cause a lack of sexual interest. Discomfort with one's sexualorientation can result in shame, which impairs a person's sexual performance.Issues that may have been present prior to the person's HIVdiagnosis relating to trust and fidelity or past sexual trauma can play a role. Meds to help stabilizea person's mood can cause sexual dysfunction, and there is the need to care- fully balance mood stability and sexual function. Depending on the factors involved, I will work with the person or couple to tailor a course of treatment to suit their needs. This may include couplestherapy, treatment for anxiety and/or depression, substance abuse treatment,correcting misinformation or dysfunctional thinking, and/or working on self-esteem. As a clinical psychologist, I don't prescribe meds, but I can encourage patients to discuss prescriptions with their physician and I also provide edu-cation on how to talk with their physician about these issues. I hear from some of my patients that the health care professionals they've been dealing with haven't taken their complaints about sexual function seri-ously. If the patient is gay, homophobia may be behind this. Or health careprofessionals may be accustomed to thinking of HIV as an issue of survival firstand foremost rather than considering quality-of-life issues. Keep at it until youfind someone who takes your issues seriously. What have you done to address the physical problem, besides taking testosterone?A couple of years after using the testosterone patch, my doctor took me off it because my levels were high and itseemed to add to my anxiety. My gpsent me to a urologist. I was the only person under 50in the room. The urologist prescribed Viagra, which didn't work that well for me. NowI take Cialis from time to time, which I find works betterthan Viagra. Have you tried any complementary therapies? Gingko is supposed to help blood circulation and help with erections. I tried it, but it didn't seem to make much ofa difference. Maybe I didn't use it enough. I kept readingabout possible interactions between herbs and hivmeds, and I decided to stay away. What about the smoking? Did any of the doctors say that could be implicated?Definitely. I smoke about half a pack a day. I'm trying to quit. It's very difficult. It's always in the back of my head thatI should quit for a whole bunch of reasons but I haven't yet. And how have you dealt with the psychological issues? I saw a psychologist and I joined group therapy. The focus of the group therapy was intimacy, and it helped butit was a slow process. I was also seeing a psychiatrist peri-odically to adjust my antidepressants. Antidepressants can also have an effect on sexual function. The one I'm on now, Wellbutrin, doesn't. I would say it helps sexual function more than anything. I was on Celexafirst, and that made it almost impossible to reach orgasm. How is your overall health? Not bad. I've been on quite a few combinations. Now I'm on Sustiva (efavirenz), Viread (tenofovir) and Videx (dd I). I'mtaking part in smart , a study about structured treatment interruptions. I stopped meds in May, but my numbersdeclined rather quickly so I had to go back on in July. I felt good being off meds. I sort of felt more like me. To be perfectly honest, I found it a lot easier to get an erectionoff meds. Was it psychological? I don't know. But I've no-ticed a change since I've been back on meds, and I don'tthink it's just in my head. How do condoms fit into this for you? Many men find that condoms inhibit their erections.Yeah, putting a condom on can basically kill it. That's why I think a lot of positive men choose not to use them.That said, I do find condom usage to be fairly high in Hali-fax and I use them myself. What's the situation with your sex life now? I'm not looking for a boyfriend at the moment. I have sexual partners from time to time. For the last three yearsthat I was living in Montreal, I didn't have sex much at all. Iwas avoiding it. When I moved to Halifax, my doctor askedabout my sexual activity, and my reply was \"not very often.\"He said, \"Oh, that'll change. You're in Halifax.\" In many ways, things are better for me here. I do have more sex here. There seems to be a lot of sex going on inthis town. And I'm more comfortable with myself. A lot ofguys are chatting online. I've done that a few times but Ihaven't actually met anyone \"in the flesh\" this way. I prefermeeting people one on one. Exchanging pictures doesn't doit for me. A picture doesn't show all of somebody's attrac-tiveness, so I don't put a lot of stock into that. I'm still basically a romantic at heart. I think a lot of gay men have trouble combining sex and intimacy, and I've beenone of them. I'm hopeful I'll get it right one of these days. \u2014Dr. Jennifer Hendrick, Clinical psychologist, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre HIVClinic, Halifax \"I found it easier to get an erection off meds.\"What's right for me isn't necessarily going to be right for someone else. How did this all affect your sex life? Sometimes we wouldn't have sex or we'd stop because I felt like she wasn't comfortable doing certain things. Thatwas hurtful sometimes, especially in the beginning of mydiagnosis because I felt kind of poisonous around sex andbeing touched, almost like I didn't have a right to be sexual.Some of it was me projecting my feelings about myself ontoher and feeling shitty about my body and sexuality. And shedidn't want to hurt me by saying she was uncomfortable. Now my partner and I check in with each other from time to time. I've had to say to her, \"I feel like we don't evertalk about hivand that's weird for me because it's such a big part of my life.\" I live with hivand work in the commu- nity, and yet I don't talk about it with her very much. So Imake sure we do. I'll bring home an article for her to reador I'll try to bring up how I'm feeling about stuff. If there'stension around sex, we try to talk about it. How did you deal with coming out and finding out you had hivat the same time? When you're first coming out, under usual circum- stances it can be a chance to explore different people andtry different things sexually. Being diagnosed with hiv inhibited that in a lot of ways because I was scared ofinfecting other people and of how people would react. I feltthat I couldn't have sex without disclosing because there'sso much guilt around it, whether or not you use protection.I told my partner I have hivon our second date because I wanted to get the rejection over with. Ever since coming out, my sex life has gotten better. Sex with women made that happen as well. I feel comfortablebeing a dyke and being with a woman and feeling solid inmy relationship. Also, that stuff around early diagnosis andfeeling poisonous and ashamed about my body has for themost part dissipated, which has made sex a lot better. Where did you access support and safer-sex info? There isn't a lot of support in the lesbian community 16 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005I identify as queer. I used to have relationships with men, but I came out around the same time I was diagnosed withHIV. It was interesting to deal with those two things at thesame time. Are you in a relationship now? I've been with my partner for about four years. We got married about a year ago. We have our ups and downs likeevery relationship, but it's a good relationship. hivhas been something we've had to negotiate around in our sex life and our emotional life. Initially, I had to gothrough a waiting period for her to decide, it felt like,whether I was worth it, in relation to me having hiv. Would the hivwin or would my personality win? hivisn't some- thing she was used to having to deal with. Lesbians don'ttend to see hivas part of their reality. It's not something they often talk about. Not only was I having my first serious relationship with a woman but I had to negotiate sex and figure out what'ssafe and what's not. Because there's such a lack of informa-tion around safer sex for women who are with women, mypartner had a lot of fears around transmission that some-times weren't realistic. So I had to find the information andreassure her, but I didn't have anything to back up what Iactually thought was realistic in terms of transmission. Forinstance, there isn't much information around oral sex forwomen. We hear it's low risk, but it's a confusing space tobe in when you're negotiating around that stuff. I told my partner I didn't want to be the only one provid- ing her with this information. She needed to do her ownresearch and talk to other people. I didn't want her to feelthat I had some kind of agenda. I think the onus is often onthe positive person to be the educator. But, at the sametime, people need to find out for themselves because eachof us is comfortable with different levels of protection. For the past 10 years, my work has focused on sexual health, especially on viral STIsl i k e HIVand herpes. Therapy work with PHAs includes accompany- ing them through different stages, in life and with regards to HIV, and helping them manage their disease at the psychological, relational and sexual level. In my practice, I notice that the psychosexual aspect of HIVtends to affect self-esteem when it comes to body image and feeling desirable. There is alsoan increased fear of being abandoned. Loneliness, fear of disclosure andrejection, personal anxieties and physical impacts of HIVare other factors that can affect the sexual lives of PHAs. Despite some limitations or changes we have to make to our sexual health, it is possible to enjoy a fulfilling and responsible sexual life. All wehave to do is take the time and use the necessary resources to progresstoward accepting and adapting to HIV. Some resources for PHAs include: help and information lines on HIV/AIDS and other STIs, community organizations, personal growth activities and groups, and professional therapeutic care by asexologist or a psychologist specialising in HIV. \u2014Katia S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, Clinical and for at Layman-Pleet , 28 Peer Network CoordinatorDiagnosed with HIV in 2001 PHOTOGRAPH: JACOB PETERS\"I have a problem with the17 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEaround hiv. Women with hivare pretty invisible in a lot of ways. As I started to tell some of my queer friends, I real-ized they didn't know much about hiv. On the flip side, a lot of the workshops on safer sex don't focus on woman-to-woman transmission or sex. In hiv support groups, at first I didn't feel comfortable talkingabout being a dyke because I wasn't sure how it would beperceived by other women with hiv. So I didn't have much support. But four years later, I've found a handful of other lesbian and bisexual women with hiv. It's great to have social relationships with them and have a bit of a community. Having the peer support\u2014hang-ing out, joking and laughing about sex, and celebrating thefact that we are sexual and have sex lives even though it'scomplicated\u2014has been so important for me. I think it's greatto celebrate sexuality when you're a positive woman becauseit's something that's not acknowledged a lot. Also, Voices ofPositive Women, where I work, is a queer-positive space. How is your health? Really good. I haven't had any health scares yet. I've decided to try to stay off meds for as long as I can; I'venever taken them. My cd4count has stayed pretty stable around 350. I'm doing some alternative therapies: I see a naturopath and do acupuncture, take supplements when Iremember, and try to get lots of exercise. Have you had any health problems that affect your sex life? I don't feel very sexy when I have a yeast infection. Some- times sex can kind of irritate that stuff and make it happenmore frequently. We've had to figure out how to be cre-ative\u2014sex toys are definitely a fun way to have safe sex.When I get a yeast infection, I use this stuff from my natur-opath called Megadophilus (a really strong dose of acido-philus in a vaginal and oral capsule) that clears it up. I try toavoid sugar and alcohol when I feel something coming on.Yogurt's good. I'm all about the natural remedies these days. Do you have any final thoughts on sexual dysfunction in the context of hiv? I have a problem with the phrase sexual dysfunction . We all have different experiences that contribute to the waywe feel about our bodies and sexual identities. Some of ushave been raped or been through sexual abuse or havecome out\u2014all kinds of things. An hivdiagnosis can be part of that as well, and I find the whole idea of labeling thesethings as \"dysfunction\" kind of problematic. Of course these experiences are going to affect the way you experience sex and express yourself, and I think that'ssexually a really normal response. To be pathologized isn'thelpful. Immediately I think of those kinds of sexual diag-noses and my mind jumps to \"medicate.\" I don't thinkthat's always the answer for people. It makes you feel likeyou're a freak for feeling a certain way or responding in acertain way to stuff that's happened in your life. I think sex can be a really powerful place for people to heal some of that stuff and to connect with other people andfeel good about their body. Everybody deserves to have aLiving with HIVcan mean more stress as well as a variety of meds that can cause sexual dysfunction. Some types of sexual dysfunction can be directly linked to certain meds\u2014lowered libido is a common complaintfor people taking antidepressants\u2014and can be treated by adjusting thedosage. (Always talk to your doctor before changing, reducing or stoppingany kind of medication.) Other times, it may be harder to pinpoint the cause of sexual dysfunction. If your sexual responses have changed for any reason, discuss it with your doctor. Some doctors may say this isn't important if you don't have apartner or they may question your right to sexual activity. Don't settle forthis! Your sexuality is a valid and vital part of your identity. Men may experience erectile dysfunction as a consequence of certain meds. Don't hesitate to discuss this with your doctor but keep in mind thatthere are non-drug options\u2014for example, many penis pumps are FDA- approved to help by drawing blood flow and achieving an erection, whichcan be maintained with a firm cock ring around the base of the penis. Women may experience vaginal dryness due to stress, medication changes or hormonal fluctuations. This can be fixed with lubrication, but besure to read the ingredient list. Use water-based lube without sugar, assugar can cause yeast infections. Astroglyde, Probe and water-based lubessold in drugstores are good choices. Avoid oil-based lubes, which not onlydestroy condoms and latex toys but can also trigger vaginal infections. Ifyou're prone to yeast infections, find a lube that does not contain glycerine.Hathor Aphrodisia is a Canadian-made glycerine-free lube. Another common problem, particularly in women, is difficulty achieving orgasm. Your orgasmic response may be slower and may require morepowerful stimulation than before. Adult toys can help with new and differ-ent stimulation. Clitoral vibration is a popular choice for easier and moreintense orgasms. The Hitachi Magic Wand is a high-quality, powerful vibra-tor often recommended by sex therapists as a clitoral stimulator for womenwho have difficulty reaching orgasm. There are also many small, inexpen-sive and effective hard plastic bullets designed for this type of stimulation. Anal stimulation is another option for men and women. The anal region is rich with nerves, and gentle stimulation in this area can add a new level ofsensation, particularly when in conjunction with clitoral or penile stimulation. A note of caution: Adult toys are classified as novelties, not health items, so they are not subject to rigorous testing and standards. Many com-mon and inexpensive toys are made of jelly rubber and soft vinyls, which areporous, meaning they can emit substances such as phthalates (a plastic-softening agent linked to health problems in some studies). They can alsoabsorb and harbour bacteria and yeast and often cause general skin irrita-tion in people with sensitive skin. However, these porous toys are farcheaper than their higher-quality counterparts. If they're your only option,be sure to use them with condoms. I highly recommend the top-qualitymedical-grade silicone toys if you can afford them\u2014they last longer, are abetter investment and can be cleaned with antibacterial soap and water. If you are shy about purchasing adult toys at a local store or unable to find a good store in your area, you may want to consider buying online.Tickled Pink Toys (www.tickledpinktoys.com) is a Canadian e-store with agood selection of quality toys at competitive prices. \u2014Jennifer De Roo, Founder of Tickled Pink Toys Ltd., Vancouver good, healthy sex life, and that's their choice, too.

Owing to its own \"design flaws,\" the virus sometimesmanages to outwit the drugs used to keep it under con-trol. This has led researchers to develop sophisticated scientific methods for analyzing drug resistance , helping us to keep up with some of the treatment challenges that hiv can throw our way. The hivvirus is a mindless little robot, programmed to do just one thing: make millions more copies of itself. Anti-retrovirals, the drugs that fight hivinfection, are designed to interfere with this replication process and prevent the tide of new virus from being formed. If hivalways made perfect new copies of itself, these drugs would actually have a much easier job. An antiretro-viral drug would face the exact same task every time, so ifone were effective, it would always be effective. Unfortu-nately, nature doesn't work that way: hiv, being a little bit \"stupid,\" makes mistakes every time it builds a new virus.These mistakes, or mutations , lead to slight differences in every new virus. Sometimes these new, mutated viruses canresist the drugs that should be controlling them . . . makingit difficult to find a drug combination that keeps working. Resistance testing is a way of finding out which drugs are still likely to be effective against mutated strains ofvirus\u2014and which ones will notwork. Resistance testing is a rather complicated business, even for experts. Yourinner science geek may be curious about how it works\u2014it's actually quite the story. More pragmatically, you shouldknow when it's important to have testing done and what the results can (and can't) tell you. hiv's gene machine Like every living thing on earth, hivis based on genetics. hiv's genes\u2014long string-shaped molecules\u2014spell out the entire instruction book for building new viruses. hivhas a natural tendency to mutate. That means that its genes and therefore the virus itself are slowly but constantlychanging. Genetic changes lead to mutations\u2014correspon-ding changes in the virus' structure, shape and response to drugs. By studying these mutations, investigators can poten- tially map different subtypes of hivin different regions of the world and determine whether one particular personmay have infected another. However, the most importantuse of hivgenetics is identifying drug resistance. Where does drug resistance come from? Mutations of some sort are produced every time the virus replicates. This usually happens more or less at ran-dom\u2014purely as a result of mistakes in the replicationprocess. Many of the resulting mutations don't make muchof a difference: The ins and outs of HIV drug resistance testing by Carol MajorResistanceGSilent mutations change the genetic makeup slightly but do not physically change the virus in any detectable way. GPolymorphisms change the physical makeup of the virus but do not necessarily cause drug resistance. Infact, some of these polymorphisms actually harm thevirus: These \"crippled\" variants can't survive or repro-duce as well, so they tend to die out quickly. Others are fairly neutral\u2014the new virus is different but not in any significant way. (Similarly, human genetic differ-ences result in different eye or hair colour, orwhether or not you cancurl your tongue.)Even with persist in peoplewho are nottaking anti- hiv medications. Then there are other, nastier forms of mutations: GSome mutations causedrug resistance byphysically changing the 19 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEvirus so that it is no longer sensitive to one or more drugs. ( Drug sensitivity is a measure of how well a drug suppresses, or controls, the virus.) Some of these areclassified as primary mutations \u2014the \"prime suspects\" that severely limit a drug's effectiveness. GAny mutation that doesn't completely cripple the viruswill be passed on to its \"offspring,\" which can thenaccumulate more. Therefore, after a few generations, a single virus may have many mutations. Some of theseso-called secondary mutations do not cause drug resistance on their ownbut do contribute en masse if enough specific ones pile up. GSome mutations do notaffect the amount of drugresistance a virus has but,instead, help a virus withresistance mutations togrow more quickly. Theseare called compensatory mutations . GFinally, some mutations actually reverse the ef- fects of others, so that avirus with a resistancemutation may becomesomewhat or completelysensitive to These are calledantagonistic mutations . Assistance RETRO SCIENCE: DNA, RNA AND ALL THA T JAZZ hivis from the family of retroviruses. Although these days being \"retro\" is akin to being cool, in the case of hivit literally means backwards . Whereas the hivvirus' genetic material is rna (ribonucleic acid), most of the rest of nature mainly uses dna (deoxyribonucleic acid) as genetic material. rna is used primarily for the grunt work\u2014send- ing messages, shunting building blocks back and forth,and other construction activities. hiv, being retro, takes the unusual step of using rna for its genetic material. It then has to work backwards, making dna from its rna before it can actually reproduce itself. This requires an enzyme called reverse transcriptase . Reverse transcriptase doesn't do this very well at all. Rather than creating exact replicas of new dna , it con- tinually makes mistakes. This is where mutant virusescome from.How do mutations produce drug resistance? hivneeds to produce an assort- ment of proteins, like a viral\"toolkit,\" in order to do its job. Anti-retroviral drugs generally work by alock-and-key effect that prevents oneor more of these proteins from doingits job. However, if a viral proteinphysically changes in just the rightway, that mutation may allow the virus to escape from the drug's \"locking\" effect. Drug-resist-ant mutations cause these specificchanges to viral proteins\u2014changesthat usually weaken the virus slightlybut allow it to evade the drugs. hivdoesn't necessarily want to mutate into a drug-resistant form.However, when the virus is not com-pletely suppressed, billions of newand different viruses are continuallybeing produced. It can be just a mat-ter of time before the virus stumbleson a mutation that gives it someresistance to a particular drug. (Picture an obsessed lock-smith making keys at random. Sooner or later, one may fitthe right lock.) If you aren't on meds, drug-resistant virusesmay appear by chance, but they don't have any particularadvantage. In fact, they are usually weaker than theirunmutated relatives and don't reproduce fast enough tosurvive very long. However, if you are on meds, the viruses are swimming in a sea of antiretroviral drugs that are trying to stop themfrom replicating. If one little virus has a mutation thatallows it to replicate easily in the presence of those drugs,even while all its relatives remain suppressed, the resistantvirus will \"preferentially\" replicate until it becomes themain virus in the mix. Also, since drugs within each class are structurally simi- lar, resistance to one may mean resistance to others in itsclass as well\u2014a scenario known as cross-resistance . But I take all my meds\u2014 why do I have resistant virus? Resistance mutations are most likely to arise in the presence of less-than-effective drug concentrations in the blood. Scientists have shown that patients taking somebut not all of their meds have the fastest development ofmutations. That's why there is so much emphasis onadherence . It is important to try to have allof your drugs in your system at alltimes to keep resistance from emerg- ing. Most importantly, do not take only one or two drugs ofyour combination. Low drug concentrations can also occur in people who are fully adherent to their medication, due to factors such aspoor absorption, rapid drug clearance and drug interactions. 20 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005Therapeutic drug monitoring, which measures drug concentrations in theblood, might be helpful for ident-ifying these problems, but it isgenerally not available. Drug inter-actions, however, can be avoidedwith careful prescribing. Detecting drug resistance There are two main methods for detecting drug resistance: pheno- typing and genotyping . The seemingly most direct way is to try to grow the virus in a test-tube in the presence of measuredamounts of drug. If it grows, it isresistant to the drug; if it does notgrow, it is sensitive. This is calledphenotyping . Phenotyping meas- ures just how sensitive or resistant a virus is\u2014whether it growsquickly, slowly, or not at all. Thoughphenotyping seems like the moststraightforward method, it is tech-nically quite difficult to do and is rarely used in practice. Phenotyping is not routinely done inany labs in Canada, although Dr. Mark Wainberg hasrecently arranged a pilot project in Quebec, sending speci-mens to the Virologic laboratory in California. An alternative method, called genotyping , is by far the most common method of assessing hivdrug resistance. Although the process seems (and is) very complicated, itboils down to a job of translation\u2014somewhat like readingEgyptian hieroglyphics or computer code. At the resist-ance testing labs, technicians take a \"viral fingerprint\"(the genetic structure of the virus) and turn it into tangibleinformation: how well various drugs can control hiv. When we look for mutations, we are comparing the indi-vidual viral fingerprint to the normal wild-type virus. Anydifferences from wild-type represent spots where thevirus has mutated. The final, crucial step in genotyping is to assess whether these mutations represent drug resistance. There are threemajor commercial genotyping technologies that do this indifferent ways: Gvircotype uses a \"virtual phenotype.\" This is a large and growing \"library\" that matches up known muta-tions with known degrees of resistance to variousdrugs. GBayer trugene uses an expert panel to assess and identify the specific drug resistance mutations. GViroSeq matches resistance mutations to a standarddatabase to determine the potential for drug resistance.Though all three technologies provide similar results, there are important differences. For example, the virtualphenotype gives an estimate of the degree of resistancecaused by a given set of mutations, while the other If a viral protein physically changes in just the right way, that mutation may allow the virus to escape from a drug's \"locking\" effect.approaches only state whether you are resistant or not. In addition, sometimes the approaches used to interpret themutation data can result in entirely different results for thesame sample. Genotyping for assessing hivdrug resistance is widely available in Canada. Different provinces have different guide-lines and use different kits or methods, but usually physicianscan order the test by indicating a viral load rebound or failureto respond to therapy. Genotyping immediately after serocon-version can be more problematic but can usually bearranged. It is also becoming increasingly important to havephenotyping availability to sort out treatment options forthose with complex drug resistance patterns. What does genotyping tell you? Resistance test reports generally provide a detailed list of all of the specific mutations found in the viral populationtested, plus a summary of the corresponding levels of drugresistance. The summary often uses colour codes to flagvarying degrees of drug resistance. The detailed mutationdata allow physicians to combine their own expertise withthe summary and interpretations of the report. Certain cautions have to be observed when interpreting a genotypic test result. These include the following: GViral load must be more than 250copies/ml for the test to be successful. GWhen assessing treatment failure, patients should beactively taking medication for the test results to beaccurate. Mutations cannot be detected during treatmentinterruptions even though they may still be around. GMixtures of mutations(more than one muta-tion at the same \"site\")sometimes may not bedetected by the test ifthey are present insmall amounts. ofdrug resistance testsshould be reviewedwhen making treat-ment decisions.Drug resistance testing is just one of many factorsto be considered whenmaking treatment deci-sions\u2014along with yourtreatment history and yourown judgment as to howyou can handle side effectsand the demands of drugadherence. When to test There are two points in time when it is useful todo drug resistance testing. 21 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDE1.Drug resistance test results are particularly important if and when drug therapy fails . If you've been on therapy for some time and your viral load begins to \"breakthrough\" (rise again), a prompt resistance test can iden-tify which mutations have occurred. This information isinvaluable for choosing a successful next regimen be-fore more mutations accumulate and further complicatethe picture. 2.A test should be done as soon as possible after diag- nosis . If you are infected with an already-resistant strain of hivbut are not actively taking meds, the mutated hiv strain will diminish until it is not detectable by resist-ance tests. The transmitted mutations are still stored inyour body, even though they may seem to disappear asthe majority of the virus naturally \"reverts\" to wild-type.A resistance test done later might not pick up thesemutations and may not provide an accurate picture of allthe drugs you could be resistant to. Dr. Paul Sax of Boston, Massachusetts, recently pub- lished a paper showing that resistance testing at initial hivdiagnosis\u2014before treatment is started\u2014can guide a doctor to select the appropriate treatment regimen andimprove a patient's outcomes. In Canada, between 7% and 15% of those just diagnosed have hivresistance mutations. So, even if you have no intention of startingtherapy soon, a resistance test done as soon as possibleafter infection provides valuable information for futuremedication decisions. A more cost-effective approachmight be to store the sample and do the test when youdecide to start treatment. Acting on results Doctors and phas face many challenges in bal-ancing the results of thesetests with quality of lifeand other factors. Forinstance, there is stillsomewhat of a dilemma indeciding how to handle an otherwise-healthy pha who has a low butdetectable viral load (say,in the low thousands) on a well-tolerated regimen.Sometimes the push toundetectable has veryundesirable effects relatedto tolerance and toxicity.On the other hand, switch-ing may preserve the use-fulness of the other drugsin the regimen. With prosand cons on both sides,this is a decision to bemade carefully by the doc-tor and patient.BASIC STEPS OF GENOTYPING 1Pick apart the viral genes to isolate the ones that deal with how the virus reacts to drugs. 2\"Amplify\" these genes to make sure there is enough for the test to work on. 3Lay out the exact chemical structure of the genes in a process known as genetic sequencing . 4Analyze this chemical sequence, or genetic \"finger- print,\" to determine how much the virus is resistant tovarious drugs.All genes\u2014whether they're yours, a housefly's or hiv's\u2014are made long strings of just four smaller mole- cules (\"nucleotides\") repeated in a very precise codedorder. Think of a long string of beads\u2014black, white, redand blue. That long sequence of coloured beads containsall the information needed to build a new virus. Mutations are places where the \"normal\" colour has been replaced by a different one\u2014a blue bead, say, wherea red one should be. (In fact, the \"coloured beads\" arecalled nucleic acids , and we represent them with the codes A, T, C and G. So a string of normal viral dna might be spelled \" atcg ,\" and a mutated variation might be \" attg .\" Computers are perfectly suited to scan the seemingly end-less strings of letters for differences\u2014a task no humanwould want to tackle.)DRUG TRADE NAME GENERIC FOLD CUT-OFF RESISTANCE NAME CHANGE ANALYSIS Zerit\u00ae stavudine 0.7 1.1 - 2.2 MAXIMAL RESPONSEViread\u00ae tenofovir 1.4 - 2.0 REDUCED RESPONSEHivid\u00ae zidovudine MINIMAL RESPONSE Agenerase\u00ae - boosted amprenavir/r 2.4 0.9 - 6.5 REDUCED RESPONSEReyataz\u00ae atazanavir 23.4 2.0 RESISTANT Lexiva\u00ae, Telzir\u00ae fosamprenavir 2.4 1.8 RESISTANT Crixivan\u00ae indinavir 27.7 0.8 - 2.2 MINIMAL RESPONSE Crixivan\u00ae - boosted indinavir/r 27.7 4.1 - 21.2 MINIMAL RESPONSE Kaletra\u00ae lopinavir/r 11.8 10.0 - 61.6 REDUCED RESPONSEViracept\u00ae - 1.5 MINIMAL RESPONSE Invirase\u00ae, Fortovase\u00ae saquinavir 4.7 0.7 - 1.0 MINIMAL RESPONSE Invirase\u00ae, Fortovase\u00ae - boosted saquinavir/r 4.7 1.1 - 12.0 REDUCED RESPONSEAptivus\u00ae tipranavir 1.6 1.6 SUSCEPTIBLE One of the newest directions in resistance testing is the concept of the \"virtual virus.\" Once a mutation occurs, it is\"archived\" in your blood cells. It may then be \"overgrown\"by other viral strains, so that subsequent resistance testsmay very well miss it. However, the archived mutationremains ready to re-emerge if the drug that caused itappears on the scene again. For this reason, Dr. Julio Montaner and colleagues at the B.C. Centre for Excellence in hiv/aids have realized that it is critical to track the virus over time, taking intoaccount the accumulation of mutations even though theymay not be present in the most recent sample. (On theother hand, a virus with many mutations may be slightlyless virulent, or damaging, than a wild-type virus because 22 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005a virus with mutations may be slightly less \"fit\"\u2014the virus pays a price in its ability to make copies of itself when itpicks up mutations.) New drugs for treatment are continually being devel- oped. We know that it is likely that these new drugs willgive rise to new resistance mutations. Strategies for treat-ment need to keep the viral load completely suppressed foras long as possible. But the good news is that this is alreadythe norm. The majority of phas now stay suppressed for years without changing meds. Carol Major is a consultant at the Ontario hivTreatment Network and former head of the hivLaboratories for the Ontario Ministry of Health.READING RESIST ANCE Mutations are the exact locations on the hiv gene that have changedfrom \"wild-type.\" This is the bottom line: how effective the drug will be. (Maximal = most effective; Susceptible = good; Reduced response = less effective;Resistant or Minimal = not effective)Amount of resistance / loss of drug effectiveness (higher numbers = higher resistance = less effective drug)In the fall of 2002, Michael Bell had never felt worse. He'd contracted the Norwalk virus three times, haddropped 60pounds and could barely get down more than a glass of waterand a few soda crackers a day. Diag-nosed with hivin 1993 , Bell, 47, had hardly ever been sick. Before con-tracting Norwalk, he had long beendoing well on his hivmeds, was a busy volunteer at a Toronto aids organization and was working at hismaintenance job. Never quite having recovered from Norwalk, the following February Belldeveloped pneumonia and a fever of109. When he pulled through\u2014just barely\u2014he had less than 50 cd4cells and a viral load of over one million.\"There was nothing the doctors coulddo for me anymore,\" Bell recalls. Sohe started seeing a naturopathicdoctor ( nd). Naturopathic care has become increasingly popular among peoplewith hiv/aids (phas). And, more often, phas go with the support and even the encouragement of their regular doc-tors, using naturopathic medicine incombination with their medications.There's been a new recognition of thepower of naturopathic medicine to help phas deal with drug side effects, immu- nity and some hiv-related conditions, which has led to more hiv clinics offering free naturopathic care. Forinstance, the British Columbia PersonsWith aids Society ( bcpwa ) runs a free 23 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEWhen The role of naturopathicmedicine for people with HIV clinic in Vancouver and Blood Ties Four Directions Centre offers freenaturopathic services in Whitehorse. Bell was lucky enough to live near the largest naturopathic hiv/aids specialty clinic in Canada. At the Sher-bourne Health Centre Community pha Naturopathic Clinic in downtownToronto, interns\u2014under the supervi-sion of licensed nds\u2014from the Cana- dian College of Naturopathic Medicine( ccnm ) started treating him, first with acupuncture, a form of TraditionalChinese Medicine that uses tiny nee-dles to help the body's natural energyflow better. When Bell stood up for thefirst time after having some needles in his pelvis, he felt a tiny shift. \"Boy,was I hungry,\" he says. \"I hadn't beenhungry in months.\"Acupuncture is just one of many types of complementary medicinemodalities used by naturopathic doc-tors. Think of them as the generalpractitioners of alternative medicine.They go to school for four years aftercompleting an undergraduate degreeand study an array of treatments in-cluding herbs, supplements, homeo-pathy, Traditional Chinese Medicine(including herbs and acupuncture), nu-trition, lifestyle counseling and manualtherapies such as massage. In Canada,licensed nds are trained at either the Canadian College of NaturopathicMedicine in Toronto or the BoucherInstitute of Naturopathic Medicine inNew Westminster, British Columbia. Kenn Luby, a Toronto ndwho specializes in treating phas and worksby Diane PetersNature Callsin the same office as two hivprimary care physicians, says, \"A naturopathuses various techniques to tap into thebody's natural ability to heal itself.\" Todo that, a practitioner looks past sur-face symptoms\u2014say, a chronic runnynose or fatigue\u2014and finds out aboutthe underlying cause (perhaps inflam-mation, an imbalance or even some-thing psychological) before planningtreatment. In Bell's case, one of his biggest problems was all the damage thatNorwalk had done to his digestive sys-tem: His stomach had shrunk and hisbowels and urinary system barelyworked, plus he was very dehydrated.Acupuncture, herbs and nutritionalsupplements encouraged healing,allowing him to start eating and drink-ing again and to develop smootherdigestion. Now, since those underlyingproblems have been helped, Bell hasfewer headaches and a lot more energyand has returned to his volunteer job.He's still taking highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( haart ) but has been able to stop taking other med-ication to help him eat and sleep.His cd4count is now up to 170and his viral load is undetectable. Like Bell, most phas benefit the most from naturopathic medicinewhen it's combined with effective hivtreatment. Call it the new com- bination therapy. \"We work veryclosely with medical doctors. We'renot opposed to regular, allopathicmedicine,\" says Afsoun Khalili, nd, who works at the SherbourneClinic. \"There's nothing like thedrugs to bring down the viral loadand increase the cd4count.\" What naturopathic medicine can do ishelp keep the body as healthy aspossible and help combat somedrug side effects so that people arebetter able to tolerate their meds. Some phas also use naturo- pathic medicine as a form of earlytreatment to help them delay takingmeds. Freida Richler did this backin 1988 when she was first diagnosed. She found a rare healthcare provider\u2014a general practi-tioner who was also an nd. \"I really didn't want to take drugs because 24 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005I've always had extreme adverse reac- tions to them,\" Richler says. Dr.Carolyn Dean encouraged her tochange her diet (to eat more wholefoods and less refined ones) and totake a series of nutritional supple-ments and vitamins. \"For more than10years, I relied exclusively on Dr. Dean and other naturopathic doctors.\" Richler, now 47, fared quite well until 1998 , when she started running a high fever and lost a lot of weight.After being diagnosed with pcp (Pneumocystis pneumonia) and other complications, she began to take hiv drugs. Although she had a hard timewith her initial regimen, she even-tually adjusted to a simpler combina-tion that was easier to tolerate. Todayshe has a cd4count of 1,524 and an undetectable viral load. \"I think Iresponded so well to the drugs andwas able to bounce back to relativelygood health because I always tooklarge amounts of nutritional supple-ments religiously, took time for self- care and was careful about my diet,\"Richler says. Richler started to attend the pha naturopathic clinic in Toronto run by ccnm shortly after recovering from pcp. During her assessment, she men- tioned to the naturopathic intern thatshe hadn't had a period in more thanthree years. The intern treated herwith acupuncture; in addition to work-ing on meridian points that help sup-port the immune system, she workedon a couple of points that stimulate thereproductive organs. After one monthof daily acupuncture, Richler got herperiod. \"Ever since then says. \"That wasfive years ago.\" phas often have a list of health concerns, including side effects, vari-ous discomforts and their immunesystems. Using just one modality, ormore often a combination of two ormore, nds have had success helping phas with diarrhea, appetite loss, fatigue, lipodystrophy, stress, hem-orrhoids, fissures, weight loss,frequent colds and many otherconditions. But naturopathic medicine has its limits. The treatments at an nd's fingertips are not strong enough tostop a powerful infection or fightcancer. And nds themselves debate its impact on immunity. \"Therecertainly are things that can affectthe immune system, like sugar andstress,\" says Joanne Leung, aWhitehorse-based ndwho works at the Blood Ties Four Directionsclinic. She admits there just haven'tbeen the studies to show thatnaturopathic medicine can actuallyimpact cd4count or viral load. But, anecdotally, nds say that their pha patients end up not just feeling bet-ter but with a stronger immune sys-tem after treatment. \"I believe thatthe patients who are seeing me aswell as seeing their doctors aredoing better than those who are fol-lowing just a medicine regimen,\"Luby says. Along with a lack of good solid medical studies to show exactlywhat naturopathic medicine can doAcupuncture :A component of Traditional Chinese Medicine that uses very fineneedles inserted into special energypoints on the body to encourage thebody to heal itself. Botanicals/herbs :The use of plant reme- dies in the form of supplements, teas ortinctures to treat conditions. Homeopathy :A form of treatment that uses common diluted remedies to helpthe body heal itself. The practitionertakes into account a complete patientprofile to select an appropriate remedy. Hydrotherapy :The use of hot and cold water (usually through towels) on vari-ous parts of the body to promote circu-lation and encourage healing. Nutritional supplements :The use of vita- mins, probiotics (healthy bacteria) andother substances normally found infoods in pill form. Traditional Chinese Medicine :An ancient approach to healing that includesacupuncture and herbs. LEARN THE LINGOfor hiv, it has a few other flaws. One is that the various modalitiesimpact people differently. Forinstance, some people respond verywell to homeopathy, while othersget no help at all. Interactions with hivmeds can also be a problem. \"It's a real chal-lenge, especially since hiv meds change so rapidly,\" says TasleemKassam, a Calgary ndwho treats phas. \"Research becomes obsolete so fast.\" As a result, many nds avoid things like botanicals andherbs, as they are the most likely tointeract with drugs, while homeo-pathy, acupuncture and dietarychanges are much safer. Luby hasanother reason for avoiding herbswith his phapatients. \"I don't want to add to the pharmaceutical loadin their bodies,\" he says. Accordingto Luby, herbs are really just drugsthat come straight from nature. However, according to Hal Huff, nd, chief supervisor of the Sher- bourne Health Centre Community pha Naturopathic Clinic, herbal medicines, when used cautiously,can be helpful in correcting ormanaging concerns related to hiv. \"Although we know that St. John'swort and probably other botanicalmedicines can interfere with haart , other herbs have been used withoutany apparent interaction in thou-sands of patients,\" he says. \"That said,as with any intervention, we are verycareful to monitor for viral loadchanges or any other evidence ofherb-drug interactions.\" Huff gives theexample of milk thistle, an herb usedto protect the liver and treat liver dam-age. \"It's been the subject of negativeattention but it appears to have beenvindicated,\" he says, citing recentstudies that show that milk thistle hasno significant impact on the efficacy ofantiretrovirals. nds develop an individualized treatment plan based upon a holisticassessment of the patient in terms oftheir physical, mental, social and spir-itual health. So it's no surprise that thestart of a relationship with an nd begins with a lengthy consultation. Atleast an hour long, this discussion is 25 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEabout sharing medical information (meds, medical history, side effects,preexisting conditions and the like)and personal information. Emotionalhealth, stress level and family historyall play into a person's treatment. \"Iend up knowing more about patientsthan their own mother does,\" Kassamsays. In the initial assessment, nds also perform a thorough physicalexamination. That's where naturopathic medi- cine's true power lies\u2014in its ability totreat the whole person, not just theirdisease or their numbers. And that'svery important because naturopathicmedicine often takes a lot of effort onthe part of the patient. \"It's hard workand it's not for everyone,\" Leung says.To make naturopathic medicine work,a patient must often make dietarychanges, take supplements andherbs on a regular schedule, showup for regular appointments andeven deal with emotional issues. phas must also be patient with naturopathic medicine: It's not aquick fix. \"It takes time, a lot longerthan I thought,\" Bell says. He's stillgetting weekly acupuncture treat-ments to keep his health and par-ticularly his digestion strong. Just as an ndpicks a mix of modalities to suit each patient, somust they adapt treatment to whata patient can handle. This is truepatient-centred care: No one shouldhave to do acupuncture if they'rereally uncomfortable with needles,or be turned away from naturo-pathic care if they can't afford thesupplements or are unable to makedietary changes. \"It fits in wherethe clients want it to fit in,\" Leungsays. When an ndand patient work closely together to create a treat-ment program and it works, it'sworth the effort. \"It can be veryempowering to make some changesand see some results,\" she adds. As more free naturopathy clinics and services open up for phas and as more doctors embrace comple-mentary medicine, more phas are benefiting from naturopathic care.It's a nurturing approach that canhelp with many problems that cause discomfort and even long-termdamage. \"I see the future of medicinebeing naturopaths and conventionaldoctors working together, especiallywith hiv but naturopathic doctors whoare drugs and moremedical doctors who practice integra-tive medicine.\" Diane Peters is a Toronto-based writer who has written extensively about health, in-cluding hiv/aids , for Chatelaine, Reader's Digest Canada, poz Parent .

NATURAL SELECTION26 THE POSITIVE SIDE Fall/Winter 2005HIV and kidney disease\u2014 what you need to know by Maggie Atkinson For nine years, my motto was: \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" That's why, despiteworsening lipodystrophy, Iclung to the drug regimenthat was keeping me alive. Why mess with success? Though myviral load was still below detection, mydoctor was urging me to make achange. She wanted me to replace d 4T (Zerit) with tenofovir (Viread) becauseof increasing evidence that d 4T was responsible for my sunken cheeks andstick-like arms and legs. Even moresinister, it could be causing damagenot apparent to the human eye. So, why hadn't I made the switch? I was concerned about safety. Tenofovir,a nucleotide analogue, is a member ofa family of drugs known to cause kid-ney damage. A related drug, adefovir,was denied approval by the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration ( fda) for treatment of hivbecause of kidney problems. Although tenofovir wasapproved by the fda and Health Canada based on clinical trials thatshowed no significant kidney prob-lems, I am cautious about drugs. I've had hivsince 1984 and have seen initial enthusiasms for drugs dis-sipate when adverse events, not ap-parent during clinical trials, appearedonce the drug was approved and usedby thousands of people. I rememberin 1997 when we first discovered Here's Lookin' at You, Kidneys lipodystrophy in people with hiv/aids (phas) on protease inhibitors, a year after phas started using these drugs. So, until a drug has been on the mar-ket for a few years, I feel rather leeryof it. But as the evidence mounted thattenofovir could be a safe replacementfor d 4T, I decided to make the switch. Many phas may now be on tenofovir because the latest treatment guide-lines recommend it as part of the nukebackbone of antiretroviral therapy. Before I began to take the new drug, I consulted my naturopath, KennLuby. He treats many phas in his Toronto practice and has helped metremendously over the years. He madesome changes to the supplements Itake each day and, with that, I feltmore confident starting tenofovir. But only a few weeks later, I read an e-mail from natap , the National aids Treatment Advocacy Project, whichconcerned me. At the Conference onRetroviruses and Opportunistic Infec-tions ( croi) in Boston last February, some researchers questioned how wemeasure kidney function and the rateof kidney dysfunction caused by hiv, tenofovir and other nukes. By only test-ing serum creatinine, as we currentlydo, we may be missing some phas\u2014 especially women and those over 50\u2014 who are at risk for chronic kidney dis-ease. I decided to find out what I coulddo to protect my kidneys.THE URINARY TRACT Every day the kidneys filter about 200 litres of blood. From this, about two litres of urine flow through theureters to be stored in the bladder.The urine is ejected from the bladderand out of the body through the ure-thra. The male urethra ends at the tipof the penis; the female urethra endsjust above the vaginal opening. THE KIDNEYS We have two kidneys\u2014located in the back, one on either side of thespine, below the ribcage. They'reabout the size of a fist and are shapedlike kidney beans. Each kidney hasabout a million tiny blood-filteringunits called nephrons. In each neph-ron, a network of tiny blood vesselscalled the glomerulus attaches to asmall tubule. Blood is filtered in theglomerulus, and extra water and wastepass into the tubule and become urine. I was under the impression that kid- neys just cleaned the blood, but they doa lot more than that. The kidneys havefour main functions: 1.They balance body fluids. 2.They balance body chemicals (ions or minerals), such as potas-sium, calcium, phosphorus andmagnesium. 3.They remove waste products, like urea (from the breakdown of pro-tein from food) and creatinine(formed by normal muscle activity). 4.They produce the following essen- tial hormones: erythropoietin ( epo), which helps make red blood cells, renin, which regulates bloodpressure, and the active form of vitamin D(D 3), which helps maintain calcium for bones. KIDNEY DAMAGE These are three different kidney- related problems that can affect phas. Their causes and treatments vary: 1. Kidney stones result from the build-up of crystallized salts and min-erals, such as calcium or drugs likeindinavir (Crixivan), in the urinarytract. If kidney stones are large enough 27 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEto block the kidney or ureter, they can cause severe abdominal and/or backpain. The stones usually pass throughthe urinary tract on their own, but in some cases they may need to beremoved surgically. About 8%of people taking indinavir may get kidney stones.Fortunately they do not often causekidney disease. Drinking lots of watercan be helpful for preventing kidneystones and helping them to pass. 2. Urinary tract infections ( UTIs) occur in a part of or throughout theurinary tract, but mainly in the bladderand urethra. If left untreated or if theyhappen repeatedly, utis can travel up the ureters from the bladder and affectthe kidneys. utis are usually caused by intestinal bacteria, such as E. coli , which are found in feces (poo). Womenare more likely to get utis because they have shorter urethras than men.Sex, even with a condom, can transferthe feces to the urethra. Drinking lotsof water and 8ounces ( 240 ml) of cranberry juice cocktail a day (prefer-ably at least 27% juice) and wiping from front to back after a bowel move-ment can help prevent utis. 3. Fanconi's Syndrome , sometimes caused by tenofovir, results in acidosis,loss of electrolytes, high creatininelevels and renal insufficiency. It cantake months to recover, and, in somecases, kidney function may not returncompletely to its pre-treatment level.The best way to avoid it, according tokidney ureter bladder prostate urethra Dr. Michelle Hladunewich, a kidney specialist from Sunnybrook andWomen's College Health SciencesCentre in Toronto, is to ensure that thedosage of tenofovir is adjusted appro-priately before starting the drug. Shesays that kidney function, electrolytes,calcium profile and a urinalysis shouldbe monitored every 3-4months. \"The key is to better judge renal dysfunctionat the outset at least by utilizing one ofthe equations to estimate gfr(glomer- ular filtration rate) or by obtaining a creatinine clearance on a 24-hour urine collection.\" All of these kidney problems can lead to kidney disease. Kidney diseases usually damage the nephrons and cause them to losetheir filtering capacity. Kidney diseasecan be acute or chronic. Acute kidneyfailure can result suddenly from poi-soning, infection or trauma. A gradualloss of kidney function, over years ordecades, is called chronic kidney dis- ease ( CKD). If left untreated, kidney disease can result in impaired kidneyfunction and, ultimately, kidney failure. The rest of this article deals with chronic kidney disease, which isbecoming increasingly more prevalentamong phas. CAUSES OF CKD Chronic kidney disease is defined as kidney damage (as evidenced byprotein in the urine) or decreasedkidney function (as evidenced by re- duced gfr) for a period of three months or more. It is a conditioncaused by various diseases. Accordingto the Kidney Foundation of Canada,as many as 1.9million Canadians may have ckdbut most are unaware of it. The two most common causes of ckd are diabetes and high blood pressure . Some other causes are listed below: GThe third most common type ofkidney disease is glomerulo- nephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli and the kidney)\u2014a groupof diseases in which the immunesystem attacks theglomeruli. GInherited diseases , such as poly- cystic kidney disease, which causeslarge cysts to form in the kidneys. GReflux nephropathy . Some people are born with an abnormal junc-tion of the bladder and the ureter,which causes urine to flow back upto the kidney. This causes infec-tions and scarring of the kidneys,which can lead to kidney failure. GHIVand other diseases that affect the body's immune system. hiv- associated nephropathy usually be-gins with heavy proteinuria (largeamounts of protein in the urine)and progresses rapidly (within ayear of detection) to end-stagerenal disease if left untreated. GObstructions caused by kidney stones, tumours or an enlargedprostate gland. GRepeated urinary tract infections. GUnresolved acute kidney failure. GDrugs. Long-term or heavy use of with caffeine can further damage your kidneys. Street drugs such as heroin, cocaine and amphetamines can also cause kidney damage. DIAGNOSIS OF CKD In the later stages of kidney disease, people may have some of thefollowing symptoms: Gmore fatigue Gless energy Gtrouble sleeping Gdry, itchy skin Gmuscle cramps at night Gswollen feet and ankles Gpuffiness around the eyes,especially in the morning Ga need to urinate more often,especially at nightHowever, there are usually no symptoms of kidney disease until thedamage is severe. That is why it'simportant to be tested. TESTING FOR CKD According to Dr. Hladunewich, everyone with hiv/aids should be screened yearly for kidney diseasebecause phas are \"proving to be a fairly high-risk group.\" The first step isa blood test for serum creatinine and aurine test to measure protein (for thealbumin:creatinine ratio). These testsare used to assess both kidney damageand kidney function. Kidney damage is measured by the amount of protein in the urine,because when the kidneys are dam-aged, protein leaks into the urine. Measuring kidney function is more controversial. Doctors andresearchers normally use the serumcreatinine test to measure kidneyfunction indirectly, but a study pre-sented at croi suggested that this test alone might not be sufficient. Instead,the creatinine test result should beused in a mathematical equation,along with age, race and gender, tocalculate the estimated glomerular fil-tration rate (est gfr)\u2014an estimate of how well the glomeruli are filtering.Sometimes you also read about thecreatinine clearance rate, a similartest of kidney function.There are two well-known equa- tions used to calculate est gfr in adults\u2014Cockroft-Gault the mdrd Study. San Francisco researchers com-pared serum creatinine to est gfr (using the mdrd Study equation) in more than 1,600 patients in chorus , a large, observational U.S. cohort. Usingthe serum creatinine test, none of the136women in the study showed kidney dysfunction, but using the est gfrequa- tion, 10 (7%) of them had moderate kidney disease. Also, among the 307 people over 50years old, the creatinine test results indicated that 12 (4%) had moderate kidney disease\u2014the est gfr showed that 66 (21%) did. Overall, using the creatinine test, 1.9% of pa- tients showed moderate kidney dys-function, while that figure increased to13.8% with est gfr. The take-home message: Perhaps we should be usingthe est gfrmeasurement in studies and in the clinic. If these initial lab tests indicate kid- ney damage or reduced kidney func-tion, the doctor may recommend anultrasound or X-ray to see whetherthe shape or size of the kidneys isSCREEN YOUR BEANS Doctors who specialize in kidney problems are called nephrologists (from the Greek word for kidney, nephron ). Doctors who specialize in problems of the organs and tubes that transport urine from thekidneys to outside the body are called urologists . Anything related to the kidneys may be called renal , from Latin renes , meaning kidneys.LEARN THE LINGOThe National Kidney Foundation is con- cerned that many people may be in theearly stages of chronic kidney disease( CKD) and not know it. It recommends that adults who are at risk for kidney diseaseuse the calculator on its website to deter-mine their est GFR. This calculator is a screening tool to inexpensively identifypeople at risk for CKD. est GFR is not an absolute lab test result; it's only an esti-mate of kidney function. Unless you live in B.C., where the labs now provide the GFR result, you can ask your doctor to calculate your estimated GFR. Or, if you know your creatinine level, you canuse the GFR calculator (www.kidney.org/ professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator.cfm). It uses an abbreviated form of the MDRD equation. Fill in your creatinine test result,age, sex and race to estimate your GFR. Check the box for \"umols/l\" when inputtingyour creatinine level because that's theinternational system unit used in Canada tomeasure creatinine. If your est GFR measures less than 60, discuss your results with your doctor.abnormal. A ct-scan or mri might also be done. These tests are calledrenal imaging. The doctor may also doa kidney biopsy\u2014a procedure inwhich a needle is used to extract smallpieces of tissue from the kidneys forexamination under a microscope. Certain people may need additional testing, such as a 24-hour urine collec- tion, if they're over 70, very thin, obese or vegetarian, or if they takecertain drugs, like Bactrim/Septra orcimetidine (Tagamet) because thesedrugs can affect or takingcreatine supplements may alsoincrease serum creatinine levels. In the final stage\u2014end-stage renal disease\u2014the kidneys stop working anddialysis or a transplant is needed. Dial-ysis involves using a machine or otherartificial device to remove the excesswater and wastes from the body.Organ transplants are rarely per-formed on phas in Canada, although they are done in the U.S. TREATMENT OF CKD Medication, diet, supplements, ex- ercise and drug dosage adjustmentsmay help prevent or delay kidney 29 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEfailure. The treatment will depend on the stage of kidney disease, the cause,symptoms and other health problems. MEDICATION There isn't a medication for ckd. You can only treat the causes and thesymptoms. For example: GIf you have high blood pressure,one of the causes of ckd, your doctor may recommend bloodpressure medication. GIf you have anemia, which can bebrought on by kidney disease, youmay need synthetic epoetin ( epo) or iron. DIET According to Diana Johansen, dieti- cian at the Oak Tree Clinic, the Womenand Family hiv Centre for British Columbia, when a person has normalkidney function their diet is generallynot adjusted to prevent kidneydisease. When the kidneys are unable to function properly, various substancesbuild up in the blood to undesirablelevels. Dietary changes aim to reducethe intake of foods that create more ofthese substances. In the early stages,you may need to reduce the amount of protein, phosphorus and sodium inyour diet. Later on, in advancedkidney disease, you may also need to reduce potassium and fluids. Speak with your doctor or a renaldietician before making any changesto your diet. GProtein is found in meats, dairyproducts, dried beans, soy prod-ucts and nuts. GDairy products, dried beans andpeas, nuts, soft drinks, cocoa andbeer are high in phosphorus. GSince sodium can raise your bloodpressure, you may need to cutdown on salt and canned, pickledor processed foods. Avoid salt-substitutes that contain potassium. GHigh sources of potassium arebananas, dried fruits, orange juice,melons, dried beans, nuts, potatoesand tomato sauces. In advancedkidney disease, high potassiumlevels can affect the heart rhythm. GHigh blood cholesterol levels canalso be associated with kidney fail-ure. A low-fat diet, exercise andlipid-lowering medications canhelp reduce cholesterol levels.I wondered about water intake. Dr. Hladunewich warned that too muchwater could be dangerous for someonewith significant kidney disease. It'sbest to determine your kidney functionthrough the appropriate testing meas-ures. If you have reduced kidney func-tion, you may need to consult a renaldietician as well as a nephrologist for advice about your diet. Evensomething that might normally seemharmless, like drinking water, canpotentially pose problems if your kid-neys aren't working properly. Thatsaid, as long as your kidneys are func-tioning normally, you should makesure to get enough water every day. SUPPLEMENTS Lark Lands, a medical journalist and longtime aids treatment educator and advocate, says there isn't any \"magicbullet\" for supporting the kidneys butthere are some basics that can help.Here are her recommendations: GThe very minimum that every pha should take is a multivitamin, anSTAGES OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Based on the kidney damage and kidney function tests, CKD is divided into five stages. Not all people progress from Stage 1 to Stage 5. If you have any of the risk factors below, you may beat increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease and should be tested for it.

By counteringthat, you may also help preventkidney problems due to scarringand blocking of the tiny bloodvessels. Avoid fats that promoteinflammation, such as partiallyhydrogenated oils (\"trans polyunsaturated fish, and walnuts.

Oddly enough, although indi-navir can affect the kidneys, it is notmetabolized through the kidneys, sodosage adjustments are not required. Some drugs that may harm the kidneys: Gtenofovir (Viread) - for treating hiv; there is some early evidence that combining tenofovir with ddI (Videx) may be related to more kidney damage than teno-fovir alone GHepsera - for hepatitis B Gcidofovir (Vistide) - for cmvretinitis Givpentamidine - for pcptreatment Gaminoglycosides - a class of anti-biotics for serious infections (includes Amikacin, Gentamicin) Grifampin - for tuberculosis Gacyclovir (Zovirax) and tion or treatmentIf you are taking more than one of these drugs at a time, it's a good ideato have your kidney function moni-tored more often. THE KIDNEYS ARE ALL RIGHT After learning about what can go wrong with the kidneys, I was nervousabout my first checkup three monthsafter starting tenofovir. But everythingwas fine. My creatinine level wasslightly higher than when I started,and when I took that result and calcu-lated my est gfr it was 89, which is only a mild decrease in kidney func-tion.

Working with clay is very spiri- tual and therapeutic. I don't knowwhat's in it, but claymakes you feel magical. For 21years I taught pottery at the Carnegie, acommunity centre atHastings and Main, arough area of Vancouver.It's called the \"livingroom\" for the downtowneastside and it's for low-income, mar-ginalized people. But last year I leftbecause everyone was passing awaylike flies in that area of town. I don'thave enough fingers or toes to counthow many friends passed away. I waslonely and depressed. I don't tend to make new friends now because I'm afraid they won't livelong. I spend most of my time at homedoing pottery. This is my peace andquiet. When I get into the clay, I tendto forget about aids, it kind of just fades away. In 1995 , my partner, John, took notice of me having cold sweats, losingweight and being sick a lot. He diag- 31 Fall/Winter 2005 THE POSITIVE SIDEnosed me before the doctor did. After my hivtest, I waited for two weeks on pins and needles because John already had it. When the doctorcalled me into the office,he told me my cd4 count was down to 40. I had full-blown aids and mac (Mycobacterium avium complex). I thought thatwas the end of the roadfor me. But I took pills for the macand got better. Back then with two partners in one household with full-blown aids, it was always something. Sheersurvival took over. NowI'm on meds and I'mpretty active. I live with hiv, but I never go too far into the future. For yearsJohn and I were living inone-month intervals. Nowwith treatment and all,we have a three-month horizon. Everythree months, you shed your skin, likea snake. I find this very optimistic. Now I teach at the Gathering Place, across the street from bcpwa . We'vegot a terrible crystal meth problem in Vancouver and this community centreis in the eye of the hurricane. It's full ofstreet people, and a lot of the studentshave hiv. My students call me Blake, even though my real name's Henry. A friendof mine, a numerologist who died of aids, once said to me: \"Don't ever go by Henry. They all die of diseases.Think of Henry viii, he died of syphilis. Go with your middle name.\"So my art name is Blake. All my students know I have hiv. We have our own little support group.We talk about ourhealth, our meds, whatwe're being diagnosedwith. We share our sto-ries. There's lots oflaughter and jokes. Claymakes you want to talkabout things. There's alot of sexual talk some-times, especially among the gay guys. Itell them to try to respect everyone inthe class, because there are straightpeople, too. The only things I ask themnot to discuss are politics and religionbecause things can get heated andthere are people in the class from alldifferent backgrounds. When people come into the class, they're usually depressed, but afterthree weeks they have this happy,beautiful face on them. Memoriescome up when you knead the clay. Alot of people think of their momsbecause when they start digging theirhands in the clay, they remember theirmothers baking, rolling out the dough. When we do the glaze and kiln firings, everyonesays it's like Christmas.They're like kids at abakery. After their workcomes out, I do little cri-tiques, in a positive way. Pottery has helped me grow and I like to see other people grow just as much as Ihave. That's my reward. I have allthese people around me who give mesupport, and it feels good to givesomething back.
