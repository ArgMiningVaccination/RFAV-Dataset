Through recovery, individuals are empowered to help find meaning in their lives and integrate back into their communities. Schedule an Appointment Outpatient Substance Use Treatment Next Steps South (260 East 161st Street): (718) 993-3397 Next Steps (718) 829-3440 Next STEPS Next STEPS (Substance Abuse Treatment Education and Prevention Service) works with patients to achieve abstinence from substances by focusing on all aspects of the whole person -- physical, mental and social. Next STEPS is located in [three large Wellness Centers in the Bronx](#wellness) that provide services including psychiatric treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, and peer support. Next STEPS takes a client-centered approach to treatment and offers services that are individualized, culturally competent and provided with the utmost respect. Next STEPS works to promote recovery with individual patients, as well as the larger community, by providing recovery-focused social activities, graduate alumni groups, and other peer support groups. Next STEPS offers individual counseling and groups covering topics such as early recovery, managing triggers, motivation for change, relapse prevention, spirituality, mental health/dual diagnosis, anger management, and the MATRIX Model. Our treatment is informed by evidence-based practices, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. Many of our patients have additional needs (mental health, medical, cultural and/or criminal justice); Next STEPS aims to provide these services in a \"one-stop shopping\" model. We also coordinate care with other agencies when a Next STEPS patient receives care elsewhere or requires a service that we do not provide. The Division of Substance Abuse has linkage agreements with many providers in the Bronx, Manhattan and Westchester. Medication-Assisted Opioid Treatment The Division of Substance Abuse provides several treatment options for opioid addiction. Medications such as methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) or other approved opioid-agonist medications, used either in maintenance or long-term tapering, are medically prescribed to normalize biochemistry, block the effects of abused opioid drugs, and eliminate drug craving. Comprehensive maintenance treatment combines pharmacotherapy with personalized health care, psychosocial support, relapse prevention, and behavioral therapies to manage opioid addiction and substantially improve our patients' health and quality of life.
