Fortunately, we have an inbuilt natural defence mechanism - our immune system. Easy lifestyle habits for immunity It's no surprise that simple lifestyle habits such as getting a good night's sleep, a balanced diet full of fruit and vegetables and washing your hands regularly can help support your body's ability to fight off infections, but did you know that plants have powerful properties to help support your body's natural defence mechanism? Here are our favourite natural remedies to help support your immune system. Boost your immune system naturally with these plants Echinacea A renowned immune tonic, echinacea can be particularly helpful for fighting infections of the respiratory tract. It may have a preventative action but also help relieve symptoms and speed recovery. Elderberries Bursting with brightly coloured pigments that act as natural antioxidants, elderberries are a natural source of vitamin C. Sipping on herbal tea is a fantastic way of incorporating these two ingredients into your day-to-day lives. Our Pukka Herbs Organic Elderberry and Echinacea tea is packed with antioxidants to reduce stress and fight infections. Vitamin C Well-known for supporting our immune function, vitamin C plays an important role in allowing our immune system to communicate and co-ordinate a response. Andrographis Andrographis is traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to promote the production of antibodies and reduce the severity of infection. Pukka Herbs recently worked with the University of Southampton on a clinical trial to prescribe andrographis - to reduce and shorten symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections - to NHS patients in GP surgeries across the UK. Mushrooms There are approximately 400 species of fungi that have been identified with medicinal properties, and many have antiviral, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory qualities. Mushrooms can be easily added into your diet through daily doses of supplements such as [Pukka's Mushroom Gold](https://www.pukkaherbs.com/uk/en/products/mushroom-gold-capsules) capsules. Ginger Wonderful and warming, ginger contains high levels of spicy essential oils that stimulate the circulation, provide natural antibacterial protection. Lemon Lemon has been used in both Western and Eastern traditional medicine as a digestive due to its aromatic and bitter properties. Our whole lemon is packed with natural vitamin C and accessory bioflavonoids for cellular protection. Manuka Honey Sweet, soothing and nourishing, manuka honey combines the therapeutic benefits of honey with the antimicrobial qualities of the manuka tree from which the bees select the nectar. Lemon, ginger and honey are a great combination that many people will be used to reaching for when symptoms strike. Our [Lemon, Ginger and Manuka Honey tea](/us/en/products/lemon-ginger-and-manuka-honey-tea) is packed with antioxidants to reduce stress and fight infections. Spicy and sweet, this perfect winter warmer combines natural antibacterial and antiviral herbs that will protect the body from infection or soothe an irritated throat and dry cough.
