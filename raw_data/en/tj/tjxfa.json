This is largely due to too much commercial and government power having been put in the hands of a few massive organisations such as Monsanto, Du Pont, Syngenta, Aventis and Dow Chemicals, who are controlling and dictating a large proportion not only of the worlds food and seed supply and production, but the weed killers, herbicides, pesticides, preservatives and chemicals our food is now laden with - as well as the medicines prescribed to patients with the very diseases resulting from consuming this food. The seeds have been genetically modified and crafted to contain pesticides in their DNA, soil and water sources are being poisoned, pollination insects such as bees are dying in their millions, diseases like BSE are affecting livestock and fish are full of mercury. The largest 8 brand names (Mars, General Mills, Kraft, Nestle, Pepsico, Kellogg's, Coca-Cola and Unilever) in the food business all use GMO. These companies make up 90% of the food available in a modern grocery store. The entire food cycle is affected, and the food itself is nutritionally bereft and disease-causing. Lifestyle diseases and chronic illness are on the increase. Heart attacks, diabetes, high cholesterol, colon, liver, kidney cancers and other organ damage, Morgellons disease, hormone imbalances, birth defects, spontaneous miscarriage, arthritis, anaemia, leukaemia, Fatty Liver Disease, ADHD, autism, certain increasing allergies and food addiction are all linked to the toxic food supply. Obesity has now reached epidemic proportions and several hundred thousand of these cases have returned results of malnutrition. All of this is attributable to the toxicity levels in modern food which is not only slowly poisoning us, but providing far less nutritional value than food available before the 70's. People are aware that there is a need for supplements and are now swallowing vitamin tablets in quantities never seen before. Unfortunately most supplements found on the market are synthetically produced, void of real ingredients (plants, herbs, etc.) that inherently contain vitamins and minerals in their natural form. DETOX THROUGHOUT THE AGES Healing and cleansing through the use of natural herbs is nothing new. Traditional Chinese medicine, ancient Egyptian medicine, Indian Aruveyda, Mayan, Incan and Aztec medicine and African Inyangas to name a few, have successfully used natural herbs for cleansing and healing for centuries; in fact for centuries before the advent of \"Western medicine\" and the commercialisation thereof. Likewise, fasting has been used as a cleansing, toxin removal and renewal ritual in Islam, Judaism, Buddhism and several other philosophies for centuries. With increased education, awareness and mistrust of big pharma, the move towards more traditional methods of healing and cleansing are rapidly on the increase today, gaining popularity and gaining results. In times gone by, just making sure that one's diet was balanced and regularly included salads, fresh vegetables and fruit, and that perhaps a warm lemon drink in the morning cleaned out the bowel, that perhaps a meat-free day once a week was observed and that one limited regular use of antibiotics and medications, was probably sufficient to keep one healthy. This type of lifestyle is no longer sufficient. The body is not able to process all the additives, chemicals, refinements and modifications in modern food, and is becoming persistently inflamed and toxic, resulting in a compromised immune system, a slowing metabolic rate, an increase in weight specifically a thickening in the belly area, premature aging and the development of a plethora of the aforementioned lifestyle diseases and the resultant increase in chronic medications. DETOX IN MODERN TIMES RE-DEFINED With our bodies experiencing toxic overload in modern times, more aggressive and regular cleansing and detox is required on an ongoing basis. So how do we do this? Organic Food: Choosing organic food goes a long way to eliminate the digestion of dangerous commercial pesticides, GMO, additives, hormones and antibiotics. Legislation about organic food is generally strict, but standards about what percentages of organic components make up ingredients in organic \"packaged food\" however differs from country to country and manipulation of certification and labeling is a concern. Several individuals and communities are now taking to growing their own organic food. Diet: I prefer to call this nourishment, as currently, the word diet is often referred to in the context of losing weight. Nourishment is about maintaining and protecting good health. The key to good nourishment is variety and moderation. Convenience, pre-packaged, over-processed and fast food is becoming the normal way of eating for many people. Also, people nowadays have a tendency to eat what they like, rather than realising that nutrition happens on a cellular level and eating food that nourishes and supports the body at this fundamental level. A good mix of amino acids from protein, essential fatty acids from fats, glucose from carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, trace elements and antioxidants in the correct combinations is the key to proper functioning body and optimum health. It is important to maintain the body in an alkaline state. This can be done by taking a drink of warm water with the juice of half a lemon or 2 tablespoonfuls of apple cider vinegar every morning. Examples of acid forming foods to avoid in large quantities include meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, rice, white flour products, carbonated soft drinks, processed foods, peanuts, sugar, and coffee. Examples of alkaline forming foods to include in the diet include lemons, limes, grapefruit, dandelions, avocados, mangoes, papaya, almonds, leafy greens, asparagus, garlic, bee pollen, olive oil, chilli, ginger and herbal teas. Water: Most people are dehydrated to some extent. Particularly as one ages, the sense of thirst diminishes thus less water is taken. The consumption of 30ml of clean, fresh water per kg of body weight is recommended on a daily basis. This is over and above juices, tea, coffee or anything else one may drink. Water is also alkaline forming. Blending and juicing: As we become more aware that the fruits and vegetables we buy are becoming increasingly deficient in nutrients, people are finding new ways to pack in as much nutrition as possible. I personally prefer blending to juicing, as you are more likely to get the benefit of the fibre content of the food. It is easier, quicker and highly nutritious to blend, for example, an apple, an orange, a handful of berries, a handful of kale, a handful of spinach, half a cup of papaya and a nib of ginger into a smoothie drink than eating all those ingredients in one sitting. Blended smoothies pack a powerful nutritious punch and it is recommended to consume at least one daily. It is also an ideal way of completing and complementing the daily nutritional requirement you might otherwise not be getting from all your meals. Antioxidants: Antioxidants combat free radicals that are formed in the body from pesticides, radiation, food additives and other modifications to food. With more than 1500 recognised antioxidants in food, there is a lot to choose from. However, you would be pretty well covered taking five to six servings of fresh fruit and vegetables every day and raw will deliver the best results as enzymes are destroyed in the cooking process. The deeper the colour, the higher the antioxidant level in any food. Herbs: Herbs, either added to food during cooking, sprinkled raw on top of included in blended drinks or teas, are not only full of nutrients and flavonoids, assists in fighting cancers, lowering cholesterol and protects the heart from forming plaque. Including fresh herbs in the daily diet also gives ongoing detoxification of the system. Mangistha cleans the lymph system, turmeric balances the digestive system, guduchi cleanses the liver, shilajit regenerates cells, ginger restores digestion, dandelion promotes bowel regularity thereby assisting with elimination, cilantro helps the body get rid of metal toxins, eucalyptus cleanses the lungs, red clover is a blood detoxifyer, milk thistle stimulates the regeneration of new cells in the liver, garlic oxidises heavy metals and basil detoxifies and tones the kidneys. Teeth: It goes without saying that 6-monthly visits to the dentist are essential for good health. Modern detoxification methods of the body are now recommending that all mercury fillings are replaced with metal-free or ceramic fillings. It is believed that mercury is released into the body through chewing and is absorbed by the lungs and the linings of the digestive system and then into the bloodstream. Foods that are good for teeth are high fibre fruit and vegetables as they work like a mouth detergent and neutralise tooth-damaging acids, dairy products that contain calcium to keep teeth strong as well as foods containing vitamins A, C and D, and phosphorous. Oil Pulling: Oil pulling is an ancient Aruveydic method of drawing toxins from the mouth, gums and teeth. It is safe, easy and quick and could be incorporated into ones daily bathroom routine. There is a strong correlation between oral health and overall health and the more toxins one can eliminate from the body on a regular basis, the better. Oil pulling is usually done with sesame oil, but can also be done with sunflower oil or coconut oil. Skin: The skin is the largest organ in the body and is often neglected. It plays a big role in both absorbing toxins and eliminating them. Suggestions for keeping the skin healthy, clean and youthful is dry-brushing every day, and a weekly exfoliation using ingredients such as raw oats, honey, salt and essential oils such as lavender. Both of these methods get rid of the top, dry layer of skin that clogs up the pores. Sauna helps open up the pores. If tee-tree or peppermint oil is used in the sauna, this will help clear the skin and provides a good opportunity to open up the airways for healthy breathing as well. Foods such as sweet potatoes (beta carotene), kiwi fruit (vitamin C), salmon (omega-3 fatty acids), sunflower seeds (vitamin E), tomatoes (lycopane), kidney (zinc) green (flavonols), all excellent sources of antioxidants particularly for the skin. Positive Frame of Mind: Negative feelings release a toxic enzyme cathypain and raises the stress hormone cortisol in the system which compromises the immune system. A positive attitude, through spiritual practices, exercise, play, communing with nature, yoga and meditation amongst others, helps in strengthening the immune system and keeping defences up. Foods that balance cortisol levels are those high in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, halibut, tuna, flax seeds, eggs, and walnuts. Cacao, in the form of dark chocolate, contains theobromine which is a mild stimulant and phenylethylamine which is a mood enhancer. Pharmaceuticals vs Alternative Medicine: There is more and more evidence suggesting that the large pharmaceutical companies are not operating in the best interests of health. Let's face it, if we were all healthy, they would be out of business. As the world continues to consume more disease-causing trans fats, sugar-laden and processed foods, so the pharmaceutical companies are cashing in putting patients on life-long drugs for conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol and heart conditions - and in reality, adding to our toxicity when we take them. The pharmaceutical giants are all gleefully poised to increase profits substantially over the next 20 years. Before agreeing to go onto lifetime prescription drugs, consider alternative modalities such as Aruveyda, Chinese Medicine, Herbalists, Yoga Therapy, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, etc. At least consider an integrative approach where complimentary therapies work together with conventional medicine. Supplements: As the nutritional value of food weakens, the body needs to be given additional supplements. Only recommend supplements and superfoods made from live, whole-food sources are advised because the body can most easily absorb their nutrients, therefore reaping maximum benefits. Fasting: This is the fastest way of eliminating toxins from the body, allowing the digestive process a complete rest. There are several ways to fast, including water-only, fruit-only, raw food-only, juice cleanses, intermittent fasting and so on which can be done either one day per week or in some cases for a week or month at a time. Guidance from a nutritionist or wellness practitioner should be sought for the longer fasts. Tissue Cleansing: This involves cleansing and detoxing the body from a holistic point of view and the process should be guided by a professional and takes place over a period of a week or more. The body is cleansed through all the elimination channels, the colon, skin, lungs, lymph, kidneys and liver. It is a complete fast, with daily colemas, light exercise, massage, supplementation, bulking agents and cleansing herbs. The result is a perfectly balanced system and the person feels fresh, has boundless energy, a clear mind, glowing skin and a general sense of well-being. Written by "}
