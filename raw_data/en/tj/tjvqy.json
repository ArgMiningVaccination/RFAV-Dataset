Disease control and healthcare are true pillars of every modern society. COVID-19 has highlighted the extent of neglect in health systems around the world. However, experts point out that by exposing the weaknesses, the pandemic will undoubtedly become a driver for innovation and improvement in the near future. Many parts come together in providing the big picture of health and the healthcare industry. The pharma, biotech, and medtech industries are probably the most prominent because they are driven especially by research and technology. But there are other essential parts like healthcare providers, payers, care facilities, and many more. And finally, knowing the health situation of a population is essential for understanding industries, markets, and drivers of this sector. Statista offers a wide range of statistics relating to health and the landscape of the healthcare industry. As a basis, we provide an enhanced overview of health and disease data, most prominently described by prevalence, incidence, and mortality figures. Healthcare providers are covered through data on hospitals and the whole healthcare workforce. It is important for us to offer an understanding of health systems and the economics and policies behind them. Our focus is also on the innovative research and manufacturing side of the healthcare sector, mostly represented by the pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical technology industries.
