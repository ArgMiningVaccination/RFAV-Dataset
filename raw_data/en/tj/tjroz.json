As little as 0.2-0.5\u00b0C increase in core body temperature si gnificantly in creases MS symptoms, and significantly reduces the capac ity of people with MS to participate in social, household and work activities, as we ll as increasing their need for pharmaceuticals and medical services. Consequently the us e of air conditioners, with all associated purchase and operating costs, is usually a necessity for people with MS. The Keeping Cool Survey found that 90% of the 21,000 people with MS in Australia are sensitive to heat, and run th eir air conditioners more frequently and for longer periods than most Australians. Nationally, pe ople with MS averaged 1557 hours of air conditioner use annually. In Victoria the annual average was 1508 hours of air c onditioner use. This compares with another Victorian survey of all households which found that average use over the warmer months was 107 hours. This suggests that people with MS might run their air conditioners 14 times as much as the average Australian household. Economic modelling estimated that average costs for people with MS across Australia from September to April for running thei r air conditioners were between $520 and $693 (based on $0.15 and $0.20 per kWh respectively). Not surprisingly costs are higher in the hotter areas ($823-1097 in QLD) and lower in cooler areas ($296-395 in ACT). For 2007 the estimated average cost of cooling for all Australian households was $117-156. This indicates that on averag e people with MS are estimated to spend almost 4.5 times more on keeping cool than the average Australian household. To help minimise these costs and the rela ted carbon emissions, people with MS make minor home modifications to improve the ther mal efficiency of their homes more often than the average Australian household. Fo r example, approximately 10% more people with MS have roof and wall insulation in th eir homes than average Australian households, and are more likely to have external window coverings. However, notwithstanding these measures to keep their costs down, the high costs of keeping cool, combined with (a) rising elec tricity prices, (b) the increasing economic pressures on households genera lly, and (c) the incr easing number of hot days and nights due to climate change, mean it is increasin gly difficult for people with MS on low incomes to keep cool on hot days and nights. In 2007, 52% of Australians with MS had annual incomes below $26,000. From a societal perspective this raises a number of public policy i ssues and challenges: ensuring that community service obligati ons to people who are heat intolerant are met in a way that is effective and equitable; maximising the efficiency of cooling for these households to minimise both the economic and environmental costs; and minimising the impact of catastrophic ev ents such as power-blackouts on this group. These public policy issues and challenges must be resolved in ways that will continue to be effective and equitable in a rapidly changing policy environment which includes: iv MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 the development of nationa l electricity markets; the implementation of smart meters, a nd time-of-use peak pricing tariff structures; rapidly increasing electricity costs now and into the foreseeable future; and more hot days and nights nationally, incr easing the need for medical cooling and the associated increasi ng costs for households. Public policy responses to heat intolerance will be most effec tive and equitable if they are aimed broadly at the wide range of people who are heat intole rant, such as those assisted through the existing concession programs. Additionally, across all of the recommendations outlined below, developi ng and implementing effective responses to the need for people with MS and other heat intolerant people to keep cool involves actions by individuals; families; health, community and professional organisations that work with them; energy retailers and supplie rs; and governments at all levels. For all three recommendations, leadership and support from state and territo ry governments in particular will be essential to ensuring that people with heat intole rant conditions are not further disadvantaged by their condition, and are able to lead full lives. The high levels of electricity use by this group along with their low incomes make them especially vulnerable to any increases in el ectricity costs (whether through smart metering and/or general increased costs). Commun ity service obligatio n schemes must be engineered to make sure they can afford to run their air conditioners enough to keep cool on hot days and nights. Th e three recommendations below cover this and additional critical issues for people with MS and other heat intolerant conditions. Recommendation 1 : Current public policy responses such as electricity rebates are a useful and effective means of assisting people with heat intoleranc e. Experiences in both VIC and WA indicate that rebates are effective for people who are heat intolerant and relatively low cost for government. Rebates must be set at meaningful levels and be regularly adju sted to take into account residential electricity price increases. Rebates/co ncessions need to be developed and implemented in all states and territories. Recommendation 2 : New programs should be developed, and existing programs should be better targeted at people who n eed to keep cool for medical reasons to maximise the efficiency of cooling for th ese households, and to minimise both the economic and environmental costs. This in volves three interrelate d strategies: (a) replacement of older inefficient air condition ers; (b) minor home retrofitting such as ceiling insulation and external window cov erings; (c) advice to the general public; people with heat intolerant conditions and their families; and professionals who work with them on steps they can take to minimise energy consumption and keep cool. Recommendation 3 : It is essential that heat wave and electricity blackout responses by state and local governments, and energy retailers and suppliers are developed for all locations before next summer, and that the needs of people with MS and other heat intolerant conditions are included ro utinely and effectively in these responses. v MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Contents Acknowledgements ii Executive Summary iii Contents v List of Figures vi List of Tables vii 1 Introduction 1 2 Background 3 MS and Heat Intolerance - the Literature 3 Economic Impact of MS 4 Climate 4 Air Conditioner Use in Australia 7 Policy Context and Responses Regarding the Need for Medical Cooling 8 3 Results 11 Survey Method 11 Demographics 11 Problems with Heat 12 Air Conditioners and Their Use 13 Ownership 13 Types of air conditioning 14 Age of air conditioner 15 Size of space cooled 16 When is the air conditioner turned on? 17 Hours of air conditioner use 17 Minor Home Modifications for Thermal Efficiency 20 Estimated Costs of Air Conditioning Use 21 4 Conclusions and Recommendations 23 5 References 26 6 Appendices 29 Appendix A: Keeping Cool Survey 30 Appendix B: Apparent temperatur e gradient map for Australia 32 Appendix C: Additional results and data 33 Appendix D: Economic modelling for air conditioner use costs 39 vi MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 List of Figures Figure 1: Average number of hot days in Australia over 30 years 5 Figure 2: Average number of hot nights in Australia over 30 years 5 Figure 3: Average number of days 30\u00b0C and over for Sydney area by month 7 Figure 4: Average number of hot nights across NSW (1962-2006) 7 Figure 5: Proportion of people experiencing vari ous impacts from hot days/nights 13 Figure 6: Type of air conditioner 15 Figure 7: Comparison of types of air conditioning between Keeping Cool and ABS 2005 survey 15 Figure 8: The age of refrigerated/reverse-c ycle air conditioners 16 Figure 9: Size of space cooled 16 Figure 10: Outside air temperature at which air conditioners are turned on 17 Figure 11: Average total hours of air conditioner use per household September to April 18 Figure 12: Average proportion of people us ing their air conditioners for different time periods every 24hrs from September to April 19 Figure 13: Number of months of air conditioner use by all Austra lians by state 19 Figure C1: Age of air conditioners by state/territory 34 Figure C2: Average proportion of people usi ng their air conditioners for different time periods every 24hrs for September-October 37 Figure C3: Average proportion of people usi ng their air conditioners for different time periods every 24hrs for November-December 37 Figure C4: Average proportion of people usi ng their air conditioners for different time periods every 24hrs for January-February 38 Figure C5: Proportion of people using their air conditioners for different time periods every 24hrs for March-April 38 vii MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 List of Tables Table 1: Average annual maximum apparent temperature for states/territories and capital cities 6 Table 2: Number of survey participants by state and territory 12 Table 3: Reasons given for not using an air conditioner 14 Table 4: Percentage of people with minor home modifica tions 20 Table 5: Estimated average household costs of air condit ioner use by people with MS from September to April (excluding evaporative and ducted air conditioning) 22 Table 6: Estimated cooling energy use and cost by state/territory in 2007 for all Australian households 22 Table C1: Statistical test results examin ing response differences between those who may and may not be concession eligible 33 Table C2: What happens to you when you get too hot?

As little as 0.2-0.5\u00b0C increase in core body temperature creat es an increase in MS symptoms for people with MS (Guthrie & Ne lson 1995). 'Heat worsens an d cooling improves negative symptoms of multiple sclerosis, sometim es dramatically so' (Baker 2002: p. 1779). As a consequence of their heat intoleran ce, people with MS in Australia use air conditioners extensively on hot days and nights as a medical necessity - not as a luxury. There are approximately 21,000 people with MS in Australia (Covance & Menzies Research Institute Tasmania 2011). MS is a chronic, progressive and incurable disease that attacks the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Most people with MS are of working age and three-quarters are wome n (Covance & Menzies Research Institute Tasmania 2011). For people with MS the costs of running thei r air conditioners are an additional disease- related expense that must be met on top of other out-of-pocket diseas e-related expenses. All of these expenses must be met from lo wer than Australian average incomes that people with MS earn. These out-of-pocket co sts, combined with (a) rapidly rising electricity costs, (b) increasing economic pressures on households generally, and (c) the increasing number of hot days and nights due to climate change, mean that it is more and more difficult for people with MS on low incomes to keep cool on hot days and nights. Given that people with MS must run their ai r conditioners to minimise their symptoms during hot weather, environmental costs re garding carbon emissions are also important and relate particularly to air conditioner e fficiency, the thermal efficiency of the space being cooled and how air conditioners are used. Notwithstanding the importance of keepi ng cool for people with MS, no previous research could be found in the literature that has explored and described the use of air conditioners by people with MS acr oss Australia, nor in other countries. This is why the Keeping Cool Survey was conducted. Prior to developing the survey, informal disc ussions with people with MS generated a range of remarks in relation to what happens to them when they ge t too hot, such as: 'Once I get hot, I hit the wall and all I can do is go to bed, often for 18 hours at a time because I am so exhausted I can' t even think or do anything else.' 'Last time it was hot my vision was blurred a nd I could hardly see anything. I just had to sit at home in my one room with an air conditioner and try and get cool. It took a few days for the tiredness and my eyes to improve.' 'It's really hard to look after my thr ee kids when it's hot, I can't keep up.' The Keeping Cool Survey was sent to 3,150 people with MS in September 2008. By February 2009 we had received 2,385 responses, for a response rate of 76%. See Appendix 1 for a copy of the surv ey. Key issues covered included: What happens when a person with MS gets too hot Use of air conditioning to keep cool Outside air temperature when air conditioner is turned on 2 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Type of air conditioner Age of air conditioner Hours of use Minor home modifications re lated to keeping cool The survey was relatively quick and efficien t to undertake as it was done within the framework of the Australian Multiple Scle rosis Longitudinal Study (AMSLS) which has been running since 2000, and has enrolled a large cohort of Australians with MS for interdisciplinary research relevant to improving their situation (see http://www.msaustralia.org.au/msra/researc h/ms-life-study.php). The Keeping Cool Survey was sent to all consenting participants of the AMSLS, which eliminated the need for special recruitment and maximised response rates. The AMSLS project is approved by the ACT Health Human Research Ethics Committee, an independent National Health and Medi cal Research Council- constituted human research ethics committee. The Keeping C ool survey was sent out under the general AMSLS project approval. There was an overlap of 1,578 respondents (6 6%) to both the Keepi ng Cool Survey and the Economic Surveys (conducted in 2003 and 2007 as part of the AMSLS). This enabled us to undertake additional analysis regarding air conditioning use by people with MS who are likely to be eligible for a conce ssion or rebate for their electricity bills. The remainder of the report is presente d in three sections: Background, Results, and Conclusions and Recommendations. 3 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 2 Background MS and Heat Intolerance - the Literature Heat intolerance has been known to be a sign ificant issue for peopl e with MS since the late 19th century. Guthrie and Nelson's (1995) critical review of the influence of temperature changes on MS trace s the scientific a nd medical understanding of the issue from Uhthoff's work in 1890 to more recent work. Two key points emerge from their review: (a) internationally MS symptoms increase in about 80% of people with MS when they get too warm, and (b) the exact physio logical cause cannot be fully explained through the usual hypothesis that heat blocks the nerve conduction of already damaged (demyelinated) axons of nerve cells. Knowledge of the impact of heat on people with MS resulted in the use of hot bath tests from the 1960s to 1980s to help diagnose MS. This was discontinued because it was not an accurate enough diagnostic test (better te sts became available) and 'because it sometimes resulted in permanent neurological deficits in MS patient s' (Guthrie & Nelson 1995: p. 1). Heat is generally associated with an increas e in MS symptoms such as blurred vision, extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, pain, trem ors, memory problems, loss of balance, bladder and bowel problems, numbness and ti ngling, decreases in c ognitive function, and in severe instances partial or complete pa ralysis (Guthrie & Nels on 1995; Simmons et al 2001; Lerdal et al 2007). Also, while it is rare, there ar e reports of deaths from heat in people with MS. Guthrie (1951, cited in Guthrie and Nels on 1995) reported two deaths from heat therapy (electro pyrexia) used in attempts to improve MS sy mptoms. Two more re cent reports include a death at home in a bath tub attributed to heat and MS (Kohlmeier, Di Maio & Kagan- Hallet 2000), and a death from sunbathing and MS (Henke, Cohle & Cottingham 2000). Paradoxically, while exposure to the cold is generally helpful and reduces MS symptoms (NASA/MS Cooling Study Group 2003; Petril li et al 2004; Meyer-Heim 2007), some people with MS (5-30%) have a worsening of symptoms in the cold (Simmons et al 2001; Visscher et al 1983). Heat intolerance has significant economic and quality of life impacts in the day-to-day lives of people with MS and their fam ilies (De Judicibus & McCabe 2007). Also, managing heat-related problems is a key compon ent in ensuring that people with MS are able to retain employme nt (Johnson & Fraser 2005). These findings are reinforced by an internet epidemiological survey of 2,500 responders with MS which found that exposure to high temperatures was one of the three most commonly cited adverse factors in relation to their MS symptoms (stress and insufficient sleep were the other two). Also, hot baths and infections , both of which increase body temperature, tied as the fourth most cite d adverse factors (Simmons et al 2001). It is generally believed that symptoms usually return to their baseline status when the body temperature returns to normal. However, largely as a result of reports regarding the hot bath test, Guthrie and Nelson (1995) a nd others (see for example Edlich 2004) note that on rare occasions the increase in symptoms is not reversible. Additionally, Visscher et al (1983: 56) 'speculate...tha t the more frequent exposure to heat in the Los Angeles area patients may accelerate the pathologic pro cess resulting in the earlier onset and 4 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 possibly more rapid course [of MS] observed in Los Angeles area patients' when compared to those in the cooler climate of King-Pierce counties in Washington state. In a meta-analysis of six reports on seasonal variations in MS onsets and exacerbations a statistically significant differe nce was found with the highest frequencies in spring and the lowest in winter (Ya-Ping et al 2000). In their study of seasonal variations in Japan, Ogawa et al (2003) found that there were more frequent exacerbations in the warmest months, and the coldest. This was attribut ed to the probable impact of increased viral infections in cold months and wa rmer weather in spring and summer. In contrast, Tataru et al (2006) unexpectedly found no increase in MS relapses during the 2003 heat wave in France. They did not e however that one of several possible explanations for this was that people with MS are well aware of the problems heat causes them, and that they take appropria te precautions during hot weather. While it is clear that heat exacerbates MS sy mptoms, results from epidemiological studies of patterns in exacerbations in relation to seasonal climate variations are confounded by other sources of exacerbations (s uch as viral infections), and the modifying behaviours of people with MS who routinely take precautions to minimise their exposure to heat on hot days and nights whenever possible. Economic Impact of MS There are significant costs associated with having MS. Covance & Menzies Research Institute Tasmania (2011) found that the aver age annual costs in 2010 to people with MS and their families in Australia was $10,554 ($3,697 out-of-pocket and $6,857 for informal care). Additionally, indirect costs such as lost income are high, averaging over $23,000 annually. Direct and indirect costs increase w ith severity of MS. All of this makes the additional cost of running an air conditioner difficult for most people with MS, and even more so for those on low incomes. These very significant economic costs are bor ne by people with MS and their families across the financial spectrum. However, like other people in the community with chronic illnesses, overall people with MS have lower income levels than the general community. Although 87% of people with MS are of work ing age, and most people with MS are employed when first diagnosed, 80% are not employed 10 years after diagnosis (Access Economics 2005). One result of this is that 52% of Australians with MS have annual incomes below $26,000 (Australian MS Longitudinal Study, unpublished data). Consequently, although many people with MS are employed, ultimately most end up on fixed incomes provided through part and full pe nsions. This combination of low incomes and the high economic costs of MS means that concessions such as energy rebates are often a critical financial factor in their daily lives. Climate Air conditioner use by people with MS in Austra lia is a direct res ponse to day-to-day weather. As the number of hot days and night s increases, the use of electricity increases for people with MS in their e fforts to keep cool, pushing up costs to a group already under considerable economic pressure. One of the difficulties of examining climatic impacts on the use of air conditioners by people with MS is the wide va riability of the weather across Australia. Additionally, air 5 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 temperature data has significant limitations b ecause moderate to high levels of humidity, coupled with hot days and nights, make it more difficult for people to keep cool. Summary climate data is presented below to gi ve an overview of some of the key issues. The first two graphs (Figures 1 and 2) pres ent national averages fo r the annual number of hot days (35\u00b0C and over) and hot nights ( 20\u00b0C and over) for the last 50 years. These demonstrate a clear trend towards more hot days and nights. Significantly, 35\u00b0C is a very high temperatur e for most people with MS. The survey results found that on average people with MS turn on th eir air conditioner when the outside temperature reaches 29\u00b0C, with many tu rning it on well before then. (see Results). Figure 1: Average number of hot days in Australia over 30 years Source : http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/silo/r eg/cli_chg/extreme_timeseries.cgi Figure 2: Average number of hot nights in Australia over 30 years Source : http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/silo/r eg/cli_chg/extreme_timeseries.cgi 6 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Table 1 presents the apparent temperature (AT) data averaged over 30 years (from 1976- 2005) for states/territories and capital cities. AT is an adjustment to the ambient air temperature based on the level of humidity. The adjustments made to air temperature to take into account the impact of humidity use absolute humidity with a dewpoint of 14\u00b0C as the reference point (with slight adjust ments depending on the temperature). If the humidity is higher than the refe rence point then the AT is high er than the air temperature, and if the humidity is lower than the reference point, then the AT is lower than the air temperature. Table 1: Average annual maximum apparent temperat ure for states/territories and capital cities State/territory apparent temperature (Celsius) Capital city apparent temperature (Celsius) NT 16.5\u00b0 Source : data was compiled for MS Australia by the Bureau of Meteorology in 2008, 30 year averages from 1976-2005. Table 1 is ordered from highest to lowest AT, and capital cities are included as state/territory averages may misrepresent im pacts on populations. That is, as populations are not equally distributed throughout each state /territory, data for capital cities may be a better representation of actual impacts on the population. See Appendix B for a gradient map of AT across Australia. As useful as the above graphs and table ar e to get an overview of climate data, such broad-brush figures obscure the wide variations across seasons and across locations. It is also difficult to translate these broader figures into what this means in relation to hot days and hot nights that would adve rsely affect someone with MS. As NSW represents an approximate mid-point for AT across the states/territories and capital cities, additional figures from Sydne y and NSW are presented below to give an indication of these variations across locations and over time. On average there are 28 days each year that are 30\u00b0C or higher in the Sydney area (see Figures 3). There is also considerable variation across Sydney area locations. For example, Observation Hill averages only 15 da ys at 30\u00b0C and over annually, in contrast to Bankstown which has 42. 7 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Figure 3: Average number of days 30\u00b0C and over for Sydney area by month 01234567 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov DecNumber of Days Source : Australian Bureau of Meteorology: http ://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/; based on averaged data across 5 Sydney area sites: Observ ations Hill, Bankstown, Parramatta, Airport, and there are wide varia tions across NSW locations generally. Figure 4 summarises differences in hot nights (20\u00b0 C or greater) between 1962 and 2006. There are more than twice as many hot nights in the north-east of NSW than in Sydney, and fewer still in the mountains.

Hot nights have a minimum temperature of 20\u00b0C or higher. Air Conditioner Use in Australia There have been several Australian reports in recent years regarding air conditioners, climate and/or energy use, such as work by de Dear and Hart (2002) based on NSW data and Roy Morgan Research (2008) on a Victor ian survey. One of the most important 8 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 works is a national survey by the Aust ralian Bureau of Statistics in 2005: Environmental Issues: People's Views and Practices . The ABS report includes a significant section on Australian air conditioner ownership and use patterns, as well as other relevant mate rial on household construc tion as it relates to thermal efficiency and energy use generally. Results from the ABS survey are used in parts of the results section of this report as a national benchmark against which results from the Keeping Cool Survey are compared. The most comprehensive national estimates a nd projections for energy use in relation to household cooling and air conditioner use are in Energy Use in the Australian Residential Sector 1986-2020 (Dept of the Environment, Water, He ritage and the Arts 2008). In this report electricity for space cooling nationally is estimated at 4% of average household energy use (p. 25). Data from this report is used in the results section to compare costs for MS households to households across Australia. In 2007 the Victorian Utility Consumpti on Household Survey was conducted (Roy Morgan Research 2008) involvi ng a stratified random sample of 2,061 households. This survey repeated similar surveys done in 2001 and 1996. The number of people in the sample that were eligible for the then MS Summer Concession was too small (n = 5) for any separate analysis of th eir usage patterns to be valid, but results related to air conditioner ownership and use are reported as Victorian household benchmarks in the results section. Policy Context and Responses Regard ing the Need for Medical Cooling The major issues shaping public policy developm ents in relation to residential electricity include the development of national electric ity markets, the implementation of smart meters, rapidly increasing electricity costs a nd related environmental measures to reduce demand and carbon emissions. Nationally electricity prices have risen 31% above the cons umer price index since 1990 (and over 80% for Melbourne in that same time, Dufty 2009), and this trend is accelerating. For example the Independent Pr icing and Regulatory Tribunal in NSW has proposed price increases for the next year of between 18.5% and 21.5% (IPART 2009). Major drivers of these increasing costs are: risi ng fuel costs; increas ing infrastructure and maintenance costs; increased demand; new construction costs; and carbon taxes. Smart meters are gradually being introduced in many parts of Australia. Smart meters are being strongly promoted as means of in creasing efficiency, reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and improving the capac ity of consumers to self-manage their electricity use through better information. Cost s of installing smart meters will be passed on to consumers, and consideration should be given to exempting low income households from this additional expense. Smart meters enable: consumption to be measured and charged in small time increments such as half- hours; differential pricing during peak (and low) consumption times (time-of-use pricing); back-to-base remote monitoring and cont rol (e.g. electricity can be switched on/off remotely by a retailer); and 9 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 possibility of add-ons such as in-home monitoring of electricity consumption. Differential pricing (time-of-use pricing) is of particular concern as peak hours (the highest cost period for electri city under time-of-use tariff structures) are often during working hours when many people with MS ar e at home and needi ng to use their air conditioners. Peak pricing periods are also es pecially sensitive to peak demand times that often relate directly to the hottest times of th e day in warm weather. This pricing regime will particularly disadvantage people with a medical need to keep cool who are not at work, and who will have to pay maximum prices out of low fixed incomes. The Ministerial Council on Energy (2008b) has co mmitted to a review regarding impacts on consumer protection and safety regulation to be completed by May 2009, and this 'may consider consumer pricing...treat ment of vulnerable consumers' and other relevant issues. In one of the major reports related to the cos t/benefits of smart metering it was noted that 'the relatively low benefits associated w ith demand response (compared to business efficiencies) from a smart meter rollout means that providing for vulnerable customers to be excluded from TOU [time-of-use] and CPP [critical peak pricing] tariffs (where they wish to be) would not materially impact th e overall cost benefit results' (NERA 2008a: p. xxiii, see note 30). Studies of residential househol d electricity consumption patter ns demonstrate that overall demand drops when smart meters are used to implement time-of-use tariff structures that charge substantially higher prices du ring peak demand periods (NERA Economic Consulting 2008a). While such structures may be a good th ing for many households and for the environment, people with MS (and othe r heat intolerant condi tions) are likely to find that this creates a serious financial burden that they are un able to meet, especially as their air conditioner use and cost is approxima tely ten times higher than that of average Australian households (see Results). The Ministerial Council on Energy (2008a: p. 3) , in its response to the Council of Australian Governments' request for a nationa l review of community service obligations and advice on best pr actice, observed that: Energy is an essential service that plays an important role in maintaining Australians' living standards. As such it is important that consumers should have access to a supply of energy. In order to facilitate the provision of energy to vulnerable customers, Governments can crea te a range of CSOs [community service obligations] to assist those in need. The MCE considers that energy CSOs are se rvices that Governme nts require energy businesses to provide to sections of th e community to fulfil Government social policy objectives. Typical energy CSOs include rebates for pensioners and concessions for people on life support but do not include income support or other payments made directly by Government to consumers. Governments can ensure the delivery of energy CSOs by a range of mechanisms. Some of the most common mechanisms ar e subsidies to retailers for providing non- commercial services and concessions on bills for classes of consumers to assist them to pay energy bills. State and Territory governments are res ponsible for delivering energy CSOs. When the survey was conducted, only WA and VIC provided concessions to people with a medical need to keep cool. 10 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 The WA government implemented a Thermo regulatory Dysfunction Subsidy Scheme in January 2007. The projected annual budge t is $500,000 to provide 1,500 people with $335 annually ($423 from July 2009) for assistan ce with heating and cooling costs as a result of a medical condition, and paid in monthly instalments. The subsidy is administered by the Office of State Revenue which also administers the Life Support Equipment Energy Subsidy. To be eligible the person suffering thermoregulatory dysfunction must be: certified by their treating physician as suffering clinical thermoregulatory dysfunction, as a resu lt of their condition, that is of such severity that without artificial control of th eir immediate physical envi ronment they would suffer serious adverse consequences a nd further medical complications. in possession of a valid means-tested c oncession card issued by either Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs, being either a: Pensioner Concession Card; Health Care Card; or Health Care Interim Voucher. The VIC Medical Cooling Concession (previously known as the MS Summer Concession) was implemented approximately 10 years ago, and has provided a discount of 17.5% on summer (Dec, Jan and Feb) electricity bills for those elig ible. In July 2008, the concession was expanded to 6 months of coverage (Nov-April), and the annual budget commitment was increased from $102,500 in 2007-08 to $2.4M over 5 years ($625,000 annual average). To be eligible applicants for the VIC c oncession, as with the WA scheme, must be assessed by a medical practitione r as having a significant heat intolerance problem. They must also hold a Pensioner Concession Card, H ealth Care Card or Veterans' Affairs Gold Card. In 2007-08 the VIC concession assisted 4,313 households. It is estimated that approximately 1,500-1,800 of these were people w ith MS. Other conditions receiving the concession include: Cerebral Palsy Chronic Fatigue Fibromyalgia Lymph oedema Motor Neurone Disease Muscular Dystrophy Parkinson's Disease Syndrome Quadriplegia Scleroderma Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Note that since the original report was written in 2008, as of January 2012 all mainland states (NSW, SA, QLD, VIC and WA) now have in place medical cooling or medical energy concessions for people with a medical need to keep cool (and warm) on low incomes. The original survey results were used extensively in campaigns run by MS Australia in partnership with other organisations in NSW, QLD and SA. Campaigns are underway in TAS and ACT at this time. 11 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 3 Results Survey Method The Keeping Cool Survey was sent to 3,150 people with MS in September 2008. By February 2009 we had received 2,385 responses, for a response rate of 76%. See Appendix A for a copy of the survey. There was an overlap of 1,578 respondents (6 6%) across the Keepi ng Cool Survey and the two Economic Surveys (conducted in 2003 and 2007 as part of the AMSLS). This enabled us to undertake additional analysis regarding air conditioning use by people with MS who are likely to be eligible for a concessi on or rebate in relation to their electricity use for keeping cool. For the 1,578 participants for whom economic data was available, additional analysis was done comparing responses on the Keeping Cool Survey of those who would probably be 'concession eligible' (those on Aged Pensi ons, Disability Support Pensions, Dept of Veterans Affairs benefits and/or Healthcare Card Holders) and those who were not. See Table C1 in Appendix C for details. Given the lack of differences in responses be tween those who are likely to be concession eligible and those who are not, results for the whole sample are presented below. This lack of difference is itself a major research finding. It was expect ed that those who are concession eligible would be less able to afford the ownership and operation of air conditioners and have lower rates of air condit ioner ownership and use. But this is not the case. Likely explanations would a ppear to reside in three in terrelated possibilities: (a) the medical need to keep cool is a very high priority for people with MS, so the impact of different income levels on ow nership and use of air conditioners is minimal; (b) even for those people with MS who ar e relatively better off financially, the overall economic impact of MS may operate to encourage them to use their air conditioners only when absolutely necessary; and (c) price signals combined with incr easing awareness and concern about environmental costs moderate usage patterns equally across both groups. Following a brief overview of the survey par ticipants' demographics, results are reported in summary form. In general national results are reported, although for some key issues/questions, state and terr itory level results are presente d. Appendix C contains more detailed results for some survey questions. Results from the Northern Territory are not reported as the number of participants was too small to be meaningful or valid. Throughout the results section, when state level data is reported the order of the states/territories from top to bottom is the rank order of their respective maximum apparent temperature (s ee Table 1 above). Demographics The demographic profile of this study consists of 79.0% female. Overall, the mean age of the participants was 52 year s, with a range of 25-83 year s. This gender and age distribution approximates that of the Au stralian MS population: 74% female, and prevalence rates peak between the ag es of 40 and 59 (Access Economics 2005). 12 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Nationally approximately 36% of those surveyed are likely to be eligible for a concession or rebate on their electricity bills. This estimate assumes that eligibility for the concession/rebate will include people with MS who are heat intolerant, and who have Disability Pension, Aged Pension, receiving benefits from Department of Veterans' Affairs, and/or a Healthcare Card. Of t hose remaining, approximately 54% would not be in receipt of one of these be nefits and 10% do not have a pr oblem with the heat. As a consequence of the lack of differences in Keeping Cool Survey responses between those are and those that are not likely to be eligib le for a medical cooling concession or rebate (see Table C1 in Appendix C), the results pr esented below can be interpreted as being equally applicable to both groups, an d to people with MS generally. The proportion of survey participants in each state and territory (Table 1) broadly corresponds to numbers of people with MS in each area, as judged from the membership numbers of MS societies in Australia. Th ere are very few people with MS in the NT, probably because of the heat, but also b ecause the disease ha s a known 'latitudinal gradient' of occurrence, with a greater incide nce and prevalence away from the equator. For instance, the likelihood of being diagnos ed with MS is 7 times more likely in Tasmania than it is in Queensland (Richert 200 9). Reasons for the latitudinal gradient are currently being investigated, w ith exposure to ultraviolet light and Vitamin D levels as possible causal factors (van der Mei et al 2007). Table 2: Number of survey participants by state and territory State Number of Participants Percentage NT 4 0% QLD 317 13% WA 234 5% Australia 2385 100% Problems with Heat Only 10% of the survey participants stated th at they did not have a problem with heat: 'I cope just fine'. Figure 5 se ts out the proportion of survey participants who experience a wide range of different health and lifestyle impacts as a c onsequence of hot days and hot nights. The frequency with which people reported these problems did vary across states/territories, and this is reported in more detail in Table C2 in Appendix C. 13 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Figure 5: Proportion of people experiencing various impacts from hot days/nights Figure 5 emphasises that the most common pr oblem people with MS experience when they get too hot is an extreme form of fati gue, with most experiencing a general increase in their other MS symptoms as well. A dditionally approximately half find the heat renders them unable to partic ipate in social activities, nor mal household duties and in the workforce. While almost 10% require more me dications, or a visit to a doctor or other health professional, 3% report having been hos pitalised as a conseque nce of the impact of heat on their MS symptoms. While these are relatively small proportions over all in relation to needing some form of medical care, it does serve to highlight the seri ousness of this issue for people with MS. The small proportions here are also probably a sign of how well and how much effort and attention people with MS put into managing thei r exposure to heat, and is an indication of what can happen if they cannot keep cool enough. Air Conditioners and Their Use This section incorporates material regard ing a number of key issues: types of air conditioners used; their age; the size of the space cooled; and the hours of operation across the year. It is particularly important information in relation to understanding how people with MS use air conditioning at home to keep cool and minimise their MS symptoms. Additionally, some of this information was later extrapolated into a model to estimate the costs incurred in order to keep cool. Ownership Of the survey participants, 82% were using ai r conditioner to keep cool, with a range of 80-90% (except TAS where 53% were using air c onditioners). This is a high level of air 14 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 conditioner use relative to the national population. In 2005 60% of all households nationally had an air conditioner (ABS 2005: p. 50). Of the 431 (18%) participants who were not using an air conditioner, 391 indicated a reason for this as outlined in Table 3. Table 3: Reasons given for not using an air conditioner No problem with hot weathe r Cannot afford an air conditione r Cannot afford the electricity Broken air conditione r Number 127 228 25 11 Percentage of those not using an air conditioner (n=431) 32% 58% 6% 1% 0% For the small number of people who could 'not afford the electricity' it is important to note that many people would opt to reduce air conditioner use because of operating costs, rather than to not use it at all. Conse quently those who cannot use it at all due to operating costs are probably in particularly difficult fina ncial circumstances. Types of air conditioning Figure 6 describes the different types of air conditioners us ed. The percentages exceed 100% because a small number of people had more than one type of air conditioner. Nationally approximately 56% were split systems, 21% were ducted, 19% were evaporative, and 14% had window units. It should be noted that this question was ambiguous, as 'ducted' can be ei ther evaporative or refriger ated/reverse-cycle. Across the general population in Victoria evaporat ive air conditioners account for 5 times as many ducted systems as refrigerated/reverse-c ycle air conditioners (Roy Morgan 2008: p. 117). Although evaporative air conditioners are much less expensive to operate (approximately one-eighth the cost of reverse- cycle air conditioners for ducted systems), in humid climates evaporative air conditioners are ineffective. Comparative data are available on types of air conditioners across states and territories for households nationally (ABS 2005) . Figure 7 compares air conditioner types (evaporative and refrigerated/reverse cy cle) between the Keeping Cool Survey and the ABS 2005 survey. Proportions between the two groups are remarkably similar across states and territories, with the exception of the ACT. To create comparable data, the Keeping Cool Survey categories of split system and window units were combined to create 'refrigerated/reverse cycle', a nd ducted systems are not incorp orated (as noted above they could be either evaporative or refrigerated). So, although ownership of air conditioners is higher for people with MS as noted above, the t ype of air conditioners used is similar to national trends for different locations. 15 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Figure 6: Type of air conditioner Figure 7: Comparison of types of air conditioning between Keeping Cool and ABS 2005 survey Age of air conditioner The age of a refrigerated/reverse -cycle air conditioner is an indicator of its efficiency. If it is more than 3 years old, it is very unlikel y to have inverter t echnology which increases cooling efficiency between 20 and 25%. Sim ilarly, air conditioners that are 10 or more years old are likely to be even less efficient as a consequence of le ss efficient designs and the increased likelihood of requi ring maintenance and/or repairs to optimise efficiency. Figure 8 describes the national distribution of the age of re frigerated/reverse-cycle air conditioners from the survey. More detailed st ate and territory data is available in Figure C1 and Table C3 in Appendix C. 16 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Figure 8: The age of refrigerated/reverse-cycle air conditioners Size of space cooled Another critical element in relation to air cond itioner use (and energy consumption and cost) is the size of the space being cooled. Figure 9 summarises the data across states and territories. Figure 9: Size of space cooled When these figures are averaged nationally, ther e is an almost perfec tly even distribution across the three categories: 34% (1 room), 33% (2 rooms) and 33% (4 or more rooms). As can be seen in the Figure 9 states/territori es were similar, except that WA had more '4 or more rooms' (42%) and fewer '1 room' Tasmania had with 23% and 44% respectively. No survey participan ts stated that they cooled 3 rooms. That two-thirds of respondents were only cooli ng one or two rooms is probably another indication of the difficulties many of them have in paying for the cost of keeping cool. 17 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 When is the air conditioner turned on? Figure 10 summarises the results regarding the external air temperature at which people with MS turn on their air conditioners. One of the things that made responses to this question possible is that most people with MS who are heat sensitive can tell you the precise air temperature point at which their symptoms increase, although this does vary in some areas with highly variable humidity leve ls (hence the use of ranges rather than exact temperature points). Nationally the average temperature at whic h people with MS turned on their air conditioners was 29.2\u00b0C, with many turning on th eir air conditioner at lower temperatures (see Figure 10). The lowest average temperat ure when air conditions were turned on was observed in TAS with 26.8\u00b0C, while the highe st was observed in SA and WA, 30.9\u00b0C and 30.4\u00b0C respectively. Additional information about the differences between states/territories is in Table C4 in Appendix C. Figure 10: Outside air temperature at which air conditioners are turned on Hours of air conditioner use Finally, the other major determinant of energy us e and cost in relation to keeping cool is the number of hours that people with MS operate their air conditioners. In order to keep the survey form short and maximise response rates, usage data were collected in two- month increments (see Figure 11). Also, alt hough data was collected for 12 months, only the 8 months of warmer weather and air cond itioner use are reported here. As with all surveys requesting remembered or 'historical' information, it is possible that some recall bias may be present in the data, and this po ssibility should be take n into account when interpreting the results on air-conditioner usage. Figure 11 illustrates the changing hours of air conditioner use across the warm months and between states and territories. The aver age total hours of use nationally for people with MS was 1,557. The apparently high le vels of use in November-December and March-April relative to January-February is an indication that it does not need to be extremely hot for many people with MS to requi re the use of air conditioning (see Figure 10). 18 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Figure 11: Average total hours of air conditioner use per household for September to April Note : this is an imputed average as it is derived usi ng the mid-points from the 13-18hrs=15. 5; 19-24hrs=21.5. When reading 11 (as with all other figures in this secti on of the report), it is useful to remember that the order of th e states/territories from right to left is in the rank order of their respective maximum AT. More deta iled information rega rding hours of air conditioner use for each state/territory can be found in Figures C2-C5 in Appendix C. In relation to Figure 11, other research in VIC has found that average total number of hours air conditioners were used in the warmer months was 107 hours (Roy Morgan Research 2008: p. ix). This data wa s based on recall and the completion of a questionnaire - similar to the Keeping Cool Survey. While it is unclear what is meant by 'warme r months' in the Roy Morgan Research, the imputed total for average VIC household usag e for someone with MS in the Keeping Cool Survey was 1,508 hours from September to April. Given the similarity in methods and the similar possibility of recall bias, the difference in the results between the two surveys is striking: in VIC people with MS average 1,508 hours compared to average household use of 107 hours. This suggests that people with MS have th eir air conditioners on almost 14.5 times as much as average households. Figure 12 illustrates the hours of air conditioner use during the months from September to April from the Keeping Cool Survey. The diffe rent levels of usage in the warmer months are more apparent here than in Figure 11. It is particularly notable that a small number of households appear to use their air conditione rs continuously across this 8-month period. These are likely to be households living in the hottest areas of the country, or people whose threshold for heat is particularly low. 19 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Figure 12: Average proportion of people using their ai r conditioners for different time periods every 24hrs from September to April National data on the number of months in which people used their air conditioners is another useful reference point for comparisons between peop le with MS and the general population. Figure 13 presents data from a 2005 ABS survey, and the relatively large proportion of people using their air conditioners for less than 3 months or less (ranging from 48% in WA to 90% in Tasmania) is a re markable contrast to the patterns seen above for people with MS. Figure 13: Number of months of air conditioner use by all Australians by state Source : ABS 2005, Table 4.14 20 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Minor Home Modifications for Thermal Efficiency Participants were also asked to identify minor home modificati ons (including existing construction elements) that related to their homes' thermal efficiency. For example, ceiling/roof insulation can reduce energy cons umption up to 45% in summer and winter (ABS 2005). Table 4 describes the results from the Keeping Cool Survey for people with MS, and data in brackets are general Aust ralian household figures from the 2005 ABS survey. Table 4: Percentage of people with minor home modifications State External window blinds, awnings, etc Internal window blinds, drapes, etc Roof insulation Roof vents Wall insulation QLD 31 78 58 (41)* 27 15 (11)* WA 30 84 75 (65) 17 11 (6) SA 52 83 77 (77) 19 37 (27) NSW 38 80 67 (53) 26 25 (18) VIC 48 79 72 (71) 12 32 (29) ACT 40 86 86 (78) 7 53 (34) TAS 17 86 77 (73) 6 38 (25) Australia^ 40 80 70 (59) 19 27 (19) *Source : ABS 2005, Tables 2.11 & 2.14. ^Australian figures here, as throughout the report unless otherwise noted, exclude Northern Territory data. As can be inferred from the national ABS figur es in brackets for r oof and wall insulation, in many instances households that include a person with MS have taken extra steps to improve the thermal efficiency of their hom es relative to the general population. Additionally it appears that the variations between states a nd territories for the Keeping Cool Survey approximate national trends. Also, although state-level deta ils are not reported, the AB S survey results found that 'outside awnings and/or shutters were the pr incipal form of window protection applied in over 30% of dwellings in Australia, mainly in SA (43% of dwellings) and VIC (38% of dwellings)' (ABS 2005: p. 12). Again at 52% for SA and 48% for VIC, people with MS exceed the national trends in their efforts to keep cool. This is vital information in relation to focu sing programs in the future to improve thermal efficiency in these homes. The low levels of roof insulation in QLD, and to a lesser extent in NSW, and the limited use of wall insulation and roof vents overall are particularly notable, but increases in efficiency could be increased ac ross the spectrum. 21 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Estimated Costs of Air Conditioning Use An economic model for estimating costs of air conditioner use by people with MS was developed that utilised the survey results. Results from the modelling are presented in Table 5. In brief, the m odelling included: (a) exclusion of evaporative and ducte d systems from the cost model; (b) average household hours of use; (c) costs were adjusted for efficiency through: (i) age of the air conditioner as a pr oxy for efficiency star ratings, and (ii) adjusting cooling load resulting from climate vari ation across states (using average maximum apparent temperature data); (d) costs were calculated across a range of prices ($0.15/kWh to $0.30kWh) to reflect the range of residential energy pr ices across Australia now and in the enar future. Note that this does not includ e fixed-costs for electricity supply, which are also increasing rapidly across the country to replace ageing electricity infrastructure and other fixed costs (see Appendix D for more cost modelling details). Additionally, sensitivity analysis was undert aken on the economic modelling with respect to five variables: (a) the number of user s in each response category; (b) the midpoints used to impute hours of air conditioner usage fr om survey responses; (c ) hourly costs with efficiency weightings; (d) electricity prices across re gions and nationally; and (e) utilisation of average maximum apparent te mperature to take into account climatic variables given that hourly costs with efficien cy weightings were ba sed on Victoria. The sensitivity analysis indicated that, in general, the modelli ng is highly robust with the results being relatively insensitive to variations in factors (a)-(e). This was demonstrated by the narrowness of the 95% confidence intervals. For example, the sensitivity analysis indicat ed that the least robust results were for variations in the midpoints used to imput e hours of air conditioner usage (factor (a) above). For example, the results indicated th at the mean annual estimated cooling cost is $296 for MS households in the ACT with a standard deviation of $34, giving a 95% confidence interval of $228-$364. This is a very narrow confidence interval as indicated by the rather small ratio of th e standard deviation to the m ean (11.5%). The confidence intervals for factors (b)-(e) were even narrower than those for factor (a). In Table 5 it is also useful to observe the ve ry significant impact that as little as a $0.05 difference in price per kWh can make to overall co sts. This is of pa rticular concern given rising electricity costs generally and the impe nding introduction of smart meters and time- of-use peak pricing tariff st ructures in many jurisdictions (see Background section). Table 6 provides estimated cooling costs for all Australian househol ds 2007 (Dept of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008), and is a useful comparison point in relation to people with MS. Note that since the original report was completed in 2009, electricity costs have risen substantially in most areas, with an averag e national increase of about 10% annually. 22 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Table 5: Estimated average household costs of air conditioner use by people with MS from September to April (excluding eva porative and ducted air conditioning) State Average hours of air conditioner use Cost at $0.15/kWh Cost at $0.20/kWh Cost Cost figures are not a direct multiplication of hours x cost, as air conditioners are not operating at full capacity at all times when they are on. See Appendix D for details of cost modelling. Table 6: Estimated cooling energy use and cost by state/territory in 2007 for all Australian households Cost at $0.15/kWh Cost at $0.20/kWh Cost Northern Territory. Source : Dept of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (2008), from Table 9, p. 39: 'Space Cooling Energy Consumption in Petajules by State from 1990-2020' Data was converted to average household data by converting petajules to kWh and dividing by total households. In comparison to estimates for all Australian households (see Table 6), costs of keeping cool for people with MS (see Table 5) is approximately 4 times higher in relation to national averages. This translates into a ve ry significant economic burden for people with MS. Given these costs for people with MS, it is all the more remarkable that there are no differences in air conditioner use between thos e who can most afford it (not likely to be concession eligible) and those w ho can least afford it (those like ly be concession eligible). The most probably conclusion from this is that keeping cool is a very high priority for people with MS, irrespective of their capacity to pay. 23 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 4 Conclusions and Recommendations Approximately 90% of the 21,000 people in Aust ralia with MS are adversely affected by the heat. To meet their medical need to keep cool and minimise their MS symptoms they run their air conditioners approximately 14.5 times more than average Australian households. Costs to people with MS to keep cool are es timated to be just over 4 times that of the average Australian household: ranging from $520-693 for people with MS, compared to $117-156 for average Australian households (cost ranges are based on co sts of electricity varying between $0.15 and $0.20 per kWh). People with MS undertake additional measures to improve the thermal efficiency of their homes in an effort to keep their cooling costs down and minimise carbon em issions more often than the average Australian household. The high number of hours that air conditioners are used can be explained through several factors. First, people with MS are more likely to be home during working hours as 80% of them are unemployed within 10 years of diagnosis. Seco nd, people with MS are more likely to stay home and indoors during hot weathe r to keep cool. Thir d, the threshold at which their symptoms increase is lower than the temperatures at which most people turn on their air conditioners. Finally, the use of air conditioners by people with MS (82%) in 2007-08 was also well above Australian air conditioner ownership (60%). The high use of air conditioners, air conditi oner ownership and household modifications to improve thermal efficiency all result in a significant additional financial costs to people with MS that must be met from lower than average incomes already severely diminished by other disease-related expenses. The lack of difference in patterns of air conditioner ownership and use between people with MS on lower incomes (as indicated by th e likelihood of concessi on/rebate eligibility) and those on higher incomes reinforces how impo rtant keeping cool is in their daily lives. In particular, keeping cool a ssists them to maximise their capacity for everyday activities (social, household and work) and minimise me dical costs (medicati on, visits to health professionals and occasionally hospitalisation). From a societal perspective this raises a number of public policy i ssues and challenges: ensuring that community service obligati ons to people who are heat intolerant are met in a way that is effective and equitable; maximising the efficiency of cooling for these households to minimise both the economic and environmental costs; and minimising the impact of catastrophic ev ents such as power-blackouts on this group. These public policy issues and challenges must be resolved in ways that will continue to be effective and equitable in a rapidly changing policy environment which includes: the development of nationa l electricity markets; the implementation of smart meters, a nd time-of-use peak pricing tariff structures; rapidly increasing electricity costs now and into the foreseeable future; and 24 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 more hot days and nights nationally, incr easing the need for medical cooling and the associated increasi ng costs for households. Public policy responses to heat intolerance will be most effec tive and equitable if they are aimed broadly at the wide range of people who are heat intole rant, such as those assisted through the existing concession programs. Additionally, across all of the issues and recommendations outlined below, developi ng and implementing effective responses to the need for people with MS and other heat intolerant people to keep cool involves actions by individuals; families; health, community and professional organisations that work with them; energy retailers and supplie rs; and governments at all levels. On all these issues and recommendations, leadersh ip and support from state and territory governments in particular will be essential to ensuring that people w ith heat intolerant conditions are not further disadvantaged by thei r condition, and are able to lead full lives. The high levels of electricity use by this group along with their low incomes make them especially vulnerable to any increases in electricity costs (through smart metering and/or general increased costs). Community service obligation schemes must be engineered to make sure they can afford to run their air conditioners enough to keep cool on hot days and nights. Recommendation 1 : Current public policy responses such as electricity rebates are a useful and effective means of assisting people with heat intoleranc e. Experiences in both VIC and WA indicate that rebates are effective for people who are heat intolerant and relatively low cost for government. Rebates must be set at meaningful levels and be regularly adju sted to take into account residential electricity price increases. Rebates/co ncessions need to be developed and implemented in all states and territories. Maximising the efficiency of cooling for thes e households to minimise both the economic and environmental costs involves three interrelat ed strategies. First, programs should be implemented that replace older, less efficient air conditioners . Given that 74% of people with MS have air conditioners that are 4 or more years old, replacing all of these would provide an immediate 20-30% re duction in both costs and environmental impacts. Although replacing existing air c onditioners with direct load control technology (which enables electricity retailers to manage the energy consumption of air conditioners) does not increase the air conditioners' efficiency, it does have the ca pacity to help electricity retailers and suppliers more effectively manage electricity supplies du ring periods of peak energy demands - especially spikes in demand on very hot days/nights. Consequently any program established to help supply new high-efficiency/lo w-carbon-footprint air conditioners to people with heat intolerance should examine the feas ibility and value of installing air conditioners that incorp orate direct load control technology. Second, programs to provide energy audits and minor home retrofits aimed at improving thermal efficiency are needed. The Comm onwealth's ceiling insulation program is a good example of one such program. There are also other, more comprehensive programs already in operation, such as the program run by Kildonnen (part of Uniting Care in Victoria) which undertakes energy (and water) audits , helps seek funding, and implements minor home retrofits and app liance replacements, as well as advising on behavioural aspects of reducing consumpti on. Funding such programs for people with MS and other heat intolerant conditions who are high users of air conditioners would also help reduce economic and environmental costs. 25 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Finally, programs are needed that advise peop le with a medical need to keep cool in relation to how they can improve the cooli ng efficiency of their home, and change behaviours that can help to reduce demand wh ile still keeping them cool. These should be a combination of programs aimed at: the general public; people with heat intolerant conditions and their families; and professi onals who work with people with heat intolerant conditions and their families. Recommendation 2 : New programs should be developed, and existing programs should be better targeted at people who n eed to keep cool for medical reasons to maximise the efficiency of cooling for th ese households, and to minimise both the economic and environmental costs. This in volves three interrelate d strategies: (a) replacement of older inefficient air condition ers; (b) minor home retrofitting such as ceiling insulation and external window c overings; (c) advice to the general public; people with heat intolerant conditions and their families; and professionals who work with them on steps they can take to minimise energy consumption and keep cool. The recent trend in some areas for electricity blackouts during heat waves is of particular concern for this group. A combination of strate gies is likely to be the most effective, including the provision of advi ce and assistance to particul arly vulnerable groups about how they might keep cool when blackouts occu r. A wide range of measures is possible such as: cold baths; creating a cool room; arrangements with friends or family; identification of vulnerable households and not blacking them out, or arranging transport to a cool public space before supplies are cut off, and so forth. Responsibility for identifying and implementing these measures will vary across jurisdictions, but likely to include a combination of energy retailers , health and commun ity services, local government, state/territory governments, and non -government organisations. It is vital that state/territory governments provide leadersh ip, oversight and incentiv es to ensure this occurs. Recommendation 3 : It is essential that heat wave and electricity blackout responses by state and local governments, and energy retailers and suppliers are developed for all locations before next summer, and that the needs of people with MS and other heat intolerant conditions are included ro utinely and effectively in these responses. 26 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 5 References Access Economics 2005, Acting Positively: Strategic Implications of the Economic Costs of Multiple Sclerosis in Australia , Access Economics, Canberra.

Figure C5: Proportion of people using their air conditioners for different time periods every 24hrs for March-April Finally, statistical testing for this last set of results f ound that overall the apparent differences between states/territories were statistically significant (Kruskal Wallis test p<0.001). The lowest number of hours used per day/night during th e March-April to cool house were observed in TAS (average = 2.7 hour s day/night), while the highest number of hours used per day/night were observed in SA and WA (average = 6.7 and 6.1 respectively). 39 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VIC 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 Appendix D: Economic modelling for air conditioner use costs 1. Evaporative air conditioners were excl uded as their operating costs are minimal relative to refrigerated/reverse-cycle air conditioners. Additionally, ducted cooling was excluded because, based on Victorian data (Roy Morgan 2008 found that there were 5 times as many evaporative as refr igerated/reverse-cycle ducted systems), it is likely that most of these systems are ev aporative, with the possible exception of NSW given its higher humidity levels in co astal areas (see Figure 6 in the main text on types of air conditioners owned). 2. Calculating imputed average hours of ai r conditioner use between September and April (12 months of data were collected, but these 8 months repr esent the months in which air conditioners were used to keep c ool). Mid-points of the ranges were used for this: 0=0, 1-6=3.5hrs, 7-12=9.5hrs, 13-18=15.5hrs, 19-24=21.5hrs. See Figure 10 in the main text for a gra phic representation of the data. 3. Based on Victoria's Sustainable Energy Authority's 2002 Operating Costs of Electrical Appliances costs per hour of air conditioner use were calculated based on two price points (see below). a. Published estimates were: $0.33-35/hr for 1-2 star rated air conditioners, and $0.24-$0.27 for 4-6 star rated units. b. These cost estimates were extrapolated to an average cost for each of three sets of star ratings: c. The age of air conditioners was used as a proxy for efficiency, with 5-6 star weightings applied to those 3 years or le ss, 3-4 stars for 4-9 years, and 1-2 stars for 10 years or older. d. A weighted average cost per hour of air conditioner operation for state/territory was then calculated taking into account varying ages of air conditioners across states. e. Note that these estimates from the Su stainable Energy Authority are based on reverse-cycle air conditioni ng for cooling a small-moderate sized space an average sized house of 150 square metres (which is the aver age size of an Australian dwelling) with 2.4 metre high ceilings, and a cost of electricity at $0.15/kWh. This was appropriate becau se (when evaporative and ducted systems are excluded) 80% of responde nts were cooling moderately sized spaces of 1 or two rooms (20% were cooling 4 or more rooms). f. Because Victorian figures were used to es timate actual costs up to this point, these were then weighted for differentia l cooling loads, using Victoria as the reference point and Apparent Temp erature as the weighting factor. 4. Hours of air conditioner use were then mu ltiplied by the different costs per hour for each state/territory (based on different wei ghtings for efficiency). The results as noted above assumed a cost of electricity supply at $0.15/kWh. Another set of figures was produced at $0.20/kW h; $0.25/kWh; and $0.30/kWh. The maximum and minimum cost figures fo r each state/ territory of $0.15 and $0.30 approximate the lower and upper ends of domestic electricity pricing nationally: tariffs vary within and between states/territories, w ith a complex mix of flat rates, time of use rates, and off-peak rates. 40 MS Australia, 54 Railway Rd, Blackburn, VI C 3103, www.msaustralia.org.au, Ph:03 9845 2700 5. Sensitivity Analysis was then undertaken for the three key variables: hours of air conditioner use, costs weighted for air c onditioner efficiency, and costs weighted for variations in apparent temperature (usi ng Victoria as the reference point). As noted in the main text, this analysis found that the results were highly robust across all parameters. See Tables D1 below for results of sensitivity analysis. Table D1: Sensitivity analysis of economic modeling Mean Standard deviation 95% confidence interval The confidence interval a ssumes that the cost estimate is normally distributed. Robustness of the model is determined through the relationship of the standard deviation (SD) to the mean. Results throughout are robust.
