Like many areas in canada, alberta needs a health care system that can respond to the changing needs of our population while delivering quality care that is fiscally responsible and sustainable. we are engaging staff, physicians and others in developing innovative ways to deliver health services. we also need to optimize the contributions of every member of our workforce. alberta's population is growing and aging, and we need to achieve even better patient experiences and health outcomes for the money we spend. recruitment alone will not enable us to provide the high level of care and service albertans expect and deserve in the future. t o ensure we meet the needs of albertans, we must create new ways for our care providers to work together, reshape how they are scheduled, where care is delivered and how we attract, recruit and keep providers. So what does this mean for patients and their families? taking a stronger, team-based approach means health care providers can spend more time with patients doing the work the providers were educated to do, and more time directly caring for patients. the patient will always be at the centre of the health care team. Patients and their families will be involved in making decisions about their care and treatment, so they can better understand their care plan and when they can expect to be discharged. this new collaborative practice model will help the care team to meet patients' needs by ensuring everyone on the team is focused on doing the work they are qualified to carry out for patients. as we create more full-time opportunities for staff, our patients and their families will see the same providers more regularly. this will reduce the need for patients to repeat their medical history, concerns or questions. this will also help patients really get to know their care team and feel more comfortable expressing their needs and preferences. we are taking action in many areas. y ou'll find samples of that work on Page 3. - Deb Gordon, Chief Nursing and Health Professions Officer, and Senior Vice President, Health Professions and Strategy and PracticetEamwork k Ey to SUStaiNabLE FUtUrE Deb Gordonyes, it's the time of year where dust gets busted, rooms get aired, and to-do lists seem to grow daily.

For several months, the rockyview general Hospital (rgH) has been developing Self-managed operating Units (SmoUs). the pilot project aims to reduce duplication and drive more decision-making to the local level. at a full-day session in april, stakeholders from corporate services, provincial programs, frontline managers, zone leadership, hospital administration and physician leaders met to \"describe\" what SmoUs will look like and how they will work. \"the retreat really showed how we all need to work together in this complex health system,\" says doug Pratt, a frontline allied Health manager at rgH, who attended the retreat. \"today demonstrated the commitment everyone has to streamlining the patient experience to meet the specific health needs of the population we serve.\" SmoUs ensure care is more responsive for patients right in their community. \"we are working directly with the local primary care network and community health care providers to look at how patients are cared for throughout their care journey. these new relationships will improve the continuity of care for the patient by further streamlining everything from medication to physical therapy,\" says dr. kelley deSouza, medical director, rgH. \"For example,\" deSouza explains, \"at the rockyview, patients seeking treatment for chronic heart failure make up a large portion of the patient population. the re-admission rate for these patients is consistently around 18 per cent, a high rate for any patient population.\" this has prompted the SmoU to re-examine the way these patients are cared for while in the hospital, and also once they are discharged from hospital and receiving care back in the community. Zone leadership teams continue to develop and oversee strategies, planning and policies, including operating, patient safety, quality and financial performance for each zone. Next steps include establishing baseline measures the rockyview can use to monitor its progress in improving patient care and staff satisfaction, and looking at the next pilot community for a SmoU. \"SmoUs place the authority and accountability for decisions right here, in our community,\" says Nancy guebert, Vice President, rgH. \"although patients will still be cared for to provincial best-practice standards, local solutions will ensure that the whole spectrum of care is looked at, not just within our hospital facility.\" nl o C a l l e a d e r s PaGe 2 we strongly believe our staff and physicians are some of our greatest assets. Not only do they care for patients and families, but they also provide invaluable insights into how we can evolve as a stronger and more responsive organization. as you will read in this edition of calgary Zone News , we are piloting a Self managed operating Unit (S moU) concept at the rockyview general Hospital. it provides local health providers an opportunity to inform how health services are and will be delivered in the calgary Zone. we envision the operating unit as a building block: it is not a return to the past, nor does it mean dismantling the Zone and the important roles and relationships we've established. SmoUs mean decisions are made by the health care professionals who know the community they serve. above all, they ensure the patient remains at the centre of their health decisions. SmoUs will help foster a greater sense of \"team\" for all employees, physicians and volunteers. it's a team working together to ensure patient care is streamlined throughout the care journey. and, looking from the lens of the patient and their family, we expect this will improve the way we deliver care in the Zone. Dr. Francois Belanger, medical Director, Calgary Zone Brenda Huband, Senior Vice President, Calgary ZoneDoug Pratt, Allied Health Manager at Rockyview General Hospital (RGH), and RGH Vice President Nancy Guebert discuss the future of Self-Managed Operating Units at the hospital.

We are: increasing the number of full-time clinical employees: in 2012/13, we increased the number of full-time clinical staff by 4.6 per cent. Having more full-time staff improves patient care because patients see the same faces, build better relationships and feel more comfortable voicing care preferences. Building collaborative teams: we are building care teams made up of staff who can meet the full range of a patient's needs. the team model - called the collaborative practice model - enables the whole care team to spend more time with patients doing the work the team was educated to do and, in many cases, more time with patients overall. improving scheduling: we are changing the way clinical staff are scheduled and are applying consistent and provincial scheduling processes. Staff will have more predictable shifts, and a pool of relief staff will cover absences or leaves, ensuring a stable supply of personnel will be available to care for patients. Providing new opportunities: Launched in august 2012, the Nursing Locum allows current aHS nurses to take temporary assignments in areas such as obstetrics, emergency, acute and continuing care in northern alberta. the Nursing Locum was developed in collaboration with United Nurses of alberta. working with partners to recruit physicians: we are actively and aggressively recruiting family physicians, with support from government and community partners. our physician resource planners are finding and pursuing international and domestic recruitment opportunities. in many cases, planners work directly with their own communities to attract doctors to their towns, villages and hamlets. in 2012 we recruited 400 new physicians to alberta. Creating experiences: we want to show what we have to offer to new and emigrating physicians. For example, the alberta clinical and Surgical assistant Program integrates internationally trained medical graduates into aHS acute care facilities. this program provides a six-month clinical preceptorship leading into careers with aHS as clinical assistants. other programs allow family medicine residents to experience the unique opportunities available in rural and remote communities. using our system as a classroom: Students from all health disciplines are encouraged to complete part of their professional education at aHS. Students are partnered with professionals who act as mentors. we provide more than three million hours of student placements each year. witH yoU. For yoU.

For example, physician resource planners are working with educational institutions, the rural Physician action Plan and local communities to help recruit physicians. \"there continues to be an active recruitment drive for family physicians for areas of need, primarily in alberta's rural areas,\" says dr. rollie Nichol, associate chief medical officer. \"the number of physicians working in alberta is continuing to increase at a faster pace than the national average, and more than twice as fast as population growth.\" n the East calgary Family care clinic (Fcc) was opened with one mission: access. From offering extended hours throughout the week, to a team that includes physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, mental health therapists, physiotherapists, social workers and pharmacists, the clinic aims for clients to access the care they need. \"the care we provide truly surrounds the client. it's a real one-stop-shop,\" says the clinic's manager, anne mackay. \"often, they haven't seen a doctor is quite some time, and they may spend the whole morning here seeing a number of different members of the interdisciplinary team.\" Located at the East calgary Health centre, the Fcc has developed a client base of 6,500 since april 2, 2012, with 100 new patients coming in each week. the interdisciplinary clinic offers clients what mackay calls a \"health care home.\" with 60 per cent of clients having English as a second language, mackay says individuals in East calgary represent some of the most culturally and socially diverse populations in the city. \"the clinic focuses on primary care services with an emphasis on wellness, health maintenance, health promotion and disease management,\" says mackay. megan mcQuiston, a registered nurse specializing in sexual and reproductive health, says the clinic's multi-disciplinary team adds new perspectives to patient care. \"a client may come in with one problem, and we'll identify another issue they may have,\" mcQuiston says. \"w e're providing outstanding care to the community.\" nyou have high expectations of your health care system. alberta Health Services helps meet those expectations by ensuring a strong and sustainable workforce that will be there for your care today, and there for your care in the future. cLiNic kEEPS wELcomE mat oUtAnne MacKay, Manager of the East Calgary Family Care Clinic, left, discusses patient education materials with Megan McQuiston, a registered nurse specializing in sexual and reproductive health.Patients with severe traumatic injuries now have access to faster diagnosis and more comprehensive treatment than ever before thanks to a state-of-the-art hybrid operating suite open at Foothills medical centre. the interventional trauma operating room (itor ) is the first operating room in North america and only the second in the world specially designed to control bleeding of patients with severe traumatic injuries. the 150-sq.-m, $6-million suite - funded by the calgary Health trust and the government of alberta - is more than twice the size of a traditional operating room, and includes its own angiography suite, which allows surgical and diagnostic imaging teams to work on a patient simultaneously. \"this is an excellent investment that makes a direct and immediate improvement for albertans in trauma care,\" says Fred Horne, minister of Health. \" this suite gives severe trauma patients their best chance for survival and recovery. it is an impressive addition to some of the best trauma care in the world.\" calgary Health trust board chair ann mccaig concurs. \"itor is the perfect example of how health care philanthropy brings world-class care to individuals and their families in calgary and southern alberta,\" says mccaig. \" working with our donors, the trust strives to ensure clinicians have access to cutting-edge technology like this suite, which ultimately means better outcomes for critically injured patients.\" typically, when trauma patients arrive at Foothills, they first go to the emergency department so that surgeons can determine whether their best chances of bleeding control are in an operating room or in an angiography suite. Now, patients with severe bleeding can go directly to the itor , where the internal bleeding assessment and repair is performed at the same time the surgical or angiographic team begin their work, saving time that could ultimately save lives. \"For patients with severe bleeding, we are now able to offer the absolute highest level of technology, the best care and best chances of survival of anywhere in the world,\" says dr. andrew kirkpatrick, medical director of trauma Services with aHS. \"this space brings multiple teams together to do the right thing for the patient, as fast as possible.\" the suite was constructed thanks to $3 million from calgary Health trust's Foothills Hospital Home Lottery program and a large anonymous donation, as well as $3 million from the government of alberta's mccaig tower capital Fund Project. the only other itor is located in Sydney, australia. n SErVicES iN yoUr comm UNity HealtHy mOmS, HealtHy BaBieS PrOGram this program is available to give prenatal mothers the support they need to get their babies off to a good start.

Now, Harbor has the state of her inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) monitored with an old diagnostic standby - ultrasound. \"Ultrasound is a lot easier and kind of fun, too,\" says the 39-year-old ca lgary woman. \" yo u can watch the screen and see what's going on inside.\" c algary has become one of the leading centres in the world in using this non-invasive tool to monitor ibd , thanks to the pioneering efforts of radiologist d r. Stephanie wilson. \" o ne of the benefits of ultrasound is that it can really help doctors better manage these illnesses,\" says wilson. \" t hey can get a clear indication of how a patient may be responding to a given therapy, and adjust treatment accordingly. c omplications of disease are also well-identified with ultrasound.\" Ultrasound can pinpoint flareups in inflammation before patients experience any symptoms, and can also show that symptoms they may be experiencing aren't due to any issues with their ibd . Ultrasound can also provide information on blood flow, as well as detect bowel thickening - important disease indicators for doctorsmanaging ibd patients. \" c algary is probably the only place in the world that uses ultrasonography so much to monitor ibd , partly because of d r. wilson' s expertise, and partly because physicians like us think it gives us very useful information,\" says d r. Subrata g hosh, a gastroenterologist and c algary Zone clinical department head for a lberta Health Services. \" i t also has the advantage of being patient- friendly and non-invasive. Patients find it a much more engaging experience than something like an mri or a ct scan.\" wilson has trained several ultrasound technicians in the diagnostic imaging ar ea of Foothills m edical c entre, which has a capacity to scan about 330 ibd patients a month. \" a lthough we're a small unit, we provide a service here that's the envy of North a merica,\" says wilson. U.S. physicians generally don' t utilize ultrasonography to monitor ibd . in flammatory bowel disease, a lifelong condition, is thought to be triggered by an interplay between genetics, diet, and the immune system. it can produce symptoms such as diarrhea, cramping and bleeding, and can be extremely debilitating.

BuSt DuSt dust builds up in your home and may contain substances that can trigger asthma symptoms such as wheezing or coughing, or other allergic reactions, such as rash or stuffy nose. these substances are called allergens. dust mites are another example of an allergen. Here are a few ideas that may help reduce dust and dust mites: Use an air cleaner with a special high- efficiency particulate air (HEP a) filter. this can help remove some allergens (such as pollen or animal dander) and tobacco smoke from the air in your home. replace drapes and blinds with roll- down shades or washable curtains. remove \"dust collectors\" from bedrooms, such as stuffed toys, wall hangings, books and knickknacks. dry vacuuming doesn't pick up dust mites. Steam clean carpets when possible - the steam kills dust mites. wash bedding, including pillowcases and mattress covers, in hot water every one to two weeks. dry bedding at high temperatures. make yOur OwN CleaNerS n all-purpose cleaner this cleaner cleans most surfaces, mirrors, glass, stainless steel, etc. Not recommended on granite counter tops.

Scrub with a soft brush, then wipe clean.in alberta, the tradition of spring cleaning extends well into summer as doors and windows get opened and rooms aired out. it's about tidying, refreshing and organizing your home. Our time-tested tips can make household tasks easier, more affordable and, dare we say, highly satisfying. Daunted by housework? y ou can break cleaning into small tasks so it feels manageable and rewarding - clean one room a night or weekend, or dust one day and wash floors another. Pass it on: donating clothing and bedding frees up space, and tattered clothes can be recycled into new cleaning rags. Save yourself: Easy, healthy, homemade solutions can greatly reduce your cost of cleaning. For less than $5, a simple vinegar and water solution can clean countertops, sinks, stainless steel, mirrors and more. add a drop of dish soap to the solution to clean dust and grime that accumulates on windowsills, tracks and screens, as well as walls, baseboards, doors and tiles. borax is an alkaline mineral salt that disinfects, freshens and shines sinks, showers, toilets, tubs and washing machines; 20 mule team is the most common brand of borax. a paste of vinegar and baking soda removes baked-on grease from pots, pans, ovens and stovetops, and shines stainless steel sinks.

For example, limited mobility or dementia hampers their ability to drive, leaving them incapable of operating their own vehicle. but there is also the barrier of unpredictable weather that is common in alberta, making it difficult for seniors to get out if they don't have proper transportation. the convenience and safety of door-to-door service for seniors from their residence or long-term care unit to programs and recreational field trips really goes a long way to maintaining some freedom and independence. Nina Livesley, care manager, operating room, Emergency room and Long t erm care at the canmore general Hospital, is happy with the benefits the handi-bus offers her patients. \"the new bus accommodates more walkers and wheelchairs,\" says Livesley. \"that's great because it allows so much more opportunity for our residents in long-term care to participate in program outings to kananaskis, morley, canmore and banff.\" with access to transportation, seniors can take part in a variety of therapeutic programs at the hospital, such as the senior's adult day support group mct rowe attends. approximately 25 seniors ride the bus in any given week. Seniors also have a variety of trip options, including day trips to churches, shopping and even a visit to the calgary Zoo. and these wheels take advantage of the latest technology. there is a colour-coded system the driver can use to ensure wheelchairs are locked into place. in addition, the bus has a feature that eliminates the need for seniors to step up onto the bus. Seniors walk onto a ramp that sits flush to the ground and, once the rider is on the ramp, it gradually rises to the level of the floor of the bus. the new handi-bus was purchased by the canmore and area Health care Foundation for the canmore general Hospital in November 2012 through donations of $131,000. myrle christensen, Executive director of the canmore and area Health care Foundation, couldn't be more pleased with the new bus. \"it really is wonderful to be able to accommodate our seniors from the hospital and the community and get them out and about,\" says christensen. \"it's the community support and generous donations that make these kinds of things happen.\" For more information, please visit www. canmorehealthfoundation.com. no u r p a r t n e r s PaGe 7 Story by Kerri Robins | Photo courtesy Richard Brown | Make a difference in your community.
