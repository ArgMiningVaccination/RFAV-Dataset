Nussenzweig4,9, Peter D. Kwong2,13 & Rafael Casellas1,10,11 ,13 Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Although a number of vaccines have been deployed, the continual evolution of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus has challenged their efficacy. In particular, the emerging variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 (first detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively) have compromised the efficacy of sera from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and immunotherapies that have received emergency use authorization 1-3. One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs (variable heavy chain domains of heavy chain antibody (also known as nanobodies)), which can recognize epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies4. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and from mice that we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and Bactrian camels. We identified two groups of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group 1 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group 2 is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry E484K or N501Y substitutions. However, nanobodies in group 2 retain full neutralization activity against these variants when expressed as homotrimers, and\u2014 to our knowledge\u2014rival the most potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that have been produced to date. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2-binding domain and recognition of conserved epitopes that are largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, although new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised. In contrast to mouse and human antibody binding domains (which are about 50 kDa in size), camelid VHHs retain full antigen specificity at about 15 kDa. This feature\u2014along with extended complementarity determining regions (CDRs)\u2014enables nanobodies to bind epitopes that are not normally accessible to conventional antibodies4, such as conserved viral domains that are often masked by glycan shields. Nanobodies can be readily humanized5 and in recent clinical trials they appeared safe and of low immunogenicity6. Despite these advan - tages, nanobodies are not widely used. One reason is that camelids are large animals that are not suitable for academic facilities. There are also few reagents available to isolate antigen-specific memory B cells from immunized camelids7. To bypass these hurdles, we sought to produce nanobodies in mice by combining 18 alpaca, 7 dromedary and 5 Bactrian camel VHH genes in a 25-kb insertion cassette (Fig. 1a). Each gene was fused to a VH promoter, leader exons and recombination signal sequences to ensure physiological expression and recombina-tion (Extended Data Fig. 1). Using CRISPR-Cas9, we inserted the VHH cassette in lieu of the VH locus in mouse embryonic stem cells (Fig. 1a).https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03676-z Received: 4 March 2021 Accepted: 27 May 2021 Published online: 7 June 2021 Open access Check for updates 1Lymphocyte Nuclear Biology, NIAMS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. 2Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. 3Laboratory of Retrovirology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA. 4Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA. 5Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. 6Laboratory of Virology, Division of Intramural Research, NIAID, NIH, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, MT, USA. 7Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, CCR, NCI, NIH, Frederick, MD, USA. 8Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Cancer Research Technology Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD, USA. 9Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA. 10The NIH Regulome Project, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. 11Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. 12Present address: Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. 13These authors contributed equally: Jianliang Xu, Kai Xu, jianliang.xu@nih.gov ; nussen@mail.rockefeller.edu; pdkwong@nih.gov ; | 8 July 2021 | 279Camelid nanobodies are expressed only in conjunction with dedi - IgG2 and IgG3, transcrip - tion4. In conventional antibodies, the hydrophobic surface of CH1 helps to pair heavy and light chain constant domains. To recapitulate this configuration in the mouse genome, we deleted CH1 from both Ighm and Ighg1 in the embryonic stem cells (Fig. 1a). The targeted allele was germline-transmitted from mouse chimeras to F1 offspring (hereafter referred to as 'nanomice'). As expected, about 85% of splenic B220+ B cells in wild-type mice were (Fig. 1b, left). By contrast, 72% of splenic heterozygous nanomice displayed an IgM+Ig phenotype (Fig. 1b, right) and of these less than 2% were IgM+Ig+ (Extended Data Fig. 2a), which implies that a large fraction of nanomouse B cells develop expressing single-chain antibodies. We confirmed this observation by amplifying VHH-DJ joining events using gene-specific primers. We found that all 30 VHHs were recombined to downstream JHs in bone marrow and spleen samples (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We performed a deep-sequencing analysis, which confirmed that all VHH genes undergo V(D)J recombination and are thus potentially available for expansion during the immune response (Extended Data Fig. 2c). In VHH-homozygous nanomice, the B cell compartment was largely normal and displayed all developmental stages, including B1, B2 and marginal-zone B cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a). One difference was an increased number of IgM+ transitional and immature B cells in the bone marrow and spleen, respectively, indicative of enhanced selection as cells transition from the short- to the long-lived CD23highCD21low com - partment, which in nanomice was reduced 1.7-fold relative to wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Another distinct feature was the absence of IgD (Extended Data Fig. 3b). This phenotype probably results from differential mRNA splicing owing to CH1 deletion at Ighm , because IgD was also absent in mice that are homozygous for deletion of the Ighm CH1 only (in which VHs and Ighg1 CH1 are intact) (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Taken together, these data show that mouse B cells can mature expressing single-chain antibodies.Activation and hypermutation in nanomice To probe activation, splenic B cells were isolated and cultured in the presence of lipopolysaccharide and interleukin-4. Under these con - ditions, VHH-expressing cells underwent proliferation and switch recombination to IgG1 (Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). To examine activation in vivo, we performed intraperitoneal immunizations with keyhole lim - pet haemocyanin. Twelve days after immunization, nanomice showed numbers of B220+CD95highIgG1+ germinal-centre B cells equivalent to those of controls (Fig. 1c). To study affinity maturation against a specific antigen, we immunized nanomice with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Hypermutation of VHH genes was increased relative to unimmunized controls (1.1 \u00d7 102 versus 7.5 \u00d7 104) (Fig. 1d). The mutation spectra revealed an enrichment in G-to-A and C-to-T transitions (Extended Data Fig. 3e), consistent with activation-induced cytidine deaminase catalysis9. To measure the antibody response against BG505 DS-SOSIP, we char - acterized 16 nanobodies that were enriched for HIV-1 trimer recogni - tion. Sequence analysis showed CDR3s to be highly diverse in this group in terms of JH use, mutations and size (9-16 amino acids) (Extended Data Fig. 4a). To measure binding kinetics, we applied biolayer interferom - etry. The analysis identified four VHH9 variants, which displayed dis - sociation constants ( KDs) that ranged from 2 to 13 nM\u2014demonstrating that they represent high-affinity binders (Extended Data Fig. 4b, Sup - plementary Table 1). We conclude that mouse B cells that express single-chain antibodies can undergo affinity maturation and produce highly specific nanobodies upon immunization. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies We next sought to produce neutralizing nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2. To this end, we immunized three nanomice and one llama with RBD and the stabilized prefusion spike of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2a). We isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells after immunization, and amplified and cloned VHHs into a phagemid vector. Following phage display, we enriched RBD-specific nanobodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding screen. Our deep-sequencing analysis identified, on average, 26,000 nanobody variants per library, which represents a total of 192 and 199 unique CDR3s for llama and nanomice, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We then clustered the nanobodies by CDR3s (Methods), isolated representative clones from each subgroup and tested them for blocking RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor in vitro10. We selected six llama and six nanomouse nanobod - ies using this method. To refine the list of candidates, we measured RBD-binding affinity by biolayer interferometry. This analysis identified 15, Nb17, from (Nb12 and Nb30) with dissociation constants below 30 nM (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 5b-d, Supplementary Table 1). The off-rate varied from 7.1 \u00d7 103 s1 to 1.1 \u00d7 103 s1, demonstrating slow dissociation for all nanobodies (Extended Data Fig. 5e). We next explored neutralization in vitro using lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the Nb19 (Fig. 2c). A crucial advantage of nanobodies over conventional antibodies is that they can be easily assembled into multimers, which often results in marked avidity12,13. To explore this property, we fused nanobodies as trimers using flexible GGGGS(\u00d73) linkers and connected them to human IgG1 Fc via the human hinge domain or its much longer, flexible llama counterpart (Fig. 2d). We also created bivalent antibodies by fusing two VHHs to IgG1 Fc (Fig. 2d). We found that neutralization increased with the number of linked monomers, from 3-fold for Nb15 Thirty VHHs selected from alpaca, dromedary and Bactrian camel were inserted via CRISPR-Cas9 in lieu of the 2.5-Mb mouse VH locus. CH1 exons from C and C1 were also deleted to avoid misfolding of the antibody heavy chain. b, Flow cytometry analysis of splenic B220+ B cells from wild-type or heterozygous IgM+Ig+ cells express conventional heavy-light chain antibodies, whereas IgM+Ig cells are mostly Ig+ in wild-type mice (not shown) or single-chain-antibody B cells in nanomice. c, Flow cytometry analysis of splenic cells from unimmunized and immunized nanomice and controls stained with CD95 and d, showing VHH somatic hypermutation in unimmunized and immunized nanomice.

Notably, the four most multimeric nanobod - ies (Nb12, Nb17, Nb19 and Nb56) reached IC50 values in the picomolar range (from 65 to 9 pM) (Fig. 2c, e ). To our knowledge, these values rank among the best reported to date for anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies14. Nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutants With the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, several variants that carry RBD mutations have emerged that increase transmissibility or allow escape from antibody neutralization. Of particular interest is the B.1.1.7 variant (which contains an N501Y substitution) that caused an upsurge in COVID-19 cases in the UK15. A second variant of concern is B.1.351, which combines N501Y with two additional RBD substitutions (K417N and E484K). P.1, a third variant that spread rapidly in Brazil, shows changes similar to those of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351: N501Y , K417T and E484K16. All of these mutations have been shown to reduce the efficacy of serum antibodies elicited by the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines1,2. We first explored whether our leading nanobodies could neutralize virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike carrying the muta R683G substitution, which increases infectivity in vitro17 was included as a control. In contrast to their efficacy against the wild-type virus, Nb17, Nb19 and Nb56 were unable to neutralize viruses carry - ing the E484K substitution alone or in combination with K417N and N501Y (Fig. 3a). Similarly, Nb15 was ineffective against N501Y . How - ever, with the exception of Nb17, the nanobodies all remained highly potent binders and neutralizers in bivalent or trivalent forms (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Figs. 5e, In the case of Nb15 and Nb56 trimers, IC50 values reached 30 pM and 14 pM, respectively. Thus, the E484K and N501Y substitutions enable viral escape from monomeric, but not multimeric, nanobodies. In contrast to neutralization potencies nanomouse Nb12 and Nb30 were largely unaltered by RBD mutations (Fig. 3a), which suggests that they recognize a region that is differ - ent from the receptor-binding motif. To explore whether multimeric nanobodies function against authentic virus, we repeated the neutrali - zation assay with recapitulated the pseudovirus findings, showing neutraliza - tion of wild type and the three variants by all four nanobodies (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 6b). Of note, these nanobodies were most effective against the B1.1.7 variant, with IC50 values that ranged between 4 pM (for Nb15) and 538 pM (for Nb30), and were relatively less effective against the B.1.351 variant, showing a range of 18 pM (for Nb56) to 2,755 pM (for Nb30) (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Neutralization of the P.1 variant was intermediate (Extended Data Fig. 6b, c). The fact that llama and nanomouse nanobodies are differentially affected by the variants suggests that they recognize different RBD epitopes. To test this idea, we applied biolayer interferometry using a preformed nanobody-RBD immunocomplex that was incubated with a second nanobody (Fig. 3c). We found that all four llama nanobodies, but not Nb30, could bind the Nb12-RBD immunocomplex (Fig. 3d). Similarly, Nb30-RBD interfered with Nb12 binding, whereas llama nanobodies bound freely to it (Fig. 3e). At the same time, Nb12 and Nb30 recognized all combinations of llama nanobody-RBD complexes, whereas llama nanobodies could not (Fig. , Extended Data Fig. 6d).

As is often the case with single-chain antibodies, both llama and nanomouse nanobodies were largely thermostable and could be aero - solized with commercially available mesh nebulizers without losing neutralization activity (Extended Data Fig. 6e-g). Nanobody structures To define the region bound by nanomouse nanobodies, we collected single-particle cryo-electron Nb30 in complex with HexaPro10, a prefusion construct of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Extended Data Figs. 7, 8, Supplementary Table 2). In both cases, we used particle subtraction, classification and local refinement to enhance the resolution of the nanobody- spike interface. The structure of the Nb12-spike complex revealed induce a two-RBD-up, one-RBD-down spike conformation, with Nb12 recogniz - ing a region towards the middle of the RBD, outside of the ACE2-binding region and distal from the residues (417, 484 and 501) affected in emerg - ing variants of concern (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 9a). The structure of the Nb30-spike complex revealed Nb30 to induce a three-RBD-up conformation, with Nb30 recognizing a region at the opposite end of RBD from the ACE2-binding motif and residues affected by escape mutations (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9b). To understand how the two nanomouse nanobodies neutralized despite recognizing surfaces outside the ACE2-binding domain, we superimposed the structure of the ACE2-RBD complex18- 20 with those of Nb12 and Nb30 (Extended Data Fig. 9c). We observed a substantial portion of Nb12 domain clashing with ACE2, which indicates that Nb12 and ACE2 binding are sterically incompatible. With Nb30, we observed a subtler clash with glycan N322 on ACE2, which none - theless also indicated that Nb30 and ACE2 binding are sterically incompatible. To obtain a structural understanding of the neutralizing regions recognized by nanomouse and llama nanobodies, we also determined 3D negative-stain electron microscopy reconstructions of each of the nanobodies in complex with HexaPro. These reconstructions revealed that llama nanobodies uniformly target the ACE2-binding interface, with Nb17, Nb19 and Nb56 inducing a one-RBD-up con - formation, whereas Nb15 associates with all-RBD-down spikes (Extended Data Fig. 9d-h). By contrast, both nanomouse Nb12 and Nb30 recognize RBD at a surface bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 local in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike. a, Cryo-electron microscopy Nb12 in complex SARS-CoV-2 spike. b , As in a, for Nb30. c , Interface between nanobodies and spike. d, Surface properties of RBD, including sequence diversity (dark purple indicates diversity among sarbecoviruses), and prevalence of RBD-recognized regions by human antibodies (dark raspberry indicates high prevalence) and binding site for ACE2 (cyan).282 | Nature | Vol 595 | 8 July 2021 ArticleRBD regions recognized by mouse nanobodies To provide insight into the prevalence of regions on RBD recog - nized by nanomouse versus human antibodies, we superimposed 51 RBD-directed human neutralizing antibodies in the Protein Data Bank and quantified the recognition prevalence at the residue level (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Table 3). Although recognition extended over much of the RBD, the prevalence of human antibody recognition was much higher in the ACE2-binding region in which the residues affected by emerging mutations reside. By contrast, the regions recognized by Nb12 and Nb30 were conserved in sarbecoviruses and displayed a substantially lower prevalence of human antibody recognition. The epitope of Nb12 overlaps considerably with those recognized by pre- vious nanobodies specific for SARS-CoV21 and SARS-CoV-213,22, which raises the possibility that these nanobodies might also block the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, the Nb30 binding footprint is farther away from the ACE2 RBD motif and covers a surface area that is 79% conserved among sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and bat to 54% for Nb12 and, on average, 23% for human antibodies) (Fig. 4c, d , Supplementary Table 3). Consistent with these findings, we found that Nb12 and Nb30 bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV and of the bat coronavirus WIV16 and neutralize HIV-1-based pseudoviruses that carry their spike, whereas Nb56 does not (Extended Data Fig. 10a, b). We observed similar neutralization patterns with vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudoviruses carrying spike pro - teins from and six additional bat coronaviruses (Extended Data Fig. 10c). We conclude that nanomouse VHHs circumvent RBD antigenic drift by recognizing a sarbecoviral conserved region outside the ACE2-binding motif. Discussion A key contribution of our study is the creation of nanobody-producing mice. Previous work has explored the transgenic expression of a limited number of llama VHHs23. In our model, the 30 VHHs replace the entire VH domain, which leads to physiological recombination and selection during ontogeny. Although our nanomice are capable of producing high-affinity nanobodies, they can be improved further by increasing the number of available VHHs. This could be done by engineering a second allele carrying VHHs from llamas, vicu\u00f1as and guanacos (the three camelids that are not represented in our insertion cassette). We anticipate that this and similar improvements in animal models will help to popularize the development of nanobodies against infectious diseases or for basic applications. As a proof of principle, we used nanomice to produce highly specific nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. To date, numerous monoclonal antibodies isolated from patients with COVID-19 or from humanized mice have been shown to block the RBD-ACE2 interface. Unsurprisingly, immunotherapies that involve such antibodies are vulnerable to escape variants that carry mutations at or around the ACE2-binding motif1-3. The anti-RBD nanobodies we isolated overcome this limitation in two important ways. First, similar to human antibodies, llama nanobodies (Nb15 and Nb56) hinder ACE2 binding to the spike of the original virus, but they are ineffective against viruses that carry E484K or N501Y substi - tutions. However, in multimeric form, these nanobodies overcome the block and display marked neutralization potency. This reversal is prob - ably the result of increased avidity for the trimeric spike, or possibly the simultaneous cross-linking of multiple spikes on the viral membrane. Another possibility is that trimers occlude ACE2 access to the RBD. Second, nanobodies nanomice (Nb12 and Nb30) associate with an RBD region that is highly conserved among sarbecoviruses21, but remains inaccessible to most human antibodies. As this region lies outside the ACE2-binding motif, nanobody-RBD contacts are unaf - fected by the E484K or N501Y substitutions. Importantly, even though the conserved domain does not overlap with the ACE2-binding motif, our structural studies suggest that nanobodies of this class sterically interfere with ACE2-RBD associations. On the basis of these features, we propose that our leading nanobodies may provide valuable tools for passive immunotherapy or pulmonary delivery against current or future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Construction of exchange-cassette and VHH minigene To replace the entire mouse VH locus (mm10, chromosome 12: 113,567,224-116,010,427) we assembled a targeting vector (pLH28- exchange-cassette) and a VHH minigene. The targeting vector was built by inserting a selection cassette composed of pEF1a-Puro-TK-2A-EGFP in between wtLoxP and LoxP257 sites within the pLH28 exchange vector24. As homology arms, 1-kb and 0.8-kb fragments flanking the VH deletion domain were cloned 5 and 3 of the LoxP sites. To build the VHH minigene, VHH genes (18 from alpaca, 7 from dromedary and 5 from Bactrian camel) were selected on the basis of published sequences25-27. Thirty mouse VH promoters (250 bp) were next chosen on the basis of their expression as measured by GRO-seq in resting and activated mouse B cells. VHHs were codon-optimized and complemented with mouse leading exons, introns and recombination signal sequences. The 30 units were pieced together by Gibson assembly (NEB) into the pBeloBAC11 vector. Embryonic stem cell targeting E14 cells were cultured in Glasgow's non-essential amino acids (NEAA), penicillin (50 units per ml)-streptomycin (50 g ml1) (Thermo added to the medium before use. Dishes and plates were coated with 0.1% glycine for 15 min at room temperature before use. To delete the CH1 exon of C, sgRNAs targeting the flanking was co-transfected with the two Cas9 sgRNA plasmids (2 g each) into embryonic stem (ES) cells (2 million cells) with the Amaxa nucleofection kit (Lonza, VPH-1001, programme A030). After 24 h of culture, GFPhigh ES cells were FACS-sorted and cultured in 10-cm dishes at a concentration of 2,000 cells per dish. Seven days later, colo - nies were transferred into 96-well plates and cultured for an additional 3 days. Genomic DNA was then extracted and genotyped for C exon deletion. Clones with homozygous deletions were selected to next delete the C1 exon with the same strategy. To delete the entire VH locus, sgRNAs targeting sequences upstream of Ighv1-86 (first Ighv) and downstream of Ighv5-1 (last Ighv), respectively, were cloned into pX458. Selected ES cells (2 million cells) were co-transfected with the two Cas9 sgRNA plasmids (1.5 g each) and the pLH28-exchange-cassette plasmid (1.5 g) and then cultured in 10-cm dishes. Twenty-four h later, cells were selected with puromycin (0.8 g ml1) for 10 days and individual colonies were picked for expansion and genotyping by long-range PCR. Positive clones (2 million cells) were co-transfected with VHH minigene vector (3 g) and a Cre-expressing plasmid (1 g) and cultured in 10-cm dish for 3 days. Cells were then selected with ganciclovir (2 g ml1) for 7 days before individual colonies were picked for expansion and geno - typing. sgRNAs and ODN primers are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Generation of nanomice Two modified ES cell clones with normal karyotype were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, which were then transferred to the uteri of pseudopregnant C56BL/6 recipients. High-percentage chimeras were mated to C57BL/6 mice and offspring were genotyped for VHH mini - gene knock-in and C and C1 exon deletion. One out of three chimeras produced F1 offspring that showed germline transmission. Three F1 male mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice. F2 heterozygous mice were inbred to produce mice homozygous for all three modifications. Two F 1 offspring from the same chimera were null for Ch1 of Ighm but wild type for VH and CH1 exon of C1. These mice were used as controls for Extended Data Fig. 3b. FACS analysis B cells were activated by presence of lipopoly - saccharide (LPS, Sigma, L2630, 50 g ml1), for 72 h. For proliferation assays, cells were stained with Cell - Tracer Violet (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C34557) at room temperature for 20 min before culturing for 96 h. For all FACS staining, cells 2% FBS) software and analysed with FlowJo software. Gating strategy is shown in Extended Data Fig. 10d. Analysis of VHH(D)J recombination Genomic DNA from bone marrow or splenic samples was extracted with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, 69506). VHH(D)J joints were PCR-amplified from 100 ng of DNA with a framework primer unique for each of the 30 VHHs, and a common downstream JH4 primer. PCR products were loaded onto 1% agarose gel to resolved them by size. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 4. VHH(D)J recombinants phagemid library construction VHH(D)J phagemid libraries from unimmunized mice were constructed by first extracting RNA from nanomouse splenic samples with Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15596026) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA with SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 18080400) according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Ten g of total RNA was denatured and annealed with gene-specific primers corresponding to CH2 50 min, template-switching oligonucleotide (TSO) (3-propyl modified) linker was added to the reaction and the first strand cDNA was elongated for another 90 min at 42\u00b0C. The reaction was inactivated at 85\u00b0C for 5 min and 2 l of cDNA was used as template for used. Thirty ng of the first-step PCR product was then amplified with a primer mix of 30 forward primers corresponding to framework (FR1) of 30 VHH genes and reverse primers corresponding JH1~JH4. pMES4 (Addgene, 98223) was amplified primers SfiI sites on both ends. VHH(D)J and pMES4 fragments were then digested with SfiI (NEB, R0123L) and (100 M0202L) at 16\u00b0C product was purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research, D4014) and eluted into 12 l of water. Three l of DNA was electroporated into 60 l of TG1 cells (Lucigen, BTX electroporation system ECM 630 at the setting of 25 F , 200 ohms, 1,600 volts. After 1 h recovery in 37\u00b0C in Articleshaker incubator, TG1 cells were plated on 5 of 10-cm agar supplemented with 100 g Medical, BPL-2400). Plates were placed in 37-\u00b0C bacteria incubator overnight, bacteria were scraped off plates and phagemid library was Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, D4054). Primers 4. sequencing for somatic hypermutation analysis VHH(D)J recombinants from splenic in 'VHH(D)J recombinants phagemid , and then cloned directly into pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 450245) and transformed into Stabl3 com- petent Escherichia coli (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C737303). Ninety-six colonies were randomly picked for from BG505 DS-SOSIP immunized nanomouse phagemid library were plated onto carbenicillin-containing plates and 50 colonies picked for Sanger sequencing. Sequence alignment was performed using Snapgene soft - ware. Immunizations All animal-related procedures were performed by following our NIAMS ACUC protocol. To monitor the germinal centre reaction, three nanomice and two C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally with 50 g of keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). A boost injection was performed in the footpads with 25 g of KLH in the presence of incomplete Fre - und's adjuvant (IFA) on day 6. Spleen samples were collected on day 12 for analysis. To isolate nanobodies recognizing HIV-1 envelope trimer, one nanomouse was immunized intraperitoneally with 50 g of BG505 DS-SOSIP in the presence of CFA on day 0, and boost immunized with 25 g of BG505 DS-SOSIP in the presence of IFA or PBS on day 22 and 44, respectively. Bone marrow, spleen and blood were collected on day 48. To isolate neutralizing nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2, a llama (Capralogics) mg of recombi - nant RBD protein in the presence of CFA at day 0, and boost immunized with 0.5 mg of RBD protein in the presence of IFA on days 14, 28 and 42. Two more boost immunizations with 0.5 mg of recombinant spike protein in the presence of IFA were performed on day 56 and 70. On day 80, 500 ml of whole blood were collected for library preparation. To isolate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies from nanomice, two groups of mice (five for group 1 and six for group 2) were immunized with RBD and/or spike protein and bleeds were collected after a 62-day immunization protocol. Mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 50 g of RBD protein (group 1) or spike protein (group 2) in the presence of CFA on day 0, and boost immunized intraperitoneally with 25 g of RBD protein (group 1) or spike protein (group 2) in the presence of IFA on days 14, 28 and 42. Mice were further immunized with 25 g of spike protein in PBS on day 56 and 59, intraperitoneally and intravenously, respectively. Bone marrow, spleen and blood samples were collected on day 62. The best responders\u2014nanomouse 1 (group 1) and nanomice 2 and 3 (group 2)\u2014were selected for phage library construction. Llama and nanomouse phage library construction The llama phage library was constructed as previously described28 with some modifications. In brief, 300 ml of whole blood was collected from llama and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were enriched using Ficoll-Paque plus (GE Healthcare, 17-1440-03). Fifty g of extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with random hexamers and 2.5 l of cDNA was used for first round RT-PCR with gene-specific primers CALL001 and CALL002. The PCR reaction was repeated in 12 individual tubes with cDNA added into reactions sepa- rately. PCR fragments of about 700-bp long were gel-purified and used as template (30 ng for each reaction, repeated in 12 individual tubes) for second round PCR with nested primers VHH-Back and VHH-For. PCR product from individual reactions were pooled and gel-purified. Nanobody fragments and pMES4 phagemid were restriction enzymes (NEB: R3140L, R3162L) and ligated (1 g and 2 g respectively) with T4 ligase at 16\u00b0C overnight. Ligation product was column-purified (into 12 l of H2O) and electroporated into 360 l of TG1 cells. After 1 h of recovery at 37\u00b0C in a shaker incu - bator, cells were plated on 6 of 245 \u00d7 245-mm (Thermo Fisher Sci- 2% (w/v) glucose. Plates were placed in a 37-\u00b0C bacteria incubator overnight and then bacteria were scraped off of plates and archived as glycerol stocks. Cells were infected with VCSM13 helper phage (Agilent Technologies, 200251) followed by precipitation supernatant with 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma, 89510) in 2.5 sodium on ice to purify the nanobody phage particles. Phage particles were resuspended in 1 ml PBS, 300 l were used for screening immediately and the remaining phages were stored at 80\u00b0C in the presence of 10% glycerol. Nanomouse nanobody phage libraries were constructed the same way as nanomouse VHH(D)J region phagemid library construction with some modifications. In brief, total RNA was extracted from splenic cells, bone marrow cells and PBMCs of immunized mice and processed separately until the TG1 cell electroporation step. RNA from splenic cells, bone marrow and PBMCs (50 g, 50 g and all, respectively) were reversed-transcribed to cDNA with Ighg1-CH2-specific primer in separate tubes. Two l of cDNA was used as template for PCR vari - able domain amplification (12 reactions each), using unmodified TSO and Ighg1-CH2-specific oligonucleotide as primers. Second PCR was repeated in 12 reactions using 30 ng of the first-step PCR product as tem - plate and 30 FR1 and 4 JH oligonucleotide mix as primers. PCR and pMES4 (200 ng and 400 ng, respectively). Ligation products from splenic cells, bone marrow and PBMC samples were pooled and column-purified (into 12 l of water) and electroporated into 360 l of TG1 cells and phage libraries prepared as described in 'VHH(D)J recombinants phagemid library construction' . Primers are listed in 4. Library construction for Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing Phagemid DNA extracted from TG1 cell libraries was used as starting material for constructing MiSeq libraries to measure VHH use and nanobody diversity. In brief, 1.2 g of phagemid DNA was used as tem - plate and VHH(D)J inserts were amplified with primers recognizing 50-l reaction (9 cycles). To avoid MiSeq failure owing to low com - plexity at initial cycles and to enable multiplex sequencing, 1-9-nt-long staggers were introduced into forward primers. Without purification, 5 l of the first PCR product were used as template for a second PCR (9 cycles) to add Illumina P5 and P7 primers on both ends. PCR product was then loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and the approximately 580-bp size band was purified with Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, D4002). DNA concentration was determined by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q33238) and average DNA size was determined by TapeStation 4150 (Agilent). DNA was then adjusted to 2 buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20. For unimmunized nanomice VHH(D)J library, DNA (2 nM) from 3 mice was mixed at a 1:1:1 ratio and loaded for MiSeq run. For immunized llama and nanomice nan - obody diversity analysis, DNA (2 nM) of pre-selection and post-selection libraries were mixed at 10:1 ratio first and then samples from individual animals were pooled at 1:1 ratio before loading for MiSeq sequencing. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Deep-sequencing analysis For unimmunized nanomouse VHH use analysis, pooled library from 3 mice was sequenced by MiSeq (pair end, 270 cycles \u00d7 2). Pair-end reads were merged with NGmerge29 with default settings. Nucleotides corresponding to pMES4 were trimmed using pTrimmer program30, leaving clean VHH(D)J sequences in the merged reads. Reads with unde - termined N nucleotides, low quality sequence or less than 300 nt in length were removed with the fastp program31. Fastq format sequences were converted to .fasta format for further analysis. To calculate VHH use, a BLAST database was built from a .fasta format file (vhh.exon.fa) containing the exon sequence of all 30 VHH genes, using BLAST+. VHH(D)Js were then aligned to VHH genes using igblast program32. The alignment output file was simplified to retain only sequence identifier and VHH(D)J recombination information. For immunized llama and nanomouse nanobody diversity analysis, in total 8 libraries (pre- and post-selection) were sequenced by MiSeq (pair end, 300 cycles \u00d7 2). The 3-end low-quality sequences were trimmed using the Sickle program (v1.33, available at https://github. com/najoshi/sickle ). For different libraries, the minimum length of trimmed sequence was adjusted on the basis of the length of staggers in the primers used for library construction. Paired sequences were merged by flash program (v.1.2.11)33 and translated. To extract nano - body sequences and to locate CDR3 regions, we used ANARCI program34 to annotate VHH genes with IMGT numbering. Protein sequences with greater than or equal to 100 amino acids in total and greater than or equal to 1 amino acid in the CDR3 region were extracted for further analysis. Enrichment of individual sequences were calculated by com - paring their frequencies in pre- and post-selection libraries. Sequences that were enriched more than 10 times and had greater than or equal to 5 \u00d7 105 frequency were selected for CDR3 clustering using cd-hit program (v.4.6.8)35. Expression DS-SOSIP and SARS-CoV-2 proteins BG505 DS-SOSIP protein was expressed and purified as previously described36. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its RBD were expressed and purified as previously described37,38 with some modifi- cations. In brief, 1 mg of pCAGGS-Spike or pCAGGS-RBD plasmid was transfected into 1 l of cells Biosystem, PXX1002). Supernatants collected on day 4 after transfection by centrifugation of the culture at 12,000g for 15 min. Supernatant was then filtered through 0.2 m aPES filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 5670020) and incubated with 10 ml of cOmplete His-tag purification resin (Roche, 05893801001) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, His-tag resin was collected through gravity flow columns (Bio - Rad, 9704652), washed with 100 ml of washing buffer (15 mM imida - zole, 50 mM TrisHCl, 300 mM NaCl) and eluted with 25 ml of elution buffer (300 mM imidazole, 50 mM TrisHCl, 300 mM NaCl). Eluate was concentrated in 10-kDa Amicon Centrifugal Units (EMD Millipore, UFC901024) and then dialysed in PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 66381). Proteins were analysed by NuPAGE gel (Thermo by liquid nitro - gen and stored at 80\u00b0C before being used for immunization. RBD and spike (HexaPro) proteins used coated by different methods onto MaxiSorp 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 439454) for phage screening. For RBD screening, two wells were coated with 50 l of RBD protein (100 g ml1 in PBS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Another well with 50 l of PBS was used as an non-coated control. Wells were washed with PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 three times and blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. For spike or BG505 DS-SOSIP screening, three wells were coated with 50 l of lectin (EMD Millipore, L8275, 100 g ml1 in PBS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Wells were washed and blocked with 10% non-fat milk in room temperature for 1 h. After three washes, 50 l of 100 g ml1 of BG505 DS-SOSIP or spike were added to 2 wells, incubated at room temperature for 2 h and washed. A third well contained PBS and served as a non-coated control. Three hundred l of phage particles was mixed with 300 l of 10% non-fat milk and rotated gently at room temperature for 1 h. One hundred and fifty l of blocked phage particles was then added into each well and incubated in room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking. After 15 washes, phages were eluted with TrypLE Express Enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12605010) by shaking plates at 700 rpm at room temperature for 30 min and used immediately for selection efficiency estimation (10 l of phage eluate) and recovery infection (the remain - ing eluate) as previously described28. Anti-RBD libraries were selected with RBD protein once, and libraries constructed from BG505 DS-SOSIP or spike immunized animals were and anti-RBD nanobodies After one or two rounds of selection, recovered TG-1 cells were plated and colonies were picked to prepare periplasmic extracts containing crude nanobodies for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In brief, individual colonies were picked and grown in 96 deep-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 278743) in 2YT medium supplemented with 100 g ml1 of carbenicillin and 0.1% glucose. IPTG (final 1 mM) was added when optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 1 and protein expression was induced in 30\u00b0C for 16 h. Periplasmic extracts were prepared by resuspending bacteria pellet in 200 l of PBS and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells were thawed slowly at room tem - perature and centrifuged at 4,100g for 15 min. Maxisorp plates were coated with lectin (2 g ml1) followed by BG505 DS-SOSIP (2 g ml1) or with RBD (2 g ml1). After blocking, 100 l of nanobody-containing supernatant were transferred to the plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and then incubated with horse radish peroxidase (HRP) Jackson ImmunoResearch, 128-035-232) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and then developed by addi - tion of 50 l of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 34028) for 10 min, then the reaction was stopped by adding 50 l of 1 M H2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured with Synergy microplate reader (BioTek Gen5). Expression and purification of nanobodies Phagemids from lead candidates identified by ELISA were extracted from TG-1 cells and transformed into WK6 cells (ATCC, 47078). Cul - tures were grown in 30 ml of 2YT medium (100 g ml1 of carbenicillin and 0.1% glucose) at 37\u00b0C and 220 rpm until OD600 reached 1. Protein expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG at 30\u00b0C for 16 h and then pelleted at 4,100g for 15 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS plus 30 l of 0.5 MU ml1 polymyxin B (Sigma, P1004) and incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 1 h. Cell debris were pelleted at 12,000g for 5 min and nanobodies in the supernatant were purified using Capturem His-tagged purification kit (Takara, 635710). For larger-scale nano - body production (0.2 to 1 l of culture), nanobodies in the supernatant were purified by cOmplete His-tag purification resin and dialysed in PBS as described in 'Expression and purification of BG505 DS-SOSIP and SARS-CoV-2 proteins' . 0.22-m PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore, UFC30GVNB) before being used for downstream assays. Expression and purification of Fc conjugated were to the Fc region of human IgG1 with 6\u00d7His tag at the C-terminal end and cloned into the ArticlepVRC8400 vector. In trimeric form, nanobody units were connected through (GGGGS)\u00d73 flexible linkers. In some cases, llama IgG2a hinge region was used in lieu of human IgG1 hinge. The Fc fusion constructs were expressed in Expi293 cells as described in 'Expression and purifi BG505 DS-SOSIP and SARS-CoV-2 proteins' at 33\u00b0C from day 2 to day 4. Antibodies in the supernatant were purified using either cOmplete His-tag purification resin or protein A (Thermo Fisher Scien- tific, A26457). When protein A resin was used, antibodies were eluted by IgG elution buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21009) and brought to neutral pH by adding 1/10 volume of Tris-HCl (1M, pH 8). Antibodies were concentrated, dialysed and filtered. Nanobody-Fc yields were up to 100 mg l1. RBD region of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus WIV16 spike protein were fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 and cloned into pVRC8400 vector. RBD-Fc proteins were expressed in Expi293 cells and purified with protein A. SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test RBD-ACE2 interaction blocking potential of nanobodies was tested using the SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) kit (Genscript, L00847) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, HRP-RBD was diluted and incubated with specified concentra- tions of nanobodies for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Samples were then transferred onto ACE2-coated plates and incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed, and the assay was developed using TMB reagent and quenched with stop solution. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a Synergy microplate reader (BioTek Gen5). Inhibition rate was calculated and plotted using Microsoft Excel according to manufacturer's instruction of the sVNT kit. Pseudotyped virus neutralization assay A panel of plasmids expressing RBD-mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike pro - teins in the of pSARS-CoV-2-SD19 have previously been described1,40. The mutants E484K and KEN (K417N, E484K and N501Y) were constructed in the context of a pSARS-CoV-2-S19 variant with a substitution in the furin cleavage site (R683G). The IC50 of these compared to a wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence carrying R683G in the subsequent analyses, as appropriate. Gen - eration of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1 particles and pseudovi - rus neutralization assay was performed as previously described11. In brief, 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3DEnv-nanoluc and pSARS-CoV-2-SD19 and pseudotyped virus stocks were collected 48 h after transfection, filtered and stored at 80\u00b0C. Serially diluted nano - bodies were incubated with the pseudotyped virus for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The mixture was added to 293TACE211 (for analysis of wild-type neutraliza- tion activity) (Fig. 2) or HT1080Ace2 cl.1417 cells (for analysis of spike mutant panel) (Fig. 3), and after 48 h cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Luciferase Cell - erase Assay System (Promega) with Modulus II Microplate Reader User interface (TURNER BioSystems). The relative luminescence units were normalized to those derived from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus in the absence of antibodies. Neutralization of HIV-1-based SARS-CoV-1 and bat coronavirus WIV16 pseudotypes were performed cells as previously The IC50 for nanobodies was In brief, HEK293T cells were grown to 80% confluency before transfection with the spike gene using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured VSV-G pseudo-typed G-luciferase the in DMEM at a multiplicity of infec - tion (MOI) of 3 for 2 h before washing the cells with 1\u00d7 DPBS three times. The next day, the transfection supernatant was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 300g for 10 min. Each viral stock was then incu bated with 20% I1 pseudo-typed G-luciferase virus before measuring titres and making aliquots to be stored at 80\u00b0C. Neutralization assays were performed by incubating pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of antibodies and scored by the reduction in luciferase gene expression as previously described2,42,43. In brief, 293TACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 \u00d7 104 cells per well). Pseudoviruses were incubated with serial dilutions of the antibodies in triplicate for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The mixture was added to cultured cells and incubated for an additional 16 h. Luminescence was meas - ured using Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and IC50 was defined as the dilution at which the relative light units were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells (virus + cells) after subtrac - tion of the background in the control groups with cells only. The IC50 values were calculated using a five-parameter dose-response curve in from BEI Resources (NIAID, NIH) and propagated for one passage using Vero E6 cells. Virus infectious titre was determined by dilution microplate neutralization assay was performed to measure the neutralization activity of nanobodies. In brief, nanobodies were subjected to successive fivefold dilutions starting from 10 g ml1. Triplicates of each dilution were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 in EMEM with 7.5% inactivated fetal calf serum for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, the virus-nanobody mixture was transferred onto a monolayer of Vero E6 cells grown overnight. The cells were incubated with the mixture for about 70 h. CPE of viral infection was visually scored for each well in a blinded fashion by two independent observ - ers. The results were then reported as percentage of neutralization at a given nanobody dilution. The IC50 for nanobodies was determined using nonlinear regression (normalized response, variable slope) in GraphPad Prism. Nanobody stability studies Nanobody was nebulized with a portable mesh nebulizer (Philips, InnoSpire Go) producing 2-5 m particles at a final concentration of 0.4 mg ml1. The resulting aerosol was collected by condensation into a 50-ml tube cooled on ice. Pre- and post-nebulization samples were ana - lysed by NuPAGE gel and visualized by InstantBlue staining. SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test was also performed to compare the neutralization potency of pre- and post-nebulization samples. For thermostability tests, nanobodies supplemented with loading buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientifc, NP0007) and -mercaptoethanol were heated at 98\u00b0C for 10 min and then analysed on a NuPAGE gel and visualized by performed using a fort\u00e9Bio Octet Red384 instrument to determine the affinity of nanobodies to RBD. In brief, biotinylated- RBD was immobilized onto streptavidin-coated biosensors and then dipped into a solution containing the nanobody for 30 s followed by dissociation for 2-3 min. To assay the coated biosensors and then dip into RBD-Fc solution for association for 1 min followed by dissociation for 1 min. Sensorgrams of the concentration series were corrected with corresponding blank curves and fitted globally with Octet evaluation software using a 1:1 Langmuir model of binding.Nanobody-RBD binding competition assay Nanobody-RBD was performed a instrument. first immo - bilized onto streptavidin coated biosensors and allowed to associate with one of the six nanobodies, then dipped into a solution contained a second nanobody. Negative-staining electron microscopy analysis for the structure of nanobody-spike complex Nanobody-spike complexes were prepared by mixing the two pro - teins at a 1:1 weight ratio, then diluted with a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, adsorbed to a freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid, washed with the above buffer, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. Images were collected at a magnification of 57,000 using EPU on a Thermo Fisher Talos F200C microscope equipped with a 4k \u00d7 4k CETA 16 M camera and operated at 200 kV. The pixel size was 2.5 \u00c5 for the CETA camera. Particle picking, reference-free 2D classification, 3D reconstruction and refinement were performed using cryoSPARC. Cryo-EM data collection and processing Nanobody-spike complexes (Nb12-S6P and Nb30-S6P) were prepared by manual mixture of the two proteins in a 1:1 weight ratio, then diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mg ml1. Samples (2.7 l) were applied to a glow-discharged Quantifoil R 2/2 gold grids and vitrified using a Vitrobot Mark IV with a blot time of 3 s before the grid was plunged into liquid ethane. Data were acquired using the Leginon system installed on Titan Krios electron microscopes operating at 300 kV and equipped with a K3-BioQuantum direct detection device. The dose was fractionated over 40 raw frames and collected over a 2-s exposure time. Motion correc- tion, CTF estimation, particle picking, 2D classifications, ab initio model generation, heterogeneous refinements, 3D variability analysis and homogeneous 3D refinements were carried out with cryoSPARC. Local refinement was performed to resolve the RBD-nanobody interface by using a mask encompassing one copy of the RBD-nanobody complex for refinement, after removing the rest of the density by particle subtraction. Cryo-EM model fitting For initial fits to the cryo-EM reconstructed maps, we used the coor - dinates of the SARS-CoV-2 spike from Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 7JZL, and a nanobody model predicted by the ABodyBuilder server44. These initial models were docked into the cryo-EM maps using Chi - mera. The coordinates were then fit to the electron density more pre- cisely through an iterative process of manual fitting using Coot and real space refinement within Phenix, Molprobity and EMRinger were used to check geometry and evaluate structures at each iteration step. Figures were generated in UCSF ChimeraX and PyMOL (https://pymol. org ). Map-fitting cross correlations were calculated using Fit-in-Map feature in UCSF Chimera. Overall and local resolution of cryo-EM maps was determined using cryoSPARC. Informatics analysis Sequence entropy are based on nine strains The calculated for each residue based on aligned sequences with the formula: px ip xi Entropy= ( )log(( )) i=121 In which xi are standard amino acids, plus gap. The buried surface area on the RBD were calculated for 51 human antibody-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes using the Naccess program.Data presentation Figures arranged in Adobe Illustrator 2020.
