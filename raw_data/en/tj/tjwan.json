What is Ayurveda? Ayurveda is a 5,000 year-old lifestyle science that promotes proactive and preemptive approaches to personal health and wellness Originating in the Indus Valley, what is now modern-day India, Ayurveda is a science of self-healing, and encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle, meditation, postures, breathing exercises and medical herbs along with cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. It is truly a holistic approach to wellness and as a lifestyle medicine it works! There's a reason it has survived for 5,000 across generations, and we're part of this generation's movement to translate this ancient science into today's living and pass on this knowledge to future generations. You are part of the cosmos and the cosmos is part of you According to Ayurveda, everything in the cosmos is reflected and mirrored in the microcosm of the human being. The universe is composed of five elements: ether, air, fire, water, and earth. These five elements combine in varying proportions to create the three doshas: Vata, the principle of movement, Pitta, the principle of transformation, and Kapha, the principle of cohesion or building block material. These elements and doshas that comprise the macrocosm also make up our individual constitutions. The purpose of Ayurveda is to bring balance to these doshas and elements amidst the changing times of day, seasons, and phases of our lives, in order to promote and maintain quality and longevity of life. Optimal health isn't found in a pill or an herbal compound - it's rooted in our day to day routines and choices - how we eat, breathe, move, sleep, interact, and connect with one another. It is a dynamic way of living in tune with nature and our own unique constitution.
