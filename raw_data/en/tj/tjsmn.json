Healings are unique to the individual and there are different types. In this article Energy Healing and Energy Balancing are considered the same Energy healers work with your energy field and sometimes the physical body to assist with the healing process. Some energy healers work directly with physical ailments, while others work with spiritual, emotional and psychological imbalances. Some work with both. Energy is information and everything is made of energy. We experience energy (information) subjectively as emotions, thoughts, and memories. We experience energy objectively through the physical body as physical comfort or discomfort. When the body experiences an illness, pain or mental clutter, it is an energy manifestation which alerts us to an issue we were not aware of on a conscious level. Healing is the process of repair, becoming whole and well. Healing means there is movement of energy, whether it is physical repair, emotional or mental stability. Healing is a shift in energy that encourages balance, awareness, health and wellness. You do not need to have an illness to benefit from energy healing. When we don't understand something we may experience skepticism, doubt or fear of the healer doing something to us. A healer of integrity will always ensure you feel safe, supported and nurtured. At Veracis, when the healer extends his/her hands over a recipient there is not an exchange of energy from one into the other. Rather the healer is assisting the recipient with their own energy flow. If the recipient has a 'negative' reaction to the healing, it is because they are processing something in their energy field. The so called bad experience is merely an indication of something the recipient is processing. It could be as simple as not being open to energy work, not trusting the healer. A healer of integrity will encourage you to do your own healing, ensuring a co-dependent relationship does not develop. When you believe you cannot do your own healing, you give your power away. It is equally important for a healer to receive a hand with the healing process, to be able to ask for help. All healing is self-healing. Veracis Healing Practitioners understand all healing is self healing - they see through the eyes of spiritual sacredness, enlightenment and truth. Using a laying on of hands, physically or non-physically, they assist you with balancing your energy flow in a safe, respectful way. - All healing is self-healing - Your body is a manifestation of your creation as spirit. Heal as spirit and you heal your body. - You have the power to heal yourself and no one else can do it for you. - You may receive assistance with your self-healing process. - You may support another with their self-healing process. - You will only heal what you are ready to heal. - How much and what you heal is unlimited. You decide. You choose. Energy Healing creates a state of overall health and wellness, energy flow and integrity (wholeness). Article by Regina Kaiser - Veracis Wellness Inc. "}
