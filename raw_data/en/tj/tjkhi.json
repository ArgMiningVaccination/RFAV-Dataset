Going to a chiropractor is mostly for the rich, who can augment real medicine with supplements, organic food, and getting a 'spinal adjustment' even if it's not covered by health insurance plans. Life University, the country's largest chiropractic \"college\" is in Georgia and that means a lot more chiropractors than you find elsewhere. Which means the chance for a lot more chance for disinformation and misinformation about medicine to groom gullible people into paying. Such behavior is fraudulent and it's dangerous. If a drug company tried to make dangerous unsubstantiated claims, it would be fined and their CEO could go to jail. But because President Clinton exempted the woo industry from real oversight - his constituents overwhelmingly embraced 'alternative' medicine - unless one of them cripples a baby nothing is done. Mainstream chiropractors are not all anti-vaccine, [Johnny Edwards in the Atlanta Journal Constitution notes](https://www.ajc.com/news/investigations/some-ga-chiropractors-are-stoking-fears-of-covid-vaccines/PVBK2FQIONB6FECRFUJ6HG55QU/). But Life University, he also notes, is routinely anti-vaccine. Their former President even said COVID-19 was fake. Which means anti-vaccine sentiment is a lot more common among chiropractors than many may be admitting. "}
