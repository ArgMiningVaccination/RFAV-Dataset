But for beachgoers and fans of out - door barbeques, one month of winter is too much. Whether you are a summer or winter person, Community Connections is here to offer tips to feel your best during all seasons. In this issue, learn about foods and activities that can help you feel better, more energetic, and relaxed during the colder months. Make sure to check out our articles on meditation and Traditional Chinese Medicine for some suggestions. WHAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO In 2006, nearly 1000 members of the FDNY commu - nity participated in our programs and services. Here are some of the things we did: Yoga classes in Man - hattan, Brentwood, and Staten Island helped mem - bers reduce stress, improve posture, and enhance flexibility. 300 FDNY employees and their family members tried acupuncture with us last year for the first time. The top three reasons you came? For help sleeping and easing your stress and chronic pain. We also ran workshops at the CSU sites on medita - tion, nutrition, aromatherapy, qigong and tai chi, sleep disorders, and the benefits of Chinese herbs. WE CAME TO YOU Community Connections offered acupuncture and massage services closer to you by adding two new sites - out at the Randall's Island training facility and at St. Boniface church just steps away from FDNY Headquarters in Metrotech. We also joined FDNY members at their own events; providing wellness ser - vices and information at FDNY company picnics, holiday celebrations, and at EMS Medal Week. Developing programs for a work force the size of the FDNY is a big challenge. The more contact we have with the community, the easier it is to determine the types of services and pro - grams that interest you. So, if you have ideas for us, or want to find out if we have a program that could help you - even if you aren't sure, contact us for more information. We hope that this winter, we can help you stay active to fight off the winter blues. Take a look at the Community Connections' calendar to see what peaks your interest!

W hat is a healthy diet according to t raditional chinese medicine? a healthy diet is the same in most cultures: Fresh food, prepared with a minimum of chemicals, preservatives, or additives Grains cooked thoroughly for easy and complete digestion Vegetables (not overcooked) to conserve valuable vita - mins and enzymes Diets low in sugar, salt, oil, and fat and high in rough - age and fiber When designing a healthy diet, TCM also looks at unique characteristics in people, the properties of different foods (like hot/cold), and environ - mental/lifestyle factors. how should your diet change with the seasons? optimal health is achieved when the individual is in bal - ance with the world and with nature. For instance, winter is cold and damp, so we recommend eating foods that warm the stomach. If you are going to eat cold foods like salads, balance them with soups and teas. Good winter foods are beef, lamb, chicken, and duck and more cooked foods than raw fruits and vegetables. I treat a lot of patients who have arthritis. Most of them feel worse when it's cold and damp outside. according to TCM, that could be caused by an imbalance in diet or envi - ronmental exposure. What about exercise? \"Winter is a time of storage, rest, repair, and revitalization\". The best way to take care of your body during the colder season is to conserve and replenish energy levels by get - ting light to moderate exercise. Swimming, walking, biking, pilates, yoga and Tai Chi will get the circulation moving, warm up the body, and keep you energized and healthy. are there differences in the way Western medicine and tcm approach illness? There is a famous saying in Chinese medicine: One disease, different treat - ments; Different diseases, one treatment. Two patients may have arthri - tis but could receive different treatments, because the cause of their arthritis is different. on the other hand, someone with arthritis might receive the same treatment as someone reci Pe Winner SWEET & SpICY CHICkEN OvER SESAME NOODLES 12 ounces soba noodles 1 jalapeno (seeds removed) 1/3 cup honey 1/4 cup fresh cilantro 1/2 tspn salt 1/2 tspn black pepper 2 tspn olive oil 1/2 rotisserie chicken (shredded or sliced) 3 tbspn soy sauce 2 tspn sesame oil 1/4 cup chopped scallions Cook soba noodles according to package directions.

In Western medicine, this may seem odd. Western doctors look at signs and symptoms and label them as particular diseases. anyone with the same diagnosis can receive similar treatment. a Chinese medicine practi - tioner, just like your regular doctor, will take a full history including all of your symp - toms, but they will also look at characteristics of the tongue, examine the quality of the pulse, consider emotional fac - tors, and will try to establish an individual's \"pattern of dishar - mony\" before recommending a treatment. For example, if a person suf - fers from arthritis, their pattern might be \"damp heat trapped in the body\" or \"damp cold\". The treatments would be totally dif - ferent for those two patterns.

S itting quietly and breathing are the building blocks of mindful meditation, a technique with growing popularity due to a key result: impoved stress management skills. Mindfulness is that sense of \"flow\" you feel when you're fully engaged. playing sports, woodworking, or practicing a musical instrument can trigger a sense of focus. Mind and body are connected to the present; nothing else seems to matter, you're in The Zone. lakers Coach phil Jackson has used mindfulness medi - atation during championship seasons. \"For me, meditation is a tool that allows me to stay calm and centered (well, most of the time) during the stressful highs and lows of basket - ball and life ...\" phil Jackson states in sacred hoops: spiri - tual Lessons of a hardwood Warrior. When you think of medita - tion, maybe you imagine a monastery, the smell of incense, monks...meditation is part of every great spiri - tual tradition. But you don't need to take monastic vows to learn meditation: mindful - ness practice is available to anyone, any time. So how do you meditate? Did your mom ever tell you to count to ten when you were angry? Meditation is that simple - and that complex.NOW & ZEN INTrOdUCTION TO MINdfUlNEss MEdITATION There are many techniques: one general instruction is to sit quietly, and pay attention to your breath. Then, count your breaths. as you count, notice when thoughts inter - rupt the process of count - ing. When this happens, start counting again from the beginning. In a recent CSU meditation workshop, FDNY members and CSU staffers learned this technique. after two minutes, the instructor requested a show of hands: who had counted to ten? There were no hands raised. Not even the instructor's! It's not easy, but regular practice helps. actually, it's not about count - ing to ten, or doing it \"right\": when you notice the thoughts that naturally interfere with counting, you are meditat - ing. Regular practice creates awareness of the flow and range of thoughts, and leads to an unexpected outcome: a settling and quieting of the mind. The result? Scientists have documented meditation's stress management benefits. In a research study at the Uni - versity of pennsylvania, stu - dents in a weekly mindfulness meditation course reported reductions in anxiety, depres - sion, fatigue, and anger. Students reported increased vigor, and feeling more rested and relaxed. Athletes practice endless ball-handling drills, musicians play scales, and woodworkers measure twice, and cut once. To gain benefits, you must practice. Jackson's teams practice meditation together, because community sup - ports learning. \"When players practice what is known as mindfulness...not only do they play better and win more, they also become more attuned with each other.\" parents teach counting to ten as a mental time-out, so that kids will make a good choice : to respond, rather than to react. In meditation practice, you train yourself to do exactly the same thing. -- anne LibbyTHE CSU MAN hATTAN 251 laFaYETTE ST, 3RD F l (212) 570-1693 STATEN ISLAND 1688 VICT oRY B C oTTaGE, CROO kED HILL ROAD bRENTWOOD (631) 851-6888 ORAN pIKE MIDD lEToWN, (845) 695-1029 secret is not thinking.
