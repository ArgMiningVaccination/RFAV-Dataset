At the Center for Women's Health, our naturopathic doctors work hand in hand with the full range of specialists and providers at OHSU. Important things to know: - We take a whole-body approach to treatment. - Treatments include nutrition, lifestyle changes, herbal medicine and dietary supplements. - We may recommend counseling to encourage overall wellness. - Naturopathy may be especially helpful as you age. - You can use naturopathy alone or together with other medical care. What is naturopathy? Naturopathic doctors treat the whole person rather than the disease. We see a connection between emotional and physical health and look first to diet, exercise and other lifestyle changes before considering herbal supplements. [Six principles of naturopathic medicine](#accordion-1871286-1) First do no harm. This is central to all medical practice. Naturopathy looks first to find natural treatments that are the least invasive. The healing power of nature. Naturopathic doctors understand that the body has a natural ability to heal. They strive to support this path to wellness. Identify and treat the causes. Rather than focus on reducing symptoms, naturopathic doctors look to identify the causes of illness and unease. Doctor as teacher. Naturopathic doctors strive to educate patients rather than simply prescribe. They work with their patients to understand how best to achieve a happy and healthy life. Treat the whole person. Our health is impacted by our bodies, our environment and our lifestyle. Naturopathic doctors look at all aspects of your life as they consider treatment options. Prevention. It's better to prevent illness and suffering than to treat it. Naturopathic medicine helps patients stay well by supporting areas of strength and finding potential areas of concern. What to expect At the Center for Women's Health, your visit with a naturopathic doctor will typically take more time than with a conventional provider. You can expect an hour for an initial visit. We will take a complete history to get to know you and learn about your diet, exercise, digestion, energy level, sleep, lifestyle, menstrual cycles, hobbies, work, mood, health concerns, medicines, supplements and more. This information helps us understand your strengths and weaknesses and figure out where natural medicine might help. We take a holistic approach to treatment. If you have a migraine headache, for example, we won't just write a prescription. We will look at your diet, physical activity, sleep patterns and mental health to find the best options for healing. We work closely with your conventional providers. Naturopathy can complement your treatment by: - Treating side effects of conventional medicine. - Adding to the effectiveness of conventional medicine. - Helping you reduce your dose of conventional medicine. - Treating conditions that don't respond to conventional medicine.
