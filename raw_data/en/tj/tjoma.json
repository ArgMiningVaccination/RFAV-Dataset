TABLE OF CONTENTS Exhaustion, Fatigue and Chiropractic Your Nerves and Chiropractic Hypertension - Pain In The Neck Autism-Vaccine Link Finally Admitted Mammograms Offer No Health Benefits Whatsoever, Doctors Conclude Chiropractic Research Amazing Nutrition Experiment Nutrition Myths How our government \"protects\" our health Did you know? Humor References Exhaustion, Fatigue and Chiropractic Why do people often feel an improvement in their energy with chiropractic care? There are many reasons. One ha s to do with balance: as your hips, head and overall body structure become more balanced, you become more efficient and don't have to expend extra energy on misaligned body parts. Im agine walking around with your head slightly off center - you'd hav e loads of stress on your neck, shoulders, hips, legs and feet that would weaken your joints, create arthritis, wear down y our discs and lower your energy. Unless you are balanced you can't function with ease and grace; every step drains energy and the evening finds you falling asleep with a book or in front of the TV (unless you have young kids, then you're trying to sleep every free moment). In addition to fatigue, signs of structural im balance include feelings of tightness, joints that are \"noisy,\" an inability to move or turn in either direct ion or as easily as you once could and premature aging. Make sure you're balanced - come in for a chiropractic checkup. Your Nerves and Chiropractic This illustration shows how the nerve s traveling from your brain and spinal cord connect to your st omach, intestines, reproductive organs, glands, muscles, eyes, ears, arms, legs, hands, feet - everywhere. Nerves send information, energy and even nourishment to your body parts. If there is the slightes t blockage to this communication, nearly any system (digestive, elimi native, immune, cardiovascular, vision, hearing, nervous, etc.) can function less efficiently and you will not be able to adapt as easily to physical, chemical, emotional or environmental stresses. This state is called dis-ease - it is a pre-disease state, one of weakness, lowered resistance to germs and a reduced ability to maintain chemical balance. Subluxations interfer e with your nerve communications. Most people who are ill have subluxations - oft en with no pain at the site of the subluxation itself. Doctors of Chiropracti c are specially trained to locate and correct subluxations, hidden distortions that cause dis-ease and interfere with your health and happiness. Please tell a ll your friends who are living on drugs or are suffering that they probably have subluxations in their body that only a Doctor of Chiropractic can locate and correct. Hypertension: Pain In The Neck http://abcnews.go.com/Vi deo/playerIndex?id=4519444 Watch this interesting ABC News story on Chiropractic and high blood pressure. A non- drug way of dealing with high blood pressure? Amazing! Autism-Vaccine Link Admitted The US government has finally admitted, a fter decades of denials, that vaccinations are linked to autism. However, government o fficials are now circling the wagons. An excellent example of official obfuscation is seen in this interview with Julie Garberding, MD, director of the Centers for Disease Control. Her evasi ons and half-truths regarding autism are clearly shown even though she ha s no choice but to admit vaccines are linked to autism. Even t hough Dr. Gupta does not cha llenge her statements, the between-the-scenes written comments are excellent. En joy this fascinating and revealing interview. http://adventuresinautism.blogspo t.com/2008/03/julie-gerberding- admits-on-cnn-that.html Mammograms Offer No Health Benefits Whatsoever, Doctors Conclude An increasing number of doctors are c ontesting the claim that annual mammograms decrease women's risk of dying from breast cancer...other doctors have begun to assert that in addition to failing to offer protec tion, mammograms \u2014 which involve exposing patients to radiation \u2014 may actually incr ease women's risk of cancer. According to some authorities, the squeezi ng of women's breasts duri ng mammograms may rupture blood vessels, causing cancer to spread to other parts of t he body and actually increasing a patient's risk of death. (1) Chiropractic Research Polio and Chiropractic , a case study. A 69-year-old retired female post-polio sufferer had left hand pain of over 40 years duration and limited flexion of the fingers of her left hand. The polio left the woman disabled, with the muscles of her right arm severely wasted and affected so badly that it was now practically useless. Her surgeon recommended surgery. After her firs t chiropractic adjustment, her left hand changed color from white to pi nk. Over the next few days she continued to notice hand improvement as well as a discontinuation of the itching in her hand. Her hand str ength improved and there was also improvement in her posture, scoliosis and gait. The woman returned to her surgeon who said surgery was no longer recommended. In a survey of 500 post-polio sufferers, chiropractors received the highest patient satisfaction ratings at 45% while MDs received the lowest percentage at 22%. (2) Sciatica. Forty-four patients experiencing sudden and painful low back pain were evaluated by orthopedists who could not fi nd anything wrong. They were given the diagnosis of \"acute sciatica.\" A doctor of ch iropractic located subluxations in all 44 who received chiropractic care. At a two-year follow-up all but two patients had returned to work. In addition, the period of sick leav e was two-thirds that of patients under conventional medical treatment. (3) Autism. A 3\u00bd-year-old girl who was diagnos ed with autism a year earlier (reduced social interaction, language skills and learning di fficulties) was brought in for chiropractic care. Both the chiropractor and the parents not iced improvements in social interactions, language skills and increased symmetry in su rface EMG (electrical muscle firing) and thermal scanning (spinal heat readings) over 10 weeks of care. (4) Amazing Nutrition Experiment A woman was worried about her family's addiction to diet soda. After researching the effects of aspartame, she decided to perform her own experiment. She got 108 rats. For nearly 3 years she fed some of the rats the equivalent, for their body weight, of two-thirds the aspartame contained in 8-oz. of diet soda each day. Eleven of the females who took aspartame - 37% - developed tumors, some of massive size. Fo r details about this amazing experiment go to http://myasparta meexperiment.com/index.php . How Our Government \"Protects\" Our Health According to K. Paul Stolle r, MD: \"Out of about 120 million doses of the worthless flu vaccine shipped for the 2007-08 flu season about 87% contained some level of Thimerosal (mercury) and at least 42% contained the maximum level.\" (5) Did You Know...? Unlike vinyl records, a CD begins playing near the center and spirals outwards toward the edge. Grapes will not float in Jell-O. The grapefruit was not named for how it tastes, but for the way it grows - in bunches. The avocado is indigenous to C entral America and, because of its shape, derives its name from the Aztec word ahucatl - meaning \"testicle.\" The notion that someone is \"mad as a hatter\" stems from the fact that in the early 19th century, felt hat makers used merc ury to stabilize wool. Many of them developed uncontrollable tr emors, confused speech and hallucinations. The voices for many of the characters on The Simpsons, according to the actors who do them, are nothing more than \"bad ce lebrity impressions:\" Moe Syzlak is Al Pacino, Louie cop) is based on Sylvester Stallone, and Mayor Quimby was inspired by John F. Kennedy. Humor A teacher was giving a lesson on the circulati on of the blood. Trying to make the matter clearer, she said, 'Now, class, if I stood on my head, the blood, as you know, would run into it, and I would turn red in the face.' 'Yes,' the class said. 'Then why is it that while I am standing upright in the ordinary position, the blood doesn't run into my feet?' A little fellow shouted, 'Cause your feet ain't empty.' **If you would like to share this ne wsletter with a friend, visit our website at www.myECchiro.com ** See you next month.
