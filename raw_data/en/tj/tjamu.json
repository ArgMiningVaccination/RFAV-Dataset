When I think back to my kitchen pantry in my early adult years I kind of cringe. There would have been packages of ramen noodles, cans of soup, artificially flavored mac-n-cheese, microwave popcorn, and who knows what else! At that point I was just barely learning how to cook on my own and I didn't quite understand the concept of having a pantry full of staples to help guide me toward [healthy meals](https://mindfulmomma.com/recipes/). Meal prep was last-minute and health wasn't the biggest priority. Fast forward many years and my pantry looks completely different! For one thing, the sheer amount of food I keep in my pantry is much bigger - now that I have a husband and two hungry teenagers to feed! Most importantly, I've learned that the key to healthy meal planning is having a pantry full of healthy staples to pull from! By healthy pantry staples I'm talking about everything from grains and beans, to sauces, oils and seasonings, to flour and baking supplies and of course coffee. It also includes nuts, seeds and dried fruits - really anything that will help you pull off a healthy meal. Pantry staples can also include snacks and treats too - at least in my view of the world! (Check out my list of [50+ healthy pantry staples](https://mindfulmomma.com/healthy-pantry-staples/) I recommend you keep stocked in your pantry.) Although I purchase my groceries in many places, including my local grocery store, I have found one source that has the best selection and lowest prices on the healthy pantry staples I am looking for - and that is the online store called Thrive Market.

(Or a Whole Foods but with great prices!) Prices at Thrive Market are 25 to 50% below retail prices, which is a significant savings over what you'll find at most stores. You do pay an annual membership fee but it is easy to earn it back in just a couple of orders. When you order from Thrive Market you can be assured that there are no GMOs in the food you are buying.
