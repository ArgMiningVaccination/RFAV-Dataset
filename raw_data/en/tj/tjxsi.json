It is primarily known for its essential oils, which give the tea a pleasant, slightly tart and bitter touch. There is a good reason why the bergamot is often also called \"green gold\". White tea was reserved for the Chinese imperial court in earlier times. Now it is still considered to be one of the most valuable types of tea in the world due to its subtle aroma and elaborate processing. About 30,000 tea buds are required to make one kilogramme of white tea. They are gently dried under special conditions of light and air, which gives the tea its mild-soft taste. To this today, it is still not clear where the lemon - a member of the citrus family - actually came from. It is presumed that its origins were in northern India. But due to its refreshing-sour taste, it has already been spread around the world for thousands of years. Limes are the intensive-sourish relatives of lemons. They were brought to southern Europe in the Middle Ages by the Crusaders. Their fruit pulp is so sour that the green citrus fruits are usually not eaten in their natural state but serve as a refreshing ingredient in beverages and foods. "}
