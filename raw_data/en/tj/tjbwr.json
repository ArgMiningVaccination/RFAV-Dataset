It holds that the body's vital energy (chi or qi) circulates through channels (\"meridians\") that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions. Illness is attributed to imbalance or interruption of chi. The diagnostic process used by TCM practitioners may include questioning (medical history, lifestyle), observations (skin, tongue, color), listening (breathing sounds), and pulse-taking (claimed to determine which meridians are \"deficient\" in chi). Treatment with acupuncture and herbs is claimed to \"restore balance.\" - These concepts are not based on the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community. Moreover the scope and quality of acupuncture education do not prepare most practitioners to make adequate diagnoses and provide appropriate treatment. - The [Traditional Acupuncture Institute](http://www.tai.edu/treatment_faq.html)makes the following claims about its services: Traditional acupuncture, proven effective over thousands of years, is directed toward good health, vitality, balance, longevity, and alleviation of stress. . . . If you have any chronic symptoms or illnesses, whether physical, mental or emotional in nature; If your daily activities place great demands on your vitality and well-being; If you can imagine being healthier, more balanced, more vital than you are now; If you are committed to improving the quality of life... Our treatment centres can serve you - I do not believe that a leader of any organization built on a mountain of nonsense \u2014 or that makes sweeping promises that it can't keep \u2014 should be asked for advice about research priorities, how to train practitioners, or \"integration\" into medical education. [Overview of IOM \"CAM\" Committee](camcommittee.html) This article was revised on January 15, 2005. [Hide Full Content](#fourteen-thousand-fifty-two) [Institute of Medicine Committee Issues Irresponsible \"CAM\" Report](https://quackwatch.org/political-activities/iomreport/) The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has published a 350-page report [1] assembled by a committee dominated by advocates of \"complementary and alternative medicine.\" The committee\u2014which I refer to below as the \"CAM Committee\"\u2014recommends amending the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act to enable greater public protection against misleading claims made for dietary supplements, but nearly all of its other recommendations are poorly reasoned.

The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has published a [350-page report](http://www.nap.edu/books/0309092701/html/) [1] assembled by a committee dominated by advocates of \"complementary and alternative medicine.\" The committee\u2014which I refer to below as the \"CAM Committee\"\u2014recommends amending the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act to enable greater public protection against misleading claims made for dietary supplements, but nearly all of its other recommendations are poorly reasoned. Neither the IOM nor the parent organization, the National Academy of Sciences, has endorsed the report. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), which provided funding for the report, limited who could be on the \"CAM\" Committee by barring all persons whom the project administrators perceived as critics of irrational \"CAM\" practices. These critics, including me, were also excluded from presenting meaningful testimony to the \"CAM\" Committee or participating in prepublication review of the report. Yet neither NCCAM nor IOM cared one bit that many of the \"CAM\" committee members have economic and/or occupational conflicts of interest or strong commitments to irrational \"CAM\" ideology [2]. Some have also served on an NCCAM council or received an NCCAM research grant. Like the [White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy](WHC/00.html) [3], the \"CAM\" Committee fails to specify what methods it is talking about and fails to note that \"CAM\" is a marketing term rather than a definable set of methods. Its report states that CAM practices are widespread and increasing in use, but some of the data it cites are misleading. The report begins by stating that \"total visits to CAM providers each year now exceeding those to primary-care physicians\" and that \"annual out-of pocket costs for CAM that are estimated to exceed $27 billion.\" These figures were published in a 1993 report by David Eisenberg, M.D. and are unfounded. Contrary to these estimates, Eisenberg inflated his results by misrepresenting established methods as \"unconventional.\" [4] That survey and other surveys actually show that only about 10% of the population visit an \"alternative\" practitioner in one year, and that fewer than 1% visit acupuncturists, homeopaths, or naturopaths. Most visits are to chiropractors, many of whom treat patients far more often than is needed. During the past ten years, the use of dietary supplements and herbs has increased, but most of that increase has been due to the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which weakened FDA regulation and relaxed rules against false advertising [5]. The \"CAM\" Committee report makes sweeping generalizations and attempts to set an agenda for widespread adoption of \"CAM\" research and teaching. Neither is justified. Despite spending more than $500 million over more than a decade on such research, the NCCAM has not produced one study that validates any \"CAM\" practice as safe or meaningfully effective for treating any illness or condition [6]. Nor is there any reason to believe that the teaching envisioned by the committee will provide science-based information to its recipients. One-Sided Statements The CAM Committee report contains many other statements that display its bias. Here are some examples, each of which is followed by my bracketed comments. \"Decisions about the use of specific CAM therapies should primarily depend on whether they have been shown to be safe and effective. But this is easier said than done, as there are extremes of belief about what counts as evidence. For some individuals, evidence limited to their own experience or knowledge is all that is necessary as proof that a CAM therapy is successful; for others, no amount of evidence is sufficient. This report will please neither of those extremes.\" [This statement insinuates that that people who criticize\"CAM\" practices or claims are closed-minded extremists. This is a \"straw man\" propaganda tactic. I would be very surprised if anyone on the \"CAM\" Committee could name a single person who fits its description of a closed-minded critic or provide a single good example of a safe and effective treatment that has been excluded from standard care because of ideological preference.] \"There are unproven ideas of all kinds, stemming from CAM and conventional medicine alike, and the committee believes that the same principles and standards of evidence should apply regardless of a treatment's origin. Study results may then move useful therapies from unproven ideas into evidence-based practice.\" [This statement falsely implies that \"CAM\" methods are sufficiently promising that our society should greatly increase the resources it focuses on these methods. I do not believe that is true. This statement also implies that \"CAM\" methods and scientific methods are equally promising. It also implies that not enough research has been done. On the contrary, there have been hundreds of trials and many systematic reviews of acupuncture and homeopathy, far more than needed to determine whether or not they are useful. There is wide agreement among specialists in bioethics, research design, and regulatory affairs about what constitutes evidence, how to gather it, and how to evaluate it. The fanciful notion about \"extremists\" is raised because scientific and ethical guidelines significantly impede the \"CAM\" agenda, which is for all intents and purposes, allergic to regulation and oversight.] \"A therapy should not be excluded from consideration because it does not meet anyone particular criterion\u2014say, biological plausibility.\" [This statement refers to research funding. The \"CAM\" Committee lists nine factors to consider when deciding which research proposals should receive priority. The list includes biological plausibility, potential for benefit, and preliminary supporting evidence. This list, however, does not include whether or not previous research is promising or consistently negative. I believe that biological implausibility plus lack of evidence of efficacy should be enough to bar government funding of studies for the purpose of establishing effectiveness. The NCCAM has funded many studies of methods that had neither a plausible rationale nor supporting evidence. Despite using the listed criteria for over ten years, the NCCAM has yet to conclude that any \"CAM\" method should either be be adopted or abandoned. Moreover, I don't know of any instance where a research outcome caused an ineffective \"CAM\" method to disappear. Why didn't the IOM's \"CAM\" Committee comment on these problems? And why didn't it identify any methods that, based on current knowledge, should be discarded?] \"Tools are also needed to aid conventional practitioners' decisionmaking about offering or recommending CAM, where patients might be referred, and what organizational structures are most appropriate for the delivery of integrated care. The committee believes that the overarching rubric for guiding the development of these tools should be the goal of providing comprehensive care that is safe, effective, interdisciplinary, and collaborative; is based on the best scientific evidence available; recognizes the importance of compassion and caring; and encourages patients to share in the choices of therapeutic options. [This falsely implies that a large numbers of \"CAM\" methods can be integrated. That makes as much sense as saying that astronomers should collaborate with astrologers. Note carefully that the IOM Committee doesn't say much about what methods should be integrated\u2014and it says nothing about which ones should not. Why didn't the committee recommend steering patients away from irrational methods?] \"Studies show that patients frequently do not limit themselves to a single modality of care\u2014they do not see CAM and conventional medicine as being mutually exclusive\u2014and this pattern will probably continue and may even expand as evidence of therapies' effectiveness accumulates. Therefore it is important to understand how CAM and conventional medical treatments (and providers) interact with each other and to study models of how the two kinds of treatments can be provided in coordinated ways. In that spirit, there is an urgent need for health systems research that focuses on identifying the elements of these integrative-medicine models, their outcomes, and whether they are cost-effective when compared to conventional practice.\" [This statement implies that popularity (marketing success) is related to effectiveness. It's far more likely that use is related to misleading publicity. Note that the \"CAM\" Committee says little about what methods should be integrated\u2014and it says nothing about which ones should not.] Self-Serving Recommendations The \"CAM\" Committee report contains recommendations in bold-faced type scattered throughout its Executive Summary. For ease of reading, I have distilled them into 13 items to which I respond: The same principles and standards of evidence of treatment effectiveness apply to all treatments, whether currently labeled as conventional medicine or CAM. The committee further states that implementing this recommendation requires that \"investigators use and develop as necessary, common methods, measures, and standards for the generation and interpretation of evidence necessary for making decisions about the use of CAM and conventional therapies.\" [I disagree. Methods that could work only if the laws of chemistry and physics are rescinded should require extraordinary evidence. These include homeopathy, therapeutic touch, electrodermal testing, and other approaches that postulate the existence of nonmaterial energies.] The U.S. Congress and federal agencies should amend the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 and the current regulatory scheme for dietary supplements, with emphasis on strengthening quality control; labeling; enforcement against misleading claims; research into how consumers use supplements; incentives for privately funded research; and consumer protection against \"all possible hazards.\" [I agree with this recommendation but would add that herbal products are not dietary supplements and should be regulated differently.] The NIH and other public agencies provide the support necessary to develop and implement (a) a surveillance system that collects data on patterns of use of CAM and conventional medicine; (b) practice-based research networks; and (c) CAM research centers to facilitate the work of the networks by analyzing information from national surveys, identifying important questions, designing studies, coordinating data collection and analysis, and providing training in research and other areas. [I disagree. No such system should be set up before it is clear what \"CAM\" practices, if any, are worth studying and what practical use the data would have.] The NIH and other public agencies should provide the support necessary to include CAM-relevant questions in federally funded health surveys such as the National Health Interview Survey, the Nurses health Study, and the Framingham Heart Study. [I am skeptical. Quite a bit is already known. More surveys would enable \"CAM\" proponents to create news events, but whether the data would serve any useful purpose is unclear. Moreover, the number of \"CAM\" claims is countless and keeps expanding as promoters dream up new ways to sell their wares.] The NIH and other public agencies should provide the support necessary to assess the changes in prevalence, patterns, perceptions, and costs of therapy use (both CAM and conventional). [I disagree. As noted in the above paragraph, more survey data would enable \"CAM\" proponents to create news events, but whether the data would serve any useful purpose is unclear.] The NIH and other public and private agencies sponsor research to compare outcomes and costs of combinations of CAM and conventional medical treatments and models that deliver such care. [I wonder what methods the \"CAM\" Committee thinks should be studied in this way. Combining effective and ineffective methods will raise costs without increasing effectiveness.] The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs should support research on \"integrated care delivery,\" as well as the development of a research infrastructure within such organizations and clinical training programs to expand the number of providers able to work in integrated care. [This falsely implies that enough value already exists for our government to make large investments that support \"CAM\" practices.] Health profession schools should incorporate sufficient information about CAM into the standard curriculum at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels to enable licensed professionals to competently advise their patients about CAM. [This might be useful if the teachings were sure to be science-based and sufficiently critical. But surveys cited later in this report suggest that most \"CAM\" instruction in medical schools today promotes irrational methods. The \"CAM\" committee doesn't appear to have considered whether medical school curricula are already overcrowded with information that is more important than \"CAM\" information.] Federal and state agencies, and private and corporate foundations, alone and in partnership, should create models in research training for CAM practitioners. [This recommendation falsely implies that \"CAM\" is fertile territory for effective methods that just need to be discovered. However, the more money that is wasted chasing \"CAM\" clouds, the less will be available for pursuing promising science-based methods. No cadre of researchers for \"CAM\" methods is needed. If \"CAM\" methods were truly promising, researchers would flock to studying them. Before creating more \"research models,\" it would be appropriate to determine whether they would lead to anything useful. This also implies that many \"CAM\" practitioners and practices have a great deal to offer the scientific community if given a chance. I doubt that this is true. Many of them have sufficient bias that they cannot conduct responsible research. Moreover, training support should be based on qualifications and not whether of not someone is identified as a \"CAM\" practitioner.] National professional organizations for all CAM disciplines should ensure the presence of training standards and develop practice guidelines. Health care professional licensing boards and accrediting and certifying agencies (for both CAM and conventional medicine) should set competency standards in the appropriate use of both conventional medicine and CAM therapies, consistent with practitioners' scope of practice and standards of referral across health professions. [What planet does the \"CAM\" committee live on? It is not possible to establish useful guidelines for useless practices. It is not possible to set competency standards for quack practices. It is ludicrous to think that pseudoscientific practitioners can create valid guidelines. Moreover, is very little evidence that \"CAM\" guidelines would have much effect on patient care. The only guidelines I know of are chiropractic. One set, which is relatively sensible, has some good points but fails to criticize nearly everything that chiropractors do wrong. Some insurance companies have found it useful in stopping payment for certain practices, but no effect on patient care has been demonstrated. Another set is delusion-based, has zero value for patients, and is being used to try to force insurance companies to pay for irrational treatment.] A user-friendly authoritative Website on CAM modalities should be created. [This begs the question of who would operate such a site and whether a government or government-funded agency would be permitted to criticize quack \"CAM\" methods if it wished to do so. Despite two years of work and considerable funding, the \"CAM\" Committee report doesn't identify a single \"CAM\" practice that should be suspect. At present, Quackwatch provides lots of \"user friendly authoritative\" information on \"CAM\" modalities. Yet the IOM officials in charge of producing this report would not permit me to participate in a meaningful way in its preparation. Moreover, for more than 10 years, many federal agencies have (a)referred questioners to organizations that provide misinformation and (b) refused to recommend organizations that provide high-quality information on \"CAM\" topics.] The National Institutes of Health and other public or private agencies should sponsor quantitative and qualitative research to examine (a) the social and cultural dimensions of illness experiences, health care-seeking processes and preferences, and practitioner-patient interactions; (b) how often patients and providers adhere to treatment instructions and guidelines; (c) the effects of CAM on wellness and disease-prevention; (d) how the American public accesses and evaluates information about CAM modalities; and (e) adverse events associated with CAM therapies and interactions between CAM and conventional treatments. [A good place to start would be to investigate the harm done by the widespread recommendations by chiropractors and naturopaths who oppose vaccination.] The National Library of Medicine and other federal agencies should develop criteria to assess the quality and reliability of information about CAM. [Those criteria already exist. They are part of scientific methodology. Furthermore, the National Library of Medicine is not trustworthy. Its MEDLINE database includes least 30 journal that advocate bogus \"CAM\" claims but excludes the one journal that specializes in the scientific analysis of bogus claims.] Brazen Conclusions The Executive Summary of the \"CAM\" Committee report concludes: We are in the midst of an exciting time of discovery, when evidence based approaches to health bring opportunities for incorporating the best from all sources of care, be they conventional medicine or CAM. Our challenge is to keep an open mind and to regard each treatment possibility with an appropriate degree of skepticism. Only then will we be able to ensure that we are making informed and reasoned decisions. I disagree. We are in the Golden Age of Quackery. The big discoveries in recent years have been (a) how clinical trial methods can be misused and manipulated, (b) how whole populations can be tricked, (c) how research dollars can be wasted, and (d) how the medical scientific establishment can be corrupted by grant money. The \"CAM\" Committee has utterly failed in its mission. Instead of advocating the bedrock principle that priorities for human experimentation should be based on plausibility, it proposes to change the rules of science. Our society's real challenge is to support only promising approaches and become open to discarding irrational ones. In response to the report, NCCAM's director (Stephen E. Strauss, M.D.) issued a news release that is even more brazen than the report itself. He stated: The IOM report speaks to a set of principles that apply not only to CAM but to all research. This is an achievement that has now elevated the discussion of CAM beyond the advocacy and skepticism that has long hampered the evolution of CAM science. The conclusion that CAM research should be held to the same rigorous standards as conventional medicine will further the scientific investigation of this new field, increase its legitimacy as a research area, and ultimately improve the public health. . . . It is particularly gratifying that the IOM findings and recommendations mirror the advice that NCCAM independently accrued over the past year in its extensive strategic planning process to formalize its research agenda for the years 2005-2009. Issues common both to NCCAM's new plan and the IOM report include the resolution to ensure rigor in CAM studies, to increase the emphasis on health services research, and to consider the ethical, legal, and social implications of CAM research and integrated medicine. Drawing upon the added insights and knowledge that the IOM report provides, NCCAM and its sister research institutes and agencies will continue our efforts to establish the safety and efficacy of CAM practices while upholding the highest standards of science [7]. Gratifying? I can see why Dr. Strauss thinks that. If the \"CAM\" Committee report is implemented, the biggest financial recipient is likely to be his agency, which funded the report and helped ensure that its conclusions were precisely what he wanted.

Simonian, being first duly sworn, depose and state as follows: I. Introduction 1. I am a Special Agent with the United States Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA/OCI), and have been so employed since September of 1997. I am assigned to the Boston, Massachusetts Resident Office. Prior to my employment with FDA, I conducted criminal investigations as a Special Agent with the U.S. Department of Labor for eight (8) years. I have attended numerous federal agency sponsored training courses and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I am responsible for conducting criminal investigations involving violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other federal statutes enforced by FDA. 2. This affidavit is submitted in support of a search warrant for The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, which operates at the address of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island. 3. This affidavit is also submitted in support of a seizure warrant for Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0. The account constitutes evidence of the commission of a criminal offense, or constitutes contraband, fruits of crime, or things otherwise criminally possessed within the meaning of Fed.R. Crm. P. 41(b), and is subject to forfeiture pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(a)(l)(A) and, therefore, may also be seized pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(b). 4. As part of my duties as a Special Agent with FDA/OCI, I am currently investigating allegations of the following illegal activity: (1) Mail Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71341, which makes it a federal crime for a person, having devised or intended to devise a scheme to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, for the purpose of executing such scheme, to place or cause to be placed in any post office or authorized depository for mail or to take or receive there from any matter or thing; and, (2) Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71343, which makes it a federal crime for a person, having devised or intended to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, to transmit or cause to be transmitted by wire, radio or telephone communications in interstate commerce any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice. 5. In addition, I am investigating allegations of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71956(a)(l)(A)(i), which makes it a federal crime to knowingly conduct and attempt to conduct financial transactions affecting interstate commerce which involve the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, in this case, Mail and Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71341 and 1343, with the intent to promote the carrying on of said specified unlawful activity. To that end, I am seeking a seizure warrant for forfeiture of Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(a)(l), which provides for the seizure of any and all property which was involved in the transactions constituting money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. 6. FDA is the agency of the United States Government charged with the responsibility of protecting the American public by enforcing the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7301-397, to ensure that, among other things, drugs and medical devices sold for use by or upon humans and animals are safe and effective and bear labeling containing true and accurate information. 7. Since April of 2004, your affiant and investigators from the FDA/OCI Task Force, the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CID), and individuals from the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) have conducted the investigation detailed below, which has established probable cause to believe that the above-described unlawful activity has been and is being perpetrated by and at the direction of Dr. John E. Curran, a Naturopath whose practice, The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, operates at the address of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island. 8. The information set forth in this affidavit is based on information obtained by your affiant and from other investigators involved in this case, interviews conducted by your affiant and other investigators, review of documents, and two separate undercover meetings with John Curran. The affidavit does not contain every fact known to me with respect to this investigation. Rather, it contains those facts that I believe to be necessary to establish probable cause for issuance of a search warrant for the premises of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, and for the issuance of a seizure warrant for Citizen's Account No. 1452-751-0. 11. II. Premise to be searched 9. This affidavit is offered in support of a search warrant for the business premises of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing, which is operated by John E. Curran. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing is located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island 10. One Richmond Square is a three-story brick office complex. A marking of One Richmond Square is located above the main entrance of the building. The premise to be searched is located within One Richmond Square, at Suite 310E, which is located on the third floor of the complex. The entrance door to the office is identified as \"310 E\". 11. Suite 301E, all of which is to be searched, is described as follows: Upon entering the suite there is a patient waiting area. To the right is a bathroom and to the left is a half door, which leads to the \"Pharmacy\" area. Supplement stock is in view on the shelves in the pharmacy area. A doorway, which leads from the waiting room to the main interior office, is located adjacent to the bathroom door. To the right of the main interior office is a room with \"therapy\" equipment. Across from that room is John Curran's office. Located on one side of Curran's office is a \"thermal imaging room\" and on the other side of the office is a room where exams are conducted. There is also door located next to the desk in the main interior office. It is unknown where this doorway leads, A diagram of the suite is attached as part of Attachment A. 111. The Scheme A. Summary 12. The investigation has revealed that John Curran induces patients to purchase expensive treatment plans and for alleged nutritional or therapeutic materials in order to cure them of alleged actual or imminent diseases that Curran claims to have diagnosed. Although he is not qualified to diagnose diseases, Curran advises his patients, among other things, that: (1) they have live parasites in their blood stream; (2) that they have a severely reduced number of blood cells; (3) that they have certain deficient \"body functions;\" (4) that they have worms in their blood; (5) that they have holes in their blood; and (6) that they have a life threatening disease. Curran provides the majority of his diagnoses by performing a \"live blood analysis\" or a \"bio-meridian test.\" As is further described below, neither test is designed to diagnose disease. 13. Upon providing a patient with the diagnoses, Curran promotes and sells the use of his treatment programs or alleged pharmacological materials, the cost of which ranges from approximately $200 to $10,000. Curran accepts cash, checks or credit cards, or, alternatively, promotes a credit service provided by GE Capital that will provide his patients with a line of credit to purchase his services. The line of credit is referred to as a \"Credit Care Card.\" Examples of what he sells are products referred to as \"E-water\", and a super \"green drink.\" Curran claims that E-water is therapeutic water, but the investigation has determined it is regular distilled water that Curran labels as \"E-water.\" The \"green drink\" appears to be a compilation of ingredients with no therapeutic value. B. The Practice of Medicine 14. Under Rhode Island state law (R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 5-37-I), the \"practice of medicine\" includes: the practice of allopathic and osteopathic medicine. Any person is regarded as practicing medicine . . . who holds himself or herself out as being able to diagnose, treat, operate, or prescribe for any person ill or alleged to be ill with disease, pain, injury, deformity or abnormal physical or mental condition, or who either professes to heal, offer or undertake, by any means or method to diagnose, treat, operate, or prescribe for any person for disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical or mental condition. In addition, one who attaches the title MD, physician, surgeon, D.O., osteopathic physician and surgeon, or any other similar word or words or abbreviation to his or her name indicating that he or she is engaged in the treatment or diagnosis of the diseases, injuries or conditions of persons shall be held to be engaged in the practice of medicine. R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 5-37-1. 15. Curran is not a licensed physician. However, the investigation has determined that Curran claims to have received a medical degree from St. Luke's School of Medicine located in Liberia, Africa. In addition, he holds himself out in promotional materials as \"Dr. John Curran, N.D., M.D.\" In addition, in his promotional materials, Curran also boasts other academic degrees such as a doctorate in naturopathy from the American Institute of Natural Healing, a doctorate of naturopathic medicine from the Southern College of Naturopathic Medicine and continuing education certificates from Brown University and Harvard University. 16. As outlined below, although Curran is not a licensed physician and cannot legally practice medicine, it is part of his scheme to lead his patients to believe that he has diagnosed serious medical conditions that require immediate attention. However, in response to a complaint filed against him with the R.I. Board of Medicine, and in order to avoid the Board's jurisdiction, Curran's lawyer, A. David Tammelleo, in March of 2003, advised the Board he is not subject to their jurisdiction because he \"is not practicing nor purporting to practice medicine.\" 17. In the letter, Mr. Tammelleo also referenced R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14. Section 23-74-14 states in pertinent part that: All unlicensed health care practitioners shall provide to each unlicensed health care client prior to providing treatment a written copy of the unlicensed health care client bill of rights. A copy must also be posted in a prominent location in the office of the unlicensed health care practitioner. Reasonable accommodations shall be made for those clients who cannot read or who have communication impairments and those who do not read or speak English. The unlicensed health care client bill of rights shall include the following: (1) The name, unlicensed health care title, business address, and telephone number of the unlicensed health care practitioner; (2) The degrees, training, experience, or other qualifications of the practitioner regarding the unlicensed health care being provided, followed by the following statement in bold print: \"The state of Rhode Island has not adopted any educational and training standards for unlicensed health care practitioners. This statement of credentials is for information purposes only. Under Rhode Island law, an unlicensed health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis. If a client desires a diagnosis from a licensed physician, chiropractor, or acupuncture practitioner, or services from a physician, chiropractor, nurse, osteopath, physical therapist, dietician, nutritionist, acupuncture practitioner, athletic trainer, or any other type of health care provider, the client may seek such services at any time\" R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14 (emphasis added). 18. The investigation has revealed that, in compliance with R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14, Curran provides his clients with a document entitled \"Client Bill of Rights,\" in which he advises patients that he is not a licensed physician and which states that an unlicensed health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis. Despite his disclaimer, however, it appears that Curran's method of practice is to identify himself as \"Dr. Curran\" and to induce patients to believe that they are, or will become seriously ill, and that he can cure them or prevent disease. C. Naturopathy 19. According to the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, a licensed medical school located in Tempe, Arizona, Naturopathic Medicine is the philosophy of treating disease and restoring health using natural therapies. It strongly promotes prevention in health care and a non-invasive approach to treatment including: acupuncture and oriental medicine, homeopathy, botanical medicine, nutritional counseling, mind-body medicine, hydrotherapy and physical medicine. 20. Naturopathic physicians (NDs) attend a four-year graduate level naturopathic medical program and are educated in all of the same basic sciences as in conventional medical school. Studies concentrate on holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. Graduates sit for professional board exams to become licensed as naturopathic doctors within licensed states or as jurisdiction allows. 21. On his website, www.drcurran.com, Curran advises that Naturopathic Medicine \"is a distinct medical system of healthcare: an art, science, and practice of diagnosing and treating people and preventing disease. It honors clients as unique human beings, enabling them to take responsibility for their own health. It is based upon the belief that the body has an innate natural ability to heal itself when given the appropriate internal and external healing environment.\" 22. Curran advises his patients through promotional materials that he is a Board Certified and Licensed General Practitioner of Naturopathic Medicine from the District of Columbia. Your affiant has reviewed an application that Curran submitted to the District of Columbia for a license. It appears that Curran paid $150 for the application. He represented in the application that he attended the American Institute of Natural Healing and competed 2200 hours of course work and received a naturopath degree/certificate in 1998. However, your affiant is not aware of any record that Curran is a licensed naturopathic \"physician\" who has taken any board exams. D. St. Luke's Medical School 23. Your affiant has reviewed records from St. Luke's Medical School. Investigation by IRS/CID SA Ferraro identified a California based extension of St. Luke's School. In response to this investigation, St. Luke's provided SA Ferraro with a hand written response advising that the school has no records indicating that John Curran was ever a student at the college. SA Ferraro has advised your affiant that there is an ongoing federal investigation regarding the sale of fraudulent degrees with regard to St. Luke's School of Medicine. E. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing 24. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing is an active licensed corporation within the State of Rhode Island. It is also a member of the Better Business Bureau (BBB). A review of the company's BBB application showed that the company is engaged in \"alternative health care.\" John Curran, N.D. M.D. is listed as the Owner/Medical Director. Curran originally operated his business, then called Rhode Island Health Aid, at 743 Reservoir Ave., Cranston, RI. He moved the practice to his current Richmond Square address and changed the name of the business to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing in approximately July of 2002. F. Live Blood Analysis 25. Investigation by your affiant has determined that on April 10, 1997, John Curran, of 743 Reservoir Avenue, Cranston, Rhode Island, purchased a NuLife Sciences Laboratory Grade Research Microscope, Serial # 204134. The Microscope was sold to Curran by PSI Resource/NuLife Sciences, 2404 Vineyard Place, Boulder CO. Among other accessories, the device came with a Panasonic CCD Color Camera with transformer and microscope slides. The investigation has revealed that Curran uses the device to perform blood analysis and improperly diagnose disease. 26. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the term \"device\" means: an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is: (1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them, (2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation's, treatment, or prevention's of disease, in man or other animals; or (3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(h). 27. Your affiant has made contact with numerous individuals who hold various positions within FDA for assistance in this investigation. I have met with Beth Griffin, Engineer/Investigator for the FDA-New England District and provided her with documentation regarding the NuLife Sciences Laboratory Grade Research Microscope. Griffin has advised me that the device is not cleared or approved by FDA for use as a medical device. 28. In addition, Curran knows that the analysis is not to be used for diagnoses. On June 9, 1998, Curran, on behalf of RI Health Aid, sent a letter to the RIDOH regarding the subject of Live Blood Evaluation. In the letter, Curran writes that \"[u]nder State and Federal Laws, people receiving services considered to be of an experimental research nature by the FDA/AMA must be informed of such. Nutritional live blood evaluation is of a nutritional nature and is not for a medical diagnosis, treatment, disease prevention, or health assessment. All evaluations are screenings for research purposes only.\" (emphasis added). Nonetheless, the investigation, as summarized below, has demonstrated that John Curran is utilizing this device in the diagnosis of disease, to include blood parasites, cancer, and white blood cell anomalies. G. BioMeridian Stress Assessment 29. Investigation by your affiant has determined that John Curran purchased a BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device from BioMeridian International. The BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device (which is also referred to as the Meridian Stress Assessment) is referred to as a \"galvanic device\" and cleared by FDA as a Class Il medical device for the measurement of the electrical resistance of the skin. Your affiant has reviewed sample printouts from the device and, in essence, they list different body systems and functions, such as heart, endocrine system, cellular metabolism and provide a reading for how each responds to the test. No galvanic skin response devices, including the BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device, are cleared or approved by the FDA for the use in the diagnosis of disease. Your affiant's investigation has determined that Curran uses this device in conjunction with the Live Blood Evaluation to provide diagnoses of diseases in patients, contrary to federal and state regulation. H. E-Water 30. Your affiant has reviewed the promotional pamphlet that John Curran provides to his clients regarding E-Water. On that document, Curran states that \"each drop of this water will refresh your body and increase your vitality. Homeopathy has proven that water has remarkable memory and capacity to store energy. This specially energized water contains the same synergistic healing properties as the water in Lourdes, France. - Dr. John E. Curran, N.D., M.D.\" 31. The document further claims that \"Body Balancing E-Water is uniquely charged water wherein the molecules spin in the reverse direction and emit electrical energy which your body's organs absorb to function at its optimal capacity. The elderly, adults, and children as well as animals and plants, can benefit dramatically from taking this E-Water. It is recommended for ALL ages. This water does not act as a stimulant.\" 32. Your affiant has spoken to David Uliss, Chief - Forensic Sciences, RIDOH and provided him with a copy of the E-Water pamphlet. Subsequent to examining the document, Dr. Uliss advised your affiant that the claims were \"ridiculous as a matter of science,\" advising that water molecules are constantly spinning in all directions and that the notion of providing a charge for organ absorption was \"absolutely without any scientific merit.\" I. The Machines 33. Your affiant is also aware that, as part of his sales pitch, Curran attempts to sell his patients a full treatment protocol that is to be performed by using certain machines, which have been described as follows: (1) hydrotherapy massage machine; (2) spectra collor spa system; (3) hyperbaric chamber; massager (5) ionic cleaner; (6) massage capsule; and (7) personal sauna with white plastic hoses. Each machine is discussed below in the context of Curran's representations about each to his patients or to an undercover agent. IV. Victims 34. As part of this investigation, your affiant and other investigators conducted interviews of the following former patients of Curran: RD: (In the interest of confidentiality of the patients, only the initials for each patient are included herein.) 35. In February of 2003, RD, a former patient of John Curran, provided a written complaint to the RIDOH regarding the treatment he had received from Curran. That statement provided the following information, in substance: 36. On September 30, 2002, RD went to see Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310E, for an initial consultation. Curran spent about a half -hour asking how RD was feeling. After the initial meeting, Curran asked RD to return the following week for some tests to see what Curran could find. During the follow-up visit, Curran performed the Meridian Stress Assessment on RD. Curran claimed that the procedure tested for \"food allergies\" and \"the body's vital functions.\" Curran presented RD with a computer printout of the foods RD was \"allergic\" to and told him that he was deficient on 55 of the 62 body functions that were tested. Curran performed a second test that involved getting a blood sample from RD1s finger. Through a microscope image of the alleged drawn blood, Curran showed RD what he called \"blood parasites\" and told RD that his body was infected with them. Curran advised RD that he was \"very sick\" and that he needed a complete detoxification, which would cost him $4,500. RD subsequently signed a contract for the program and began the treatment. 37. Curran's treatment called for RD to stay on a liquid diet that consisted only of a product identified by Curran as the \"Super Green Drink\" formula for a period of four (4) weeks. The Super Green Drink Formula is a powder that Curran manufactures and sells to his clients. RD's weight when he started the liquid diet was 149 lbs. Three (3) weeks and three (3) days later, RD's weight had dropped to 124 lbs. 38. When RD called Curran to tell him he was down to 126 Ibs., Curran indicated that he didn't care if RD lost another 25 pounds but advised that RD must stay on the diet, after which Curran proceeded to prescribe to him $208.33 worth of pills and other liquid formulas. It took RD over a year to get back to his present weight of 150 lbs. RD advised that he paid Curran a total of $3500. ML: 39. On August 11, 2004, ML, a former patient of John Curran, was interviewed by your affiant and provided the following information, in substance: 40. On July 22, 2004, ML had a complete medical assessment performed by Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, for which ML was charged $950.00. As part of that examination, Curran performed numerous tests including a Meridian Stress Assessment and Live Blood Analysis. ML advised that Curran introduced himself as \"doctor\" Curran and wore a name tag that read \"Dr. Curran.\" Additionally, ML advised that on the walls of his office Curran had four (4) certificates from various institutions including Harvard Medical School. 41. During the visit, ML stated that Curran told her that he had cured four (4) people who had Hepatitis C. After conducting the blood analysis test, Curran advised ML that she was infested with blood parasites and showed ML two slides that allegedly contained ML's blood. Curran pointed out \"worms and eggs\" that were ready to hatch within ML's blood. Curran told ML that she had \"only one good blood cell with the others being deformed.\" Upon completion of the Stress Assessment Test, Curran provided ML with a printout of the results, which indicated that ML had five (5) out of (62) bodily function readings that were \"good\", with the rest being \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" ML informed your affiant that she was surprised,at the results of her blood test because just a couple of weeks prior to her exam with Curran she had been to the hospital on an unrelated matter at which time a blood evaluation had been conducted and no abnormalities were found. 42. After providing ML with his results, Curran addressed a proper course of action. Curran took ML to a room in the office that contained various machines. Curran advised ML that using the machines was the \"fast cure\" to rid her of her parasite infestation. He proposed a treatment plan for $10,000.00 for a total of ten (10) visits which would allow her to use each of the machines. ML subsequently told Curran that the price was too expensive. Curran then stated that he would return to his office and formulate the necessary list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that ML would need to be cured. ML stated that, some time later, Curran returned to the patient room and provided ML with a list of items totaling $5,000.00. Curran also provided ML with an application for a Credit Care card, which, if approved, would provide her with financing for Curran's services. ML filled out the application for the card, but advised the office not to forward her application until she had a chance to discuss the matter with her husband. ML also provided Curran's office with a check for $600.00 as an initial payment for the items Curran had listed and advised Curran that she would return the next day to provide payment in full. ML stated that she felt very pressured at the time of her visit to buy the prescribed \"medications.\" 43. ML advised that after discussing her visit with her husband, and thinking about what had occurred during her visit, she felt as if she had been the victim of an attempted fraud. ML advised that she then contacted her bank (Sovereign Bank) and put a stop payment on the check she had provided to Curran. LM: 44. On September 27, 2004, Bruce McIntyre at the RIDOH interviewed LM, a former patient of John Curran. LM provided the following information, in substance: 45. LM went to see Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, after reading about him in a local health magazine. LM had her initial consultation with Curran on August 6, 2004. LM stated that she went to see Curran because she wanted to lose weight and stop smoking. After this initial consultation, Curran scheduled LM to come to the office for a complete medical assessment on August 13, 2004, for which LM was ultimately charged $950.00. LM advised that the medical assessment lasted between 4-5 hours. As part of the exam, Curran conducted several tests including a live blood analysis and a stress assessment test. Subsequent to taking a blood sample from LM's finger, Curran advised LM that she was infested with blood parasites and that the parasites had been in LM's system a long time and had become \"double-headed.\" After conducting the stress assessment, Curran produced a printout that he told LM indicated that she had four (4) out of (62) bodily functions that were good with the rest being \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" LM also informed that during her exam Curran told her that he had cured patients who had Stage IV Cancer. 46. Subsequent to advising her of his diagnosis, Curran provided LM with a list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that LM would need to take. Included on the provided list were a \"Super Green Drink\", a powder made by Curran that cost $1,195.00, and \"Dr. Curran's Unique Body Balancing E-Water\" that cost $45.00 per bottle and also was produced by Curran. In total, Curran charged LM $4,806.97. AD: 47. On September 27, 2004, LD, the mother of AD, met with a member of the RIDOH and filed a complaint, including a written statement, regarding the treatment her daughter had received from John Curran. LD provided the following information, in substance: 48. AD (age 24), who is temporarily living in San Diego, was diagnosed with Celiac Disease (gluten and wheat allergies) while living in California. AD came home to Rhode Island for a week and decided to seek another opinion regarding her illness. Dr. John Curran was recommended. Curran listed himself as an MD as well as an ND, and that convinced LD and AD to utilize his services. 49. On Tuesday, August 31, 2004, AD had an afternoon appointment with Curran. Curran initially had a technician perform what he referred to as a Full Body Medical Imaging Scan. Curran then explained to AD that there were many blood and other tests that he needed to be performed to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Curran asked AD to return on Saturday, September 4, to complete those tests. AD was scheduled to fly back to San Diego on Sunday the 5th and had other plans for Saturday. Curran stated that he would be in his office later in the evening on Tuesday the 31st and that he would wait for AD in order to complete the tests. AD asked her mother, LD, to accompany her to Curran's office for the evening appointment. 50. At the onset of that appointment, Curran explained his testing procedures, and AD and LD subsequently went in to the examining room where the tests would take place. Curran proceeded to perform his exam. As part of that exam, Curran pricked AD's finger tips, put blood samples on a glass slab, put that slab under the microscope and projected the \"living blood cells\" onto a monitor, enabling both AD and LD to view what he proceeded to diagnose. 51. Curran showed what he stated were \"parasites\" living in AD's blood cells. He said that her blood was infested with these parasites and that her immune system was so overworked trying to kill them on a daily basis that when other germs and bacteria entered her system, the immune system was too tired to fight. Curran also showed LD and AD \"white formations\" in the cells, which he said were \"holes\" in the blood. He also showed what the \"healthy\" color of blood cells should be and what you wouldn't want to see for coloration. Curran showed another view of AD'S cells and said they were tainted \"green,\" which was an indication of early cancer. Curran advised that this was the \"worst\" blood work he had ever seen and advised LD that she had to picture AD standing on the edge of a cliff. Curran indicated that if AD were not treated immediately, with drastic measures, AD would \"fall off the cliff' within one to two years. Curran also told AD that she had thyroid problems and a dysfunctional pituitary gland that were making her age three years to every one. LD advised investigators that she was \"devastated\" upon hearing the diagnosis. However, Curran told LD and AD that this diagnosis was reversible, informing that \"drastic measures were required for drastic situations.\" Curran claimed that he could cure AD with a very intensive ten-days of therapy. 52. Curran walked LD and AD into his therapy chamber and showed them a Hyperbaric Chamber, Hydrotherapy Massage Machine, and a Spectracolor Spa System. Curran stated that the theory behind the therapy was that he had to \"kill\" the parasites in her blood cells as quickly as possible with intensive heat, detoxify the body of nasty matter, supplement her diet with herbal treatments, and put her on a nutritional diet. Curran stated that the protocol would cost $10,000. Curran stated that he knew that LD and AD had a lot to digest but advised them \"not to lose sleep over it.\" Curran explained to LD and AD that they could have a credit application prepared right then and there to see if they qualified for the cost of treatment. Curran advised that many of his patients were not prepared to come up with money out of pocket and utilized the credit service. Curran provided LD with an application for a Creditcare card which LD filled out and which was immediately submitted by the office. LD was approved for the issuance of credit prior to her leaving the office. 53. At the conclusion of the exam, LD was presented with a bill in the amount of $1355.33 for all of the tests conducted that night. Curran suggested that AD call her boss in California to say that she was delaying her return and to delay her flight back for a couple of weeks. The next day, LD and AD were supposed to pick up a diet plan for AD, and AD was scheduled to begin therapy. LD wrote out a check for $1355.33 and left the office. 54. LD relayed Curran's diagnosis to her husband, ED, who suggested that AD see her primary care physician, Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah, prior to beginning treatment with Curran. On Thursday, September 2, 2004, AD met with Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah. AD informed her of everything Curran had said and showed her some of the test results. Dr. Jeremiah advised AD that she was the second of her patients who had visited Curran and who had been given a life-threatening diagnosis. Dr. Jeremiah subsequently conducted a full physical exam on AD, including blood work. 55. Your affiant has subsequently met with and spoken to Dr. Jeremiah, who advised your affiant that, with the exception of Celiac Disease, AD is a healthy 24-year-old with no indication of cancer or any other life-threatening illness. Her thyroid is normal, as is her pituitary gland. Dr. Jeremiah further informed your affiant that the only parasites that can be detected through blood work are those connected with malaria and that AD had not been exposed to malaria nor had any such symptoms. 56. LD informed investigators that she stopped payment on her check to Curran immediately and contacted her lawyer who forwarded a letter to Curran addressing this issue. The possible impact of the letter on this investigation is discussed below. 57. On October 19, 2001, your affiant and TFA Christopher Cardarelli met with LD at her residence. LD reiterated her statements previously made at the RIDOH. LD also added that during their time with Curran, Curran told LD that he had cured patients with Stage IV Cancer. (Curran made the identical claim to client LM). CR: 58. On December 13, 2004, your affiant interviewed CR, a former patient of John Curran, at CR's residence located in Sterling, Massachusetts. CR provided the following information, in substance: 59. On November 30, 2004, CR went to see John Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, after hearing about him from a work colleague. CR stated that he went to see Curran because he wanted to lose weight. Curran conducted a complete medical assessment exam for which CR was charged $950.00. CR advised that the exam lasted several hours. As part of the exam, Curran conducted several tests, including a live blood analysis and a stress assessment test. The first test Curran conducted was the blood analysis test. For that test, Curran took a blood sample from CR's finger which he placed on three glass slides. Curran placed the slides, one at a time, under a microscope that was hooked up to a computer monitor. Curran then reviewed the blood and advised CR that he had \"clumpy\" red blood cells. Curran further informed CR that his red blood cells had \"holes in them.\" Curran stated that CR's white blood cells had a \"glowing aura\" around them and pointed out \"inch worm\" like creatures moving around CR's blood. CR stated that, after pointing out each one of these conditions, Curran would exclaim \"that's not good\" or \"this doesn't look good.\" Curran also showed CR a pamphlet which had pictures of what \"healthy\" blood cells should look like and what one would not want to see. Curran's final diagnoses was that CR's immune system was fatigued and that he had a virus in his blood. 60. Subsequent to the blood analysis, Curran conducted a BioMeridian Stress Assessment test. After conducting test, Curran produced a printout that he told CR indicated that CR had three (3) out of (62) bodily functions that were good, with the rest being \"stressed\" or 'weakened.\" 61. After advising CR of his diagnosis, Curran provided him with a list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that CR would need to take to improve his health. Included on the list were the \"Green Drink\" formula and \"Dr. Curran's Unique Body Balancing E-Water.\" Additionally, Curran scheduled a machine therapy protocol for CR which was intended to \"pull the toxins out\" of CR's body and \"kill the virus\" in CR's blood. CR advised that he agreed to purchase both the supplements and treatment program suggested by Curran. 62. To help him finance his treatment, CR filled out a Credit Care card application which was provided to him by Curran's office manager and approved for credit while CR was still at Curran's office. At the conclusion of his appointment CR's Credit Care account was charged the sum of $6,719.08 for the exam, supplements and therapy treatment program. CR has subsequently contacted Curran's office and notified them that he had decided not be participate in the therapy program and requested that his Credit Care account be credited for the corresponding charge (2,995.00). CR advised that he was told by someone at Curran's office that they would make the credit, however, as of December 3, 2004, no such credit had been issued. V. Undercover Operation 63. In addition to the above-cited patients, and as part of this investigation, an undercover, monitored, operation was initiated as described below. A. Task Force Agent (TFA) Al Faella 64. On September 17, 2004, TFA Albert Faella, while working in an undercover capacity, went to Curran's office located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, for a previously scheduled exam. Your affiant has listened to a recording of that meeting as well as spoken to TFA Faella about that meeting which is summarized as follows: 65. As part of the exam, Curran pricked a blood sample from TFA Faella's finger and smeared the sample on three (3) individual glass sample slides. Curran subsequently requested a urine sample from TFA Faella for which TFA Faella had to exit the exam room. When TFA Faella returned with the requested urine sample, Curran was sitting in front of a microscope. TFA Faella sat in the chair next to Curran, looking at a monitor, which appeared to be wired to a camera mounted on the microscope. Curran appeared to TFA Faella to have a slide already in the microscope and pointed out to TFA Faella what his red and white blood cells looked like. Curran stated that the white blood cells should be perfectly round and proceeded to change the glass slide in the microscope. Curran tested the urine sample and stated that TFA Faella's urine was acidic at 5.0 which is completely acidic. Upon looking at the new slide, Curran stated that there was something wrong with TFA Faella's white blood cells because they were not shaped completely round and some were not fully-grown. Upon further examining the slide, Curran spotted what he called a \"microimbulei.\" He stated that once one is seen, \"they're like roaches\", and guaranteed that there are \"millions in the body,\" which Curran explained meant TFA Faella's \"immune system is not functioning optimally or else it would not let anything grow in the body.\" 66. Curran also added that it looked like TFA Faella had a little bit of liver toxicity and spider webbing. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella had a lot of cell deformity and that his immune system needed total regeneration because Curran could not find one good cell. Curran advised TFA Faella that \"they're all deformed\" (referring to Faella's white blood cells) and that if TFA Faella stayed like this that his immune system would allow other things to grow and eventually become premature diseases. TFA Faella asked Curran if what he had been shown floating in his blood was a parasite and Curran responded \"correct\" and that it was easy enough to treat. Curran stated that he also had seen a couple of clots forming in TFA Faella's blood and observed eggs starting to grow, stating that within twenty-four hours the eggs would be huge. Curran went on to say that they (referring to the parasite eggs) are deep seated within the cells and the immune system cannot get at them. When asked by TFA Faella about how to get rid of the parasites, Curran replied that he was working on a program in his head. 67. Curran informed TFA Faella that the next slide in the blood test would show if the parasites had caused any damage to the body. While conducting this test, Curran explained that the bar graph on the monitor should show a solid red line and that any break in that line would indicate some type of weakness within the system. In conducting this test, Curran stated that he did see something happening in TFA Faella's system but did not know whether the condition would mature in six months or six years, and then revised his answer to one year, adding that this test would have to be performed every three months. Curran also observed some holes in TFA Faella's blood smear, which Curran stated indicated that something was starting to happen. Curran explained that when he sent other similar patients for scans they always come back positive for cancer. However, in the case of TFA Faella, Curran advised that he would be able to reverse the condition now, in this stage, quite easily. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella's fiber net is all broken which indicates glucose intolerance. Curran asked TFA Faella if he took any painkillers, to which TFA Faella replied \"no\" and inquired why Curran was asking. Curran stated that TFA Faella had a little discoloration of the blood and indicated that he (Curran) could see orange/greenish specks which indicate diseases. Curran stated that he has an eighty-percent success rate and could get TFA Faella's blood back to that of a twenty-year-old. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella had adrenal stress which was sitting on top of his kidneys and causing fatigue and that he also saw purple in the blood sample which is a sign of malabsorbtion of nutrients. 68. In the next test he performed, Curran placed a clear liquid in the palm of TFA Faella's hand and had him grasp a small, approximately five-inch brass bar, which was connected to a computer system labeled BioMeridian Health Assessment test. Curran advised TFA Faella to grasp the bar loosely. Curran was holding on to a pen-like probe which he would push against TFA Faella's joints on the opposite hand and foot and then changed to the other side to complete the test. Curran explained that the testing system he was using was the most state of the art in the United States and that the test would measure the various bodily organs and lymphatics and detennine whether something was wrong in one of the internal organs. Curran proceeded to explain how this is a very important test to have done at least once a year to determine if a body has disease in it or not. While conducting the test, Curran informed TFA Faella that he had gall bladder problems and that his kidneys were super-stressed. At the end of the testing, Curran stated that the printer was not working and he could therefore not supply a copy of the test, but would keep it in the file. He went on to say that out of the sixty-two tests the machine scans for, TFA Faella had only passed five of them, but that within a month Curran would have TFA Faella back in shape. 69. After completing the assessment test, Curran had TFA Faella sit on an exam table where he looked at TFA Faella's fingernails on both hands and indicated to TFA Faella that his oxygen system wasn't working properly. Curran went on to say that because he did not see any half moons in the fingernails that it was a sign of degeneration and that 80-90 % of all his cancer patients have no moons in their fingernails. Curran also examined TFA Faella's tongue, took his body temperature, and checked his eyes. Curran stated that TFA Faella's pupils were pulsating, which meant that TFA Faella's glandular system was running out. 70. Upon completion of the exam, TFA Faella was instructed to get dressed and wait in Curran's office. Curran subsequently returned to the office and began to talk about several treatment protocols with TFA Faella. The first treatment discussed involved TFA Faella subsisting for a period of 30 days on only the Green Drink formula, 64 ounces of carrot juice a day and numerous other supplements Curran would supply to kill the parasites. Curran stated that this program would keep TFA Faella's blood squeaky-clean and heal everything. Curran went on to state that the only thing that worried him was the formation of TFA Faella's white blood cells because none of them were correct and he did not know why. But, Curran stated, in thirty days the cells would become perfectly round. 71. Curran then offered TFA Faella another treatment program to be done in addition to the above-cited supplement program. This therapy would last for a period of ten days and was intended to deactivate pesticides and heavy metals and excrete them as well as any deep seated microbes. Curran proceeded to show TFA Faella the therapy room that was located across his office and described each machine in the room and its function. 72. The first was a hyperbaric chamber which Curran stated was used for people who have had a stoke or brain damage and which supplies high-pressure oxygen. The next machine was a Hydro Massager which had an infra red light above it and, according to Curran, was supposed to stimulate the thyroid into producing healthy white blood cells. The beam saturates the body, which deactivates microbes from reproducing as well as cancer cells, viruses and bacteria with a high frequency. 73. The next piece of equipment shown to TFA Faella was an ionic cleanser, a machine in which clients would put their feet. While the machine appeared to TFA Faella to be a simple foot massager, Curran advised that, while in use, a person could actually see the garbage coming out of the body and floating up in the water. Curran described the garbage coming out of the body as browns, greens and all sorts of different colors. 74. The next piece of equipment shown to TFA Faella was a massage capsule, in which a client would lie inside. The apparatus had a black light above it where a person's head would be. Curran stated the machine provided cold light therapy. Curran advised that the machine would reprogram the immune system and fight against infections. 75. The final piece of equipment that Curran showed TFA Faella was a personal sauna in which a person's head would be sticking out of the unit as it heats up. Attached to the unit were two small white plastic hoses from which Curran advised O2 and O3 were being pumped into the unit, which heats up to 110 degrees. According to Curran, O3 takes pesticides out of the cells. 76. Curran and TFA Faella then returned back to Curran's office to discuss which form of therapy would be best. Curran then advised that a full course of treatment, utilizing the above-described machines would cost $10,000.00. A plan involving only supplements would cost several thousand. Curran reiterated to TFA Faella that the $10,000.00 program was best, stating that it's the only form of treatment that will completely erase everything wrong with TFA Faella. TFA Faella advised Curran that his schedule would not allow him to use the machine protocol and he would opt instead for the supplement program. Curran again tried selling a shorter time period machine-based treatment protocol, which TFA Faella refused. Curran then left the office to devise a supplement protocol for TFA Faella. Curran subsequently returned with a list of supplements for TFA Faella to purchase. The products included two supplements that Curran advised he produced himself. The first of these was the \"E-water\", which is bottled water bearing the, said trade name. Curran advised that this water reverses the molecules in the body. The second was the \"Green Drink\" formula which, Curran claimed, contained every nutrient that the body needs. The E-Water was sold for a cost of $45.00 for a four-(4) ounce bottle and a white unlabeled bucket of green powder to make the \"Green Drink\" sold for a cost of $675.00. 77. TFA Faella purchased all of the supplements with official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using Sovereign Bank check No. 109 for the total sum of $3,729.00, which included the full body exam. Sovereign Bank subsequently provided your affiant with a copy of the cited check which indicated that it had been deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. Your affiant is aware of the process by which a check issued by Sovereign Bank is processed. Your affiant is aware that prior to the funds being deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, a series of interstate bank wire transfers occurred culminating with the funds being deposited into the identified account. 78. On September 16, 2004, immediately following TFA Faella's exam with Curran, your affiant accompanied TFA Faella to Pawtucket Memorial Hospital, 11 Brewster Street, Pawtucket, RI. Upon arrival, Faella met with Dr. Noubar Kessimian, in a previously arranged meeting, for the purposes of supplying Dr. Kessimian with a blood sample for testing for the presence of blood parasites. TFA provided the necessary blood sample, which was tested at Memorial Hospital. Dr. Kessimian subsequently provided your affiant with a printout of the lab results, which were negative for the presence of parasites. Dr. Kessimian has also advised your affiant that blood parasites are extremely rare and are almost exclusively found as a result of contracting Malaria, a disease not present in this geographical area. B. Postal Inspector (PI) PI Correia 79. On October 8, 2004, Postal Inspector (PI) Al Correia, while working in an undercover capacity, went to the office of John Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, as part of a previously scheduled exam. Your affiant has listened to a recording of that meeting as well as spoken to PI Correia about that meeting which is summarized as follows: 80. Upon PI Correia's arrival, Curran reviewed a pre-exam form filled out by PI Correia and advised that it was a typical \"kill me diet.\" Curran stated that 99 percent of the people he treats are riddled with disease and, with PI Correia, Curran has an opportunity to stop it before PI Correia became diseased. 81. In the exam room, Curran initially conducted a Live Blood Analysis. Curran pricked PI Correia's right index finger and smeared blood on three (3) glass slides. Curran stated the microscope he was utilizing was not hooked up to the monitor screen at this time and he would let PI Correia look into the microscope viewfinder if he found something. 82. Curran then placed a blood slide on the microscope and told PI Correia that his blood cells should be perfectly round. He had PI Correia look in the microscope and noted that the blood cells were not round. Curran showed PI Correia a picture of healthy blood cells and then a picture of what PI Correia's blood cells looked like. Curran stated it was Rulo [sic], which could be, amongst other things, degenerative disease, liver disease, cancer, etc. Curran told PI Correia that he did not know exactly what it was but that PI Correia's system was not functioning correctly. 83. Curran stated the next blood slide could give him an answer. He then requested that PI Correia go to the bathroom and provide a urine sample. When PI Correia returned to the exam room, Curran tested the urine and stated that it was normal. Curran then looked at another blood slide and told PI Correia that he did not have any tumors but did have heavy metal, probably heavy metal poisoning. Curran stated that PI Correia had a yeasty buildup that could trigger a premature disease if not treated. 84. Curran stated the next test would check PI Correia's electroconductivity. A clear liquid was placed in the palm of PI Correia's hand and he was given a small bar (approximately five inches long) to hold in the hand. On the computer monitor screen there was a graph labeled Bio Meridian Health Assessment, which would tell Curran if the organ tested is stressed or weakened. Curran touched PI Correia's other hand and foot with a pen like device, producing readings on the graph. While touching the pen like object to PI Correia's foot, Curran told PI Correia that his liver was super stressed. Curran stated 17 out of 62 bodily functions were in the norm. Curran explained that the body fires electricity and this machine checks the firing of that electricity, which occurs in every area of one's body. Subsequent to conducting the test, Curran provided PI Correia with a printout of the results. Curran stated that PI Correia's weakest areas were his right lung and small intestines. The assessment indicated that only 17 out of 62 bodily functions were operating in a \"balanced\" state with the others being either \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" Included in those systems that were identified as stressed or weakened were the lymphatics, lungs, large intestine, nervous system, circulation, allergies, cellular metabolism, endocrine system, small intestine, connective tissue, gallbladder, kidneys and urinary bladder. Curran advised PI Correia that after continuous visits to his office, PI Correia would be perfect. 85. During the meeting, PI Correia asked Curran if he should be concerned that his blood cells were not round. Curran advised that they were round but coagulated and clumpy, which could cause heart attack and stroke if it caused blockage of the arteries. Curran stated that because PI Correia's blood was clumpy he couldn't read it in that state. Curran then stated he could get PI Correia into a program that would make him perfect. 86. Curran suggested a rejuvenation program consisting of not eating for 30 days while subsisting on the \"Green Drink,\" which would repair every cell in PI Correia's body. Curran also advised that PI Correia could drink the Green Drink for breakfast and lunch but eat a good dinner at night. Curran stated that this protocol would make PI Correia perfect and keep him there. This protocol would stop PI Correia's blood cells from sticking together. Curran advised PI Correia that the Green Drink formula took him ten years to formulate and that he puts 100 products in the formula. Cunan informed that it took half a year, working with scientists, to put the 100 products in the drink. Curran stated the drink totally repairs every cell in the body, PI Correia told Curran that he would purchase the supplements he suggested. Curran gave PI Correia a list of items totaling $2,715.82, which included the full body exam. PI then stated he would purchase the items at a later date. 87. The exam, at a cost of $950.00, was paid for by official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using an undercover Mastercard credit card. Your affiant subsequently contacted Mastercard and was advised that the transaction cited resulted in a wire of funds in the amount of $950.00 to the U.S. Bank National Association located in Knoxville TN. Your affiant is aware that company is a credit card clearing house. Funds from that institution were then wire transferred to Citizens Bank in Rhode Island, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. 88. On October 19, 2004, PI Correia met with Dr. Paul J. Agatiello, MD., F.A.C.P. for the purposes of receiving a comprehensive medical exam as a second opinion to diagnosis received from Curran during Correia's October 8, 2004 exam. In his Summary Statement, Dr. Agatiello wrote \"[t]o a reasonable degree of medical certainty, this physician finds NO evidence by history or physical examination of abnormalities of the lymphatics, lungs, large intestine, nervous system, circulation, allergies, endocrine system, small intestine, connective tissue, gallbladder, kidneys or urinary bladder.\" 89. Your affiant's investigation determined that PI Correia is the first person identified in this case that has not been diagnosed with deformities, such as parasites or worms, in his blood. According to PI Correia, during his exam with Curran, blood was drawn from his finger and placed under the microscope. Curran told PI Correia that the computer screen monitoring system, which Curran has used with all other identified patients to show the presence of parasites, was not hooked up and was not being used. 90. Your affiant is aware that just prior to PI Correia's visit, Frank S. Lombardi, attorney for AD, sent a letter from his office on September 7, 2004. In that letter attorney Lombardi accused Curran, among other things, of performing unnecessary work and charging expensive fees. Lombardi also notified Curran that his client had requested a stop payment on the check she wrote to him and that she had notified the Board of Medical Licensure regarding her visit to Curran's office. P.I. Correia visited Curran after the letter was sent to Lombard. 91. Also, of note. at the bottom of PI Al Correia's BioMeridian Stress Assessment analysis, provided by Curran, the following is written: \"The MSAS equipment does not provide a medical diagnosis. If patients feel they need a diagnosis, they should consult with their physician.\" Your affiant has reviewed similar assessment analysis reports provided to other patients of John Curran. That review revealed that in all cases, for patients seen prior to PI Correia and prior to the Lombardi letter, no such statement is made. Despite the disclaimer that has been added to the Stress Assessment test, based upon your affiant's review of the audiotapes of both undercover visits by TFA Faella and PI Correia, Curran never verbally advised either that he could not provide the diagnoses and that they should consult their physician if they felt they needed a diagnoses. VI. Peer Review of Currant's Treatment Protocol 92. In addition to the statements obtained above from Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah and Dr. Noubar Kessimian, I have also reviewed comments by a third doctor regarding Dr. Curran's methods. As part of its initial investigation, the RIDOH forwarded copies of Curran's promotional documents for review by Doctor Tim Gorski, MD Fellow at the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FACOG). On November 4, 2002, Dr. Gorski wrote a letter in response to the forwarded materials. Your affiant has reviewed Dr. Gorski's assessments in which he provides his medical opinion that many of Curran's treatments are of an unproven or disproven nature. In particular part, Dr. Gorski provided the following information to RIDOH: The \"BioMeridian Stress Assessment\" appears to be a variation on electrodiagnostic methods that are well-known forms of medical fraud. The procedure consists of grounding the patient, then using a probe to pass low levels of electrical current through the patient. Various dials connected to the circuit are then claimed to measure the status of the patient's health. However, the resistance/current measured only reflects nonspecific effects such as how hard the probe is pushed against the patient. 93. Dr. Gorski also stated that naturopaths do not prevent, cure, diagnose or treat disease. VII. Glen Lynch 94. On May 11, 2004, your affiant along with PI Al Correia interviewed Glen Lynch. Glen Lynch had contacted the RIDOH and requested a meeting to discuss John Curran. Glen Lynch provided your affiant the following information, in substance: 95. Glen Lynch informed that he is the brother-in-law of John Curran. Glen Lynch stated that John Curran was engaged in certain unethical activities for which Glen Lynch had specific information. Glen Lynch stated that he was, until recently, employed by Curran at his medical office and as the day-to-day operator and owner of Eve's Herbal Garden, a vitamin supplement store on 743 Reservoir Avenue in Cranston, RI. Cumin's previous practice, Rhode Island Health Aid, was originally at the same address on Reservoir Avenue. According to Glen Lynch, Curran was the real owner of Eve's Herbal Garden with Glen Lynch holding the title in name only. 96. Glen Lynch stated that he was asked by Curran to create a \"Super Green Drink\" formula sold by Curran to his patients. Glen Lynch provided investigators with a notepad, which he claimed identified the formula he used to create the \"Green Drink\" and listed the cost of each of the various ingredients in the formula. When Curran had originally asked Glen Lynch to create the drink, he told him to \"make it green and make it taste good.\" Glen Lynch advised that he has no scientific background but attempted to create a formula that contained various healthy nutrients. Glen Lynch stated that Curran would charge up to $1,200.00 for a bucket of the powder. Glen Lynch left the employment of Curran after Curran had approached him regarding the cost of the formula. Curran wanted Glen Lynch to cut the expenses and to just keep it green and tasting good. Glen Lynch stated that he could not honor that request, stating that he felt it was wrong, and that it led to his having a falling out with Curran. Glen Lynch provided your affiant with a jar containing the green drink formula. 97. With regard to the \"E-Water\" that Curran sold, Glen Lynch stated that Curran would purchase gallons of distilled water, which he would place in a transparent like box with a rod in it, which was connected to a plug in electrical power source. Curran would pour the water in the box and let it sit there for a while. Glen Lynch surmised that the box was transparent so that if someone looked at it would appear as if something was happening to the water. Glen Lynch stated that upon his leaving the employment of Curran he had taken the apparatus, which Glen Lynch provided to your affiant. VIII. The Money 98. Glen Lynch has advised your affiant that Curran's business generated significant amounts of cash and that Curran had personally shown him large amounts of cash. Glen Lynch stated that Curran told him that he could not deposit the money into the bank in amounts over $10,000 because of, as Glen Lynch remembers it, \"some IRS rule.\" Glen Lynch also stated that, with regard to his medical practice, Curran told him that he \"wanted to make a couple of million bucks and get out.\" During his undercover visit to Curran's office, TFA Al Faella saw a safe in Curran's office, to the left of his desk, under a credenza. 99. Glen Lynch further informed your affiant that he and Curran had engaged in some fraudulent financial transactions with Glen Lynch's American Express Card and Curran's business, Rhode Island Health, when it was still on Reservoir Avenue. According to Glen Lynch, Curran devised a scheme whereby Curran would bill Glen Lynch's Amex card for fictitious purchases at the store and then split the cash received by the business with Glen Lynch. Glen Lynch stated that both he and Curran were aware that Glen Lynch would not be paying back the charged moneys [3]. Footnote 3. Your affiant is also aware that Glen Lynch has previously pleaded contendere to two state charges of simple assault/domestic and vandalism. 100. American Express has provided your affiant with records for the account of Glen P. Lynch (Acct. No. 3715-628432-52008 & 3721-2171 18-34008). A review of those records indicates that there was in excess of $33,000.00 in charges from Rhode Island Health. Those charges were almost exclusively in round thousand dollar allotments. According to Cathy Curran (No relation) Senior Special Agent, Northeast Region, for American Express, the GL Accounts have not been paid. 101. As part of this investigation, your affiant and other participating investigators have also reviewed numerous financial documents. 102. Your affiant has reviewed records provided by the Rhode Island Department of Administration, Division of Taxation-Employer Tax Section. Those records pertained to wages paid by The Northeastern Institute of Advanced Healing. A review of those records indicates that for calendar year 2003, John Curran claimed wages totaling $21,000. For the first two (2) quarters of calendar year 2004, John Curran reported wages totaling $12,500. 103. Your affiant has determined that John E. Curran currently resides at 66 Falcon Ridge Drive, Exeter, RI. The residence was purchased on August 2, 2004, and the listed owners are John E. Curran and Colleen R. Brophy. The home was purchased for $465,000.00 from Thomas and Valeria Guest. The mortgage payment for the residence are made by John Curran utilizing funds from The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing (Citizens Bank Checking Account No. 1452-75 1-0) 104. Your affiant has reviewed records from GE Capital relating to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. GE Capital is the issuing company behind the Creditcare card application that is utilized at Curran's practice. Medical practitioners utilize the card for patients who are in need of a financial payment plan to receive services. SA Robert Ferraro has conducted an analysis of payments made by GE Capital to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing (Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-75 1-0). That analysis indicates that for the year 2003, GE Capital sent a total of $120,413.16 in credit deposits to the Citizens Bank account. For the year 2004, to date, similar deposits have been made totaling approximately $210,216.00. Investigation by your affiant has determined that payments made to the identified account are done so by bank wire transfer. Upon approval of credit from GE Capital, a Credit Care card is sent to the client via the U.S. Mails. Subsequent payments to GE Capital can be made by sending payment via the U.S. Mails. 105. As stated above, your affiant's review has determined that it appears that receipts from Curran's business are deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0. To date, the investigation has traced certain payments that relate to fraudulent services into Account No. 1452-751-0. 106. On August 13, 2004, LM, the patient identified above, paid $2,000 to Curran's business by using a Visa credit card issued by Household Bank SB NA. Household Bank has confirmed to SA Robert Ferraro that it issued a payment on behalf of LM to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing. 107. Your affiant is also aware that Visa and Mastercard payments are typically processed through a clearing house. On January 5, 2005, your affiant spoke with a representative at Merchant Services. Your affiant was informed that Merchant Services is a credit card clearing house bank. Your affiant was advised that Merchant Services collects payment for credit card charges made through individual companies that utilize a credit card machine provided by Merchant Services or a wholesaler associated with Merchant Services. Your affiant was advised that charges are \"bundled\" and then monies are forwarded to the client after subtracting the fees charged by Merchant Services. Additionally, clients provide Merchant Services with a single bank account where funds are to be forwarded. 108. Your affiant has determined that John Cun-an utilizes Merchant Services and that charges made from his company are forwarded to Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0. Your affiant has also reviewed bank statement for Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0 and identified what appear to be numerous deposits of bundled payment items from Merchant Services, including deposits that occurred after August 13, 2004, when ML used her Visa card to pay Curran. 109. Your affiant is also aware that Merchant Services was utilized by John Curran to process the credit card payment for services he provided to PI Al Correia as fully described above at paragraph 87. 110. In addition, as explained above at paragraph 77, TFA Faella purchased supplements from Curran with official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using Sovereign Bank check No. 109 for the total sum of $3,729.00. Sovereign Bank subsequently provided your affiant with a copy of the cited check which indicated that it had been deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. 111. The investigation has revealed that the proceeds of the scheme are being used to promote the scheme because the funds deposited in the Citizen's Bank account are used to make payment on the business' American Express Account. A partial review of Citizens Bank records for Account No 1452-751-0, for the time period of January 2004 through September 2004, identified monthly checks being made payable to American Express Business Platinum Card, Account No. 3727-150577-83006 83006, held in the name of Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute. The identified checks include the following: Check No. 2306 written on January 6, 2004 in the amount of $15,591.70; Check No. 5472 written on or about March 1, 2004 in the amount of $23,788.69; Check No. 5666 written on May 1, 2004 in the amount of $27,137.34; Check No. 5769 written on June 13, 2004 in the amount of $17,841.78; Check No. 5820 written on June 28, 2004 in the amount of $28,513.95; Check No. 5930 written on August 6, 2004 in the amount of $14,700.23; and Check No. 2567 written on September 15, 2004 in the amount of $24,935.30 112. Your affiant has conducted a partial review of statements from American Express Business Platinum Card, Account number 3727-150577-83006, for the time period of October 2003 through September 2004, held in the name of Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute, 38 One Richmond Square, Suite 3 10E Providence, RI. The review identified checks being made payable to various corporations engaged in providing products and services utilized by Dr. John E. Curran and the Northeast Institute of Advanced Natural Healing in the furtherance of a scheme to defraud. The following purchases took place after Curran had seen ML, TFA Faella and PI Correia. 113. On August 26, 2004 and September 29, 2004, payments, each in the amount of $5,046.61, were made to Practice Builder Business Services. The investigation has revealed that Practice Builder Business Services is a company engaged in providing medical practices with strategic marketing services. The company provides, among other services, web design and strategies, company promotional design, typesetting and placement and mailing and physician and patient retaining and referral building. 114. On September 3, 2004, a payment of $19,190.00 was made to BioMeridian Inc., located in Utah. As stated above at paragraph 29, this corporation sells BioMeridian Stress Assessment devices, a device utilized by John E. Curran and described in detail in this affidavit. 115. Numerous payments have been made to Chi's Enterprise, a corporation that the investigation has revealed is engaged in the sale of herbal supplements. The payments include a payment was charged in the amount of $728.00 on August 17, 2004. IX. Computer Search Issues 116. As used in the Affidavit, the term \"computer\" includes \"computer software and memory,\" which refers to digital information that can be interpreted by a computer and any of its related components to direct the way they work. Software is stored in electronic, magnetic, optical, or other digital form. It commonly includes programs to run operating systems, applications (such as word-processing, graphics, or spreadsheet programs). 117. Based upon my training, experience, participation in other fraud and drug investigations, and discussions with other law enforcement officers experienced in the use and retrieval of computer-generated information, I am aware that computer storage devices (like hard disks, floppy disks, tapes, laser disks, and Bernoulli (drives) can store the equivalent of thousands of pages of information. Additionally, a person engaged in fraud may try to conceal criminal evidence, such as by storing it in random order with deceptive file names. This may require the qualified computer experts to examine all the stored data to determine which particular files are evidence or instrumentalities of crime. 118. During the course of this investigation, your affiant has consulted with other Special Agents, including FDA SA Special Agent Phil Walsky. SA Walsky has been a Special Agent with FDA for six years. Prior to FDA, SA Walsky was a special agent with the United States Secret Service. SA Walsky has been performing computer forensics since 1997, when he received computer forensics examination training and certification while he was with the Secret Service. He has continued to perform computer forensics as a Special Agent for the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigation. SA Walsky has received training and has gained experience in the usage of specialized computer software and hardware which assists him in examining seized computers. He performs dozens of computer forensic exams a year. The training SA Walsky has received includes Seized Computer Evidence Recovery (SCERS) training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, in Georgia in1997, and numerous continuing training over the following years. This continuing training covers various topics of computer forensics investigations such as legal issues, software and hardware components, internet and email dynamics, and other computer related topics. He has received additional training for various forensic software and hardware tools that I use for computer examinations. 119. Based on your affiant's experience in fraud investigations, consultation with other special agents and discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that computer files or remnants of such files can be recovered months or even years after they have been downloaded onto a hard drive, deleted or viewed via the Internet. Electronic files downloaded to a hard drive can be stored for years at little or no cost. Even when such files have been deleted, they can be recovered months or years later using readily-available forensics tools. When a person \"deletes\" a file on a computer, the data contained in the file does not actually disappear; rather, that data. remains on the hard drive until it is overwritten by new data. Therefore, deleted files, or remnants of deleted files, may reside in free space or slack space - that is, in space on the hard drive that is not allocated to an active file or that is unused after a file has been allocated to a set block of storage space - for long periods of time before they are overwritten. In addition, a computer's operating system may also keep a record of deleted data in a \"swap\" or \"recovery\" file. Similarly, files that have been viewed via the Internet are automatically downloaded into a temporary Internet directory or \"cache.\" The browser typically maintains a fixed amount of hard drive space devoted to these files, and the files are only overwritten as they are replaced with more recently viewed Internet pages. Thus, the ability to retrieve residue of an electronic file from a hard drive depends less on when the file was downloaded or viewed than on a particular user's operating system, storage capacity, and computer habits. 120. Also based on discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that computer hardware, software, and electronic files may be important to a criminal investigation in two distinct ways: (1) the objects themselves may be contraband, evidence, instrumentalities, or fruits of crime, an/or (2) the objects may be used as storage devices that contain contraband, evidence, instrumentalities, or fruits of crime in the form of electronic data. Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits the government to search for and seize computer hardware, software, and electronic files that are evidence of crime, contraband, instrumentalities of crime, and/or fruits of crime. In this case, the warrant application requests permission to search and seize records that may be stored on a computer. These records constitute evidence of crime, and your affiant believes that, in this case, the computer hardware is a container for this evidence. This affidavit also requests permission to seize the computer hardware that may contain the records if it becomes necessary for reasons of practicality to remove the hardware and conduct a search off-site. 121. Based upon discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that searching and seizing information from computers often requires agents to seize most or all electronic storage devices (along with related peripherals) to be searched later by a qualified computer expert in a laboratory or other controlled environment. This is true because of the following: a. The volume of evidence. Computer storage devices (like hard disks, diskettes, tapes, laser disks) can store the equivalent of millions of information. Additionally, a 'suspect may try to conceal criminal evidence; he or she might store it in random order with deceptive file names. This may require searching authorities to examine all the stored data to determine which particular files are evidence or instrumentalities of crime. This sorting process can take weeks or months, depending on the volume of data stored, and it would be impractical and invasive to attempt this kind of data search on-site. b. Technical Requirements. Searching computer systems for criminal evidence is a highly technical process requiring expert skill and a properly controlled environment. The vast array of computer hardware and software available requires even computer experts to specialize in some systems and applications, so it is difficult to know before a search which expert is qualified to analyze the system and its data. In any event, however, data search protocols are exacting scientific procedures designed to protect the integrity of the ' evidence and to recover even \"hidden,\" erased, compressed, password-protected, or encrypted files. Because computer evidence is vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional modification or destruction (both from external sources or from destructive code imbedded in the system as a 'booby trap\"), a controlled environment may be necessary to complete an accurate analysis. Further, such searches often require the seizure of most or all of a computer system's input/output peripheral devices, related software, documentation, and data security devices (including passwords) so that a qualified computer expert can accurately retrieve the system's data in a laboratory or other controlled environment. 122. Your affiant recognizes that the computer(s) located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, R.I. may be used by functioning companies, and that a seizure of the computers may have the unintended and undesired effect of limiting the companies' ability to engage in business. In response to these concerns, the agents who execute the search will take an incremental approach to minimize the inconvenience to any legitimate business that may be occurring at this address and to minimize the need to seize equipment and data. This incremental approach, which will be explained to all of the agents on the search team before the search is executed, will proceed as follows: a. Upon arriving at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, the agents will attempt to create, while at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, an electronic \"image\" of the information stored on the computer(s). Generally speaking, imaging is the taking of a complete electronic picture of the computer's data, including all hidden sectors and deleted files. Imaging a computer permits the agents to obtain an exact copy of the computer's stored data without actually seizing the computer hardware. The computer expert or another technical expert will then conduct an off-site search for the computer files described in the warrant from the \"mirror image\" copy at a later date. If the computer expert successfully images the computers, the agents will not conduct any additional search or seizure of the computers. b. If \"imaging\" on-site proves impractical, or even impossible for technical reasons, then the agents will seize those components of the computer system that the computer expert believes must be seized to permit the agents to locate the computer files described in the warrant at an off-site location. The components will be seized and taken in to the custody of law enforcement agents. If employees of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, so request, the computer expert will, to the extent practicable, attempt to provide the employees with copies of any files that may be necessary or important to the continuing function of legitimate business. If, after inspecting the computers, the analyst determines that some or all of this equipment is no longer necessary to retrieve and preserve the evidence, the government will return it within a reasonable time. CONCLUSION 123. Based on the foregoing, including: (1) the purported diagnoses that patients had abnormalities in their blood, including parasites; (2) the efforts to sell products to the patients, such as the green drink and E-water, and misrepresentations regarding their development and potential; (3) the undercover operations that showed that Curran had falsely diagnosed the conditions of the undercover agents; (4) the patient complaints and summaries; (5) the medical opinions that indicate that parasites in the blood should only occur in patients with malaria, a disease not present in this geographical area; (6) Curran's statements to Glen Lynch that he could not deposit cash in amounts greater than $10,000 at a bank and the he intended to \"make a couple of million bucks and get out;\" (7) Curran's use of interstate wires to conduct financial transactions resulting from his scheme; and, (8) Curran's use of the mails to respond to and deflect inquiries from the RJDOH regarding patient complaints, I believe that probable cause exists that John E. Curran, through his activities at The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island has engaged in the following illegal activity: (1) Mail Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; and (2) Wire Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. 124. Based upon the foregoing, including: (1) the deposits of fraudulently obtained proceeds into Citizen's Bank Account No. 1452-751-0; (2) the use of the funds in the Citizen's Bank account to pay American Express Business Platinum Card, Account No. 3727-150577- 83006, bills addressed to Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute; (3) and the charging of expenses intended to promote the scheme to the American Express account, I believe that probable cause exists that John E. Curran, through his activities at The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, has conducted financial transactions involving the proceeds of the specified unlawful activities of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343), with the intent to promote the carrying on of said specified unlawful activities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i). 125. I further believe, based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, there is probable cause to believe that evidence, fruits, any instrumentalities of illegal activity by John Curran, as more fully described in Attachment B, are presently located on the premises at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, at the office and principal place of business of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. I respectfully request that the Court issue a search warrant for those premises as described in Attachment A, authorizing seizure of items described in Attachment B, which I incorporated by reference as though fully set forth in the Affidavit. 126. Based upon the above information, there is also probable cause to believe that Citizen's Bank Account No. 1452-751-0 is being used with the intent to promote the carrying on of the specified unlawful activities of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i), and that said account contains the traceable proceeds from the above violations. Thus, all funds in this account are forfeitable to the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, or constitute property traceable to such property. JASON A.

R. Campbell, General Manager Tianshi Health Products, Inc., USA 917 134th Street Southwest, Suite #A-8 Everett, Washington 98204 WARNING LETTER Dear Mr. Campbell: An inspection conducted at your facility at Tianshi Health Products, Inc., USA, 917 134th Street Southwest, Suite #A-8, Everett, Washington, on February 19-20, 2004, by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revealed a serious regulatory problem involving the product known as the Acupoint Treasure. Under a United States federal law, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), this product is a medical device because it is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or function of the body. See section 201(h) of the Act, 21 USC. 321 (h). Specifically, according to its labeling, the Acupoint Treasure is a \"pocket medical acupuncture appliance\" that claims to lower blood pressure, eliminate inflammation, relieve pain, improve microcirculation, and treat diseases, including periarthritis of humeroscapularis, headache, waist pain, and nerve pain. The law requires that manufacturers of certain medical devices or initial importers of certain foreign-made medical devices obtain marketing approval or clearance for their products from FDA before they may offer them for sale or import them into the United States. This helps to protect the public health by ensuring that new medical devices are shown to be either safe and effective or substantially equivalent to other devices already legally marketed in this country. Our records do not show that there is marketing clearance or approval in effect for the Acupoint Treasure. Our inspection revealed that 2000 Acupoint Treasures were nonetheless imported and delivered to your Everett, Washington facility in August 2003 from your facility Tianjin Tianshi Bioengineering Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China. These Acupoint Treasures were declared as \"TIANSHI ACUPOINT TRESURE MASSAGE\" with product code \"89I{}{}SA\" under entry number FN5-0105653-8. The inaccurate declaration on the entry caused these unapproved medical devices to enter the United States without review by the FDA. Two hundred of these devices were subsequently exported to Canada. Because the Acupoint Treasure medical devices do not have marketing clearance or approval from the FDA, they violate United States law. In legal terms, the devices are misbranded under section 502(o) [ 21 U.S.C. 352(o)] and adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) [ 21 U.S.C. 351(f)(1)(B)] of the Act. Your devices are misbranded under the Act because you did not submit a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the Act. Until you submit a section 510(k) premarket notification and FDA reviews it and notifies you that your device is substantially equivalent to other legally marketed devices, your devices are also adulterated under the Act because the law requires, and you do not have, an approved premarket approval application that shows your device is safe and effective. For a product requiring premarket approval before marketing, the notification required by section 510(k) of the act is deemed to be satisfied when a premarket approval application (PMA) is pending before the agency (21 CFR 807.81 (b)). Until these serious violations of the Act are corrected, future shipments of the Acupoiut Treasure may be refused admission to the United States. This serious violation of the law may also result in FDA taking regulatory action without further notice, including seizing your product inventory. Federal agencies are informed of the issuance of ail warning letters about drugs and medical devices so they may consider this information when awarding government contracts. You should take prompt action to correct this deficiency. You should notify this office within fifteen (15) working days from receipt of this letter of the specific steps you have taken to correct the noted violations, including an explanation of each step taken to prevent the recurrence of similar violations. If corrective action cannot be completed within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which the corrections will be completed. Finally, you should understand that there are many FDA requirements pertaining to the manufacture and marketing of medical devices. This letter pertains only to the issue of premarket review requirements for your device and does not necessarily address other obligations you have under the law. The kind of information you need to submit in order to obtain clearance or approval for your device is described on FDA's Internet website at www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice. The FDA will evaluate this information and decide whether your product may be legally marketed. You may obtain general information about all of FDA's requirements for manufacturers and distributors of medical devices by contacting our Division of Small Manufacturers and International Consumer Assistance (DSMICA) at (800) 638-2041 or through the Internet at http://www.fda.gov.

Even if adequately trained, such \"counselors\" would still be objectionable because of the obvious conflict-of-interest that exists when a provider profits directly from products they recommend and sell. - Require large sums of money at the start or make clients sign contracts for expensive, long-term programs. Such practices too often have been abused as salespeople focus attention on signing-up new people rather than delivering continuing, satisfactory service to consumers. Programs should be on a pay-as-you-go basis. - Fail to inform clients about the risks associated with-weight-loss or the specific program. - Promote unproven or spurious weight-loss aids such as HCG, starch blockers, diuretics, sauna belts, body wraps, passive exercise, ear staples, acupuncture, electric muscle stimulators, spirulina, phenylalanine, arginine, etc. - Claim that \"cellulite\" exists in the body. - Claim that use of an appetite suppressant or methylcellulose enables a person to lose body fat without restricting accustomed caloric intake. - Claim that a weight control product contains a unique ingredient or component unless it is unavailable in other weight control products. ___________________________ NCAHF is a private nonprofit, voluntary health agency that focuses upon health misinformation, fraud, and quackery as public health problems.

IN THE MATTER OF BRUCE RIND, M.D. Respondent License Number: D37186 BEFORE THE STATE BOARD OF PHYSICIAN QUALITY ASSURANCE Case Number: 98-0507 CONSENT ORDER PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND The State of Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance (the \"Board\"), on December 15,1999, voted to charge Bruce Rind, M.D. (the \"Respondent\") (D.O.B. January 16, 1951), license Number 037186, under the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the \"Act\"), MD. CODE ANN., HEALTH OCC. (\"H.O.\") \u00a7 14-404 (1999 Supp.). The pertinent provisions of the Act provide the following: Subject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 14-405 of this subtitle, the Board, on the affirmative vote of a majority of its full authorized membership, may reprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee: (3) Is guilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; (22) Fails to meet appropriate standards as determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care performed in an outpatient surgical facility, office, hospital. or any other location in this State; (23) Wilfully submits false statements to collect fees for which services are not provided; and (40) Fails to keep adequate medical records as determined by appropriate peer review.

Be registered by the Board, or to have met all the requirements of Health Occupations Article, \u00a7\u00a7 1A-101-1A-502. [Footnote 2: \u00a7\u00a71A-101-1A-502 is the Maryland Acupuncture Act.] On September 28, 2000, Respondent was subsequently notified of the Board's charges by certified mail to Respondent's counsel, Alan Oumoff, Esquire. On November 1, 2000, Respondent, his attorney Alan Dumoff, Esquire, and Janet Klein Brown, Administrative Prosecutor, appeared before the Case Resolution Conference Committee (the \"CRC\") of the Board. As a result of negotiations with the Office of the Attorney General, Respondent agreed to enter into this Consent Order, consisting of Procedural Background, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, with the terms and conditions set forth below. FINDINGS OF FACT I. Background 1. At all times relevant to these Charges, Respondent was and is a physician licensed to practice medicine in Maryland. The Respondent was originally issued a license to practice medicine in Maryland on or about August 10, 1988, being issued license number D37186. Respondent also has active licenses to practice medicine in Virginia and Washington, D.C. 2. At all times relevant hereto, Respondent has maintained an office for the practice of medicine in Rockville, Maryland. [Footnote 3: Respondent's solo practice is called \"Center for Holistic Medicine.\"] Respondent's self-designated specialty is anesthesiology, having been Board certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology in January 1988. 3. On or about January 12,1998, the Board received correspondence from Blue Cross Blue Shield of the National Capital Area (\"BC/BS\"), informing the Board that upon reviewing ten (10) medical records and related claims in 1994, BC/BS determined that the services were \"outside the standard of good medical practice\" because the services rendered were considered by BC/BS to be related to the \"treatment of environmental illness,\" a non-covered service. BC/BS referred the cases to the Board for its review. 4. Based on the complaint, the Board initiated an investigation of the matter. 5. The Board subpoenaed records, including Quality Assurance records from Kaiser Permanente and from Private HealthCare Systems (\"PHCS\"). Respondent was terminated from PHCS in March 1998 because certain laboratory testing was not considered by PHCS to be appropriate or acceptable in the general medical community and the medical necessity of intravenous therapy has not been substantiated. 6 On or about February 5,1999, the Board requested the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland (\"Med Chi\"), or an appropriate component society, to conduct a practice review of Respondent's medical practice. 7. Thereafter, the Montgomery County Medical Society (\"MCMS\") Peer Review Committee conducted a peer review. Two Board certified physicians, one in anesthesiology and one in internal medicine. reviewed thirteen (13) randomly selected medical records of Respondent's patients, the 1998 letter from BC/BS, and a July 10, 1998 letter of response written by Respondent's attorney on Respondent's behalf, and determined that the standard of quality care was not met and the medical records documentation was not adequate in twelve (12) of the thirteen (13) cases. [Footnote 4: Fourteen (14) records were sent to Med Chi, but only thirteen (13) were reviewed.] [Footnote 5: The \"conclusion\" of the Peer Review Report states the Respondent breached the standard of care in eleven of the charts reviewed; however, the text of the report cites that the standard was not met in twelve of the cases.] 8. On November 19, 1999, the Board received the report of the MCMS Peer Review Committee. The Peer Reviewers noted that there were multiple deficiencies in caring for the patients reviewed which included the following: a. Not obtaining informed consent on a number of patients who were given non-conditional (sic) treatments. (i.e. intravenous vitamin and colchicine therapy and prolotherapy); b. Billing for comprehensive visits when, in fact, the Respondent's documentation included limited information with respect to symptoms and physical findings; c. Inappropriate follow up with respect to diagnostic evaluation for patients presenting with significant clinical conditions; d. Identifying complex medical diagnoses without supporting history, physical examination and/or laboratory testing; and e. Respondent performed acupuncture on two of the patients who were reviewed. II. Patient Specific Allegations Regarding Failure to Deliver Quality Medical Care, Inadequate Medical Records and False Statements to Collect a Fee Patient 1 [Footnote 6: Patient names are confidential and are not used in the Consent Order. Respondent is aware of the identity of each of the patients, having been provided a Confidential Patient Identification List enumerating each of the patients and their names.] 9. Patient 1, then a 59 year old male (d.o.b. 5/2/36), was treated by Respondent on numerous occasions between January 4,1995 and December 13,1995 for myofascial pain following a motor vehicle accident and for supra-nuclear palsy. 10. Respondent saw Patient 1 on an initial office visit of January 4, 1995. Respondent noted blank facial expression and restricted range of motion of the neck. Respondent's initial assessment was incomplete in that he did not note that Patient 1 had been in an automobile accident, failed to document subjective complaints and a plan of treatment. Respondent's physical examination was limited to an assessment of reflexes and a neurological examination. 11. Respondent charged Patient 1 $200 for an \"office consult, detailed\", or \"Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology,\" published by the American Medical Association, is a listing of descriptive terms and identifying codes for reporting medical services performed by physicians.] In 1995, CPT Code 99244 referred to an: [O]ffice consultation for a new or established patient, which requires these three key components; a comprehensive history; a comprehensive examination; and medical decision making of moderate complexity. CPT Code 1995. 12. Respondent did not document a comprehensive history; comprehensive examination; and assessment of moderate complexity to support coding and charging for performance of a detailed office consultation. 13. On January 4, 1995, Respondent diagnosed \"supranuclear palsy secondary to heavy metal toxicity from fillings\" without objective laboratory data of mercury levels. Respondent alleges that the diagnosis of supranuclear palsy was by history from Patient 1 and that he intended to \"rule out\" the diagnosis of \"secondary to heavy metal toxicity\" by a diagnostic trial of chelation therapy. 14. On June 26,1995, Patient 1 presented with \"mild hemoptysis\" (coughing up blood). Respondent alleges that Patient 1's symptoms were vague. Respondent's treatment plan was \"will observe.\" Respondent did not follow-up and obtain a chest x-ray or refer Patient 1 to his primary care physician for further assessment. On Respondent's office billing form, Respondent only noted a diagnosis of \"Mercury Toxicity.\" Respondent saw Patient 1 for a return visit on June 30, 1995 but did not document any progress note, including any follow-up of the hemoptysis.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The detection and elimination of health care fraud and abuse is a top priority of Federal law enforcement. Our efforts to combat fraud were consolidated and strengthened considerably by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA established a national Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC or the Program), under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) [(1)], acting through the Department's Inspector General (HHS/OIG), designed to coordinate Federal, state and local law enforcement activities with respect to health care fraud and abuse. The fifth year of operation under the Program saw a continuation of the collaborative efforts of Federal and state enforcement and oversight agencies to identify and prosecute the most egregious instances of health care fraud, to prevent future fraud or abuse, and to protect program beneficiaries. Monetary Results In 2001, the Federal government won or negotiated more than $1.7 billion in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health care fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well as prior year judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, the Federal government collected more than $1.3 billion. More than $1 billion of the funds collected and disbursed in 2001 were returned to the Medicare Trust Fund. An additional $42.8 million was recovered as the Federal share of Medicaid restitution. This is the largest return to the government since the inception of the Program. Enforcement Actions Federal prosecutors filed 445 criminal indictments in health care fraud cases in 2001. A total of 465 defendants were convicted for health care fraud-related crimes in 2001. There were also 1,746 civil matters pending, and 188 civil cases filed in 2001. HHS excluded 3,756 individuals and entities from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or other federally sponsored health care programs, most as a result of convictions for crimes relating to Medicare or Medicaid, for patient abuse or neglect, or as a result of licensure revocations. This record number of exclusion actions is the result of successful collaboration with state Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) and state licensure boards. INTRODUCTION ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE SECRETARY DETAILING EXPENDITURES AND REVENUES UNDER THE HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE CONTROL PROGRAM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001 As Required by Section 1817(k)(5) of the Social Security Act STATUTORY BACKGROUND The Social Security Act section 1128C(a), as established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191, HIPAA or the Act), created the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, a far-reaching program to combat fraud and abuse in health care, including both public and private health plans. The Act requires that an amount equaling recoveries from health care investigations \u2014 including criminal fines, forfeitures, civil settlements and judgments, and administrative penalties, but excluding restitution, compensation to the victim agency, and relators' shares \u2014 be deposited in the Medicare Trust Fund. [(2)]All funds deposited in the Trust Fund as a result of the Act are available for the operations of the Trust Fund. As stated above, the Act appropriates monies from the Medicare Trust Fund to an expenditure account, called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account (the Account), in amounts that the Secretary and Attorney General jointly certify as necessary to finance anti-fraud activities. The maximum amounts available for certification are specified in the Act. Certain of these sums are to be available only for activities of HHS/OIG, with respect to Medicare and Medicaid programs. In 2001, the Secretary and the Attorney General certified $181 million for appropriation to the Account. A detailed breakdown of the allocation of these funds is set forth later in this report. These resources generally supplement the direct appropriations of HHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) that are devoted to health care fraud enforcement, though they provide the sole source of funding for Medicare and Medicaid enforcement by HHS/OIG. (Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received $88 million from HIPAA which is discussed in the Appendix.) Under the joint direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary, the Program's goals are: - to coordinate Federal, state and local law enforcement efforts relating to health care fraud and abuse; - to conduct investigations, audits and evaluations relating to the delivery of and payment for health care in the United States; - to facilitate enforcement of all applicable remedies for such fraud; - to provide guidance to the health care industry regarding fraudulent practices; and - to establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions against health care providers. The Act requires the Attorney General and the Secretary to submit a joint annual report to the Congress which identifies both: - the amounts appropriated to the Trust Fund for the previous fiscal year under various categories and the source of such amounts; and - the amounts appropriated from the Trust Fund for such year for use by the Attorney General and the Secretary and the justification for the expenditure of such amounts. This annual report fulfills the above statutory requirements. MONETARY RESULTS As required by the Act, HHS and DOJ must detail in this Annual Report the amounts deposited and appropriated to the Medicare Trust Fund, and the source of such deposits. In 2001, as a result of the combined anti-fraud actions of the Federal and state governments and others, the Federal government collected a record high of more than $1.3 billion in connection with health care fraud cases and matters. [(3)]These funds were deposited with the Department of the Treasury and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA), transferred to other Federal agencies administering health care programs, or paid to private persons. The following chart provides a breakdown of the transfers/deposits: Total Transfers/Deposits by Recipient 2001 Department of the Treasury HIPAA Deposits to the Medicare Trust Fund Gifts and Bequests $0 Amount Equal to Criminal Fines 2,894,234 Civil Monetary Penalties 6,060,481 Amount Equal to Asset Forfeiture * 0 Amount Equal to Penalties and Multiple Damages 454,615,907 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services OIG Audit Disallowances - Recovered 124,450,000 Restitution/Compensatory Damages 662,398,030 Restitution/Compensatory Damages to Federal Agencies Office of Personnel Management 8,078,116 Department of Defense 11,264,448 Other Agencies 7,615,320 Department of Health and Human Services - Other than CMS 4,165,252 Relators' Payments ** 83,335,798 TOTAL *** 1,364,877,586 *This includes only forfeitures under 18 United States Code (U.S.C.) 1347, a Federal health care fraud offense that became effective on August 21, 1996. Not included are forfeitures obtained in numerous health care fraud cases prosecuted under Federal mail and wire fraud and other offenses. **These are funds awarded to private persons who file suits on behalf of the Federal government under the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. sec 3730(b). ***Funds are also collected on behalf of state Medicaid programs and private insurance companies; these funds are not represented here. The above transfers include certain collections, or amounts equal to certain collections, required by HIPAA to be deposited directly into the Medicare Trust Fund. These amounts include: - Gifts and bequests made unconditionally to the Trust Fund, for the benefit of the Account or any activity financed through the Account; - Criminal fines recovered in cases involving a Federal health care offense, including collections under section 24(a) of title 18, U.S.C. (relating to health care fraud); - Civil monetary penalties in cases involving a Federal health care offense; - Amounts resulting from the forfeiture of property by reason of a Federal health care offense, including collections under section 982(a)(6) of title 18, U.S.C.; and - Penalties and damages obtained and otherwise creditable to miscellaneous receipts of the general fund of the Treasury obtained under sections 3729 through 3733 title 31, U.S.C. (known as the False Claims Act, FCA), in cases involving claims related to the provision of health care items and services (other than funds awarded to a relator, for restitution or otherwise authorized by law). HIPAA requires an independent biannual review of these deposits by the General Accounting Office (GAO). The GAO review covering Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 is ongoing. PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS ExpendituresIn the fifth year of operation, the Secretary and the Attorney General certified $181 million as necessary for the Program. The following chart gives the allocation by recipient: 2001 ALLOCATION OF HCFAC APPROPRIATION (Dollars in thousands) Organization Allocation Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General [(4)] 130,000 Office of the General Counsel 3,876 Administration on Aging 1,500 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2,552 Assistant Secretary for Budget, Technology and Finance 500 Total 138,428 Department of Justice United States Attorneys 24,244 Civil Division 16,810 Criminal Division 1,093 Civil Rights Division 609 Justice Management Division 713 Total 43,469 Total 181,897 Accomplishments 2001 marked the fifth year of the Program. During those five years, the Program's accomplishments have been impressive. Over $2.9 billion has been returned to the Medicare Trust Fund. In 1999, the Trustees of the Medicare Trust Fund extended their estimate of the financial life of the fund by 30 years. One of the primary contributing factors cited by the Trustees was \"the continuing efforts to combat fraud and abuse.\" (Trustees Annual Report, 1999). Returns to the Federal government as a whole are even larger, over $3 billion. In addition, more than 2,000 defendants were convicted for health care fraud-related offenses. Over 15,000 entities or individuals were excluded from participating in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally sponsored health care programs. The Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank is \"up and running\" and industry guidance and beneficiary outreach have been greatly expanded. These continuing accomplishments of DOJ and HHS and other partners in the coordinated anti-fraud effort, as well as the extensive preventive activities, demonstrate that the increased funds to address health care fraud and abuse are sound investments. Collections During this year, the Federal government won or negotiated more than $1.7 billion in judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in health care fraud cases and proceedings. As a result of these activities, as well as prior year judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions, the Federal government collected $1.3 billion in cases resulting from health care fraud and abuse, of which more than $1 billion was returned to the Medicare Trust Fund, and $42.8 million was recovered as the Federal share of Medicaid restitution. It should be emphasized that some of the judgments, settlements, and administrative impositions in 2001 will result in collections in future years, just as some of the collections in 2001 are attributable to actions from prior years. Judgments/Settlements Working together, HHS and DOJ have brought to successful conclusion the investigation and prosecution of numerous costly health care fraud schemes. Among them, are the following: - HCA - The Healthcare Corporation (HCA). Formerly known as Columbia/HCA, HCA, the largest for-profit hospital chain in the United States, agreed to plead guilty to criminal conduct and paid over $840 million in criminal fines and civil penalties to the Federal government and the affected states related to five areas of Medicare and Medicaid fraud. This investigation was the largest multi-agency investigation of a health care provider ever undertaken by the government. Under the terms of the plea agreement, two subsidiaries - Columbia Homecare Group, Inc. and Columbia Management Companies, Inc. - paid more than $95 million in criminal fines and pleaded guilty to several charges involving a wide range of criminal conduct which occurred at HCA's hospitals nationwide. The criminal conduct charged included cost report fraud, fraudulent billing of Medicare for personnel who worked at home health agencies and other personnel who worked at wound care centers, fraudulent billing to Medicare for patients diagnosed with pneumonia, paying kickbacks and other remuneration to doctors to induce referrals, paying kickbacks in connection with the purchase and sale of home health agencies, and fraudulent billing of Medicare for fees paid to manage those agencies. HCA also paid over $745 million to resolve the civil allegations which included: upcoding of pneumonia and other diagnosis-related groups, hospital laboratory tests, overbilling arising from a series of acquisitions of home health agencies, charging marketing costs as home health community education, and billing for non-covered home health services. As part of the civil settlement, HCA entered into a comprehensive 8-year corporate integrity agreement (CIA), and agreed to divest itself of a hospital subject to exclusion. - Vencor, Inc., one of the nation's largest operators of nursing homes and long term hospital services, agreed to pay the Government a total of $219 million of which $104.5 million resolved civil claims that Vencor knowingly submitted false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE, the military's health care program. This civil settlement concluded a successful joint investigation and negotiation by multiple Federal and state agencies, and represented the largest settlement under the civil FCA to date based on failure to provide adequate health care at long term care facilities. The company entered a 5-year CIA that requires Vencor to adopt a comprehensive quality assurance infrastructure at all levels. Importantly, the government proceeded against Vencor even after the company filed for bankruptcy, stating that the long term care institutions \"care for our nation's most vulnerable citizens\" and will be held accountable, notwithstanding bankruptcy proceedings. - LifeScan, Inc. Culminating from a cooperative effort among the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DOJ and HHS/OIG, the United States entered into a global settlement for $60 million with LifeScan, a California corporation that develops, designs, manufactures, distributes and sells blood glucose monitoring systems. The company allegedly marketed an adulterated and misbranded medical device for which Federal (including Medicare, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and TRICARE) and state health care programs paid. The company also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor violation of FDA laws. To guard against future compliance problems, the government included in the Special Conditions of Probation a requirement that for the next 3 years the company conduct extensive training and internal reviews, and report on these activities. A separate 3-year CIA was also negotiated. - Quorum Health Group, Inc. The owner of 30 acute care hospitals and manager of over 200 more, settled a case for $87.5 million for allegedly engaging in fraudulent cost reporting practices in violation of the FCA. The provider used \"reserve\" cost reports to determine its allowable Medicare costs and then filed a separate set of allegedly fraudulent cost reports to obtain greater Medicare reimbursement. Quorum's successor, Triad, also entered a comprehensive 5-year CIA. These and other settlements reflect the culmination of investigations that have been ongoing for several years. Though settled in 2001, the fines and restitution generated by some of these cases will not be credited to the Medicare Trust Funds until 2002. Highlights of Other Collaborative Efforts Nursing Homes One area in which collaboration has proved most effective has been in enforcement and oversight of fraud and abuse in skilled nursing facilities, particularly issues relating to quality of care in these facilities, as demonstrated by the following: - Forensics Roundtable. The DOJ hosted a roundtable discussion of elder abuse and neglect. The roundtable, entitled \"Elder Justice: Medical Forensic Issues Relating to Elder Abuse and Neglect,\" brought together 27 preeminent experts to discuss medical, legal and organizational issues concerning elder justice. The panel of 27 experts represented a variety of professions and areas of expertise, including geriatrics, forensic pathology, family medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, gerontology, nursing, social work, psychology, emergency medicine, adult protective services, and Federal, state, and local law enforcement. The discussion focused on four distinct but overlapping subjects relating to elder abuse and neglect: (1) detection and diagnosis, (2) application of forensic science, (3) education and training, and (4) research. A consensus emerged that an inadequate research base, lack of education, insufficient coordination, and poor planning nationwide have made it difficult to prevent, detect, diagnose, intervene, treat, and prosecute elder abuse and neglect. More information about the roundtable, including the recommendations for follow-up, may be found at: [http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/elderjust/index.html] - Enforcement Actions. Several important enforcement actions against nursing homes also culminated in 2001, including the Vencor case, described above, and the following: - Questionable Nursing and Therapy Services Charges: National Healthcare Corporation (NHC) entered a $27 million civil settlement to resolve allegations that the company submitted inflated Medicare costs reports. The government alleged that the cost reports overstated the number of hours that the nursing staff spent caring for Medicare patients, and that some nursing home personnel were billed as performing therapy on Medicare patients which were not performed. As a condition of the settlement of this case, NHC also entered a 5-year CIA. - Owner of Nursing Home Excluded: The principal operator and co-owner of two nursing homes and other health care businesses in Pennsylvania agreed to a 5-year exclusion for his role in providing substandard physical, medical and personal care to residents of those homes. The settlement represents the first time HHS/OIG has excluded the owner of a health care facility based on the owner's responsibility for poor quality of care at the facility. - Heightened Monitoring of Quality of Care: Manor Care, Inc., and affiliates, settled a civil FCA case arising from alleged inadequate care to Medicare patients residing at one of the corporation's skilled nursing facilities. The government contended that the quality of patient care was substandard, including inadequate nursing care for residents with pressure ulcers, insufficient staffing, training and supervision, and missing or incomplete assessments of residents' functional capacity and needs. Under the consent order and judgment, the company will pay $90,000 to the government. More importantly, the company is required to retain an independent consultant and take other steps to closely monitor future quality of care at the facility. To ensure compliance, the approving Court specifically retained jurisdiction until the corporation fully implements all provisions of the extensive order. - Criminal Convictions for Bribery: A former official of the Oklahoma State Department of Health and an Oklahoma nursing home owner were sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $50,000 in fines. Both were convicted of bribery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666. Under the scheme, the owner agreed to pay the Deputy Commissioner a bribe in return for the Deputy Commissioner's aid in falsifying and backdating documents relating to Medicare reimbursements to the nursing home company. The investigation was conducted by the FBI, HHS/OIG and the Oklahoma State Attorney General's MFCU. - Grants by DOJ. During 2001 DOJ awarded grants to organizations for follow-up work based on the Forensic Roundtable, and other projects, for the following purposes: - To establish a working group of experts to identify, review, refine, and develop priorities among the myriad of suggestions made at the Roundtable. One objective of the working group will be to gather information from Federal agencies and national, state, and local organizations about contemplated, planned or existing activities related to medical forensic aspects of elder abuse and neglect, in order to promote communication and coordination and to identify promising practices. - To provide five community organizations with funds to address elder victimization issues at the community level, such as coordination and referral to law enforcement. - To provide a statistical analysis and report of current data concerning local prosecutions for nursing home abuse and neglect and other types of elder victimization and a survey of local prosecutors to identify needs and priorities in pursuing these cases. - To develop and empirically demonstrate the signs of abuse, and to gain a further understanding of bruising (location, coloration, and resolution) in the geriatric population. - To identify and describe the forensic markers for elder sexual abuse that will be used to develop a database critical for understanding how intentional sexual injuries may present in the geriatric population. - Recommendations to Improve Quality of Care. The HHS/OIG issued several significant reports assessing a variety of facets of nursing home care. In a study of Medicare reimbursement for therapy services, significant levels of error were found in physical, occupational, and speech therapy services to Medicare nursing home patients. Medicare erroneously paid approximately $48.5 million for medically unnecessary, undocumented and inadequately documented therapy during the first half of 1999. This represented a disturbing overall error rate of 24.7 percent. Enhanced provider education, and focused medical reviews were recommended to reduce the error rate. In addition, HHS/OIG evaluated current practice in implementing the nursing home resident assessment and concluded that inability to validate the resident assessment through the medical record exposes the Medicare program to billing abuses. The HHS/OIG also examined safeguards that ensure the appropriate admission and mental health treatment of younger Medicaid beneficiaries who have a serious mental illness and reside in nursing facilities, and found that the required pre-admission screening and resident reviews are not in compliance with Federal requirements. Technology CMS and DOJ cosponsored a national conference, Combating Health Care Fraud & Abuse: Technologies and Approaches for the 21st Century, which explored technologies and approaches used to detect, prevent, and investigate health care fraud and abuse in Federally-funded health programs in June 2000. At the conference, interactive regionally-based group working sessions produced recommendations for specific follow-up action, which CMS and DOJ developed into an Action Plan for the future. The final report and Action Plan were released in May 2001. Chief among these recommendations was formation of a National Technology Group to consist of representatives from Federal and state health care program integrity and law enforcement agencies. The group was formed, and held its first meeting in June of 2001. The group will address national issues that crosscut Federal and state health care program and law enforcement agencies, provide policy and operational guidance, serve as an information clearinghouse for the use of fraud detection technology and collaborative program integrity and enforcement approaches, and seek to facilitate formation and coordination of Regional Technology Users' Group. Drug Pricing Enforcement Actions: Prescription drug pricing remains an important area of inquiry for the HCFAC program. A number of investigations, audits and evaluations focused on whether the government is paying reasonable and appropriate amounts for covered prescription drugs. For example: - CIA Requiring Medicaid Price Reporting: A settlement was finalized with the Bayer Corporation, with the company agreeing to pay the Government $14 million and to enter a 5-year CIA. At issue were the average wholesale prices that Bayer reported for six of its drugs, and alleged misrepresentations that Bayer made to state Medicaid programs and to CMS. The CIA is noteworthy because, for the first time, a company agreed to affirmatively report certain drug pricing information, including an obligation to provide certified pricing data directly to the Medicaid programs for covered Bayer products. - Settlement in Connection with Partially Filled Prescriptions: The DOJ and HHS/OIG, working jointly with representatives of the MFCUs, reached settlement in a qui tam action against CVS Corporation, involving allegations that the company submitted claims for partially-filled prescriptions to Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). In addition to paying $4 million to the government, CVS also agreed to a 4-year CIA. Status of Medicare and Medicaid Drug Pricing and Payment Medicaid-Pharmacy Acquisition Costs: Ongoing audits and evaluations have generated information that will be valuable to policymakers who are considering alternate reimbursement approaches. Following up on previous work, HHS/OIG conducted a nationwide review of pharmacy acquisition costs for brand name drugs reimbursed under Medicaid. Most states use average wholesale price (AWP) minus a percentage discount, which varies by state, as a basis for reimbursing pharmacies for drug prescriptions. This review sought to determine the size of the discount. Based on pricing information from 216 pharmacies in 8 States, HHS/OIG estimated that the national actual acquisition cost for brand-name drugs was an average of 21.8 percent below AWP. In most states, the average discount below AWP for reimbursement of estimated acquisition cost was only 10.3 percent in 1999. If this disparity were eliminated, HHS/OIG estimated that nearly $1.1 billion could have been saved for the 200 brand name drugs (accounting for the greatest amount of Medicaid reimbursement in 1999). Medicare-inflated Payments for Prescription Drugs: In Medicare, HHS/OIG studies spanning the last 4 years have revealed that Medicare and its beneficiaries pay considerably more than do other Federal health care programs for prescription drugs. In January 2001, HHS/OIG released a report comparing Medicare reimbursement to prices available to the physician/supplier community, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and to Medicaid. The study focused on 24 drugs representing $3.1 billion of the $3.9 billion in Medicare drug expenditures in 1999. For every drug in the review, Medicare paid more than the wholesale price available to physicians and suppliers and the VA Federal Supply Schedule price. In fact, for half of the drugs, Medicare paid more than double the VA price. Medicare and its beneficiaries would have saved over $1.6 billion if it had paid the same amount as does the VA, or $761 million at actual wholesale prices. These comparisons were run again using more current drug pricing information \u2014 the sometimes large discrepancies between Medicare and other reimbursement for the same drugs remained. The study also found that Medicare carriers are not establishing consistent drug reimbursement amounts for certain drugs. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS continue to seek administrative and legislative remedies to reduce excessive drug reimbursement amounts and require all carriers to reimburse a uniform amount for each drug. Medicaid Rebates: Medicaid reimburses pharmacies and other providers for the drugs that they dispense to Medicaid beneficiaries. Manufacturers must pay rebates, shared between states and the Federal government, on all drugs sold to Medicaid. The rebate is based on the difference between best price and Average Manufacturers Price (for sole source drugs) or a statutory percentage of the Average Manufacturer Price (for generic drugs). \"Best price\" is defined as the lowest price at which drug manufacturers sell drugs to any non-governmental, for-profit purchaser and specifically includes sales to health maintenance organizations (HMOs). CMS guidance permits the exclusion of sales to drug repackagers in calculating the best price. However, this follow-up review confirmed that manufacturers were excluding sales to repackagers from their best price, even when the repackagers were HMOs. CMS guidance does not permit the exclusion of sales to repackagers if the \"repackager\" is not actually reselling the drug, i.e., is, instead, \"selling\" the drug to a subsidiary or affiliate - in effect keeping the drugs for its own use. As a result, the Medicaid program lost drug rebates totaling $80.7 million. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS require drug manufacturers, who excluded sales to HMOs from their best price determinations, to repay the lost rebates. CMS concurred, and intends to revisit policies on exclusion of sales from best price determinations. Pharmacy Payments from Third Parties: Millions of Medicaid beneficiaries have other pharmacy coverage through private health plans, employers, non-custodial parents, State programs such as workers' compensation, or Federal programs such as Medicare. Because Medicaid is usually considered the payer of last resort, other insurance sources may be liable for claims providers send to Medicaid. An HHS/OIG study found that States were at risk of losing 80 percent ($367 million) of the payments they tried to recover ($440 million) in 1999 through a \"pay and chase\" approach. On the other hand, States that did not make the unnecessary payments in the first place safeguarded $185 million against possible risk. Almost three-quarters of States surveyed reported that third parties refuse to process or pay Medicaid pharmacy claims. States say they have more problems with pharmacy benefit management companies than with all other types of third parties combined. The $367 million represents the universe of potentially recoverable claims. In those states where financial records were reviewed, the amount actually recoverable is somewhat less due to coverage and eligibility requirements of third party payers that are not known to States. The CMS concurred with HHS/OIG recommendations to review use of cost avoidance waivers (which authorize Medicaid to pay first and seek reimbursement from private insurers), improve claim formats, and educate third party payers. Program Exclusions There was another significant rise in the number of individuals and entities excluded from doing business with Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal and state health care programs. Exclusions in 2001 were at a record high. A total of 3,756 individuals and entities were excluded from participation in Federal programs. This is a 12.1 percent increase from 3,350 exclusions in 2000. A more detailed description of these and other accomplishments of the major Federal participants in the coordinated effort established under HIPAA follows. While information in this report is presented in the context of a single agency, most of these accomplishments reflect the combined efforts of HHS, DOJ and other partners in the anti-fraud efforts. FUNDING FOR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Certain of the funds appropriated under HIPAA are, by statute, set aside for Medicare and Medicaid activities of HHS/OIG. During the fifth year of the Program, the Act provided that between $120 and $130 million be devoted to these purposes. The Secretary and the Attorney General jointly allotted $130 million to HHS/OIG in 2000, an increase of $10.75 million over 1999. HHS/OIG conducted or participated in 840 prosecutions or settlements in 2001, of which 664, or 79 percent, were health care cases. A total of 3,756 individuals and entities were also excluded, many as a result of criminal convictions for crimes related to Medicare or Medicaid (682); or to other health care programs (66); for patient abuse or neglect (309); or as a result of licensure revocations (1,846). This all time high in exclusion actions is the result of increased outreach and collaboration with State licensing boards and MFCUs. In addition to HHS/OIG's role in bringing about the judgments and settlements described in the Overview of Accomplishments, HHS acted on HHS/OIG recommendations and disallowed $124.45 million in improperly paid health care funds in 2001. HHS/OIG continues to work with CMS to develop and implement recommendations to correct systemic vulnerabilities detected during HHS/OIG evaluations and audits. These corrective actions often result in health care funds not expended (that is, funds put to better use as a result of implemented HHS/OIG initiatives). In 2001, such funds not expended amounted to more than $16 billion \u2014 nearly $13 billion in Medicare savings, and $3.1 billion in savings to the Medicaid program. Fraud and Abuse Prevention HIPAA's increased resources have enabled HHS/OIG to broaden its efforts both to detect fraud and abuse, and to prevent it. Prevention initiatives, such as those listed below, inform and assist the health care industry and its patients. Equally important, these prevention activities reduce program losses and enforcement costs. - Industry Guidance. The centerpiece of the HIPAA guidance initiatives was an advisory opinion process through which parties would obtain binding legal guidance as to whether their existing or proposed health care business transactions ran afoul of the Federal anti-kickback statute, the civil monetary penalties laws, or the exclusion provisions. During 2001, HHS/OIG issued 21 opinions. A total of 66 advisory opinions have been issued since 1997. The advisory opinion process serves to enhance HHS/OIG's understanding of new and emerging health care business arrangements and informed the development of new safe harbor regulations, fraud alerts, and special advisory bulletins. - Corporate Integrity Agreements. Many health care providers that enter agreements with the government in settlement of potential liability for violations of the FCA also agree to adhere to a separate CIA. Under this agreement, the provider commits to establishing a program or taking other specified steps to ensure its future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid rules. The duration of most CIAs is 5 years, during which time the provider must submit periodic reports to HHS/OIG. These agreements require a substantial effort by the provider to ensure that the organization is operating in accordance with Federal health care program requirements and the parameters established by the CIA. At the close of 2001, HHS/OIG was monitoring more than 300 CIAs. - Compliance Roundtable. In July 2001, HHS/OIG and the Health Care Compliance Association cosponsored a Roundtable discussion to afford providers and other entities an opportunity to talk directly with HHS/OIG officials about compliance programs subject to CIAs. The meeting offered HHS/OIG an opportunity to describe its CIA policy objectives and receive providers' unique insights on ways to accomplish these objectives without unnecessary burden on the providers. Over 50 health care providers and 30 Government representatives took part in group discussions on topics that ranged from compliance education and training, and compliance program infrastructure, to audit requirements and reporting to HHS/OIG. Participants from both industry and government exchanged ideas about how best to work together to protect the integrity of the health care system. In a related effort to obtain feedback on implementation and maintenance of compliance programs and CIAs, HHS/OIG also distributed a survey to providers that were, at the time, operating under CIAs. The survey sought information relating both to the substance of CIA requirements (such as independent review organizations, confidential disclosure programs, claims review, and reporting) as well as the responsiveness and professionalism of HHS/OIG's oversight. The results of both the survey and the Roundtable will provide valuable information to the HHS/OIG as it reexamines and reforms the CIA process. More information on the results of the survey may be found at [http://oig.hhs.gov/]. In response to feedback received from the Provider Roundtable and the survey of providers subject to CIAs, the HHS/OIG developed a plan to modify its role in the civil settlement process. First, the HHS/OIG developed criteria for the provider community as to those situations which would not require a CIA to resolve a provider's liability under the FCA. Second, the HHS/OIG modified the claims review procedures contained in CIAs, and revised the CIA requirement with respect to the use of independent review organizations. Both changes are intended to reduce the financial impact of these requirements without weakening the integrity of a provider's compliance program. These modifications will be offered both to providers which negotiate future CIAs, as well as those with existing CIAs. - Medicare Error Rate: The HHS/OIG reported that improper payments under Medicare's fee-for-service system totaled an estimated $11.9 billion during 2000. That estimate was the lowest to date and about half of the $23.2 billion that was estimated for 1996, when HHS/OIG developed the first national error rate. The HHS/OIG developed the estimate of improper payments with the support of medical experts who together reviewed a comprehensive statistical sample of Medicare fee-for-service claims expenditures and supporting medical records to determine the accuracy and legitimacy of the claims. The HHS/OIG believes that since the first error rate of 1996, CMS has demonstrated continued vigilance in monitoring the error rate and developing corrective action plans. Clearly these corrective actions have been successful. The majority of health care providers now submit claims to Medicare for services that are medically necessary, billed correctly, and documented properly. As in past years, HHS/OIG estimated that over 90 percent of the 2000 fee-for-service payments met Medicare reimbursement requirements. The HHS/OIG's 5-year analysis indicates that over 70 percent of the claims that did not meet reimbursement requirements were attributable to unsupported and medically unnecessary costs - two areas that will receive ongoing monitoring. - Recommendations for Systemic Improvements: Frequently, investigations, audits and evaluations reveal vulnerabilities or incentives for questionable or fraudulent financial practices in agency programs or administrative processes. As required by the Inspector General Act, HHS/OIG makes recommendations to address these vulnerabilities, and thereby promote economy and efficiency in HHS programs and operations. Relying on the independent factual information generated by HHS/OIG, agency managers recommend legislative proposals or other corrective actions that, when enacted or implemented, close loopholes and reduce improper payments or conduct. The net savings from these joint efforts toward program improvements can be substantial. Many of the studies described throughout this report offered evidence and ideas supporting proposals for significant cost savings during 2001 and beyond. Prominent examples of these reviews include the following: - Upper Payment Limit (UPL). States are allowed to pay Medicaid facilities above their cost for a service or procedure, as long as the State's aggregate payment does not exceed the amount that would have been paid under Medicare (referred to as the upper limit). In a series of audits, HHS/OIG has found that some States use intergovernmental transfers as a financing mechanism to maximize Federal Medicaid reimbursement available through UPLs, and effectively avoid contributing the state share of Medicaid spending. Over the past year, CMS has published three final regulations to curb states' use of this loophole. The CMS estimates that the new rules will save $77 billion in Federal Medicaid funds over the next 10 years. - Therapy. The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 suspended Medicare reimbursement caps on Part B physical, occupational, and speech therapy that were imposed in 1997. The monetary caps on services coincided with a dramatic decrease in Part B therapy charges during 1999. Preliminary reports indicate that there was a rebound in Skilled Nursing Facility therapy charges in 2000 and 2001. An HHS/OIG study indicated that this rebound is attributable both to the moratorium on caps and perceived inadequate contractor oversight of billing practices and medical necessity of Part B therapy. In response, CMS will take steps to ensure that adequate medical reviews of Part B therapy are conducted and to improve providers' understanding of guidelines for Part B therapy and billings. - UPIN. An evaluation of Unique Physician Identification Numbers (UPINs) revealed a fundamental vulnerability in Medicare's claims payment process \u2014 one that can easily be corrected. The report found that in one year, Medicare paid over $90 million for medical equipment and supply claims with invalid or inactive UPINs. Moreover, a small number of suppliers accounted for a significant share of these charges. The HHS/OIG recommended that CMS revise claims processing to ensure that claims contain UPINs that are valid and active. As HIPAA requires CMS to establish unique identifiers for all health care providers, this report recommended that CMS take steps to validate and update UPIN Registry data prior to implementation of the new provider identifier system - Payments for Mental Health Services: A study of Medicare payments for mental health services revealed that 39 percent of psychiatric services in nursing homes were medically unnecessary, had no mental health documentation or were questionable. An area of particular vulnerability was psychological testing; nearly one-third of the tests were too frequent, medically unnecessary, or utilized questionable testing instruments. CMS has agreed to develop guidelines in these areas, which will both protect the quality of mental health services and could result in a potential savings of $30 million a year. In a separate study, HHS/OIG found that Medicare allowed $185 million in 1998 for outpatient mental health services that were medically unnecessary, billed incorrectly, rendered by unqualified providers, and undocumented or poorly documented. CMS has agreed to take steps to identify problematic mental health services for prepayment edits or post-payment medical review, promote awareness of documentation and medical necessity requirements, further refine guidance on a particular testing code, and require carriers to initiate recovery of payments for the inappropriate outpatient mental health services identified in the report. - Duplicate Payments. An HHS/OIG evaluation of 15 procedure codes found that Medicare's claims processing system permitted duplicate payments by more than one carrier. Total improper payments for the sample services were approximately $446,000. HHS/OIG recommended that CMS either revise Common Working Files edits to detect and deny duplicate billings, or, if more cost effective, increase post-payment reviews. A related study disclosed 3,152 services involving potential duplicate payments made by the same carrier, resulting in estimated questionable allowances of approximately $2.25 million. Other potential duplicate payments were found involving over 2,000 other procedure codes. CMS has agreed to investigate its claims processing systems to determine why potential duplicate services were not detected and to recover improper payments. Focus on Quality of Care HHS/OIG investigations, audits and evaluations focus not just on improper billing for health care services, but also the quality of care provided to program beneficiaries. Activities designed to promote or safeguard beneficiary care included: Enforcement Actions: - A physician convicted twice in Florida was excluded from Medicare and other health care programs for 25 years for practicing medicine without a license, and later for executing a scheme for obtaining fraudulent medical school documents which he used to secure a license. He then represented himself to be a qualified and validly licensed physician and billed health care programs through the mail for services he provided to patients. The court ordered him jailed for 39 months and to pay almost $5 million in restitution. - The owner of an Illinois business providing counseling services was sentenced to more than three years incarceration and required to pay $6.7 million in restitution for submitting false claims for group psychotherapy sessions that either never occurred or were conducted by unlicensed personnel. To bill for these sessions, the owner used the Medicare provider numbers of licensed clinical social workers, physicians and other mental health professionals without their knowledge. - An Indiana woman was convicted of mail fraud for having forged two occupational therapy licenses for her own use after taking copies of actual licenses from a local hospital. For over two years, the woman, who had no medical training, worked in an Indiana nursing home treating disabled Medicare beneficiaries. The costs of her salary and the services she provided were ultimately billed through the nursing home's cost report and paid by the Medicare program. This criminal case resulted from the HHS/OIG Self-Disclosure Program. - The owner of a now defunct Durable Medical Equipment (DME) company was convicted for paying $85,000 in kickbacks to induce a physician to order wound care supplies billed to Medicare. The individual also violated misbranding rules of the FDA through his ownership of a company that manufactured hydrogel wound care dressings which were labeled and packaged as \"sterile\" but were not actually tested for sterility. In an earlier civil settlement, the former owner agreed to pay the Government $255,000 and accepted a 15-year exclusion from Federal health care programs. Patient Anti-Dumping Enforcement. HHS continues to pursue potential violations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also called the patient anti-dumping statute. In 2001, HHS/OIG obtained 21 settlement agreements and judgments with hospitals and physicians and collected civil monetary penalties of nearly $437,750. This reflects the continued commitment of both CMS and HHS/OIG to ensure patient access to appropriate emergency medical services. Other Judgments and Settlements. In addition to the significant enforcement actions described in the Program Accomplishments section of this report, the HHS/OIG conducted or participated in over 664 investigations that resulted in prosecution or settlement during 2001, involving all aspects of the health care industry. These include: - Prescription Drug Fraud. The HHS/OIG worked with the DOJ Drug Enforcement Administration and State and local authorities to investigate fraudulent diversion and \"street\" sale of prescription drugs such as OxyContin. These schemes often involve patients, beneficiaries, pharmacists, physicians and others who obtain prescription drugs, reimbursed by Medicaid, under false pretenses for personal use or for resale. One such investigation in Maine has already resulted in 19 guilty pleas for health care fraud and related offenses. In another matter, the chief of the radiology department at a Virginia hospital was sentenced for acquiring a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception and subterfuge. From June 1998 through January 1999, the radiologist accessed the hospital's pharmaceutical cabinet and diverted morphine and fentanyl for his own use over 175 times. To conceal this diversion, he created charge tickets indicating that the drugs were for patients undergoing invasive procedures. Because many of the patients were Medicare beneficiaries, the program was inappropriately billed for pharmaceuticals taken under false pretenses. A third physician was sentenced to more than 10 years for conspiracy to dispense and distribute controlled substances and for Medicare fraud and kickbacks, and was ordered to pay $229,384 in restitution. The indictment alleged that the physician routinely wrote large quantities of prescriptions for highly addictive pain medication, billed Medicare for services not provided and upcoded office visits. A pharmacy owner was convicted in the same scheme, and sentenced to serve 16 years imprisonment and fined $56,400 for drug-related offenses. Through his pharmacy, the individual dispensed in excess of one million doses of highly addictive pain medication based upon prescriptions written by the physician. Furthermore, the individual knowingly filled hundreds of invalid prescriptions that the physician had prewritten and which contained false information. - Kickbacks and Patient Brokering. In 2001, ten individuals including four who were principal owners of the largest illegal patient brokering network in the United States were sentenced in Florida. From 1989 through 1997, the company engaged in the business of supplying patient referrals to inpatient psychiatric hospitals for up to $6,000 per patient. The company acquired patient referrals, including Medicare beneficiaries, by paying kickbacks to referral sources. To disguise the patient referral fees as legitimate services, the company created false contracts and agreements with the hospitals. The investigation is ongoing. In a separate matter, a total of 31 defendants were indicted in a Medicare fraud and kickback scheme investigated by a joint health care fraud task force in Florida. Owners of a DME company and clinic and their associates allegedly recruited Medicare beneficiaries involved and used their Medicare numbers to bill the program for equipment not provided. The beneficiaries also signed fraudulent delivery receipts for the equipment in return for kickbacks in cash, checks or food. To date, 10 of the 31 individuals charged in connection with this investigation have pled guilty. Office of the General Counsel In 2001, the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) was allocated $3.8 million in funding from HCFAC. These funds were used primarily for litigation activity, both administrative and judicial. AccomplishmentsInitiatives for Preventing Health Care Fraud - Stark regulation - Continuing its work with CMS and HHS/OIG to clarify the prohibitions against self-referrals by physicians to protect beneficiaries and taxpayers from potentially abusive referral patterns, OGC finalized Phase I of the final rule and is working with HHS/OIG and CMS to complete Phase II of the final rule. Phase II gives physicians clear direction about how to structure financial arrangements if they are ordering certain services from a hospital or other entity with which they have a financial relationship. - Community Mental Health Center Initiative - During 2001, OGC provided comprehensive legal assistance to CMS, Region VI, with respect to the planning and unprecedented implementation of a large scale suspension of payments project. Fraudulent physical therapy claims in the Houston, Texas area were being filed for services that were either medically unnecessary or for services that were not actually being provided. OGC provided legal clearance for the coordinated suspension of payments to more than 60 physical therapy clinics in August 2001. To date, none of these suspensions have resulted in any court challenge. Policy Guidance and Education - OGC improved the effectiveness of the Nursing Home Oversight and Improvement Program enforcement effort by (1) recommending legislation and submitting comments on draft legislation (ultimately included in the Department's legislative package) to bar Federal court jurisdiction over attempts by Medicaid-only facilities to enjoin HHS enforcement actions; (2) submitting comments and suggested revisions on proposed changes in State Operations Manual; (3) commenting on and suggesting revisions to CMS's model enforcement notice letters; (4) proposing changes to Part 498 of the regulations governing appeals; (5) making presentations to CMS surveyors and enforcement staff, state surveyors and state survey agency attorneys on survey and enforcement issues; and (6) preparing a 160-page digest of all administrative decisions in nursing home enforcement cases, which is now used by CMS and OGC offices nationwide. - OGC is building on successful partnerships previously established in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, by initiating \"Medicare Secondary Payer partnership\" discussions with the U.S. Attorney's Offices for the Northern and Southern Districts of Indiana with the Medicare contractors for Indiana. In 2001, OGC secured an agreement in principle and is now working out the details of the partnership arrangements and procedures designed to enhance recovery of conditional Medicare payments in tort cases involving Medicare beneficiaries in the State of Indiana. Civil and Criminal Enforcement Actions - Qui Tam Covenant Care settlement - In May 2001, the United States resolved allegations of fraud with Covenant Care for $1.6 million. Covenant Care allegedly submitted false claims to Medicare for its nursing homes by improperly allocating hours to the Medicare certified distinct parts of its nursing facilities for nursing services that were actually provided in the non-certified parts of the facilities. OGC's CMS division worked closely with DOJ to calculate the amount of damages and recovered an additional $450,000 for overpayments made to Covenant Care that fell outside the scope of the fraud investigation. This cooperative effort resulted in a significant return to the Medicare trust fund. - OGC asserted CMS's interests in numerous bankruptcy and receivership actions throughout the country by negotiating agreements to recover overpayments and advancing the use of offset recovery. For example, in Vencor, the court affirmed the plan of reorganization under which the United States will receive $104.5 million under the FCA on behalf of the Medicare Trust Fund, which includes $20.8 million for false claims involving substandard quality of care. Medicare will receive another $92.5 million for other overpayments. Administration on Aging In 2001, the Administration on Aging (AoA) was allocated $1.5 million in HCFAC funds to develop and disseminate consumer education information to older Americans, with a particular focus on persons with low health literacy, individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds, persons living in rural areas, and other vulnerable populations. AoA and its nationwide network of agencies supported community education activities designed to assist older Americans and their families to recognize and report potential errors or fraudulent situations. Accomplishments - National Technical Assistance Resource Centers: AoA established and supported four national resource centers to provide materials and technical assistance to aging service professionals for the purpose of educating and empowering vulnerable and culturally diverse older Americans to take a more active role in monitoring and protecting the benefit integrity of Medicare and Medicaid. - National Videoconference on \"Innovative Strategies for Reaching Underserved and Unserved Populations.\" AoA and its four resource centers convened a national video conference that was linked via satellite to more than 130 community locations in 41 states. The video conference informed thousands of professionals and others who provide services to older Americans about successful strategies for educating minority, rural, and non-English-speaking beneficiaries about Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. The program continues to be distributed via videotapes, and is available on-line through the resource centers' website. - Regional Partnership and Collaboration Conferences. AoA convened four regional conferences which brought together hundreds of Federal, state, and community partners to share successful products and practices, strengthen collaboration between Federal, state, and local partners, and to work to advance the performance of outcome tracking mechanisms. - Development of New Website. AoA launched a new website dedicated to information about Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. The purpose of the site is to promote consumer awareness and facilitate the sharing of information and best practices between the agency's partners and grantees, as well as among aging network professionals. - Distribution of Community Education Materials. HCFAC funding supported the distribution of health care journals in nearly every state in the country, as well as community education brochures in English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Community education videos in English, Spanish, and Chinese that were developed with HCFAC funding during 2000 were distributed throughout 2001 via AoA's grantees and through the network of state and area agencies on aging. - Senior Medicare Patrol Projects: AoA provided technical assistance to AoA's 52 Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP) projects, located in 47 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The projects recruit and train retired individuals to educate other seniors in their communities about how they can help prevent and detect potential Medicare and Medicaid error, fraud, and abuse. The SMP projects trained more than 10,000 senior volunteers, in 2001, who directly educated more than 300,000 beneficiaries. - Other Community Education Activities: An estimated 40 million individuals were also reached through a variety of television, radio, and print media events. While it is not possible to directly track the cases reported and dollars recovered through these community education activities, the projects reported nearly $60 million in Medicare, Medicaid, and other dollars recouped through the complaints they referred, and through their partnership activities. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services In January 2001, $2.5 million in HCFAC funds was allocated to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to assist states in developing Medicaid payment accuracy measurements (PAM) methodologies and to conduct pilot studies to measure and reduce state Medicaid payment errors. CMS is also committed to exploring the feasibility of estimating the range of improper Medicaid payments on a national level. The focus of both the state-specific and national efforts is on payment, not eligibility errors (which are governed exclusively by section 1903(u) of the Social Security Act). The funding was approved for three purposes: (1) to contract for outside technical expertise to assess state, Medicare and other PAM experience to date and develop a national Medicaid methodology; (2) to provide incentive grants to two or three states to conduct PAM studies and assess the feasibility of establishing a standard methodology that might be used by all states; and (3) to hire four analysts in CMS to direct and staff this initiative. CMS proposed to work closely with HHS/OIG, and with the National Association of State Medicaid Directors and its Fraud & Abuse Technical Advisory Group (TAG). In July 2001, CMS' Center for Medicaid and State Operations invited all state Medicaid and Program Integrity directors to apply for participation in the PAM demonstration project, which is a federally funded, collaborative effort to develop model PAM methodologies for use on a state-specific and national basis. State proposals were solicited under the authority of section 402(a)(1)(J) of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1967. The duration of the project will cover a minimum of two years, with funding approved initially for the first year only. Accomplishments - Nine states applied to participate in the PAM pilot: Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. Five of these states are represented on the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Control TAG. On September 26, 2001, CMS approved all nine applications, with an estimated cost to HCFAC of $1.8 million. - 2002 Plans: the nine states will test various approaches to Medicaid PAM. Most will focus on fee-for-service payments, although Minnesota will address the validation of encounter data, a key element of PAM in the managed care context. In 2002 CMS will solicit participation of up to 15 states in Year Two of the pilot, including potential funding of the initial 9 states. As part of its 2002 efforts, CMS will evaluate the progress of the initial pilots and may continue funding the initial nine states' efforts. - In September 2001, CMS contracted with The Lewin Group for technical assistance to CMS and the pilot states, at an estimated cost of $.7M for Year One of the pilot. The Lewin Group's experience includes extensive work with CMS in developing Medicare error rate measurement methodologies, as well as relevant studies for a number of states. Lewin will work closely with the Medicaid pilot states, CMS and HHS/OIG to help develop promising PAM methodologies. Lewin will review the literature in this area to glean useful guidance, analyze appropriate statistical approaches, explore how to apply PAM to managed care, and propose standards for reviewing medical records. Assistant Secretary for Budget, Technology and Finance At the end of 2001, $500,000 of HCFAC funds were allocated to the Assistant Secretary for Budget, Technology and Finance (ASBTF) to fund certain contractual consultant services related to the Departments's new financial management system. The services entail providing oversight and independent verification and validation of the development of the new system. The contract was awarded in September 2001. The funding covers the requisite consulting services over the four-month period, ending in January 2002. The CMS Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System will be a major component of the new HHS integrated financial management system. This system will include Indian Health Service (IHS) financial and health care-related information. The new system will increase HHS managers' accountability, address various material weaknesses at the CMS, strengthen internal controls at IHS, and help prevent waste and abuse in HHS health care programs. ASBTF is using a consulting company to help ensure that the new integrated financial management system is being developed to meet the Department's financial management goals. Specifically, this HCFAC project is to ensure that the new system will preserve the integrity of the Department's financial information and resulting financial statements and management reports, including Medicare contractor information, CMS financial information, and IHS' unique financial reporting needs that are related to health care payment and delivery system. Overall, HHS will ensure the new system's compliance with statutory requirements of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 and other pertinent laws. FUNDING FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE United States Attorneys Health care fraud involves a variety of schemes that defraud public and private insurers and providers nationwide. In addition to Medicare and Medicaid, a number of federally funded health benefit programs have been the targets of these schemes. The fraudulent activity may include double-billing schemes, kickbacks, billing for unnecessary or unperformed tests, or may be related to the quality of care provided to patients. In addition to monetary losses, in some instances these improper activities endanger patient safety. United States Attorneys' offices (USAOs) are responsible for civilly and criminally prosecuting health care professionals, providers, and other specialized business entities who engage in health care fraud and abuse. USAOs continue to strengthen and refine cooperative efforts with Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies involved in the prevention, evaluation, detection, and investigation of health care fraud and abuse. In addition to the FBI, HHS/OIG and CMS, USAOs offices work with State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, Offices of Inspectors General for a number of Federal agencies, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FDA, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the TRICARE Support Office. Each USAO has appointed both a civil and criminal health care fraud coordinator to assist in coordination and to facilitate communication between Federal, state and local law enforcement groups. In addition, many cases are investigated in a parallel fashion, so that potential criminal and civil remedies are addressed more efficiently, by the attorneys and the agencies investigating the wrongdoing. The criminal and civil judgments and settlements discussed in the program accomplishments above were among the many significant accomplishments of the USAOs and are examples of such parallel investigations and prosecutions. Prior to the enactment of HIPAA, USAOs dedicated substantial resources to combating health care fraud and abuse. HIPAA allocations have supplemented these efforts. Training The Executive Office for the United States Attorneys' Office of Legal Education (OLE) is tasked with the responsibility for providing health care fraud training for USAO and DOJ attorneys, investigators, and auditors. During 2001, OLE conducted a number of courses and presentations on health care fraud, including: - Basic Health Care Fraud Seminar - Criminal and Civil - Advanced Health Care Fraud Seminar - Criminal and Civil - Affirmative Civil Enforcement - Special Topics (includes a health care fraud component) - Affirmative Civil Enforcement for auditors and investigators (includes a health care fraud component) While the primary participants in OLE sponsored courses were DOJ employees, agency counsel and investigative personnel were also invited to participate as presenters and students. In addition to OLE sponsored training, a number of USAO attorneys, auditors and investigators participated in multi-agency health care fraud training courses over the last year. Accomplishments - Criminal Prosecutions The primary objective of criminal prosecution efforts is to ensure the integrity of our nation's health care programs and to punish and deter those who, through their improper activities, adversely affect the health care system and the taxpayers. Each time a criminal case is referred to a USAO from the FBI, HHS/OIG, or another law enforcement agency, it is opened as a matter pending in the district. A referral remains a matter until an indictment or information is filed or the case is declined for prosecution. In 2001, the USAOs had 1,791 criminal matters pending involving 2,733 defendants, a 7 percent decrease in the number of criminal matters over 2000. During 2001, 445 cases were filed involving 601 defendants. This represents a 2 percent increase over cases filed in 2001. A total of 465 defendants were convicted for health care fraud-related crimes in 2001. Health care fraud convictions include both guilty pleas and guilty verdicts. A sample of the criminal cases brought by USAOs, in addition to those set forth in the overview section, is set forth below. In Florida, a physician was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for conspiracy to submit false claims to Medicare and to prepare false health benefit claim forms, conspiracy to violate the Medicare kickback statute, and for conspiracy to distribute prescription narcotics. The physician was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $350,000 and was ordered to forfeit an additional $250,000. The physician, who purportedly ran a pain management clinic, in fact ran a prescription drug \"pill mill\" which provided drug addicts with large quantities of prescription pain killers. The physician submitted claims to the Medicare, Medicaid and private health benefit programs claiming to have provided non-rendered medical treatment to the addicts. In the same case, the physician's in-house pharmacist was convicted of conspiracy to distribute prescription narcotics and was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment. In Indiana, a podiatrist was sentenced to 68 months in prison following his guilty pleas to six counts of mail fraud for fraudulently billing the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs for a number of complex services that were medically unnecessary. In addition to being sentenced to prison, the podiatrist was ordered to make restitution in the amount of $2.76 million: $2.4 million to the Indiana Medicaid Program; $504,000 to Medicare; and $16,000 to TRICARE. In Florida, the owner of a medical personnel staffing and home health management company was sentenced to 37 months in prison and ordered to pay $923,100 restitution for defrauding TRICARE and Medicare. The investigation disclosed that between 1992 and 1996, the company fraudulently received reimbursements from TRICARE and Medicare for costs allegedly incurred for overhead expenses and direct patient care which were falsely reported as furniture costs, salary costs, Christmas bonuses, and \"royalty fees.\" The company owner, with the assistance of his son, also paid kickbacks to three doctors for referrals to the home health company. In Virginia, the president of a medical transport company was sentenced to 37 months after pleading guilty to one count of health care fraud for fraudulently billing the Medicaid Program for approximately $1.4 million. In addition to the prison term, the president was required to pay $1.4 million in restitution, and to forfeit an additional $375,000. The scheme involved the submission of thousands of claims fraudulently seeking payment for the transportation of ambulatory patients who were falsely billed to Medicaid as being wheelchair-bound patients, and the submission of billings for services not rendered and for transportation to destinations not covered by Medicaid. In New York, a physician pleaded guilty to one count of health care fraud for fraudulently billing Medicare and private health insurance companies for over $10 million billed in a scheme through which the physician billed for \"nerve block\" injections when in fact he only performed considerably less expensive acupuncture treatments. As a result of the false billings, the physician received $800,000 from Medicare and an additional $600,000 from ten private insurance companies. Pursuant to the plea agreement, the physician has agreed to forfeit $820,000 to the government, repay the private insurance companies $529,000 in restitution, and pay $500,000 to settle a related civil FCA case. Accomplishments - Civil Cases Civil health care fraud efforts constitute a major focus of Affirmative Civil Enforcement (ACE) activities. The ACE Program helps ensure that Federal laws are obeyed and that violators provide compensation to the government for losses and damages they cause. Civil health care fraud matters ordinarily involve the United States utilizing the FCA, as well as common law fraud remedies, payment by mistake, unjust enrichment and conversion to recover damages from those who have submitted false or improper claims to the United States. Each time a civil referral is made to a USAO it is opened as a matter pending in the district. Civil health care fraud matters are referred directly from Federal or state investigative agencies, or result from filings by private persons known as \"relators,\" who file suits on behalf of the Federal Government under the 1986 qui tam amendments to the FCA. Relators may be entitled to share in the recoveries resulting from these lawsuits. At the end of 2001, the USAOs had 1,746 civil health care fraud matters pending. A matter becomes a case when the United States files a civil complaint, or intervenes in a qui tam action, in United States District Court. The vast majority of civil health care fraud cases and matters are settled without a complaint ever being filed. In 2001, 188 civil health care fraud cases were filed. A sample of the civil cases brought by USAOs, in addition to those in described in the overview section, are set forth below. Seven hospitals located throughout the country agreed to pay the United States almost $5.5 million to settle claims that they unlawfully charged the Medicare and TRICARE programs for surgical procedures using experimental cardiac devices. The devices had not been approved for marketing by the FDA at the time the procedures were performed between 1987 and 1994. The settlement involved hospitals in Florida, California and Arizona. The government had previously entered into settlements with other hospitals engaged in similar conduct and these other settlements resulted in payments of almost $13 million. The settlement stems from a qui tam filed by a former medical device salesman. In Maryland, a nursing home agreed to forego approximately $436,000 in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to resolve allegations that the facility provided substandard nursing home care between November 1998 and December 1999. In addition to the monetary settlement, the nursing home entered into a comprehensive CIA with the government. A managed care organization in Illinois agreed to pay $2.9 million to settle civil allegations that it defrauded Medicare by obtaining excessive capitated payments for beneficiaries who were institutionalized. Based upon an audit by HHS/OIG, it was determined that the managed care organization incorrectly categorized some of its beneficiaries living in several counties in Illinois as being institutionalized between October 1, 1995 and September 30, 1997. As a result, the managed care organization received enhanced capitated payments from Medicare to which it was not entitled. A 1998 HHS/OIG audit of a sample of the managed care organization's claims for institutionalized beneficiaries revealed that 29 percent were incorrectly categorized as institutionalized. In addition to the settlement, the managed care organization also entered into a CIA with the HHS/OIG. In California, two medical practice groups agreed to pay $10.25 million to settle allegations that they knowingly defrauded Medicare, TRICARE and Medi-Cal from 1992 to 1999 by submitting numerous false claims to inflate reimbursement payments from Medicare, TRICARE and Medi-Cal. The false billings alleged included: (1) billing for nonreimbursable annual physical exams; (2) billing for routine doctor \"referrals\" as more highly reimbursable \"consultations;\" (3) exaggerating the complexity of \"evaluation and management\" office visits to obtain greater reimbursement; and (4) billing for undocumented lab work and other ancillary services. Civil Division Civil Division attorneys vigorously pursue civil remedies in health care fraud matters, working closely with the USAOs, the FBI, the Inspectors General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense, CMS, and other Federal and state law enforcement agencies. Cases involve providers of health care services, supplies and equipment, as well as carriers and fiscal intermediaries, that defraud Medicare, Medicaid, the TRICARE program of the Department of Defense, the FEHBP, and other government health care programs. Accomplishments In 2001, the Division opened or filed a total of 92 health care fraud cases or matters. In addition to these new efforts, the Civil Division pursued over 425 existing cases. A significant number of these health care fraud cases have the potential for particularly high damages. Civil Division attorneys were actively involved in the recoveries described in the overview - HCA, Vencor, Quorum, LifeScan, NHC, and Bayer. The following examples demonstrate the breadth and significance of other cases in which the Division was involved during 2001. The University of California agreed to pay the Government $22.5 million to settle allegations that the school's five teaching hospitals routinely submitted false billings to Medicare, Medicaid and other Federally-funded health programs. The alleged false claims included upcoding, as well as billing for services purportedly performed or supervised by faculty physicians - when those services were, in fact, performed by residents with little or no supervision. In another recovery in the ongoing \"Operation LABSCAM\" investigation, Quest Diagnostics agreed to pay more than $13 million on behalf of Nichols Institute. Beginning in 1989 and ending shortly after its acquisition by Quest in 1994, Nichols routinely billed Federal health programs for laboratory test that were medically unnecessary. Collectively, the Government has recovered over $850 million from the nation's clinical laboratories as a result of LABSCAM and related investigations. The civil complaints in four qui tam suits against a lab which specializes in bladder and prostate cancer testing were settled by a $9.1 million payment to the Government. The allegations against Urocor included upcoding, unnecessary testing, and paying kickbacks to referring physicians. Urocor will enter into a five-year CIA. Following a bench trial, the Government was awarded treble damages and penalties totaling $7.7 million for Medicare fraud committed by Century Health Services, a chain of ten home health care agencies. Medicare permits reimbursement for staff benefits, including corporate contributions to employee stock ownership plans. However, the defendants used the stock plan reimbursements for their personal benefit, leaving the plan barren. The award is under appeal. In addition to these case-specific accomplishments, the Department's Nursing Home Initiative, coordinated by the Civil Division, promotes, among other things, increased prosecution and coordination at Federal, state and local levels to fight the abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation of the nation's senior and infirm population. The Department is pursuing a growing number of cases under the FCA involving providers' egregious \"failures of care.\" The financial crisis in the nursing home industry has to date resulted in bankruptcy filings by five of the seven largest nursing home chains and several smaller chains. These bankruptcy cases are the largest ever involving health care providers, and raise the specter of failure of care, as well as financial issues. The significance of these cases require considerable and ongoing coordination among the Civil Division's Corporate Finance and Civil Fraud sections, the Criminal Division, CMS, and HHS/OIG. Also, the Civil Division co-chairs with the Criminal Division the National level Health Care Fraud Working Group, which meets quarterly and coordinates the health care fraud enforcement activities of all concerned Federal and state agencies. Vital resources were made available from the Account to provide the Civil Division with Automated Litigation Support, auditors, and consultants. These resources supplemented other Civil Division funds. During 2001, the majority of these monies were used to support two cases - HCA (Columbia) and the Department's tobacco litigation. Criminal Division The Fraud Section of the Criminal Division develops and implements white collar crime policy and provides support to the Federal white collar enforcement community. The Fraud Section supports the USAOs with legal and investigative guidance and, in certain instances, provides trial attorneys to prosecute criminal fraud cases. For several years, a major focus of Fraud Section personnel and resources has been to investigate and prosecute fraud involving Federal health care programs. The Fraud Section has provided guidance to FBI agents, Assistant United States Attorneys and Criminal Division attorneys on criminal, civil and administrative tools to combat health care fraud, and worked on an interagency level through: - providing frequent advice and written materials on confidentiality and disclosure issues arising in the course of investigations and legal proceedings regarding medical records. - monitoring and coordinating Departmental responses to major regulatory initiatives, legislative proposals, and enforcement policy matters. Examples include issues such as provider education and regulation, medical records privacy, Internet sales of drugs and medical products and expansion of the Medicare program to provide prescription drug benefits. - reviewing and commenting on numerous requests for advisory opinions submitted by health care providers to the HHS/OIG and consulting with the HHS/OIG on draft advisory opinions per the requirements of HIPAA. - working with CMS officials to promote more effective use of technologies and high-tech approaches for combating health care fraud and abuse. DOJ and CMS prepared a report with recommendations for future follow-up action based on a national conference held for representatives from Federal, state and local health care programs and law enforcement agencies to exchange information on electronic tools, analytical techniques, and collaborative approaches for detecting and preventing health care fraud and abuse. - preparing and distributing to all USAOs and FBI field offices periodic updates on major issues, interagency initiatives, and significant activities of DOJ's health care fraud component organizations as well as periodic summaries of recent cases. - organizing and overseeing, in conjunction with the Civil Division, the National level Health Care Fraud Working Group to address fraud in health care and managed care. - participating on interagency working groups formed to address illicit Internet sales of drugs and medical products and nursing home fraud and resident abuse. The Fraud Section has responsibility for handling complex health care fraud litigation nationwide and examples of successful prosecutions in FY 2001 include: - HCMF Corporation, a privately owned nursing home chain in Virginia, which was entitled under the Medicare and Medicaid programs to claim reimbursement for the administration costs associated with its operation of eighteen nursing homes throughout Virginia, pleaded guilty to improperly claiming reimbursement for salaries and benefits paid to more than thirty HCMF owners, family members and employees who performed little or no function for the nursing homes or whose duties were largely unrelated to operating the homes. HCMF also submitted false and misleading documentation to Medicare and Medicaid auditors in order to justify these claims. As part of its plea agreement, HCMF agreed to pay restitution to these programs in the amount of $1.7 million, and the Chairman of HCMF's Board of Directors was held jointly and severally liable for the restitution amount. Both the Chairman, and the Treasurer of HCMF pleaded guilty to making false statements in connection with a Federal health care program, and for concealing information from Medicare and Medicaid so that HCMF could continue receiving reimbursement. In addition to any criminal sentences imposed, these two officers, by virtue of their guilty pleas, will be excluded from the health care benefit programs for at least five years. Civil Rights Division The Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division vigorously pursues relief affecting public, residential health care facilities and has established an Institutional Health Care Abuse and Neglect Initiative to carry out the Department's initiative to eliminate abuse and grossly substandard care in Medicare and Medicaid funded nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. The Section plays a critical role in the HCFAC Program. As the sole component responsible for the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997 (CRIPA) authorizes investigation of conditions of confinement at state and local residential institutions (including facilities for persons with developmental disabilities or mental illness, and nursing homes) and initiation of civil action for injunctive relief to remedy a pattern or practice of violations of the constitution or Federal statutory rights. The review of conditions in facilities for the mentally ill and for persons with developmental disabilities, and nursing homes comprises a significant portion of the program. The Special Litigation Section works collaboratively with the USAOs around the country and with HHS. Accomplishments As part of the Department's Institutional Health Care Abuse and Neglect Initiative, and as an enhancement to the Department's ongoing CRIPA enforcement efforts, the Special Litigation Section staff began preliminary inquiries into conditions and services at 29 nursing home facilities in 15 states. Our task in preliminary inquiries is to determine whether there is sufficient information supporting allegations of unlawful conditions to warrant formal investigation under CRIPA. Conditions uncovered at one nursing home will be the subject of a full CRIPA investigation. Inquiries regarding the remaining 28 facilities are continuing. In addition, Section staff are conducting preliminary inquiries of two public facilities for persons with mental illnesses. The Special Litigation Section staff participated in ongoing nursing home investigations, including the investigation of Laguna Honda Hospital in San Francisco, California, one of the largest public nursing home facilities in the United States. This work involved on site evaluation tours with expert consultants, review of documentary evidence and interviews of staff. Further tours of Laguna Honda are scheduled for the next fiscal year. Staff attorneys also presented oral argument as amicus curiae in a private lawsuit brought concerning Laguna Honda, Davis v. California Health and Human Services Agency (N.D. Cal.), regarding the proper interpretation of the integration regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131. Subsequently, the court ruled that the integration mandates of Title II of the ADA might oblige defendants to expand community services for Laguna Honda residents and to place them in the community as appropriate to their needs. In addition, the staff conducted four CRIPA investigations of residential facilities for persons with developmental disabilities: Oakwood Developmental Center in Kentucky; Woodward and Glenwood Centers in Iowa; and Holly Center in Maryland. In both the Kentucky and Iowa investigations, Special Litigation Section staff conducted tours of facilities, accompanied by expert consultants, reviewed documents, and interviewed facility staff. The Special Litigation Section staff are preparing detailed letters which will inform the responsible officials not only of the specific findings made during the investigation, but also of the minimum remedies required to address identified deficiencies. In the Holly Center investigation, negotiations toward settlement are continuing regarding the correction of some remaining deficient conditions. In all of these matters, section staff review situations which may entail alleged abuse and neglect. The Section staff also conducted compliance reviews in four cases: United States v. Tennessee (M.D. Tenn.) involving Clover Bottom Developmental Center; Harold Jordan Center and Greene Valley Developmental Center; United States v. Tennessee ( D. Tenn.) involving the Memphis Mental Health Institute; United States v. New Mexico (D. N. Mex.) regarding the New Mexico School for the Visually Handicapped; and Evans and United States v. Williams (D. D.C.) involving dozens of community placements and services for persons with developmental disabilities in the District of Columbia. In each of these cases, staff reviewed compliance with the terms of previously filed agreements and court orders. In addition to compliance activities in Evans, staff were active in negotiating a new consent order and settlement agreement which established the Quality Trust for Individuals with Disabilities, a nonprofit organization independent of the parties that will provide advocacy and legal services to consumers within the District of Columbia's developmental disabilities system. The District agreed to pay an initial sum of $11 million into a trust, and to fund the Quality Trust at a rate of $2 million per year for the first 10 years to allow the trust to grow. The result will be a permanent, independent advocacy organization. In addition to its law enforcement activities, the Special Litigation Section is responsible for representing the Civil Rights Division in the Department's health care fraud activities. The Section participates, for example, as a Department and Civil Rights representative on an inter-agency Nursing Home Steering Committee. The Section has also participated in public education and outreach by speaking and participating at both national and regional conferences on quality of care in health care facilities. The Justice Management Division, Debt Collection Management Staff continues to perform for the program various administrative and coordination duties. The duties of this office include: budget formulation, oversight and coordinating with the Office of Management and Budget and CMS; coordinating with HHS/OIG and the Department of the Treasury on the tracking of collections; coordinating with the GAO on required audits; and preparation and coordination of the annual report. In addition, $629,000 for the Nursing Home Initiative was administered by this office. APPENDIX Federal Bureau of Investigation Mandatory Funding \"There are hereby appropriated from the general fund of the United States Treasury and hereby appropriated to the Account for transfer to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to carry out the purpose described in subparagraph (C), to be available without further appropriation - (I) for fiscal year 2001, $88,000,000.\" The health care industry is an attractive target to fraudulent activity which, if not aggressively pursued, can have a significant detrimental effect on the financial stability of the U.S. health care system. As such, successful health care fraud enforcement cannot be achieved by one agency alone. Investigations must be a cooperative effort if they are to be successful in combating the increasing problems of health care fraud. The FBI is actively involved in this cooperative effort.The FBI works many health care fraud cases on a joint basis with other Federal agencies, including the HHS/OIG. These two Federal agencies collaborate through attendance at health care fraud working groups, attend each others training conferences, and have a liaison program between the two organizations. In addition, most health care fraud task forces formed by FBI field divisions represent the coordinated efforts between the FBI, state and local law enforcement, Federal investigative agencies such as HHS/OIG, and private industry. The FBI and HHS/OIG continue to share a common commitment to ending fragmented health care fraud enforcement efforts and encouraging the coordination of investigative resources. Under HIPAA, the FBI was provided $88 million in 2001 for health care fraud enforcement. This money was used to support 776 positions (445 agents) funded in prior years and an additional 48 positions (30 agent) in 2001. Currently, the FBI has 14 dedicated health care fraud squads across the country. As the FBI has increased the number of agents assigned to health care fraud investigations, the number of pending investigations has increased over 400 percent rising from 591 cases in 1992 to 2,870 cases through 2001. The FBI is the only Federal investigative agency to have jurisdiction over both government sponsored health care programs and privately funded health care programs. Criminal health care fraud convictions resulting from FBI investigations has risen from 116 in 1992, to 650 through 2001. Health care fraud investigations are among the highest priority investigations within the FBI. The investigations are generally complex and require specific knowledge, skills and abilities to successfully investigate. Often, sophisticated, innovative, and creative ideas are needed to combat and eventually prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes. As the complexity and long-term nature of health care fraud investigations increase, the FBI anticipates that the number of FBI investigations and convictions will begin to level off. A considerable portion of the increased funding was utilized to support major health care fraud investigations. In addition, operational support has been provided for FBI national initiatives focusing on pharmaceutical diversion, chiropractic fraud, medical clinics, and transportation providers. Further, the FBI continues to support individual field offices with equipment and to assist in various individual investigations. The funding made available through HIPAA also made possible a health care fraud Managers Conference and several Regional Training Conferences for FBI Agents and Professional Support assigned to health care investigations. These training sessions provided in-depth training on the Medicare program and current health care fraud trends and issues to approximately 300 investigative personnel. Other training made possible by HIPAA included: training sessions on data mining and Medicaid fraud. Further, HIPAA funding was utilized to fund training sponsored by various private organizations.

McAdoo, hereinafter \"Respondent,\" was licensed as a dentist in the State of Colorado on or about October 21, 1987, being issued license number 6394, and has been so licensed at all times relevant hereto. 2. The Board has jurisdiction over the person of the Respondent and the subject matter of this Notice of Charges. 3. Respondent is a past employee of the Huggins Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Center (\"Huggins Center\"). 4. The Huggins Center accepted for treatment patients with systemic illnesses and diseases. The Huggins Center treated patients by removing all dental amalgams, metallic crowns or bridges; replacing those with composites; extracting all teeth which had root canals; and excavating cavitations. The Huggins Center provided this treatment to patients who ,were experiencing no problems with their amalgams, crowns, bridges, or root canal teeth. Hal Huggins developed a standard protocol for treatment of Huggins Center patients, including serum compatibility tests, IV-C, and electrical reading of amalgams. . 5. In 1985, Hal Huggins co-authored a book entitled It's All In Your Head, in which he espoused his theories and the treatment offered at the Huggins Center. In 1993, Hal Huggins revised this book and retitled it It's All In Your Head: The Link Between Mercury Amalgams and Illness. 6. On May 1, 1996, Hal Huggins' license to practice dentistry was revoked in Case Number DE 95-04. The Final Agency Order and Initial Decision in Case Number DE 95-04 is incorporated as though fully set forth herein. The Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), identified numerous violations of the Dental Practice Law of Colorado, including instances of substandard care, performing treatment and tests without clinical justification, and practicing outside the scope of dentistry. 7. Respondent advertised in a holistic magazine, Nexus, that \"What a dentist places in your mouth can and does affect your overall systemic health. I feel that all patients (including parents or children) should have a say in choosing materials used for fillings. I provide information, options, and dental material testing with which to make an informed decision. . . . \" The advertisement is incorporated as through fully set forth herein. 8. Respondent advocates dental material compatibility testing and ordered it for patients. The representation is that such testing, performed using the patient's blood serum, can detect allergic reactions to groups of metals and, thus, certain dental materials, and that this information can then be used to determine the \"least reactive dental material\" for a patient. 9. The dental material testing that Respondent \"provides\" is the Clifford Materials Reactivity Testing (\"the Clifford test\") performed by Clifford Consulting and Research, Inc. (\"Clifford\"); on occasion, Respondent uses an identical test done by Huggins Diagnostic Center (\"Huggins\"). Respondent ordered dental material compatibility testing for the following 15 patients (14 had it done at Clifford and one had it done at Huggins). The test that both Clifford and Huggins perform is a serum compatibility test wherein a patient's blood serum is mixed with a small amount of the material in question and observed for the formation of an immune complex which precipitates out of solution and collects at the bottom of the test well. The ALJ in Case Number DE 95-04 found the serum compatibility tests to be substandard and without clinical justification. 10. Upon completion of each patient's test, Clifford (and Huggins) produced a report for Respondent. The report detailed groups of materials to which the patient had a \"positive\" immunological reaction (meaning the patient could be allergic and that the particular materials should not be used for a dental purpose in the patient's mouth). 11. The report also listed approximately 3558 dental product which were either indicated or contraindicated for the patient, depending upon what group of materials the patient tested \"positive\" for. 12. Upon receipt of the test results, Respondent told these patients that he would eliminate identifiable materials that the patient was shown to react to immunologically by the compatibility test. Respondent further stated that he would restore the patients' teeth using materials that the patient did not show a reaction to in the compatibility test. 13. Respondent advocates and performs electrical conductivity testing to determine the amount, if any, of electrical current generated by the interaction of amalgam fillings with the chemical environment within the patient's mouth. Respondent uses the results to determine which fillings to begin removing and replacing first, beginning with the most \"reactive.\" 14. Respondent also advocates intravenous vitamin C (\"IVC\") therapy as an adjunct to removal of amalgam dental work and surgical cavitation to help with the healing process. Respondent referred several of his patients for IVC. 15. Eight of the following patients signed an informed consent form. This form is identical for every patient, except for the procedure to be performed. 16. The second paragraph of the consent form states, in part, \"....due to a combination of aesthetic, personal, and other considerations, it is my individual decision to have these procedures performed. \" 17. The fourth paragraph of the consent form states, in part, \"... the main objective at this time is to eliminate identifiable materials that I have been shown to react to immunologically from the serum compatibility test.\" 18. The final paragraph of the consent form states, \"... I am here on my own behalf and not as an agent for federal, state, or local regulatory agencies and am not seeking information under cover of false identity or misrepresentation of my situation or on a mission of entrapment.\" 19. From approximately August 20, 1997, through June 15, 1999, Respondent provided care and treatment to Patient A, whose identity Respondent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' Identities. 20. On August 27,1997, Patient A signed a consent form wherein the procedure to be performed was handwritten as follows: ('Replace amalgams (\"silver\" mercury fillings) with tooth colored fillings and/or crowns. Replace existing crowns with non heavy metal filled crowns.\" 21. Review of Respondent's file for Patient A reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 8/29/97,\" \"Date Dr. Scott McAdoo.\" 22. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient A, the patient's record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. . 23. . Respondent performed electrical conductivity testing on Patient A, as documented on the Initial Data Base and Recommendations sheet. 24. Review of Respondent's dental treatment record for Patient A reveals that Respondent failed to document a complete dental history, a complete dental examination, a diagnosis supporting his proposed treatment, and a treatment plan. Respondent also failed to obtain an adequate panographic x-ray before beginning treatment. 25. Review of Respondent's file for Patient A also reveals that there is no documentation of a periodontal examination or an occlusal examination, despite the fact that Respondent was going to restore half of the occlusal apparatus, which included replacing 12 crowns and 3 fillings. 26. On August 20, 1997, Respondent noted in Patient A's chart, \"Discussed Compat, IVC, Acup,\" \"Compat\" meaning the intravenous vitamin C, and \"Acup\" meaning acupressure or acupuncture. Respondent referred Patient A for all three of these treatments. Patient A's chart does not indicate follow-up for the IVC or ACUP referrals. 27. From approximately February 3, 1997, through July 21, 2000, Respondent provided care and treatment to Patient B, whose identity Respondent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' Identities. 28. A review of Patient B's dental record reveals that Respondent failed to obtain written consent from Patient B before beginning 'any treatment. The standard regarding informed consent requires that a patient be informed of the afflicting condition, the proposed treatment for that condition, all reasonable alternative treatments including, if appropriate, doing nothing, all substantial or reasonable anticipated risks of such treatments and the anticipated outcome of such treatments. 29. Review of Respondent's file for Patient B reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 9/11/97,\" \"Date Dr. Scott McAdoo.\".. 30. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient B, the record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 31. A review of Respondent's dental treatment record for Patient B reveals that Respondent failed to document diagnoses supporting his proposed treatment plan, a description of the radiographically evident periapical pathology associated with tooth #24, a complete dental examination including a periodontal examination and charting, an occlusal examination, and radiological examination and diagnosis. 32. Respondent extracted tooth #24, but the chart does not explain why it was extracted or that alternatives and risks of extraction were explained to the patient. 33. Respondent performed \"surgical cavitations\" (surgical entry and debridement of \"holes\" left by extracted teeth) of the extraction sites for previously extracted and healed teeth #s 1, 16, 17, and 32. The documented diagnosis for teeth #s 1 and 32 was alveolar cavitational osteitis (ACO), and the documented diagnosis for teeth #s 16 and 17 was neuralgia inducing cavitational osteonecrosis (NICO). 34. On August 1, 1996, and September 23, 1997, Respondent provided care and treatment to Patient C, whose identity Respondent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' Identities. 35. Patient C saw Respondent only for prophylaxis during orthodontic treatment. 36. A review of Patient C's dental record reveals that Respondent failed to obtain written consent from Patient C before beginning any treatment. The standard regarding informed consent requires that a patient be informed of the afflicting condition, the proposed treatment for that condition, all reasonable alternative treatments including, if appropriate, doing nothing, all substantial or reasonable anticipated risks of such treatments and the anticipated outcome of such treatments. 37. Review of Respondent' s file for Patient C reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 10/17/97,\" \"Date Scott McAdoo.\" . 38. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient C, the record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 39. A review of Respondent's dental treatment record for Patient C reveals that Respondent failed to properly document his initial examination of Patient C, and failed to obtain and document an adequate examination to reach a diagnosis to support his treatment plan. 40.

The standard regarding informed consent requires that a patient. be informed of the afflicting condition, the proposed treatment for that condition, all reasonable alternative treatments including, if appropriate, doing nothing, all substantial or reasonable anticipated risks of such treatments and the anticipated outcome of such treatments. 76. Review of Respondent's file for Patient I reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 9/21/97,\" \"Date Dr. Scott McAdoo.\" 77. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient I, the record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 78. It is believed that Respondent performed electrical conductivity testing on Patient I and documented it on an old periodontal examination from, from a previous dentist, dated 4/17/91. 79. A review of Respondent's dental treatment record for Patient I reveals that Respondent failed to document a complete dental examination including an occlusal examination. 80. Respondent performed a periodontal examination on September 12, 2000, well after his restoration of tooth # 4 and extraction of teeth #s 15, and 19 and the last day Respondent saw the patient. 81. From approximately March 6, 1997, through April 30, 1997, Respondent provided care and treatment to Patient J, whose identity Respondent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' Identities. 82. A review of Patient J's dental record reveals that Respondent failed to obtain written consent from Patient IJ before beginning any treatment. The standard regarding informed consent requires that a patient be informed of the afflicting condition, the proposed treatment for that condition, all reasonable alternative treatments including, if appropriate, doing nothing, all substantial or reasonable anticipated risks of such treatments and the anticipated outcome of such treatments. 83. An entry made in Patient J's dental record for March 6, 1997, reveals the following notation: \"Discussed Compat (had blood drawn), IVC, Acup.\" 84. Review of Respondent's file for Patient J reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 3/11/97,\" \"Date Dr. Scott McAdoo.\" 85. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient J, the record\\ does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 86. Respondent performed electrical conductivity testing on Patient J, as documented on the Initial Data Base and Recommendations sheet. 87. A review of Respondent' s dental treatment record for Patient J reveals that Respondent failed to document a complete dental examination including a periodontal examination and charting and occlusal examination. 88. Further review of Patient J's dental record reveals inadequate documentation supporting the extensive treatment plan. A review of the March 6, 1997 panograph reveals missing teeth wherein the bony extraction sites appear radiographically nominal; however, Respondent diagnosed these sites with ACOo presumably requiring invasive surgical cavitation. 89. On April 9, 1997, arid April 29, 1997, Respondent provided care and treatment to Patient K, whose identity Respbndent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' Identities. 90. A review of Patient K's dental record reveals that Respondent failed to obtain written consent from Patient KI before beginning any treatment. The standard regarding informed consent requires that a patient be informed of the afflicting condition, the proposed treatment for that condition, all reasonable alternative treatments including, if appropriate, doing nothing, all substantial or reasonable anticipated risks of such treatments and the anticipated outcome of such treatments. 91. Review of Respondent's file for Patient K reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 4/15/97,\" \"Date Dr. Scott McAdoo.\" 92. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient K, the record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 93. A review of Respondent's dental treatment record for Patient K reveals that Respondent failed to document a complete dental examination including a periodontal examination and charting and occlusal examination. There is inadequate documentation to support the treatment plan described on the Initial Data Base Sheet. 94. Respondent obtained one radiograph of tooth #4 and failed to obtain any further radiographs before setting forth his extensive treatment plan, which included 8 crowns and 9 fillings. 95. From approximately June 30, 1997, through September 19,2000, Respondent provided care and treatment t6 Patient L, whose identity Respondent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' Identities. ' 96. On July 10, 1997, Patient L signed a consent form wherein the procedure to be performed was handwritten as follows: \"Replace amalgams (\"silver\" mercury fillings) with least reactive tooth fillings~ Extract root canal teeth.\" 97. Review of Respondent's file for Patient L reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 7/2/97,\" \"Date Dr. Scott McAdoo.\" This date is before the consent form was signed by the patient. 98. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient L, the record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 99. A review of Respondent's dental treatment record for Patient L reveals that Respondent failed to document an occlusal examination. There is a periodontal examination record but it is dated September 19, 2000, the last day the patient was seen by Respondent and after Respondent performed 2 fillings, one crown, one extraction, and replaced two bridges. There is inadequate documentation to support the treatment plan described on the Initial Data Base Sheet. 100. Respondent referred Patient L to a periodontist but failed to properly document the referral. 101. From approximately April 2, 1997, through July 24, 2000, Respondent provided care and treatment to Patient M, whose identity Respondent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' Identities. 102. A review of Patient M's dental record reveals that Respondent failed to obtain written consent from Patient M before beginning any treatment. The standard regarding informed consent requires that a patient be informed of the afflicting condition, the proposed treatment for that condition, all reasonable alternative treatments including, if appropriate, doing nothing, all substantial or reasonable anticipated risks of such treatments and the anticipated outcome of such treatments. I ;. 103. Review of Respondent's file for Patient M reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 4/14/97,\" \"Date Dr. Scott McAdoo.\" 104. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient M, the record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 105. A review of Respondent' s dental treatment record for Patient M reveals that Respondent failed to document! a periodontal examination or charting until June 2, 1998, 14 months and 12 office visits after Patient M's initial examination. Respondent also failed to document an occlusal examination. There is inadequate documentation to support the treatment plan described on the Initial Data base Sheet. 106. Respondent also failed to obtain a complete set of radiographs before beginning extensive restoration. There is no pre-operative extraction radiograph of tooth # 19. 107. From approximately April 8, 1997, through July 24,2000, Respondent provided care and treatment to Patient N, whose identity Respondent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' Identities. 108. On May 15, 1997, Patient N signed a consent form wherein the procedure to be performed was handwritten as follows: \"Replace amalgams (\"silver\" mercury fillings) with least reactive tooth colored fillings and/or crowns based on compatibility test.\" 109. Review of Respondent's file for Patient N reveals a report from Clifford that states, \"Date Received: 4/14/97,\" \"Date Dr. Scott McAdoo.\" This date is before the patient signed the consent form. 110. Although Respondent ordered and obtained a Clifford test on Patient N, the record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 111. Respondent performed electrical conductivity testing on Patient N, as documented on the Initial Date Base Sheet. 112. A review of Respondent's dental treatment record for Patient N reveals that Respondent failed to document a complete dental examination including a periodontal examination and charting and occlusal examination. There is inadequate documentation to support the treatment plan described on the Initial Data Base Sheet. 113. Respondent referred Patient N for IVC and Acup but failed to properly document these referrals. 114. From approximately January 12, 1995, through July 28, 1995, Respondent provided care and treatment to Patient O, whose identity Respondent knows and is listed in the Confidential Key to Patients' I Identities. According to Respondent's records, Patient O had numerous systemic complaints. \" 115. On January Id. 1995, Patient O signed a consent form wherein the procedure to be performed was handwritten as follows: \"Replace amalgams with least reactive tooth colored materials. Extract root canal teeth. Clean out cavitations (holes in bone).\" Respondent failed to diagnose any endodontic condition that would justify the recommended extractions. . 116. Review of Repondent's file for Patient 0 reveals a report from Huggins that states, Although Respondent ordered and/or obtained a compatibility test on Patient O, the record does not document any justification for this test or that this test was used in any way to develop the treatment plan. 118. Respondent performed electrical conductivity testing on Patient O, as documented on the Initial !?ate Base Sheet. 119. A review of Respondent's dental treatment record for Patient O reveals that Respondent failed to document complete dental examination including a periodontal examination and charting, soft tissue examination and occlusal examination. Respondent failed to document a definitive diagnosis. There is inadequate documentation to support the treatment plan described on the Initial Data Base Sheet. 120. Respondent extracted asymptomatic, endodontically treated teeth #s 9, 29 and 30. Respondent failed to document any pain, discomfort, infection, or swelling associated with these teeth nor any diagnosis of any endodontic condition that might justify these extractions. 121. Respondent diagnosed ACO of the surgical extraction sites of previously-extracted teeth #s 1, 16, 17, and 32. Respondent performed \"surgical cavitations\" on all four extraction sites. 122. Respondent failed to document any complaints of pain, infection or swelling associated with these extraction sites to justify invasive surgical cavitation. Respondent also failed to adequately document the surgical procedures performed. 123. Respondent replaced 11 fillings and 6 crowns without radiological indication. 124. The crowns on teeth #s 24 and 25 that Respondent unnecessarily replaced in March 1995 were ultimately replaced again by a subsequent treating dentist in May 1999. 125. Respondent routinely removed otherwise asymptomatic fillings, crowns, and endodontically treated teeth. There was often no legitimate dental reason for the restorative work. 126. Mercury toxicity is a medical condition, requiring treatment by a medical doctor. 127. Respondent diagnosed ACO, NICO, and focal infection in several of his patients for whom he removed dental work. 128. ACO, NICO, and the focal theory of infection are not generally recognized diagnoses or theories by the scientific medical/dental community. 129. Respondent performs \"surgical cavitation\" as a treatment for NICO, often on asymptomatic endodontically treated teeth that he has extracted, and on healed asymptomatic extraction sites of previously extracted teeth. 13 O. Respondent' s performance of \"surgical cavitation\" for the treatment of ACO and NICO is below the standard of practice for dentists within the state of Colorado. 131. Respondent's serum compatibility testing has no scientific basis to determine which materials will react with the immune system and which will not. Respondent's serum compatibility testing is without clinical justification. 132. The need to test for dental materials reactivity, as an accepted or routine component of a comprehensive dental examination or as an accepted or routine component of determining a dental diagnosis or treatment plan, is not included in any accredited dental curriculum. 133. When an allergic reaction to a dental material is suspected or a systemic medical manifestation due to use of a dental material is suspected, the standard of care is to refer the patient for a medical consultation. Such testing and interpretation is the practice of medicine. Respondent failed to refer any of these patients for a medical consultation and/or interpretation of the test results. 134. Regardless of the actual compatibility test results for Patients A through O, Respondent used the same dental material to restore their teeth. 135. Respondent's treatment objective, as stated in the consent form signed by eight of the above-referenced 15 patients (\". . . the main objective at this time is to eliminate identifiable materials that I have been shown to react to immunologically from the Serum Compatibility Test\") is mlsleading and false. This treatment is below the standard of practice for dentlsts within the State of Colorado. . 136. Electrical conductivity testing such as that performed by Respondent is not recognized in the general practice of dentistry. . 137. Intravenous vitamin C therapy is not a recognized adjunct for any dental procedure and is not recognized in the general practice of dentistry. Furthermore, Respondent is not a medical doctor and cannot discuss the pros and cons of medical procedures. 138. Because the treatment referenced above is without clinical justification, patients cannot consent to it. 139. The final paragraph of Respondent's standard informed consent form is irrelevant to the practice of dentistry and serves only to protect Respondent against dental practices that he knows or suspects are negligent and/or below the standard of care for dentists in Colorado.

It summarizes scientific Web site evaluations; recommended and nonrecommended books; and other information relevant to consumer protection and consumer Barrett wins libel award. An arbitration panel composed of three attorneys has awarded Dr. Stephen Barrett $6,500 in general damages and $10,000 in punitive damages in a libel case against Tedd Koren, D.C., and Koren Publications, which is probably the world's largest publisher of chiropractic patient education materials. In 2002, Barrett sued Koren for falsely reporting that Barrett had been \"delicensed,\" is a \" quackpot,\" and was \"in trouble\" because he had been justifiably sued for racketeering. Koren's report was based on a \"news release\" by [Tim Bolen](http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/bolen.html), a professional character assassin whom Barrett is also suing for libel. Koren's answers during a deposition indicated that he neither knew nor cared whether what he said was true. The arbitrators also ordered Koren to publish a retraction. Koren has filed an appeal, which means that the case may be retried in front of a jury. Chirobase has the [full story of the suit](http://www.chirobase.org/08Legal/koren/suit.html) and a copy of the [deposition](http://www.chirobase.org/08Legal/koren/depo.html). Stuart Suster's medical license revoked. The Wisconsin Medical Board has revoked the medical license of Stuart Suster, M.D., of Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. In July, an Administrative Law Judge issued a lengthy [report](http://www.casewatch.net/board/med/suster/susteralj.doc) which concluded that Suster had: - Improperly prescribed controlled drugs. - Improperly touched 16 women, including seven whose breasts he grabbed or fondled when they were in his office and two he kissed while they were receiving \"electrostimulation treatment\" in a reclining chair. - Threatened to injure four patients. - Improperly fondled the scrotum of a male patient who had complained of constipation. - Used an improper procedure code to bill ten insurance companies for approximately $1 million more than they might pay for properly coded claims for treatment with a [Dynatron](http://www.dynatronics.com/)machine. - Billed excessively in six cases, in some of which he charged both the patient and the patient's insurance company for the same services. - Billed third-party payers for a total of more than 24 hours of physician-patient contact time on four dates. - Engaged in substandard practices, including inadequate record-keeping, in treating three patients. - Failed to comply with an Wisconsin Medical Examining Board order to undergo to a five-day residential evaluation. The order was issued after several patients complained that he had spoken to them in an angry and loud manner, using language inappropriate for a physician. The charges against Suster state that he underwent the evaluation but refused to release the required report to the Board. Although the proceedings did not question Suster's basic use of the Dynatron machine, they could have done so. Proponents claim that the device relieves chronic pain by influencing the sympathetic nervous system. [However, an assessment published in 2002 by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries concluded that it has not been proven effective](http://www.quackwatch.org/06ResearchProjects/dynatron.pdf). The revocation takes effect immediately, although Suster can appeal the decision in state court. In recent months, [Tim Bolen](http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/bolen.html) has \"advocated\" on Suster's behalf. Lead poisoning by ayurvedic products reported. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported on 12 cases of lead poisoning associated with with the use of ayurvedic medications. The report states that certain traditional or folk medications used in East Indian, Indian, Middle Eastern, West Asian, and Hispanic cultures contain lead and other adulterants, but certain branches of ayurvedic medicine consider heavy metals to be therapeutic and encourage their use in the treatment of certain ailments. [ [Lead poisoning D.D.S., who practiced \"mercury-free dentistry\" in Tomahawk, Wisconsin, has agreed to surrender his dental license and pay $6,045.46 in costs to the State of Wisconsin. The [Dental Examining Board's report](http://www.dentalwatch.org/reg/spaeth.html) states that Spaeth \"failed to completely remove patients' existing restoration materials and decay before placing new composite restorations,\" \"failed to do certain periodontal examinations,\" and \"failed to properly place and shape composite restorations.\" The Board concluded that his mistreatment of six patients constituted \"unprofessional conduct.\" The American Dental Association Council on Ethics, Bylaws, and Judicial Affairs has concluded that \"removal of amalgam restorations solely for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed at the recommendation of the dentist, presents a question of fraud or quackery in all but an exceedingly limited spectrum of cases.\" Spaeth replaced a total of 57 amalgam fillings with composite fillings. But rather than considering why he did this, Wisconsin's regulators focused on allegations that his replacement work was substandard. In 1991, Spaeth was reprimanded for failing to keep adequate records. Omnimedia adds misguided publications. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. has purchased New Age Publishing Inc.'s \"Body & Soul\" magazine and Thorne Communications Inc.'s \"Dr. Andrew Weil's Self Healing\" newsletter. Body & Soul, founded in 1974 as the \"New Age Journal\" and renamed in 2001, promotes organic food, \"natural\" products, \"mind-body methods\" and various spiritual and metaphysical practices. [ [Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia acquires Body & Soul Magazine and Dr. Andrew Weil's Self Healing Newsletter, PR Newswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-12-2004/0002230345&EDATE=), Aug 12, 2004] \"Body & Soul\" contains many inappropriate recommendations. Weil's newsletter intertwines sense and nonsense. (An example of its nonsense is a recent statement that \"acupuncture, which aims to rebalance the body's life energy or chi, can be helpful for MCS patients, perhaps by helping to eliminate toxins and strengthening organ systems.\") The news release did not indicate whether Martha Stewart herself played any role in the acquisition. [Hide Full Content](#twenty-nine-thousand-two-hundred-thirty-four) [My 1986 Visit to the Nevada Clinic](https://quackwatch.org/homeopathy/articles/nevada/) A few physicians who consider themselves homeopaths use \"electrodiagnostic\" devices to help select the remedies they prescribe. A leading proponent of this method in the United States is Fleming Fuller Royal, M.D., owner and medical director of The Nevada Clinic, Las Vegas, Nevada. Dr. Royal is a member of Nevada's homeopathic licensing board and was its president from 1983 to 1985 and is currently its secretary-treasurer. These devices do not make legitimate diagnoses, but Royal helped persuade the Nevada legislature to legalize their use within the state.

In 1986, when I was preparing an article on homeopathy for Consumer Reports magazine, Royal invited me to visit his clinic as a patient. The following account of my visit was published in Nutrition Forum Newsletter in January 1987. Although this report may not sound critical, I do not trust what Royal does and would never recommend using his services. As far as I know, he has never published a scientific report demonstrating that he helps patients. On March 1, 2002, I noticed that the clinic was using and marketing the Quantron Resonance System (QRS), a device that it claims is effective against a long list of diseases and conditions. These claims are false. Since the device lacks FDA approval for its intended purpose, marketing it in interstate commerce is a federal crime. Nevada Clinic publications state that electrodiagnosis is one of the most effective aids for diagnosing illness and that \"there are no incurable diseases, only ignorant physicians.\" The initial clinic visit\u2014which spans a two-day period-commonly costs $700 to $800, including $165 for allergy testing and $100 for homeopathic remedies. The program also includes lectures on nutrition and allergies. The clinic is located in a small shopping center near the outskirts of Las Vegas. It has 10,000 feet of floor space with more than 40 rooms. The spacious waiting room is tastefully decorated and seats 18 people. Most staff members wear white uniforms with royal blue jackets. There are four physicians, each of whom sees about 70 patients during a 4-day work week. Patients are typically asked to return three times during the six months after their first visit and annually thereafter. Most learn of the clinic through word-of-mouth or ads in homeopathic or health food publications. After making an appointment, they are sent medical history forms to complete. Upon arrival at the clinic, patients are given a name tag and asked to sign an insurance form and a consent form which acknowledges that the clinic specializes in electrodiagnosis, uses homeopathic methods, has made no guarantees, and will not function as their primary physician for routine examinations or other necessary treatment. After signing the forms, patients receive a 71-page Patient's Handbook and are shown a 20-minute videotape, both of which introduce the staff and explain the clinic's methods. Then they are escorted to the various rooms where examinations and educational programs are carried out. They are weighed, blood pressure is taken by a nurse, and specimens of urine and blood are taken for laboratory analysis. Since overnight fasting is required for some of the blood chemistry tests, a snack of juice, nuts and rice cakes is provided after the blood is drawn. (Some clinic \"veterans\" bring their own snacks.) All patients at The Nevada Clinic are diagnosed with a computerized galvanometer called the INTERRO. This is said to measure changes in the skin's electrical resistance which indicate whether the body's organ systems have proper \"electromagnetic energy balance.\" To use the device, the doctor probes \"acupuncture points\" on the patient's hands and feet and interprets numbers on the computer's screen. (The less the electrical resistance, the higher the score.) One wire from the computer goes to a brass cylinder covered by moist gauze which the patient holds in one hand. A second wire is connected to a probe which the doctor touches to the patient's other hand or foot. When he does so, it completes a low-voltage circuit and causes a band to rise from 20 to up to 100 on a scale on the computer screen. Readings over 60 are said to represent \"inflammation,\" readings of 48 to 60 are normal, and readings below 48 represent \"degeneration,\" which may signify cancer or atherosclerosis. The device makes a whining noise resembling that of an electrical motor; the higher the number, the louder the noise. The INTERRO is programmed so that charts and tables can be placed on the screen to help the doctor select from approximately 1,700 homeopathic remedies. By selecting certain remedies and retesting with the probe, the doctor determines which remedies will balance the disturbed energy flow in the patient's body. (According to the Patient's Handbook, \"the magnetic blueprint of the homeopathic remedy flows through the body via the electrical current and resonates in harmony with the body, returning an abnormal reading to normal.\") One or more remedies may be placed in a tray attached to the computer to receive an energy transfer. The INTERRO and another device are used to diagnose allergies. During the latter procedure, vials of common allergy-causing substances are placed in the tray so they become part of the circuit. Mercury dental fillings are probed with another electrodiagnostic device said to measure negative electrical potentials, which, if too great, indicate that toxic amounts of mercury or other metals may spread to surrounding tissues and cause eventual damage to nearby nerves. Some patients are tested by the clinic nutritionist with a device in which vitamins, minerals and enzymes are placed in a tray connected to a meter that supposedly indicates whether the patient needs them. In October 1986, at Dr. Royal's invitation, I underwent all of the electrodiagnostic tests except for vitamin testing. After testing me on the INTERRO, he said I had a number of electromagnetic blockages and had \"temporomandibular joint stress, probable subclinical allergies, and possible mild early preclinical arthritis.\" After determining what he thought was the most appropriate remedy, he placed a vial of vitamin B12 in the tray and \"transferred an electromagnetic blueprint\" to it. He explained that it was desirable to overcome \"energy blocks\" caused by the scars in my skin. Since the energy travels mainly through acupuncture meridians on the surface of the skin, he wanted to remove the blockage by injecting the specially prepared B12 into the points of blockage: my appendectomy scar, the areas inside my throat from which my tonsils had been removed, the skin near my jaw joints, and my vaccination scar. After doing this, he retested and said that most of the blocks were gone, but my jaw showed considerable tension and should be manipulated. After doing that, he prescribed five homeopathic remedies for home use and advised me to have my dentist replace one of my mercury amalgam fillings with another material. During the testing, I noticed that the harder the probe was pressed to my finger or toe, the higher the reading on the INTERRO screen. Royal readily acknowledged this, but said, \"that's why it takes a lot of training to use the equipment properly.\" The manufacturer's literature states that if the INTERRO is used for medical diagnosis in the United States, it must bear the label \"FOR INVESTIGATION USE ONLY. The performance characteristics of this product have not been established\" and that diagnosis must be confirmed with an accepted medical procedure. But Royal told me that no such label was needed. A sign in the clinic pharmacy warns that homeopathic remedies should be kept away from electrical outlets and appliances and should not be x-rayed at airport entries. The reason for this is that \"remedies posess electromagnetic fields [that] become distorted and unpredictable when strongly affected by other magnetic fields.\" The nutrition lecture was conducted by a woman who said she had taken correspondence courses through [Donsbach University](/related/donsbachuniversity/) (an unaccredited school) and the [American Association of Nutritional Consultants](/consumer-education/nonrecorg/aanc/). Her main advice was to eat less meat and more fresh fruits, vegetables and other unprocessed foods. She recommended installation of a home water purifier. She also said that aluminum pots can cause Alzheimer's disease, that milk (other than goat's milk) is not good for adults, that microwave cooking \"zaps the life force\" and changes the molecular structure of foods, and that sunshine beneficially stimulates the pituitary gland. Royal calls his approach \"bioenergetic medicine\" and says it is the wave of the future. He was introduced to it by Floyd Weston, a former insurance executive who had investigated its use in Germany. (According to a 1981 article in the National Health Federation's Public Scrutiny, Weston learned about electrodiagnosis after organizing a group of businessmen \"to conduct a worldwide search for the answer to good health.\") When Weston approached him, Royal was practicing medicine in Oregon and felt that the medical climate would be hostile toward electrodiagnosis. So Weston investigated the situation in Nevada and reported that influential persons were interested in having another type of tourist industry besides gambling and had promised him that Royal would not be bothered there by medical authorities. In 1979, before Royal could relocate, Oregon's board of medical examiners became concerned about his use of electrodiagnosis and ordered him to take written and oral competency examinations. He passed the written examination, and since he had been planning to move anyway, it was agreed that the oral exam would be dropped and his Oregon license classified as inactive. The Governor of Nevada subsequently appointed Royal to a homeopathic advisory board, and a homeopathic licensing law was passed which included \"noninvasive electrodiagnosis\" as part of the definition of homeopathy. So this practice is now legal in Nevada. The Nevada Clinic of Preventive Medicine opened in 1980, but in 1983 its name was shortened because insurance companies would not honor claims from a \"preventive medicine\" clinic. (\"With the name change,\" the clinic newsletter notes, \"more patients' insurance claims are being paid.\") Royal originally directed the clinic's medical aspects and Weston directed its business aspects, but in 1983 they parted company, and in 1984, Royal became sole owner and operator. Royal struck me as an extremely sincere person who believes in what he is doing and wants very much to help those who consult him. His clinic set-up radiates caring and concern. The atmosphere is unhurried, and the staff is friendly, efficient and energetic. Everything is explained in detail, an aspect of treatment missing from many medical practices. From a marketing standpoint, the clinic set-up is outstanding. So far, 16,000 patients have been seen at The Nevada Clinic. Royal said he plans to double the clinic's size, to add a mini-kitchen and physical therapy department, and to computerize all patient records so that statistical reports will be easy to compile. Do Royal's methods actually help people? It would be easy to suggest that since electrodiagnosis and homeopathy are outside the realm of accepted medical practice, such treatment is worthless. But Royal says that most of his patients suffer from headaches and/or allergies. These conditions often have an emotional component that can be influenced by a positive doctor-patient interaction\u2014which most patients who trust The Nevada Clinic are likely to have. Does the clinic lure people away from effective treatment? My single visit could not determine this, but several patients told me they had not been helped by their previous doctors. Royal said he does not accept cancer patients because \"if they get better, physicians will say it was a spontaneous remission or that the patient did not have cancer at all; and if they die, I'll get blamed. It's a no-win situation.\" Royal said he does not want to treat severe neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"Lou Gehrig's disease\") or the late stages of multiple sclerosis. Nor does he wish to treat illnesses severe enough to require hospital care or surgery. Regarding medications prescribed by other doctors, he said, \"All medications are to be continued until improvement is noted by the referring doctor and/or the patient. We advise patients to follow the advice of their personal physician and to give us progress reports at specific times.\" It would be fascinating to conduct a well designed study to measure what Royal is actually accomplishing. He seems open and self-confident enough to cooperate with such a study if an appropriate person or agency were interested in carrying it out. This article was posted on July 22, 2004.

Consumer Protection Division Law Department United States Postal Service Washington, D.C. 20260 APPEARANCE FOR RESPONDENT: Christopher S. Barnard, Esq. Katz, Paller & Land 470 E. Paces Ferry Road Suite 2000 Atlanta, GA 30305 INITIAL DECISIONThis proceeding was initiated on May 16, 1980, when the Consumer Protection Division, Law Department, United States Postal Service, Washington, D.C. (Complainant) filed a Complaint in which it alleged that Great Life Laboratories, Inc., 500 Dorian Road, P. O. Box 837 Westfield, NJ 07090 (Respondent) is engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mails by means of false representation within the meaning of 39 U. S. Code \u00a7 3005. Complainant alleges in paragraph I of the Complaint that attention is attracted to the scheme or device by advertisements which are calculated to induce the readers thereof to remit money or property through the mails. Paragraph II advises that copies of advertisements typical of those referred to in paragraph I are attached to the Complaint as Exhibits A and B. (Copies attached hereto as Appendices A and B.) In paragraph III of the Complaint, Complainant alleges that by means of such advertisements, or others similar thereto, Respondent represents, directly or indirectly, in substance and effect, whether by affirmative statements, omission or implication that: a) The RNA in RIBOMINS will cause wrinkles to disappear. b) The RNA in RIBOMINS will make some individuals look ten to fifteen years younger. c) The RNA in RIBOMINS reduces breathlessness and fatigue. d) The RNA in RIBOMINS heals acne, age spots and other skin ailments. e) The RNA in RIBOMINS promotes good health and a general sense of well-being. f) The RNA in RIBOMINS prevents aging and disease. g) RIBOMINS increases resistance to flu and other diseases. h) RIBOMINS have been scientifically tested and proven effective in making the user feel younger and more energetic and have healthier skin. Complainant alleges in paragraph IV that the aforesaid representations are materially false as a matter of fact. Complainant then requests that an order conforming with 39 U. S. Code \u00a7 3005(a) (1) and (2) be issued against Respondent. In its Answer, Respondent denied each of the charges as stated in the Complaint, and with respect to each charge it further denied specifically each and every other allegation set forth directly or indirectly, in substance and effect, whether by affirmative statements, omission, or implication, in each separate paragraph beginning with the preamble paragraph of the Complaint and ending with the Ad Damnum paragraph thereof. The product sold by Respondent is a tablet called Ribomins, the ingredients of which are as follows: |1 Tablet 4 times daily provides|| | RDA* % U.S.A. |Vitamin A (fish oils) 10,000 units|| | 200 |Vitamin D 400 units|| | 100 |Vitamin B-1 (yeast & thiamin) 20 mg|| | 1333 mcg|| | 250 |Vitamin C (rose hips & other Natural sources) 300 mg|| | 500 |Vitamin E 100 I.U.|| | 333 |Niacinamide 100 mg|| | 500 |Panthotenic Acid 50 mg|| | 500 |Folic Acid 100 mcg|| | 25 |Calcium 600 mg|| | 60 |Iodine (kelp) 15 mg|| | 100 |Iron (ferrous fumarate) 19.6 mg|| | 110 |Magnesium (oxide) 200 mg|| | 50 |Zinc sulfate 90 mg. supplying Zinc 36 mg|| | 240 |Selenium (in special yeast) 4 mcg|| | ** |Ribo-Nucleic Acid 180 mg|| | ** |ONLY THE FINEST NATURAL INGREDIENTS AVAILABLE ARE USED IN THIS PRODUCT.| |Contents including base Made from fish oils, fermentation extract, rose hips, special yeast, vegetable oils, kelp, and pure vitamins and minerals as indicated in a base containing para-aminobenzoic acid 30 mg. inositol 40 mg. lecithin, citrus-bioflavinoids 100 betaine manganese and torula yeast.| |DIRECTIONS: Adults as a dietary supplement of various essential vitamins and minerals 1 tablet 4 times a day as a dietary supplement.| |* Recommended Daily Allowance as established by US Government. | ** Recommended Daily Allowance has not been established. In less detail Respondent describes Ribomins as a dietary supplement consisting of ribo-nucleic acid (RNA) plus essential vitamins and minerals. Four tablets a day are said to \"provide 180 mg. of RNA - and a whole lot more.\" (App. A) At the bottom of the fourth column of text in Appendix A, Respondent solicits orders for Ribomins, and offers a refund of the purchase price if, after 30 days of use as directed, the purchaser is dissatisfied and returns the unused tablets to Respondent. The purchase orders and the refund requests are to be sent to Respondent at 500 Dorian Road, P. O. Box 837, Westfield, NJ 07090. The following excerpts from Appendix A provide a basis, but not necessarily the only basis, for each of the alleged representations set forth in paragraph III of the Complaint. Representations- - a) The RNA in RIBOMINS will cause wrinkles to disappear. - b) The RNA in RIBOMINS will make some individuals look ten to fifteen years younger. - c) The RNA in RIBOMINS reduces breathlessness and fatigue. - d) The RNA in RIBOMINS heals acne, age spots and other skin ailments. - e) The RNA in RIBOMINS promotes good health and a general sense of well-being. Advertising statements- \"The 'No-Aging Diet' is creating a sensation. Recently, a national magazine and newspapers reported that a high nucleic acid diet can: - Cause wrinkles to disappear... - Make some individuals look ten to fifteen years younger... - Reduce breathlessness and fatigue... - Combat acne, ugly brown 'age spots', and other skin ailments... - Promote good health and general sense of well-being... - A major Health Journal reported:...The most immediate effect observed in dosages as low as 30 mg. of RNA daily was an increase in energy and well being. Reports disclose that the most striking effects were observed on the skin of the face. The first results observed were a healthier, rosier appearance and an apparent smoothing of the skin of the face. After one or two months of treatment, lines and wrinkles began to diminish.\" Representation- f) The RNA in RIBOMINS prevents aging and disease. Advertising statements- \"A significant breakthrough in the fight against the effects of aging.\" * * * \"Hailed by doctors as the scientific breakthrough of our time, RNA (Ribo-Nucleic Acid) is opening up exciting new possibilities in the fight against the effects of aging and disease.\" Representation- g) RIBOMINS increases resistance to flu and other diseases. Advertising statement- \"This safe and effective nutritional supplement may significantly contribute to your family's health and resistance to flu and other illness.\" Representation- h) RIBOMINS have been scientifically tested and proven effective in making the user feel younger and more energetic and have healthier skin. Advertising statement- \"If you are between 20-60 years of age, a major medical authority reports that RNA may significantly contribute to making you feel more energetic, may help your skin to look its healthiest, and may help to make you feel younger, more alert, and alive.\" In general, the hope of the reader as to the benefit to be obtained by purchasing and taking the product is fortified by the confidence and assurance of the seller as to the ability of the product to accomplish the advertised results. This confidence and assurance is made manifest in the banner caption of the advertisement stating that what is being offered for sale constitutes \"a significant breakthrough in the fight against the effects of aging.\" This display by the seller of its confidence in the product is undergirded and strengthened by the no-risk, money-back guarantee made by the seller. Complainant called as its first witness Dr. Theodore Robert Reiff, a medical doctor who is Associate Professor of Medicine in the School of Medicine at the University of North Dakota. Based upon his education, training and experience, including his private practice of medicine, as stated at the hearing and in his curriculum vitae, all of which reflect a special interest in geriatrics and gerontology, Dr. Reiff is well qualified to give expert testimony in respect to the issues in this proceeding. (Tr. 4-7, CX-E) Dr. Reiff, with what appears to be an excess of modesty, did not claim to be an expert in nutrition, but his credentials unequivocally establish that he is expert in (1) the mechanisms of aging and (2) the kind and character of preliminary study and testing that must be performed before valid claims can be made that products advertised and sold through the mail and over the counter will arrest or reverse the aging process. Dr. Reiff's testimony is summarized through page 20 of this decision. His testimony is adopted as part of the basis for this decision. The process of establishing a scientific fact usually begins with a theory or hypothesis which is arrived at by definitive reasoning. It can be initiated, also, by observation which leads to the formulation of a theory or hypothesis. Next, experimentation is performed in a proper, scientific manner which includes, among other things, proper controls and adequate statistical evaluation. The results of the experiment are then objectively reported in the scientific literature, followed by confirmation of the results of the experiments by other independent, objective scientists using accepted techniques. If the results can be replicated by others and if the information is of value, the knowledge then becomes accepted by the scientific, professional community. In designing the test or the experiment one factor to be considered is whether the experimental subjects are to be humans or animals. The subjects have to be of quantity and quality that would result in a valid experiment and be statistically significant. Unethical or inhumane practices are not be carried out in the experiment and the means must be justified by the ends sought to be accomplished, by the professional standards of society and of the individual profession. The process of having writings accepted for publication in scientific journals begins, generally, when the author sends a copy of the article to the appropriate journal. The paper is reviewed by the board of editors and the consulting editor. After appropriate peer review, if the research and the description of it are considered to be acceptable, in good form, methodologically and ethically acceptable, and scientifically valid, the paper is accepted. Otherwise, the paper can be rejected. (Tr. 8, 9) In discussing the process of the aging of living things, Dr. Reiff began by defining aging as a series of biological processes or events, including physical and chemical events, that take place, rather than just the passage of time. When aging is so defined, the question becomes: can the rate at which those processes and events take place be altered, thereby altering the rate of aging? The answer is: probably, yes. (Tr. 10) Theories of aging, or more properly mechanisms of aging, at various levels of biological organization were discussed. Some of these mechanisms are now summarized. A. The molecular level is the lowest level of biological organization. 1. The cross-linking theory is that aging is due to the cross-linking of collagen molecules, which are large protein molecules that form and help form the structural framework of the body. With aging there is an increased cross-linking of the collagen fibers in the cell. When this occurs there is created a mesh or network of fibers that entrap the cell and make diffusion of nutrients by the circulatory system more difficult. In turn, this collagen network makes more difficult the diffusion of the waste products from the cell through the capillary where they are excreted. The cell's metabolism is impaired and it becomes less viable. Here, in order to retard the aging process, it would be necessary to reduce the cross-linking process by chemical means since these are chemical cross-linkings. 2. The error theory of aging is that aging may be due to an accumulation of genetic error in DNA, which is the chemical from which genes are formed. Each time cells replicate there is, ideally, a complete replication of the original cell, but this is not always the case. There may be only a 99 per cent replication, which when carried through a series of ten replications, there might be almost a 10 per cent error in the DNA. There would result an interference with further replication because there might be enough error to prevent correct multiplication and cell division. An offsetting factor is that within cells there are certain enzymes, called \"endonuclear enzymes\" that have the capability of recognizing and correcting error in DNA. These endonuclear enzymes are thought to be over 99 per cent efficient. Despite this modification of the error theory, it probably is an important mechanism of aging at the molecular level. 3. The \"free radical\" theory is a third mechanism of aging. The term \"free radicals\" refers to reactive molecules and atoms. One way in which radicals are made by chemists is to radiate a chemical reaction. An incident of radiation can raise the energy state of an orbiting electron by having the energy of the photon added to it thereby making the atom molecule more reactive chemically. The \"free radical\" theory is that aging may be due to an increase in the number of free radicals that occur with aging and these free radicals cause a lot of unwanted reactions thereby accelerating the aging process. Efforts have been made to reduce the number of free radicals by giving certain chemical agents in the food of experimental animals. One such experiment appears to have had some success in pregnant rats, but it has not been established that it works in humans. 4. Another theory of aging at the molecular level is called the \"pigment\" theory. A brown, fatty pigment, \"lipofusion,\" is found in heart muscle, and other, cells and the amount of this pigment increases with age. Some recent reports indicate that certain chemicals may be given which allow the cell to get rid of the pigment. Experiments can be done that show that this chemical process works in tissue culture, but this has not been validated in humans. (Tr. 11-16) B. The next higher level of biological organization is the cellular level. Most cellular studies in aging stem from the work of Leonard Hayflick and the so-called \"Hayflick Phenomenon.\" From his study of connective tissue from the lung of a human fetus that had been aborted Hayflick found that the cells reproduced as normal cells did and that they did so for about fifty generations of cells. Hayflick, among other things, calculated that from the amount of tissue that would be produced at the time an individual is a new-born fetus enough tissue could be produced to last 150 to 175 years. In the past few years there have been reports that there is an extract of brain tissue, probably in the class of peptides known as \"encalfrines,\" which are chemical messengers for the brain. It has been reported that when this substance is added to cells and tissue culture it is capable of more than doubling cell replication potential from fifty to over one hundred. Thus, even if there is a cellular limitation to the life span for certain of us, it is conceivable that this might be capable of being altered. Dr. Reiff stated that this extract of brain tissue is leading the way to psychological control over the cell replication potential, or cellular aging. This may have a tremendous therapeutic potential in the future, but at present, there are no therapeutic aspects to it. (Tr. 16-21) C. The next biological level of organization is the organ or organism level, these being made of cells. About 20 or 30 years ago, Dr. Nathan Shock and his colleagues at the National Institute of Gerontology initiated a longitudinal study in which they brought healthy humans into the laboratory and studied the organ function in these people. They studies the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, muscles, bone strength, nerve conduction velocity, liver, endocrine system and, lately, the immune system. They found that if a plot is made of the percentages of maximal function in relation to age, from about age 30 on, there is a decline from 100 per cent of maximal function in the twenties of all the organism function studied at an average rate of decline of one-half to three-quarters per cent per year. This has caused people to think, erroneously, that is why we live only threescore and ten years \u2014 that by the age of 70 we have lost function and can not continue to exist. The reason it is not true is because humans are born with a surfeit of function. Humans are born with two kidneys, but they can get along fine with less than one. They are born with an excess in the capacity of bone strength, bone muscle, strong lung function and heart function, all serving in good stead as reserve capacity. Physiological difficulties do not begin to develop until these functions are reduced to about one third of maximal. That is the time when one starts getting symptomatic with normal day-to-day functions and the level of activity. But from the point of view of the organism, there is enough function to last at least a century. It is believed that the reason for the earlier decline in organ function is atrophy, or the decrease of function or size of the organ with disuse. If one does not use it, he loses it. If one does not exercise his muscles, not only do they get weaker, but, also, the cells decrease in size; they have decreased RNA and protein synthesis. Conversely, it should be possible to extend the period of normal functioning of muscles, and other organs, by the process of hypertrophy, increasing their function and size. Therefore there may be ways of extending the healthy human life span by keeping people active physically, mentally and emotionally so as to prevent or delay the atrophic process. If so, nutrition is very important because in order to produce the hypertrophy, sufficient nutrients must be supplied to allow the body to rebuild and undergo the hypertrophic process. Instead of needing fewer nutrients because they have lower caloric and protein requirements, as formerly was thought, some studies indicate that older people may even need more of certain foods in order to allow the hypertrophic response. (Tr. 21-26) Generally, in the higher levels of biological organization it appears that the life span is increasingly shorter. The cellular limitations do not appear to be the limiting factor because there are enough connective tissues to last possibly as long as 150 years. If atrophy is not permitted to set in, there should be enough organ function to last in excess of 100 years. The Hayflick studies on cell longevity have not been done sufficiently on living people, they having been performed only in the test tube. Experimentation is in progress to determine if all cells are capable of 50 replications. In addition, the competence of the immune system has been studied during the last decade. There are some reports from the University of Rochester School of Medicine that the immune system is capable of being psychologically and behaviorally conditions. (Tr. 29-31) The primary causes of death in the very old appear to be infection, pulmonary emboli (blood clots that break off from the veins in the lower extremities and go to the lungs), and cancer. Infection and cancer are very much related to the decreased immunal competence, while pulmonary emboli are very much related to physical inactivity. (Tr. 32) Life is shortened by increased psychological factors reflecting depression, inactivity, and putting people out to pasture. Sociological aspects come into play - such things as pollution, environmental hazards, war and other factors which further shorten the life span below its biological potential. Much work is being done on this problem, but most of this work gives information that has to be used in the futre. Very few of the claims being made for treatment to enhance longevity have been scientifically established. For instance, claims that certain elements or chemicals, when added to food, are free radicals which increase the human life span have not been proven in humans. (Tr. 34-35) In testifying about the ingredients in Ribomins Dr. Reiff began by defining and discussing ribonucleic acid, or RNA. RNA is an element or chemical in the cells that is responsible for a number of things, including protein synthesis. RNA is produced by deoxyribonucleic acid, commonly referred to as DNA. DNA is within the nucleus of the cell and it is the chemical that makes up the genes of the cell. It is responsible for synthesizing RNA which goes into the plasm of the cell and synthesizing protein. (Tr. 35) When the RNA in Ribomins is ingested, it is broken down in the intestinal tract to its constituent parts, purine and pyrimidine, which are absorbed and are available for utilization in the body, for the building up of nucleic acids in the cells and for other uses in cells and energy metabolism. People who have an adequate diet are believed to obtain adequate amounts of RNA and DNA, as well as other nutrients. RNA and DNA, being cellular constituents, are found in organs that are rich in cells such as liver. They are found, also, in certain beans and nuts. Materials that are very cellular contain a lot of RNA and DNA. Individuals do not get enough RNA in their diets when they do not get enough food, or enough of the right kind of food, or if they are on diets that significantly restrict the organ foods or other foods that are rich in cells. (Tr. 36) The treatment for people who do not receive enough RNA is to give them proper nutrition if they are able to eat the diet, if their digestive systems are intact, and if they are able to absorb the nutrients. The diet should be a therapeutic diet which should contain not just vitamins and RNA but, also, all the other nutrients that are needed by the body. If someone is deficient in RNA, he very likely will have a protein deficiency. (Tr. 37) \"Cellular therapy\", which was also referred to as \"Sickle Cell Therapy\", a process in which ground animal tissues were given by injection to older people, was tried in Europe a number of decades ago. It was supposed to supply a lot of RNA and DNA and cause rejuvenation. The treatment was never scientifically validated and it was discredited by the medical profession in the United States and abroad. It is now in disrepute. Some people who received this treatment claimed to be helped, but these anecdotal accounts were never validated. (Tr. 38) There are certain conditions in which giving a diet that is particularly rich in nucleic acid could be hazardous. One such condition is gout which is caused by too much uric acid and when uric acid builds up in the body beyond its saturation point, it can precipitate uric acid deposits in joints, causing arthritis. Urates (salts of uric acid) can also deposit in the kidneys causing kidney stones and kidney damage. Also, if there is kidney failure, the nucleic metabolic products and the urates could accumulate and do further damage. If patients who have certain types of tumors, certain malignancies, including lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease and lymphosarcoma, are treated by radiation or chemical therapy, resulting in destruction of large amounts of tumor tissue, the urate levels in the blood would rise very high and kidney failure and gout could be precipitated. Persons with the foregoing conditions constitute groups for whom the use of increased amounts of RNA in the diet may be contraindicated and such supplementation should be used with care. It previously has been pointed out that the kidney function reduces at the rate of three-quarters percent per year after the age of 30, so that an 80 year old person might have a reduction of 40 pre cent from the maximum. (supra, p. 11) In treating older persons, therefore, it must be realized that they have decreased kidney function. (Tr. 37-40) There is no recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for RNA. Nutrition is a very important part of the treatment of older people. Undernutrition is a very serious and qualitatively important health hazard in the elderly due to inflation and the depressed economic circumstances of older people. Since they have to pay their rent, utility bills, and taxes, one of the few places where they can cut back on expenses is in nutrition. Nutrition in the elderly is becoming an increasingly serious problem of major proportions in the United States. (Tr. 40-41) Nothing in the scientific literature confirms that RNA, taken in Ribomins as directed, by persons not so malnourished that they have nutritional deficiencies, would make skin wrinkles disappear, or make individuals look 10 to 15 years younger, or reduce breathlessness or fatigue (except for a possible placebo effect), or heal acne, age spots and other skin ailments, or promote good health and a general sense of well-being (again, except for a possible placebo effect), or prevent aging and disease (unless there were a disease caused by a deficiency of RNA which was part of a generalized nutritional deficiency, in which event the patient would need other nutrients as well), or increase resistance to flu and other diseases (unless there was a deficiency in the vitamins and minerals contained in the product). There is no credible evidence to indicate that Ribomins have been scientifically tested and proven effective in making the user feel younger and more energetic and have healthier skin. From the foregoing statements it follows that there is no scientific evidence that Respondent's product, taken as directed, will have any effect on the progress of the mechanisms of aging described by Dr. Reiff. The foregoing testimony of Dr. Reiff is in accord with the consensus of informed medical opinion as reflected in his studies, his reading of scientific literature, and his discussions with his colleagues. (Tr. 41-44) Dr. Reiff has read about attempts by certain organizations and persons to promote RNA supplements and RNA plus vitamins as a great therapeutic advance. In his readings and discussions with colleagues the medical findings and conclusions have always been that these efforts have been discredited and that there is no evidence that these supplements have any benefits. (Tr. 50) The evening before the hearing Dr. Reiff read a book entitled \"No Aging Diet, Eat and Grow Younger\" by Dr. Benjamin S. Frank, of whom Dr. Reiff had not previously heard. A photocopy of the book had been furnished to Dr. Reiff by Complainant's Counsel, and so far as he was aware, Dr. Reiff had never read any other of Dr. Frank's writings. (Tr. 49) There are some weekly scientific journals which publish hypotheses and preliminary experiments. There are two geriatric medical journals, one of which is the Journal of the American Geriatric Society which has been published for many years, and the second is \"Geriatrics\" which has been published more recently. \"Geriatrics\" is not a classical journal. It is more of a news magazine type of journal, but it is read by doctors interested or specializing in geriatrics. (Tr. 53) Referring to his earlier statement that it is probable that medical science can interfere with the aging process, Dr. Reiff mentioned some experiments in which calorie and protein restriction in developing animals, rats and others, appeared to increase their life span. This restriction is not be applied to humans, however, because no experiments with humans have been performed. Many treatments that have been developed through practice are not being tested to determine the mechanism of their action and to scientifically validate them. It is possible that RNA has a place in the treatment of some of the degenerative aspects of aging and that it is worthy of further experiments. (Tr. 54, 55) The mechanisms of aging described as cross-link, error, error modified by enzyme, free radical and pigment are interrelated. For example, the free radical theory interrelates with the cross-link theory because cross-links cause changes in the oxidation by free radicals. (Tr. 57) The limited cellular potential is probably very much related to the error theory. (Tr. 58) Culture experiments are going on to see if human cultures can have healthy longevity increased by free radicals. It is hoped that in the next few years there will be sufficient information to determine whether free radical inhibitions may be a really important therapeutic modality. (Tr. 59) There are multiple mechanisms that cause or permit aging and they are all interrelated. This field is in scientific infance in many respects and there is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done. (Tr. 60, 61) When RNA is ingested it is broken down into its constituent nucleic acids and it is then absorbed. If it is properly absorbed it goes into the bloodstream and it is carried to the cells where it is reconstituted and utilized in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. There is information to the effect that with advancing age and with increased atrophy the ability to synthesize and produce RNA decreases. The ingestion of more RNA will assist in alleviating those problems if there is a deficiency of RNA in the diet. (Tr. 67-68) Wrinkles are caused by atrophy of the subcutaneous tissue of the skin which does not then provide the supporting base for the epithelium which then wrinkles. Wrinkling probably is also related to: a loss of elastic tissue; changes in collagen caused by cross-linking and other factors; a decreased blood supply to the tissues resulting in less ability of the tissues to maintain their original shape and to retain their elasticity. (Tr. 72-73) In the book \"No Aging Diet\" by Dr. Frank there is a statement to the effect that ingestion of RNA will alleviate or remove wrinkles, but there is no credible information in the book that would indicate that there is any scientific validation of the statement. (Tr. 72) Most of the information was anecdotal information about what a patient said after taking the tablets. Such a statement is of little scientific credibility. Dr. Reiff is of the opinion that the hypothesis or theory that oral RNA therapy can alleviate some of the symptoms or aspects of aging has little merit, especially in terms of giving isolated RNA. In the case of an isolated deficiency of nucleic acid, if, contrary to the witness's belief, such a specific deficiency could be demonstrated, then there might be some reason to give large amounts of RNA. Otherwise, if there is a deficiency of nucleic acids the proper treatment would be by giving ordinary nutrients, or foods. (Tr. 75-76) Dr. Reiff concluded the major part of his testimony by commenting, generally, about the Frank book, \"The No Aging Diet\". He stated that there was no presentation of any validity to the claims made therein; there was no substantiation; there was no credible information that any of the claims have been validated. (Tr. 75) Arnold J. Susser was called as the first witness for the Respondent. Dr. Susser, President of Respondent, was awarded a B.S. Degree in Pharmacy at Rutgers University in 1955, and a Doctorate in Naturopathy by the Quebec Institute of Naturopathy in 1974. He is a licensed pharmacist in New York and New Jersey and he is the founder and President of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants, which claims a membership of only 80-100, including members of The Nutrition Society of America. A more detailed statement of Dr. Susser's background is set forth in Respondent's Exhibit 1. Dr. Susser outlined the history of the development of Ribomins, the product which is the subject of this proceeding. (Tr. 92-94, 111) Dr. Susser defined naturopathy as a natural approach to health as opposed to allopathic care which employs drugs and medication. He continued: \"***it is allowing the body, by encouraging the body's normal, natural function with the necessary nutrients, to kind of heal itself, bring in the materials because, after all, our glands, organs and systems can not make things out of thin air. We have to make hormones, enzymes and everything else from nutrient factors.***\" (Tr. 94) In Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 23rd Ed., copyright 1976, naturopathy is defined as \"a system of therapeutics in which neither surgical nor medicinal agents are used, dependence being placed only on natural (nonmedicinal) forces.\" Dr. Susser formulated Ribomins which at first consisted of certain vitamins and minerals. To this mixture he added RNA, in order to provide (as he said virtually all experts would agree) for the body to form energy, or energy molecules, known as \"ATP.\" His authorities for foregoing statement are Dr. Benjamin S. Frank, previously mentioned, of New York, and Dr. Allen Nitler, of the State of Washington, who is listed, according to Dr. Susser's belief, in some San Francisco-Los Angeles directory. Dr. Nitler published an article in the Journal of Dr. Susser's American Academy of Nutritional Consultants. Dr. Susser describes the journal as a \"prestigious, nutritionally oriented, but still a very widely read, medically, journal.\" (Tr. 99) Dr. Susser says that Dr. Nitler concluded, among other things, that RNA, when ingested, is absorbed intact, or virtually so, even though it is a large molecule. (Tr. 99) The article adds, according to Dr. Susser, that more and more experts are agreeing that RNA in tissue and glandular substances, as part of the protein of the substances, does indeed become absorbed and can be recognized in the cells of the person who is absorbing it. (Tr. 100) Dr. Susser says that naturopathists use the words \"counseling\" and \"person\" instead of \"treating\" and \"patient.\" There are fewer than 300 naturopathic physicians in the United States. There is no licensure for that particular specialty. In his practice he sees people who are referred to him by medical doctors and he sees some who have been to many medical doctors but who need additional help. These people are given a form on which they keep a record of their food intake over a four-day period. Dr. Susser's nutritional staff breaks down the foods into the grams of proteins, carbohydrates and fats and milligrams of vitamins and minerals. Deficiencies and excesses of nutrients, including nucleic acids, are looked for as well as excess amounts of \"antagonists\" such as preservatives and chemical agents. The diet is discussed with the person and the environment in which the person lives and works is considered. If a report has been requested by the referring doctor, one will be prepared, and a regimen of dietary changes will be suggested. In about five years, Dr. Susser has recommended Ribomins to literally thousands of people. Also, the food intake of the person is adjusted to meet recommended dietary allowance standards, and if this entails the addition of more food than can be ingested, such supplements as Ribomins with RNA are suggested. According to Dr. Susser, over 90 per cent of the people he sees have a nutritional deficiency in 21 or more substances because of the effects of food processing and the promotion of junk foods. (Tr. 101-105) Dr. Susser developed the advertisement on which the Complaint herein is based on Dr. Frank's works, and on written materials which Dr. Susser had accumulated for a number of years. In 1969 Dr. Frank had written an article entitled \"Nucleic Acid, the Better Answer to Aging.\" In his article Dr. Frank mentioned the substances he added to certain vitamins, and he stated that the health of his patients improved in such matters as cardia function, retardation of aging, improved mental acuity, more youthful appearance of the skin, diminution of wrinkles and improved hair condition. These judgments of Dr. Frank were concurred in by Drs. Nitler, Lutz and Susser, and according to Dr. Susser, hundreds of others. It is Dr. Susser's reasoning that if RNA is involved in energy production, if the energy is increased within the cellular function, the efficiency of the function will be increased, and the food supplements will be more greatly utilized by the body. Collaborating with Dr. Susser in the preparation of the advertisement were, primarily, Dr. Frank and a Milton Pierce of New York City, as advertising copywriter. On a few occasions there were present, also, Dr. Frank's wife, a news editor of a radio station in New York, O. Miele, involved in the communications field, and Mrs. Susser, who is Vice-President of the Respondent. (Tr. 105-110) On cross-examination, Dr. Susser stated that in the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants and its affiliate, the Nutrition Society of America, there is a total of 80-100 members. (Tr. 111) The Quebec Institute of Naturopathy was accredited and authorized to award Ph.D degrees for some time prior to and including 1974, the last graduating class of which Dr. Susser was a member in that year. The witness stated that the reason for the closing was due to the fact that there were so few naturopaths in Canada that the Canadian government refused continued funding. (Tr. 112) RNA is present in all American diets, but to varying degrees. Dr. Susser has never found people who have not had RNA in their diet, except perhaps two or three persons who had either near zero or negligible amounts in the diet. These persons were primarily vegetarians. According to the witness RNA is not contained in the cellular matter of foods. The amounts of RNA contained in the diets of the persons with whom Dr. Susser consults are described by him as being either small or negligible, moderate or high. A diet high in glandular intake, such as fish, yeast and certain other foods, is recognized as a high RNA diet. A lacto-vegetarian diet is moderate to low in RNA intake, while a strict vegetarian diet is low in RNA. Depending on the individual involved, a moderate RNA intake may range from 3000 down to a few hundred milligrams of RNA per day, which is a wide range. Dr. Susser defined a diet with a high RNA content as containing 3000 milligrams and up per day, but he could not give the range of RNA to be found in the average hamburger. he did say that beef is low in RNA compared to other meats. A low RNA intake would be 50 milligrams or lower. If a person, as determined from a consideration of his or her daily intake, ingests a low to moderate amount of RNA, then the 180 milligrams provided by four tablets a day of Ribomins would be a judicious suggested addition to the diet. Even if a person had a significantly high intake of nucleic acid, the 180 milligrams added by four tablets of Ribomins with RNA would be regarded, by Dr. Susser and to most doctors who use it, as a safe and conservative amount, yet an amount that would be effective in terms of the production of energy factors in the body. (Tr. 111-118) Dr. Susser agreed with Dr. Reiff that no RDA for RNA has been established. (Tr. 121) Dr. Susser said, however, that humans do have a requirement for RNA. In support of this statement he cited Drs.s Frank, Nitler and Lutz and a release entitled \"Morbidity and Mortality, Reportable Diseases,\" issued by the County of Los Angeles Health Department for the Ninth Report Week ending March 1, 1969. (RX-2. This article speaks of the need for \"clinical trials involving interferon inducers in experimental and naturally occurring viral disease in humans.\" It also speaks of speculation that \"interferon induction might be of use in preventing tumor induction,\" but it is said that such speculation is premature.) With reference to his earlier statement that Dr. Nitler's article suggested that the RNA molecules are digested and used intact, Dr. Susser referred to some telephone conversation he said he had with a Dr. Howard Lutz of Washington, D.C. Dr. Lutz is reported by Dr. Susser as saying that he believed that the March, April or May, 1980, issue of the British medical journal \"Lancet\" contained an article in which it is stated that large molecular nuclear proteins, which Lutz called globulin, and which are larger than RNA molecules, which Lutz called globulin, and which are larger than RNA molecules, were found to be able to bypass the destruction presumably the breakdown into its component parts by the digestive process in the intestines contrary to the belief of the orthodox, or the adherents to the old school of thought. (Tr. 130-131) Among the weaknesses of the foregoing argument are that (1) the appropriate issue of \"Lancet\" was not produced; (2) Dr. Lutz did not appear; (3) Dr. Nitler's work could be found only in the journal of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants, which journal, also, was not offered; and (4) Dr. Nitler did not appear. Although he is (or was) the founder and President of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants, Dr. Susser stated that he did not know whether the journal of that organization is listed in MEDLARS and MEDLINE, systems for performing research in medical literature. (Tr. 134-135) One of the past presidents of the Academy founded by Dr. Susser is Dr. Carlton Fredericks, Ph.D in radio communication. (Tr. 142, 311) Dr. Susser stated that even if a person has a diet that has no nutritional deficiencies, and which would, therefore, supply all of the body's needs for the synthesizing of RNA, there would still be a requirement for exogenous RNA. (Tr. 137-142) Again, the witness relied on the works of Drs. Frank and Nitler. He claimed that support could be found in Respondent's Exhibit 2, but this exhibit does not deal specifically with the question put to the witness, or with the issues in this proceeding. Finally, the witness agreed that \"If it is a specialized situation with a person of exact stress levels of a known factor which is absolutely known hypothetically (sic), perhaps he will have enough RNA from his diet if he is absorbing it and making it on his own.\" Also, according to Dr. Susser, the providing of 100 to 200 milligrams a day, at a minimum, assures a person of receiving some RNA nutrient intake in his or her diet. The authorities for the last statement are Drs. Frank, Nitler and Atkins, the MEDLARS and the journal of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants, although the studies that were performed by Dr. Frank have not, the witness agreed, been published in any reputable scientific publication. (Tr. 142-148) The next witness called by Respondent was Dr. John G. Ledney, an osteopathic physician in general practice, who lives in Richwood (or Ridgewood) New Jersey. he was graduated from Youngstown College, Youngstown, ohio, in 1962, with a B.A. degree and majors in chemistry and biology. He was graduated in 1967, after four years of study, from the college of Osteopathy in Kansas City, Missouri, by which institution he was awarded the D.O. degree. He was appointed to a general practice internship for the period 1967 to 1968 at Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver, Colorado. Following his internship, he entered private practice. (Tr. 156, 157, 166) Dr. Ledney defined an osteopathic physician as \"a person who treats with an idea of the whole system, and his watchword is treating the whole patient and not in particular reference to disease only. He is interested in his financial, spiritual and emotional as well as physical well-being.\" Dr. Ledney is a licensed osteopathic physician and he is a member of the American Osteopathic Association, of Chicago, Illinois. (Tr. 157) The official definition of osteopathy adopted by the American Osteopathic Association is: \"That system of the healing art which places the chief emphasis on the structural integrity of the body mechanism, as being the most important single factor to maintain the well-being of the organism in health and disease.\" (The American Illustrated Medical Dictionary, Dorland, 21st Ed.) Nutrition is an elemental part of Dr. Ledney's practice. In keeping abreast in his profession Dr. Ledney attends seminars and he reads the current and recent literature in his field. (Tr. 158) For the last 15 years he has been interested in the practice of nutrition as therapeutic maintenance, and for the past five or six years he has put strong emphasis on it in his practice. (Tr. 158) RNA is one of the two nucleic acids in the nucleus of the cells and it is very important for the conversion of ATP to energy and in utilizing other nutrients in the production of energy. Some of the sources of RNA are fish, glandular animal tissue and yeast. (Tr. 158) When asked whether there is any correlation or relationship between RNA and extending the age and normal body functions, Dr. Ledney said that he believes that Dr. Frank's book is probably the most thorough discussion of that subject. He added that while he does not think Dr. Frank's work was scientifically documented or validated by doubleblind studies, he sees in his practice the same things Dr. Frank mentioned in his book, namely, that people who have a high RNA diet are healthier and younger appearing people. (Tr. 158-159) Dr. Ledney sees an average of 120 to 140 patients a week. The majority of his patients complain primarily of fatigue, followed in order by backache, headache, and obesity. Dr. Ledney became familiar with Ribomins early in 1975 when Dr. Susser brought it to his attention. he uses the product heavily in his practice and he uses it personally. If a patient requests a strong, good, safe multivitamin, Dr. Ledney refers them to Ribomins and has very good success with it. he has never had an adverse reaction when he has used Ribomins with an obese patient and on an overall basis 99 per cent of his patients have given a positive report of their experience in taking the product. They have reported such things as increase in energy, vigor, improved sense of humor and well-being; sleeping patterns improved; less depressions and changes in emotional levels; increased work output; less fatigue at the end of a full day and the requirement for less sleep. Other vitamin products have not produced the same favorable results and he attributes the difference in results to the presence of RNA which most other vitamin preparations do not contain. (Tr. 159-162) In addition to the foregoing results, he reported that the hair loss condition called alopecia areata improved; there were two patients whose eyebrows returned; and two patients came to him because some of his other patients had their hair return. In some patients their general facial expressions and countenances were brighter, their eyes were brighter, they were more alert and they could follow directions better; in some patients the general turgor of the skin improved. He thinks there is something about Ribomins that increases the whole health of a person and he believes that it is the circulatory system that is improved. There is a known need in the diet for RNA, but that need has not been quantified. Further, Dr. Ledney referred to a newspaper article in which it was indicated that RNA is directly related to interferon which, in turn, is related to virus protection. These are not validated reports but the curiosity of the scientific world has been aroused. When he is working nutritionally with his patients he sees less disease of all types and he attributes this result to an increase in the support of the immune system. He has observed in his own patients quite a decrease in susceptibility to colds and fever which he attributes to Ribomins with RNA, with which he has also had great success in treating mouth sores. Initial relief is quickly realized. The normal course of the problem is about eight days, but if he sees the persons when they are in the early stage of getting sick, and if they take this product, the cold sores respond within a couple of days. (Tr. 160-164) All of the patients who come to see Dr. Ledney can use some nutritional support. He does not prescribe Ribomins in all cases, but he modifies the diet according to the needs of the individual. If he feels that a patient will benefit from the taking of Ribomins, he prescribes the product. Dr. Ledney does not know how many or what proportion of osteopathic physicians use Ribomins with RNA, or any other RNA type of supplement. (Tr. 165) Dr. Ledney factors out the effect of Ribomins by means of his experience with them over the past five years of his 12 years of practice. He has not used synthetic vitamins to a great extent but he has used natural vitamins extensively. Synthetic vitamins are man-made materials sold by drug companies, while natural vitamins are made of natural ingredients. Synthetic and natural vitamins do not have different chemical structures, but they do have different biological properties. The basis for this difference is not known. (Tr. 168) The vitamin ingredients of Ribomins are natural. For example the Vitamin D comes from fish liver oils. Dr. Ledney's statement of the results obtained by him in his use of Ribomins is based on what his patients have told him and, also, on what he observed of them. His statement that 99 per cent of his patients have given him a positive report of their experience in taking Ribomins is based on the fact that it is difficult for him to recall one patient who has failed to report favorably on his use of the product. It is possible that the placebo effect accounts for some of the favorable comments he has received. (Tr. 169) Dr. Ledney reported that he observed increased resistance to colds among his patients. A cold is not the same as an allergy, although allergists might say they are the same. Many patients have a seasonal allergy, usually in May and August or September and, as he follows the patients during the first year, he sees less and less allergy reactions. These patients usually have been under the care of an allergist with weekly injections of different substances. He has gotten 50 to 100 patients off of allergy injections who have stayed healthy and have no allergic manifestations. He said that the fact that he noticed an increased resistance to colds is a fairly important scientific breakthrough, but he did not report it in scientific literature. According to Dr. Ledney if RNA is ingested, it stays more or less intact, it is absorbed intact and it then goes to the particular site in the body where it is needed. This statement is based on carbon-tagged studies reported by Nitler which showed that RNA was transported to the utilization site. (Tr. 171) While no need for RNA supplementation has been established, Ledney takes the position that there is an RNA shortage in all or nearly all people. He has no support for this position other than his observations in his practice; there are no studies, and no reports in scientific literature. He stated that the addition of RNA to nutrients previously used by him has brought about a tremendous change in his patients. (Tr. 172) One of the main problems of all people is their emotional state. He feels he is qualified to differentiate between a psychotic patient and a nutritionally affected patient. Some patients come to him after having visited a psychologist or psychiatrist. he treats them nutritionally and sees great results. He thinks \"the mental metabolism that goes on with this RNA and all the supplementation and therapy, the therapeutic regimen has made major breakthroughs in my practice which was, basically, not a part of my medical training. *** Most of my nutritional learning has been on my own, and the medical establishment does not treat maintenance or preventive medicine. It treats disease, and that is down the road.\" (Tr. 173) Dr. Ledney spends a good deal of time with each patient, but he thinks that the patient who just takes the product without having the benefit of his other consultative measures would be likely to derive the same benefits. Twenty-five to 30 per cent of his patients will not do anything else but take something by mouth. Dr. Ledney starts them on Ribomins and they get additional amounts of the product from other sources. He recognizes that about 25 to 30 per cent of the population achieves beneficial results by virtue of the placebo effect. These percentages are reflected in his practice. (Tr. 174-175) Martin D. Feit, M.D., who lives and engages in private practice in Staten Island, New York, was called as Respondent's next witness. Dr. Feit was graduate from Gettsburgh College in 1955 with a B.A. degree in Biology, and from the Chicago Medical School in 1960. He is a diplomate of the American Academy of Bariatric Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians. He is also a certified acupuncturist in New York and New Jersey. (Other items of note are stated in Dr. Feit's curriculum vitae, RX-3.) In his practice he specializes in nutrition. Dr. Feit described RNA as a substance which, when taken into the body, aids in normal cell metabolism and aids in preventing the running down of the cells. So far as the skin is concerned, RNA helps in the nutrition of the cell metabolism, hair growth, skin turgor, skin health, and the function of the other organs of the body. (Tr. 179-181) RNA is derived endogenously, being built up in the body, or exogenously, from outside sources such as fish, meat organs and yeast. Whether the body synthesizes enough RNA or needs an exogenous source depends on where the person is living. No quantitative requirement for RNA has been established by any medical group, but it is recognized as being essential. (Tr. 182) Dr. Feit became interested in RNA when he was Assistant Director of the Methadone Clinic in Staten Island. The instant product is not expensive and former heroin users could take it to feel better and to function better. (Tr. 183) As a person ages, if he is not health conscious, the skin gets loose, loses its color, loses its turgor, it wrinkles and the person physically degenerates. If patients are health conscious, or if they had taken a lot of RNA and other supplements all of their lives, there was a noticeable difference - seventy-year-old patients looked forty. (Tr. 183) Dr. Feit's practice became nutritionally oriented in 1971 or 1972 and he first knew of Ribomins in about 1974. Dr. Feit prescribes Ribomins with RNA for patients who complaint of fatigue and for persons who say they feel that they are aging too rapidly. In his methadone practice, there was a general improvement in the way patients felt and even in their mental performance. He has used Ribomins with RNA in treating obesity, drug addiction, and as a supplement to acupuncture for persons with alopecia areata. In terms of skin improvement, Dr. Feit found that after about a two- to four-week period, depending on how a patient followed the diet, there would be a tightening of the skin and improvement in skin turgor. (Tr. 184-185) The physiological process that occurs when Ribomins are ingested is that the RNA and vitamins go to the skin for skin metabolism. The elasticity of the cells would be increased, the skin would tighten and small wrinkles may be taken away. In addition, there would be a lessening of fatigue and there would be some relief from stress. Most of his patients who are on a proper diet, supplemented by Ribomins with RNA, do not get ill as much, the intensity of colds is diminished and the severity of flu is decreased. Ribomins with RNA builds up a person's resistance and prevents him from becoming sick or lessens the degree of sickness. (Tr. 185-186) Despite this endorsement of the use and value of RNA, Dr. Feit stated that the state of knowledge of his profession with regard to the requirement of the body for RNA, the role of RNA, and the body's needs for RNA, as well as other nutrients, \"is in its infance.\" (Tr. 187) In addition to nutritional treatment, Dr. Feit employs osteopathic techniques and acupuncture, the latter of which he has found to be helpful in treating lung patients. Dr. Feit has published papers in the American Journal of Acupuncture, primarily on acupuncture and nutrition, but none on nutrition alone. (Tr. 194-195) The next witness called by Respondent was [Robert C. Atkins, M.D](https://www.casewatch.net/depos/atkins1980.shtml)., who is engaged in the private practice of Internal Medicine, in the subspecialty of Nutrition and Carbohydrate Metabolism, in New York City. Dr. Atkins received his A.B. degree at the University of Michigan in 1951 and his M.D. degree at Cornell University Medical College in 1955. (Dr. Atkin's curriculum vitae is with the record as RX-5) Dr. Atkins has been working with diets since 1964 and with a full scope of nutrition since sometime in the early 1970's. Only about one percent of the practicing physicians in the country base their practice on, or emphasize, nutrition. Dr. Atkins said that Ribonucleic acid is an intermediary metabolite. \"Metabolite\" is defined in Dorland's American Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 21st edition, as \"any substance produced by metabolism.\" The experience of Dr. Atkins is in the clinical use of RNA as contrasted with the biochemistry of the substance, as a result of which he said that his answers to questions on this phase of the subject were less precise than he would have liked them to be. He stated, however, that the body gets the RNA it needs for its cells from the many precursors from which the various component parts can be synthesized. (Tr. 200) Dr. Atkins does not use RNA with every patient, but there are certain times, e.g., for persons suffering fatigue or angina pectoris, when he does add it to his basic routine as an isolated addition for the purpose of determining whether there is going to be any improvement in the patient's well-being. There are certain clinical situations in which he has come to use it, including fatigue that is not responsive to other measures, and angina pectoris. He began to use RNA four or five years ago, but more especially during the past two years, and he estimates that he has used it with between 100 and 200 patients. (Tr. 201) Dr. Atkins was introduced to using RNA through reading \"No-Aging Diet\" and \"Nucleic Acid Nutrition and Therapy\" by Dr. Benjamin S. Frank. (RX-6 and 7) In conversations with Dr. Frank, Dr. Atkins asked for what indications Dr. Frank found RNA useful; what complications or side effects RNA produced; in what dosage Dr. Frank used it; and for what clinical indications. Dr. Atkins then believed it worth while to try RNA on his own patients. (Tr. 202) Dr. Atkins does not particularly recommend sardines or other so-called high RNA foods, but he recommends RNA in tablet form as a food or nutritional supplement. He prescribes RNA for patients with whom he has started his overall program, which is a diet the main purpose of which is the stabilization of the blood sugar, and the secondary purpose of which is the elimination of any specific allergenic foods which that individual may be eating. Then there is added a comprehensive vitamin formulation and a mineral formulation based, in large part, on the epidemiology of the area and on the mineral results of the hair analysis. Occasionally, if the presented complaint is angina pectoris, the use of RNA may be started during the first week. More often RNA is withheld so as to provide a chance to evaluate the specific impact of RNA on that patient somewhere in the midst of the course of therapy. There is a solid core of patients - approximately between 20 and 30 per cent - who seem to be quite responsive to RNA. Their clinical response had been unimpressive with all the other vitamins and minerals until the RNA was added, at which point a dramatic improvement would take place in well-being; in so-called energy and sleep requirements; and in a variety of other complaints, such as depression, that seemed to accompany the fatigue. Upon discontinuing the RNA, these patients would slip back to their old previous level of not feeling so well. So, having taken these patients on and off RNA often enough he was able to convince himself that, at least for these individuals, RNA was helpful and did have a detectable and discernible clinical role. There were many patients for whom it just seemed to be part of the general improvement, or in whom nothing dramatic was noted that would cause him to believe that RNA was really making any major contribution. (Tr. 203-204) There were some other effects reported as being noticed very subjectively, which Dr. Atkins said he believed he saw, such as an improvement in the appearance of the patients. There is one other study, which should be, but has not been done, which is \"before and after\" photography. Dr. Atkins does believe that there is some efficacy in taking RNA because these people seem to look either healthier or younger or to have less lines, less crows feet around their eyes. Dr. Atkins stated that this observation is so subjective that it is an impression which, at best, would be very difficult to document. Dr. Atkins has prescribed RNA in ever adult age group including adolescence, but the emphasis has been on the older patient - the patient past the age of 50. (Tr. 204-205) Dr. Atkins described the state of medical knowledge of RNA, its uses and therapeutic value as being \"in its infance.\" He is not aware of any new investigations or information emerging. He said that Dr. Frank was certainly the leading proponent of the concept that supplementary RNA makes a difference. He added that everybody recognizes the essentiality of RNA to every cell in the body, but heretofore the feeling had been that we were going to be able to synthesize all the RNA that we need with whatever nutritional precursors we have and this is the currently prevailing thinking. It is only because there is the possibility of showing detectable differences with supplementary RNA that we might raise the question as to whether or not RNA production really has rate-limiting features which can be overcome by the utilization of additional dietary RNA. Continuing, the witness said that the question that really has to be addressed in order to determine whether RNA is a valuable nutrient, is whether or not our ability to synthesize RNA is not limited by the rate at which we can do it. Can we make enough molecules of RNA to supply our needs at a rate at which we might use it, or would supplementary RNA actually change the availability of it by providing so much more than we are getting from our manufacture of it through precursor nutrients? As to whether RNA supplementation might be beneficial to everyone rather than to those patients of Dr. Atkins who are put on a carbohydrate-limiting diet, it was his opinion that the carbohydrate-limiting diet does not play much role in whether or not RNA is useful. He has a group of patients who are on full carbohydrate diets and who take RNA and the same percentage of responders seems to prevail in that group as well. As to the value of using RNA supplements, Dr. Atkins is somewhere between enthusiastic and skeptical. He believes that there is a base for RNA in medical management or the nutritional management of some patients. On the other hand, there is actually a risk factor which had not even been talked about - the possibility that the uric acid level might be elevated. Therefore, he can not recommend its across the board usage, but he does see it as having a place in some individuals. More work has to be done and it has to be delineated. The right clinical situation has to be studied. In his opinion studying exercise tolerance in the angina patient would be a good place to start because one can document such a study. It would be quite admissible of a doubleblind study here, and he thinks such work should be done. (Tr. 205-207) On cross-examination, Dr. Atkins stated that he has published essays in Medical Counterpoint and in Medical TImes. (Tr. 208) He is, also, the author of two books entitled \"The Dr. Atkins Super Energy Diet\" and \"Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution.\" (RX-5) Doubt was expressed by a witness for Complainant, and no evidence to the contrary was adduced, that Medical Counterpoint and Medical Times were listed in Index Medicus, maintained by the National Library of Medicine to aid physicians in locating responsible, reliable, scientific writings. Both of the named publications are now defunct. (Tr. 229) Dr. Atkins stated that the American Medical Association, of which he is a member, has expressed a negative opinion concerning the diets described in his books. (Tr. 218) He conceded that the books by Dr. Frank on which he placed significant reliance (RX-6 and 7) were not subjected to the peer review and testing by which writings submitted for publications in authoritative scientific and professional journals are screened. (Tr. 215) Dr. Atkins is of the opinion that there is a certain risk associated with taking RNA by a person with a high uric acid (Tr. 214), but he is uncertain as to the degree of risk associated with taking Ribomins with RNA because of the relatively small amount of RNA contained in the product. A person could get 45 milligrams of RNA at one meal if he ate a lot of sardines or nuts or glandular meats. (Tr. 220-224) Dr. Atkins is of the opinion that when RNA is ingested at least some of it is absorbed intact. This opinion is said to be based on his observation of the effectiveness of RNA when given to some of his patients. He did not know whether RNA, when absorbed, is still RNA. (Tr. 213) The witness said that no RDA for RNA has been established - he thinks the presumption is that it is non-essential. (Tr. 221) Complainant called as its rebuttal witness Dr. Victor Herbert, 130 West Kingsbridge Road, Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center, Bronx, New York. Dr. Herbert's educational background includes the following degrees: Columbia University, New York B.S., 1948; Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, M.D., 1952; and Columbia University School of Law, J.D., 1974. He is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine and by the American Board of Nutrition. He has published over 400 scientific papers in peer review scientific journals, primarily in internal medicine, hematology and nutrition, particularly relating to patient care, diagnosis, treatment and biochemistry and physiology of nutrition. He currently is the President of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition, which is the arm of the United States in international nutrition matters. He is a member of the Joint Subcommittee on Human Nutrition Research of the executive Office of the President of the United States and a member of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. (Tr. 226-227) Other matters comprising the qualifications of Dr. Herbert, including his professional society memberships, editorial board memberships, consultant positions, hospital training and positions, intra-institutional posts, inventions, honors, lectureships, and memberships in organizations not requiring a degree in science, are stated in CX-J, which was received in evidence. Dr. Herbert defined essential nutrients as those which must be taken in the diet for life and health because the body can not make them. He defined ribonucleic acid or RNA as a chemical compound which is produced in cells, particularly outside of the nucleus of the cell in the cell plasma or cytoplasm, and it consists of sticking together of purine bases, sugars and phosphate, phosphoric acid. He has done research involving RNA and DNA and he has published a number of papers in that area. In fact, he developed a diagnostic test used in hematology and in cancer research which revolves around DNA synthesis, and RNA synthesis is also involved. There is not RDA for RNA. He is one of the fifteen members of the Food and Nutrition Board which created the Recommended Dietary Allowances and there is no RDA for RNA because RNA is not absorbed. RNA in food is chopped up completely be pancreatic nuclease, so that it is unabsorbed. If it were absorbed, it would be dangerous because that RNA which is not human in origin could be allergenic for humans if absorbed intact. \"It's chopped up in the gut and after being chopped up, the individual purines colorless crystalline substances forming the base of the uric acid group of compounds known collectively as purines or purine bases. -Dorland, supra, are absorbed and they then add to the burden of body uric acid to be disposed of as a waster product. RNA is made within cells; none of that which comes in diet is absorbed. The pancreatic nuclease and other pancreatic enzymes have this specific function of chopping up various undesirable substances so that they are not absorbed, only their end products are absorbed.\" (Tr. 227-228) Dr. Herbert pointed out that \"RNA as it comes in food, like in sardines, is generally not RNA; it's ribonucleo protein and in the intestine when the pancreatic enzymes start chopping up the bib molecule, they chop off the protein first and that leaves RNA, which then gets chopped up by other enzymes.\" Thus, what is in sardines is not RNA; it is ribonucleo protein, which is a much bigger molecule than RNA. Concerning peer review he said that it is the scientific system for separating wheat from chaff - that is, for separating, for example, a nutrition book for the public which may be completely fiction, from a nutrition book for scientists. The process of peer review involves the writing being submitted to an editor competent in medical science who then sends it out to a minimum of two reviewers known to be competent in the specific area of the scientific paper in question. These reviewers then do their best to tear the writing apart, both as to theory and fact and experimental method and conclusions. Their criticisms are then synthesized by the editor and sent back to the author who is not allowed to publish until he successfully meets the criticisms of his work. (Tr. 228-229) The membership of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants is not composed of scientific nutritionists according to uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Herbert. He said, also, and there was no testimony to the contrary, that several members of that organization have been convicted of criminal charges involving nutrition fraud. This is the group of which Dr. Susser is shown as the Founder/President in Dr. Susser's curriculum vitae. (Tr. 230; RX-1) There is no relationship between interferon and dietary RNA. Dietary RNA is destroyed in the intestines. There are some studies which show that in tissue culture, if one adds a variety of substances, interferon production can be stimulated. One such substance which can be added to a tissue culture as an intact substance is RNA in certain forms, and in some tissue cultures it will stimulate interferon production. In other tissue cultures it will not; some RNA's will stimulate, others will not. * * * One can think of RNA as a necklace - that is, it is a string of substances strung together and that necklace is called RNA regardless of whether it is made out or pearls or diamonds or glass; its component parts can be considerably different so long as it meets the basic criteria of purine bases and sugar and so on, so that the RNA from a mouse, for example, can produce a fatal allergic reaction if injected into a human. \"***That's one of the reasons that we have intestinal enzymes to chop up our foods so that we don't absorb food RNA which is not human, except for cannibals, and get allergic reactions and even possibly an anaphylactic reaction from absorbing a sardine or an animal RNA - we chop it up in our intestines.\" (Tr. 230-231) Dr. Herbert stated that there is no scientific evidence that dietary RNA will cause wrinkles to disappear; make some individuals look 10-15 years younger; reduce breathlessness and fatigue; heal ace, age spots and other skin ailments; promote a good health and a general sense of well being; or prevent aging and disease. (Tr. 231-232, 303) He also testified that none of the other ingredients in Ribomins would produce the results expressed in the alleged representations. (Tr. 314-15) On cross-examination Dr. Herbert stated that scientific evidence is a report published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal based upon data which is sufficiently valid to allow the possibility of such an interpretation. (Tr. 232) Without specific controls such as double-blind testing it is impossible to separate cause and effect from coincidence. (Tr. 232, 301-2) Therefore, conclusions drawn from treatment without controls, such as the conclusions stated in the testimony of Respondent's witnesses, are not valid. (Tr. 301) Dr. Herbert further testified that conclusions drawn from observing patients and hearing their comments are anecdotal and should be given no weight. In his cross-examination Dr. Herbert traced, in lay terms, the function of RNA in the production and replication of cells as follows: \"***The sequence of events is, that in the nucleus you have DNA. DNA is the basic cellular blueprint. It tells the cell what it is going to be. That is, the DNA blueprint says you are going to be a human being or you are going to be a salmon or you are going to be a cow. That basic blueprint in the nucleus is transferred by the DNA to a negative for the blueprint, just like if you are taking a picture of a blueprint, you a a negative. That negative for the blueprint, which carries the same information, is called messenger RNA. That messenger is made in the nucleus. That is RNA. That messenger RNA then goes to the cytoplasm. It travels out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where, as you recited my testimony, I indicated the majority of RNA is made. That messenger RNa then goes to tiny bodies in the cytoplasm called ribosomes. On those ribosomes another form of RNA is made from that blueprint of the messenger RNA. And then yet another form of RNA called transfer RNA picks up individual amino acids in the cell and brings them to the ribosome where they hook on in specific relation to the negative of the blueprint and create a protein. That is the life process and it follows a specific blueprint. \"So human RNA only makes humans. Sardine RNA only makes sardines and so on. If sardine RNa, for example, worked in a human, the human would grow fins and a tail, because it is a specific blueprint for making sardines. But RNA is mainly made in the sytoplasm. Messenger RNA is made in the nucleus.\" (Tr. 250-251) Commenting on whether the statement \"RNA is a protein\" is scientifically correct and on the manner of the digestion of RNA, Dr. Herbert said: \"If you use it 'RNA is a protein' to describe ribonucleic protein, yes. If you use it to describe ribonucleic acid, without the protein, no. It depends on how the term is being used. But RNA, ribonucleic acid, is ribos, which is a sugar, and nucleic acid. And nucleic acid is two things. *** It is a molecule made from smaller molecules and the smaller molecules are molecules of purines and paradigms strung to gather with phosphoric acid. *** an RNA molecule is a mixture of a sugar purine and paradigms and phosphate. *** 'RNA is digested just like protein is digested by pancreas ribonuclease, a specific enzyme, which we put in our intestines to destroy sardine RNA, for example, so we don't absorb it and absorb the blueprint that makes us a sardine.\" (Tr. 253) Much of the cross-examination of Dr. Herbert consisted of questions concerning articles or reviews in various scientific publications. Dr. Herbert had either written or contributed to the writing of these articles and reviews. Dr. Herbert's answers to questions put to him on cross-examination did not modify his direct testimony, and they contained little, if anything, to which Respondent could point for support of its position or for weakening of Complainant's case. The following typical series of questions and answers is illustrative of the foregoing statement. \"Q. The Journal of American Medical Associate, (sic) June 27, 1980, Volume 243, number 24 in the Medical News section, there is an article 'Vitamin B15 - whatever it is, it won't help.' Are you familiar with this? A. Yes. Q. You did not author this? A. The author's name is stated at the end of the article. Q. William Check? Q. Yes. Q. It mentions you. I want to read the mention of you and you tell me if this is an accurate characterization of yourself. First, it describes the work reported at the American Society for Clinical Nutrition by Neville Colman and I assume you also? A. Correct, I was a co-author. Q. 'This work is a continuation of the campaign against scientific health fads being waged by Victor Herbert, MD, JD, chief of the Hematology and Nutrition Laboratory,' etcetera. Is that accurate? A. It is an interesting characterization. Q. Is it accurate? A. I don't perceive myself as waging a campaign. I conceive myself as speaking the truth in the field of nutrition. Q. You are familiar with the product in question in this hearing, the vitamin RNA product? A. Yes. Q. Does that fall within your category of unscientific health fads? A. Yes. Q. So this is part of your campaign being waged? A. No, I am not waging a campaign. That is a characterization by someone else not by me. I characterized myself as speaking the truth about nutrition. This is part of my speaking the truth about nutrition.\" (Tr. 269-270) The remainder of the cross-examination of Dr. Herbert, as in the case of that which has just been quoted above, consisted principally of effort, entirely unsuccessful, to discredit this witness (e.g., Tr. 274-277; 293-295; 297-299; 300-301). The testimony of Dr. Herbert relating to the issues in this proceeding concluded with two statements. The first such statement was that there is no recommended dietary allowance for RNA because RNA in the diet serves no dietary purpose. (Tr. 313) Secondly, the witness was asked whether the other ingredients in Ribomins with RNA, namely certain vitamins and minerals, would contribute to the accomplishment of the results stated in the representations alleged in paragraph III of the Complaint as having been made by Respond ent. Dr. Herbert replied that, with one exception, the other ingredients alone or with RNA included can do none of those things. The exception, he stated, is in charge III (e) (that the RNA in Ribomins promotes good health and a general sense of well-being of a person suffering from a specific nutrient deficiency of one of the listed vitamins or minerals would be promoted. However, because the occurrence of deficiency in those vitamins is so rare, such a benefit would be accidental and coincidental. (Tr. 314-315) FINDINGS OF FACTBased upon the evidence hereinbefore summarized and cited below, and based upon other considerations of record noted below, I make the following findings of fact: 1. Respondent has used the advertisement which is Appendix A hereto in the conduct of its business. (Item 1, Respondent's Response to Request for Admission (hereinafter, Response)) 2. Respondent solicits remittances of money through the mail to the name and address shown in the caption hereof for a product called Ribomins, or Ribomins with RNA, consisting of ingredients as heretofore stated. (Items 2, 3 and 4, Response; supra, pp. 3-4; Appendix A) 3. Respondent guarantees that purchasers will be satisfied with the product or they can obtain a full cash refund. (Appendices A and B) 4. Respondent makes the representations set forth in paragraph III of the Complaint. (Appendix A; supra, pp. 5-7) This finding is predicated on the principle that an advertisement is to be considered as a whole and the meaning is to be determined in light of the probable impact of the entire advertise- ment on the person of ordinary mind. Donaldson v. Read Magazine, 333 U.S. 178, 189 (1948); Peak Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, 556 F.2d 1387, 1389 (5th Cir. 1977); Unique Ideas, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, 416 F. Supp. 1141, 1145 (S.D.N.Y., 1976). 5. Persons of ordinary mind reading Respondent's advertisement would interpret it substantially as characterized in paragraph III of the Complaint. 6. The representations found to have been made by Respondent are material representations because they are of the kind and character which would persuade readers to order and pay for Respondent's product. 7. The material representations heretofore found to have been made by Respondent in its advertising material are false as a matter of medical fact. a. Respondent's Dr. Susser, is the originator and seller of the product and he is, or has been, the organizer/president of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants. (Tr. 92-94); supra, p. 21) Dr. Susser bases his statements concerning the effects of taking of Ribomins on the writings of Dr. Jerome S. Frank, a Dr. Allen Nitler, a medical doctor in the State of Washington who is to be reached through California, and a Dr. Howard Lutz, of Washington, D.C. (Tr. 99, 100) b. The testimony in this record is to the effect that Dr. Frank's writings have never been subjected to peer review, and that the results of taking RNA reported therein are anecdotal and without scientific verification. The same lack of verification is true with respect to the results of the self-designated \"testing\" of the product by Drs. Susser, Ledney, Feit, and Atkins. Dr. Frank's writings, the evidence indicates, are without \"scientific validation\" and the results of his use of RNA with patients lacks \"scientific credibility.\" (Dr. Reiff - Tr. 72-76, supra - p. 20; Dr. Susser - Tr. 148; Dr. Atkins - Tr. 215, supra - p. 42; Dr. Herbert - Tr. 300, supra -. 47) c. Dr. Nitler's writings, so far as revealed by this record, appear only in the Journal of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants. This group is not recognized as being composed of scientific nutritionists. (Dr. Herbert - Tr. 230, supra - p. 45) Furthermore, Dr. Susser, who has an obvious and an admitted interest in the outcome of this proceeding, was evasive in respect to some questions and he claimed not to know whether the journal of that group is listed in MEDLARS or MEDLINE. (Tr. 135; supra - pp. also, Susser at Tr. 141-144; Dr. Herbert's description of the Nutritional Consultant's group makes it clear that he does not think the writings of Dr. Nitler referred to in this proceeding would be published in recognized scientific and professional journals Tr. 230; supra p. 45) d. Dr. Lutz is cited frequently by Dr. Susser, but no citation is given for his work. Although Dr. Lutz is said to be located in Washington, D.C., where three of the four sessions of the hearing were held, Dr. Lutz did not appear as a witness. Thus, testimony concerning his writings and statements is uncorroborated hearsay and of no legal significance. e. Dr. Susser cites Dr. Nitler as his authority for the proposition that RNA is \"absorbed intact or virtually intact.\" (Tr. 99-200, supra - p. 22) Dr. Susser is joined in this statement by Dr. Ledney, except that Dr. Ledney is more positive that dietary RNA is absorbed intact and then it is carried to the particular site in the body where it is needed. Dr. Nitler is referred to as the authority for Dr. Ledney's opinion. (Tr. 171-172; supra - p. 32) f. Dr. Feit, although a warm advocate of the use and value of RNA in the treatment of patients, says that the state of knowledge of his profession concerning RNA is in its infancy. (Tr. 187; supra - p. 32) f. Dr. Feit, although a warm advocate of the use and value of RNA in the treatment of patients, says that the state of knowledge of his profession concerning RNA is in its infancy. (Tr. 187; supra - p. 36) g. Dr. Atkins said that, based on its effectiveness as observed by him in patients for whom he has prescribed it, he has \"reason to believe that at least some supplemental dietary RNA is absorbed intact\" (Tr. 213; supra - p. 42). h. Opposing the above statements that dietary RNA is absorbed intact are the following comments: Dr. Reiff -when RNA as presented in Respondent's product is ingested, it \"is broken down in the intestinal tract to its constituent parts ***\"; Dr. Herbert -\"RNA is made within cells; none of that which comes in diet is absorbed intact \" (Tr. 228, 253; supra - p. 44). Further excerpts from Dr. Herbert's testimony are: \"Any textbook of biochemistry will tell you that dietary RNA is not absorbed intact . This is Principles of Biochemistry, 5th edition by Abraham White, Phylis Handler and Emil Smith. This is published in 1973 by McGraw Hill and I am reciting from chapter 9, entitled nucleic acids and nucleo proteins, tables 9.2, which lists the specificity of nuclease and says 'pancreas deoxyuridine nuclease destroys DNA and pancreas ribonuclease destroys RNA.'\" (Tr. 297) * * * \"It is well established science. Every biochemist including any who might work for your client knows that pancreatic ribonuclease destroys all of the RNA you eat as soon as it hits the small bowel, because if you, for example, absorbed sardine RNA and it got in your cells and worked as RNA, you would turn into a sardine, because it is a specific blueprint.\" (Tr. 298) * * * \"Q Did you rely on that particular text when you testified?\" \"A No, I relied on what I learned in medical school from Irwin Chigaff, among others, in first year biochemistry and my own work in breaking up RNA, which I have done in the course of my research, using pancreatic extract, pancreate and bile case (sic, in transcript), which is a commercial tradename for an Illinois company's brand of mixture of pancreatic proteins, which were used to digest tissue. \"The purpose of the pancrease enzymes is to digest all the things from food that we want to break down before we absorb. Digestion means breaking down and the pancrease enzymes, which go out into the food, as the food leaves the stomach, food comes in the mouth, goes into the stomach, where it is turned into a turgid, muddy, semi-liquid. And then it is poured out of the bottom of the stomach into the top of the intestine. In the top of the intestine there is a tube coming from the pancreas and that tube pours into this liquified mixture of food, the pancreas enzymes, whose job is to chop up things like RNA and DNA and enzymes, so that they don't get absorbed. Because if they are not from a human source, all they can do is harm if they are absorbed intact. They cannot do any good absorbed intact. That is known to every medical student who took first year biochemistry and first year physiology.\" i. Dr. Reiff said categorically that there is nothing in the scientific literature which confirms that Respondent's product, it taken as directed by persons without nutritional deficiencies, would produce the results represented by Respondent in its advertisement. (Tr. 41-44) j. Dr. Herbert testified that there is no scientific evidence that dietary RNA, or Ribomins as constituted, taken as directed, will produce the results represented by Respondent. (Tr. 231-232, 303; supra, pp. 45-46) 8. There is some risk, the magnitude of which is uncertain, involved in the taking of Respondent's product. (Dr. Reiff - Tr. 38-40, supra - p. 15; Dr. Atkins - Tr. 207, 214, supra - p. 42; Dr. Herbert - Tr. 228, 303; supra - p. 44) 9. The fact that the placebo effect may occur in the case of some users does not support the efficacy of the product or the truthfulness of Respondent's representations. Stauffer Laboratories v. F.T.C., 343 F.2d 75 (9th Cir., 1965); Original Cosmetics Products, Inc. v. 459 F. Supp. 496 (S.D.N.Y., 1978); aff'd. 603 F.2d 214, Table, den. 444 U.S. 915 (1979); Wilmont Products, P.S. Docket No. 6/46 (P.S. De., 1979). 10. Expert opinion testimony need not be based upon tests of the particular product in issue to constitute sufficient evidence of false advertising representations. Reilly v. Pinkus, 338 U.S. 269, 274 (1949); Original Cosmetics Products, Inc. v. Strachan, supra; Skinny Suit, P.S. Docket No. 3/44 (P.S. Dec., 2/19/76, p. 6). 11. A finding of falsity can be based on the testimony of expert witnesses whose testimony is in accord with the consensus of informed medical or scientific opinion when there is no contradictory evidence which is said to be in accord with such a consensus of opinion. Athena Products, Ltd., P.S. Docket No. 7/99 (Initial Decision, August 8, 1980, decision now on appeal); Standard Research, P.S. Docket No. 7/78 (Initial Decision, December 18, 1979); Standard Research, P.S. Docket No. 7/48 (Initial Decision, August 31, 1979); Modern Age Products, Inc., P.S. Docket No. 5/102 (P.S. Decision, June 29, 1977; Initial Decision, April 6, 1977); Nutrient Laboratories, P.S. Docket No. 5/48 (Initial Decision, November 17, 1976). 12. The views and opinions expressed by Complainant's witnesses are in accord with the consensus of informed scientific and medical opinion. 13. There was no claim that the views and opinions of Respondent's witnesses were in conformity with the consensus of informed scientific and medical opinion. 14. In the last paragraph of Respondent's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law it is suggested that there is a diversity of opinion among the medical experts which precludes the issuance of a mail-stop order in this matter. Without question there is a division of the opinions of the doctors called as witnesses by the respective parties. When, however, consideration is given to the qualifications of the witnesses, their obvious knowledge, or lack thereof, concerning the action within and by the digestive system on the ingredients of the product involved herein, the interest of the witnesses, and other matters which are weighed in determining authenticity of evidence and credibility of witnesses, the conclusion is inescapable that the clear and decisive preponderance of the evidence is on the side of Complainant. 15. The falsity of Respondent's representations has been established by the preponderance of the competent, credible evidence. 16. Respondent's offer of a refund to dissatisfied purchasers does not overcome the effects of the making of false sales representations. Borg-Johnson Electronics v. Christenberry, U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y., 169 F. Supp. 746, 751 (1959) CONCLUSIONS OF LAW1. The foregoing Findings of Fact are incorporated herein by reference as Conclusions of Law. 2. Upon the basis of the entire record it is concluded as a matter of law that Respondent is engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mails by means of materially false representations within the meaning of 39 U. S. Code 3005. Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by the parties have been fully considered, and to the extent indicated herein, they have been adopted. Otherwise, such proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are rejected for the reason that they are unsupported by or contrary to the evidence or because of their immateriality. Accordingly, an order of the type authorized by Section 3005 of Title 39, United States Code, substantially in the form attached, should be issued against this Respondent.

Stephen Barrett, M.D. Each of the following approaches has at least one of the following characteristics: (1) its rationale or underlying theory has no scientific basis, (2) it has not been demonstrated safe and/or effective by well-designed studies, (3) it is deceptively promoted, or (4) its practitioners are not qualified to make appropriate diagnoses. This article covers traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, clinical ecology, colonic irrigation, craniosacral therapy, herbalism, iridology, macrobiotics, naturopathy, [aromatherapy](aroma.html), [chelation called \"Oriental medicine\" or \"traditional Chinese medicine (TCM),\" encompasses a vast array of folk medical practices based on mysticism. It holds that the body's vital energy (chi or qi) circulates through 14 hypothetical channels, called meridians, that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions. Illness is attributed to imbalance or interruption of chi. Ancient practices such as [acupuncture](acu.html) and Qigong are claimed to restore balance by removing the interruptions. Traditional acupuncture, as now practiced, involves the insertion of stainless steel needles into various body areas. A low-frequency current may be applied to the needles to produce greater stimulation. Acupressure (shiatsu) is a technique that uses finger pressure instead of needles. Some states restrict the use of acupuncture to physicians or persons operating under the direct supervision of physicians, while others permit laypersons to practice without medical supervision. The treatment is applied to \"acupuncture points,\" which are said to be located throughout the body. Originally there were 365 such points, corresponding to the days of the year, but the number identified by proponents during the past 2,000 years has increased gradually to over 2,000 [1]. Some practitioners place needles at or near the site of disease, while others select points on the basis of symptoms. In traditional acupuncture a combination of points is usually used. However, the existence of \"meridians,\" \"acupuncture points,\" or chi has never been scientifically validated. Some acupuncturists reject Chinese medicine's trappings and postulate that pain relief occurs through mechanisms such as the production of endorphins (chemicals similar to narcotics). Although acupuncture may relieve pain, such relief tends to be short-lived. The evidence supporting claims that acupuncture is effective consists mostly of practitioners' observations and poorly designed studies. Acupuncture has not been proven to influence the course of any organic disease. The adverse effects of acupuncture are probably related to the nature of the practitioner's training. A survey of 1,135 Norwegian physicians revealed 66 cases of infection, 25 cases of punctured lung, 31 cases of increased pain, and 80 other cases with complications. A parallel survey of 197 acupuncturists, who are more apt to see immediate complications, yielded 132 cases of fainting, 26 cases of increased pain, 8 cases of pneumothorax, and 45 other adverse results [2]. However, a 5-year study involving 76 acupuncturists at a Japanese medical facility tabulated only 64 adverse event reports (including 16 forgotten needles and 13 cases of transient low blood pressure) associated with 55,591 acupuncture treatments. No serious complications were reported.The researchers concluded that serious adverse reactions are uncommon among acupuncturists who are medically trained [3]. Qigong is also claimed to influence the flow of vital energy. Internal Qigong involves deep breathing, concentration, and relaxation techniques used by individuals for themselves. External Qigong is performed by \"Qigong masters\" who claim to cure a wide variety of diseases with energy released from their fingertips. However, scientific investigators of Qigong masters in China have found no evidence of paranormal powers and some evidence of deception. Investigators have observed, for example, that a patient lying on a table about eight feet from a Qigong master moved rhythmically or thrashed about as the master moved his hands. But when she was placed where she could no longer see him, her movements were unrelated to his. The diagnostic process used by TCM practitioners may include questioning (medical history, life-style), observations (skin, tongue, color), listening (breath sounds), and pulse-taking. Medical science recognizes only one pulse, corresponding to the heartbeat, which can be felt in the wrist, neck, feet, and various other places throughout the body. TCM practitioners check six alleged pulses at each wrist and identify more than twenty-five alleged pulse qualities such as \"sinking,\" \"slippery,\" \"soggy,\" \"tight,\" and \"wiry.\" TCM's \"pulses\" supposedly reflect the type of imbalance, the condition of each organ system, and the status of the patient's \"chi.\" The herbs prescribed by Chinese medicine practitioners in the United States are not regulated for safety, potency, or effectiveness. There is also the risk that an acupuncturist whose approach to diagnosis is not based on scientific concepts will fail to diagnose a dangerous condition. The National Council Against Health Fraud has concluded: (a) acupuncture is an unproven modality of treatment, (b) its theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge, (c) research during the past 20 years has not demonstrated that acupuncture is effective against any disease, (d) perceived effects of acupuncture are probably due to a combination of expectation, suggestion, counter-irritation, conditioning, and other psychologic mechanisms, (e) the use of acupuncture should be restricted to appropriate research settings, (f) insurance companies should not be required by law to cover acupuncture treatment, (g) licensure of lay acupuncturists should be phased out, and (8) consumers who wish to try acupuncture should discuss their situation with a knowledgeable physician who has no commercial interest [4]. [Ayurvedic medicine](../../04ConsumerEducation/chopra.html) is set of practices promoted by proponents of transcendental meditation (TM). Ayurveda (meaning \"life knowledge\") is a traditional Indian approach that includes meditation, \"purification\" procedures, rejuvenation therapies, herbal and mineral preparations, exercises and dietary advice based on \"body type.\" Its origin is traceable to four Sanskrit books called the Vedas \u2014 the oldest and most important scriptures of India, shaped sometime before 200 BCE. These books attributed most disease and bad luck to demons, devils, and the influence of stars and planets. Ayurveda's basic theory states that the body's functions are regulated by three \"irreducible physiological principles\" whose Like the \"sun signs\" of astrology, these terms are used to designate body types as well as the traits that typify them. Like astrologic writings, ayurvedic writings contain long lists of supposed physical and mental characteristics of each constitutional type. Through various combinations of vata, pitta, and kapha, ten body types are possible. However, one's doshas (and therefore one's body type) can vary from hour to hour and season to season. Ayurvedic proponents claim that the symptoms of disease are always related to \"imbalance\" of the doshas, which can be determined by feeling the patient's wrist pulse or completing a questionnaire. Some proponents claim that the pulse can be used to detect diabetes, cancer, musculoskeletal disease, asthma, and \"imbalances at early stages when there may be no other clinical signs and when mild forms of intervention may suffice.\" \"Balance\" is supposedly achieved through a multitude of procedures and products, many of which are said to be specific for specific body types. The full Maharishi Ayur-Ved program for \"creating healthy individuals and a disease-free society\" has 20 components: development of higher states of consciousness through advanced meditation techniques, use of primordial sounds, correction of \"the mistake of the intellect,\" strengthening of emotions, Vedic structuring of language, music therapy, enlivening of the senses, pulse diagnosis, psychophysiological integration, neuromuscular integration, neurorespiratory integration, purification (to remove \"impurities due to faulty diet and behavioral patterns\"), dietary measures, herbal food supplements, other herbal preparations, daily behavioral routines, prediction of future imbalances, religious ceremonies, nourishing the environment, and promoting world health and world peace. Most of these cost several hundred dollars, but some cost thousands and require the services of an ayurvedic practitioner TM is a technique in which the meditator sits comfortably with eyes closed and mentally repeats a Sanskrit word or sound (mantra) for 15 to 20 minutes, twice a day. It is alleged to help people think more clearly, improve their memory, recover immediately from stressful situations, reverse their aging process, and enjoy life more fully. Proponents also claim that \"stress is the basis of all illness\" and that TM is \"the single most effective thing you can do to improve all aspects of health and to increase inner happiness and learning ability.\" Deepak Chopra, M.D., a leading ayurveda proponent, claims that \"If you have happy thoughts, then you make happy molecules. On the other hand, if you have sad thoughts, and angry thoughts, and hostile thoughts, then you make those molecules which may depress the immune system and make you more susceptible to disease.\" Chopra promises \"perfect health\" to those who can harness their consciousness as a healing force. Meditation may temporarily relieve stress \u2014 as would many types of relaxation techniques \u2014 but the rest of these claims have no scientific basis. [Clinical ecology](mcs.html), which proponents also misrepresent as \"environmental medicine,\" is not a recognized medical specialty. It is based on the notion that multiple common symptoms are triggered by hypersensitivity to common foods and chemicals. Proponents typically suggest that the immune system is like a barrel that continually fills with chemicals until it overflows, signaling the presence of disease. However, some also say that \"immune system dysregulation\" can be triggered by a single serious episode of infection, stress, or chemical exposure. Potential stressors include practically everything that modern humans encounter, such as urban air, diesel exhaust, tobacco smoke, fresh paint or tar, organic solvents and pesticides, certain plastics, newsprint, perfumes and colognes, medications, gas used for cooking and heating, building materials, permanent press and synthetic fabrics, household cleaners, rubbing alcohol, felt-tip pens, cedar closets, tap water, and electromagnetic forces. Clinical ecologists typically base their diagnoses on \"provocation-neutralization\" testing. In this test, the patient reports symptoms that develop within ten minutes after various concentrations of suspected substances are administered under the tongue or injected into the skin. If any symptoms occur, the test is considered positive and lower concentrations are given until a dose is found that \"neutralizes\" the symptoms. Treatment requires avoidance of suspected substances and involves lifestyle changes that can range from minor to extensive. Generally, patients are instructed to modify their diet and to avoid such substances as scented shampoos; after-shave products; deodorants; cigarette smoke; automobile exhaust fumes; and clothing, furniture, and carpets that contain synthetic fibers. Extreme restrictions can involve staying at home for months or avoiding physical contact with family members. In many cases the patient's life becomes centered around the illness. Researchers at the University of California have demonstrated that provocation- neutralization testing is not valid. In a double-blind study, each of 18 patients received three injections of suspected food extracts and nine of dilute salt water over a three-hour period. The tests were carried out in the offices of proponents who had been treating the patients. In nonblinded tests, these patients had consistently reported symptoms when exposed to food extracts and no symptoms when given salt-water injections. But during the experiment, the patients reported as many symptoms following one type of injection as they did after the other, indicating that their symptoms were nothing more than placebo reactions. The symptoms included itching of the nose, watery or burning eyes, plugged ears, a feeling of fullness in the ears, ringing ears, dry mouth, scratchy throat, an odd taste in the mouth, fatigue, headache, nausea, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, tingling of the face or scalp, tightness or pressure in the head, disorientation, difficulty breathing, depression, chills, coughing, nervousness, intestinal gas or rumbling, and aching legs. Clinical ecologists also claim that \"neutralizing\" doses of offending allergens can relieve the patient's symptoms. However, the patients who were treated during the experiment had equivalent responses to extracts and salt water [5]. The American Academy of Allergy and Immunology (AAAI), the nation's largest professional organization of allergists, has warned: Although the idea that the environment is responsible for a multitude of health problems is very appealing, to present such ideas as facts, conclusions, or even likely mechanisms without adequate support, is poor medical practice [6]. [Colonic irrigation](gastro.html) \u2014 also called colon hydrotherapy \u2014 is typically performed by passing a rubber tube into the rectum for a distance of up to 20 or 30 inches. Warm water is pumped in and out through the tube, a few pints at a time, typically using 20 or more gallons. Some practitioners add herbs, coffee, or other substances to the water. The procedure is said to \"detoxify\" the body. Its advocates claim that, as a result of intestinal stasis, intestinal contents putrefy, and toxins are formed and absorbed, which causes chronic poisoning of the body. This \"autointoxication\" theory was popular around the turn of the century but was abandoned by the scientific community during the 1920s. No such \"toxins\" have ever been identified, and careful observations have shown that individuals in good health can vary greatly in bowel habits. Proponents may also suggest that fecal material collects on the lining of the intestine and causes trouble unless removed by laxatives, colonic irrigation, special diets, and/or various herbs or food supplements that \"cleanse\" the body. The falsity of this notion is obvious to doctors who perform intestinal surgery or peer within the large intestine with a diagnostic instrument. Fecal material does not adhere to the intestinal lining. Colonic irrigation is not only therapeutically worthless but can cause fatal electrolyte imbalance [7]. Cases of death due to intestinal perforation and infection (from contaminated equipment) have also been reported [8-10]. Craniosacral therapy, also called craniopathy and cranial osteopathy, is based on the notion that bones of the skull are moveable and can be manipulated. Some practitioners claim to attune themselves to the patient's \"rhythm\" while holding the patient's skull in their hands. Some claim to improve the flow of \"life energy,\" thereby curing or preventing a wide variety of health problems. Some claim to remove blockages to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Some claim to realign the skull bones. Actually, the bones of the skull fuse early in life and cannot be moved independently. Herbalism is practiced mainly by naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, iridologists, and unlicensed \"herbalists,\" many of whom prescribe herbs for virtually every health problem. While some attempt to base their prescriptions on research findings, others are guided by such perceptions as \"astrological influences\" and the \"Doctrine of Signatures\" (the ancient belief that the form and shape of a drug source determine its therapeutic value). Many herbs contain hundreds or even thousands of chemicals that have not been completely catalogued. While some of these may turn out to be useful as therapeutic agents, others could well prove toxic. Most herbal products sold in the United States are not standardized, which means that determining the exact amounts of their ingredients can be difficult or impossible. With safe and effective medicines available, treatment with herbal products makes little sense. Moreover, many herbal practitioners are not physicians and lack adequate training in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. [Iridology](iridology.html) is based on the notion that each area of the body is represented by a corresponding area in the iris of the eye (the colored area surrounding the pupil). Iridologists claim that states of health and disease can be diagnosed according to the color, texture, and location of various pigment flecks in the eye. Iridology practitioners purport to diagnose \"imbalances\" and treat them with vitamins, minerals, herbs, and similar products. They may also claim that the eye markings can reveal a complete history of past illnesses as well as previous treatment. Most iridology practitioners are chiropractors and naturopaths, but laypersons who do \"nutrition counseling\" also are involved. Bernard Jensen, D.C., the leading American iridologist, states that \"Nature has provided us with a miniature television screen showing the most remote portions of the body by way of nerve reflex responses.\" He also claims that iridology analyses are more reliable and \"offer much more information about the state of the body than do the examinations of Western medicine.\" However, in two large studies, Jensen and seven other prominent iridologists could not distinguish between patients who had kidney or gallbladder disease and those who were healthy. Nor did they agree with each other about which was which [11,12]. This is not surprising, because there is no known way that body organs could be represented at specific locations in the iris. Macrobiotics is a quasireligious approach centered around a semivegetarian diet claimed to improve health and prolong life. Proponents suggest that the diet is effective in preventing and treating cancer, AIDS, and other serious diseases. There is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Macrobiotic proponents base their recommendations for foods on the amount of \"yin\" or \"yang\" (alleged \"energy modes\") rather than nutrient content. Macrobiotic practitioners may base their recommendations on pulse diagnosis and other unscientific procedures related to Chinese medicine. These include influences\" and and \"spiritual diagnosis\" (an evaluation of \"atmospheric vibrational conditions\" to identify spiritual influences, including memories and \"visions of the future\"). The leading proponent has been Michio Kushi, founder and president of the Kushi Institute in Brookline, Massachusetts. According to Institute publications, the macrobiotic way of life should include chewing food at least 50 times per mouthful (or until it becomes liquid), not wearing synthetic or woolen clothing next to the skin, avoiding long hot baths or showers, having large green plants in your house to enrich the oxygen content of the air, and singing a happy song every day. Kushi claims that cancer is largely due to improper diet, thinking, and way of life, and can be influenced by changing these factors. He recommends \"yin foods\" for cancers due to excess yang, and \"yang foods\" for tumors that are predominantly yin. His books contain case histories of people whose cancers have supposedly disappeared after they adopted macrobiotic eating. However, the only reports of efficacy are testimonials by patients, many of whom received conventional cancer therapy. The diet itself can cause cancer patients to undergo serious weight loss [13]. Some versions of macrobiotic diets contain adequate amounts of nutrients, but others do not. Studies of children living in several macrobiotic communities have found that they tended to be smaller, shorter, and to weigh less than children fed normal diets. Deficiencies of vitamin B12, iron, and vitamin D have also been reported. [Naturopathy](Naturopathy/naturopathy.html) is based on the belief that the cause of disease is violation of nature's laws. Naturopaths claim to remove the underlying causes of disease and to stimulate the body's natural healing processes. They state that diseases are the body's effort to defend itself and that cures result from increasing the patient's \"vital force\" by ridding the body of waste products and \"toxins.\" Like some chiropractors, many naturopaths believe that virtually all ailments fall within the scope of their practice. Naturopathic treatments can include \"natural food\" diets, vitamins, herbs, tissue minerals, cell salts, manipulation, massage, exercise, diathermy, colonic enemas, acupuncture, and homeopathy. Although naturopaths claim that they stress prevention of disease, they tend to oppose immunization procedures. Natural hygiene is an offshoot of naturopathy that emphasizes fasting; a raw-food diet of vegetables, fruits, and nuts; and food-combining, a dietary practice based on the incorrect notion that certain food combinations can cause or correct ill health. Natural hygienists oppose immunization, fluoridation, and food irradiation and eschew most forms of medical treatment. [Orthomolecular therapy](ortho.html) is defined by its proponents as \"the treatment of disease by varying the concentrations of substances normally present in the human body.\" It dates back to the early 1950s when a few psychiatrists began adding massive doses of nutrients to their treatment of severe mental problems. The original substance was vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or nicotinamide), and the therapy was termed \"megavitamin therapy.\" Later the treatment regimen was expanded to include other vitamins, minerals, hormones, and diets, any of which may be combined with conventional drug therapy and electroshock treatments. A few hundred physicians now use this approach to treat a wide variety of conditions, both mental and physical. The human body has limited capacity to use vitamins in its metabolic activities. When vitamins are consumed in excess of the body's physiological needs, they function as drugs rather than vitamins. A few situations exist in which high doses of vitamins are known to be beneficial, but they must still be used with caution because of potential toxicity. For example, large doses of niacin can be very useful as part of a comprehensive, medically supervised program for controlling abnormal blood cholesterol levels. \"Orthomolecular\" practitioners go far beyond this, however, by prescribing large amounts of supplements to all or most of the patients they treat. [Reflexology,](reflex.html) also called zone therapy, is based on beliefs that each body part is represented on the hands and feet and that pressing on specific areas on the hands or feet can have therapeutic effects in other parts of the body. Proponents claim that the body is divided into ten zones that begin or end in the hands and feet, and that each organ or body part is \"represented\" on the hands and feet. Proponents also claim that abnormalities can be diagnosed by feeling the feet and that pressing each area can stimulate the flow of energy, blood, nutrients, and nerve impulses to the corresponding body zone. The pathways postulated by reflexologists have not been anatomically demonstrated. Most reflexologists claim that their foot massages can relieve stress, which presumably is correct but does not require the services of a \"certified reflexologist\" for $35 to $100 per session. Many practitioners claim foot reflexology can cleanse the body of toxins, increase circulation, assist in weight loss, and improve the health of organs throughout the body. Some claim that reflexology is effective against a large number of serious diseases. There is no scientific support for these assertions. [Therapeutic touch](tt.html) is a method in which the hands are used to \"direct human energies to help or heal someone who is ill.\" Proponents claim that healers can detect and correct \"energy imbalances\" by stroking the body or placing their hands above the afflicted part. Healing supposedly can result from a transfer of \"excess energy\" from healer to patient. Neither the forces involved nor the alleged therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated by scientific testing [14]. It is safe to assume that any reactions to the procedure are psychological responses to the \"laying on of hands.\" A recent study of 21 TT practitioners found no evidence that they could actually detect a human energy field.\" [14] References - Skrabanek P.

AMNews, June 7, 2004] FTC hits two more infomercials. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has charged the marketers of \"Supreme Greens with MSM\" and \"Coral Calcium Daily\" with falsely claiming that their products can prevent and cure cancer and other diseases. The FTC's complaint states that Boston-area marketers Direct Marketing Concepts, Inc., ITV Direct, Inc., and Donald Barrett, along with their business partners, California corporations Healthy Solutions, LLC and Health Solutions, Inc., and their principals Alejandro Guerrero (a.k.a. Alex Guerrero), Michael Howell, and Greg Geremesz; and Wayne, Pennsylvania-based Triad ML Marketing, Inc., King Media, Inc., and Allen Stern, have sold \"Supreme Greens with MSM\" and \"Coral Calcium Daily\" to consumers through two widely-aired infomercials. The infomercial for Supreme Greens promoted it as a means to treat, cure, and prevent cancer and other diseases, and to cause significant weight loss. The infomercial for Coral Calcium Daily touted it as a means to treat and cure cancer and other diseases and as a superior form of calcium based on its purported bioavailability. The FTC further alleges that Direct Marketing Concepts, ITV, and Barrett failed to disclose that the infomercial promoting Supreme Greens is a paid commercial advertisement and not an independent television program, and that these defendants charged consumers' credit cards for automatic product shipments without authorization. [[Marketers of \"Supreme Greens\" and \"Coral Calcium Daily\" come under fire from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/06/dma.htm).

In addition to training our students in spinal manipulation, we also teach them how to use additional therapies, when indicated, such as nutritional advice, therapeutic exercise, physical therapy, rehabilitation, lifestyle modification, postural retraining, meridian therapy (acupuncture), and homeopathic or botanical remedies. [homeopathic remedies](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/homeo.html)) certainly do not, and , [meridian therapy](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/acu.html)is based on a delusional view of how the body works. Northwestern College of Chiropractic Doctors of chiropractic will provide care that may have a direct influence on problems or conditions (subluxations, injuries, postural problems, headaches, neck pain, lower back pain, etc. \u2014see Research, below); care that is supportive of other problems or treatments (collaborative care with other health care professionals) or care based on optimizing wellness and function based on objective findings, but when pain may not be present as a symptom. . . . Conditions or problems doctors of chiropractic may treat include: - Pediatric conditions. Research and clinical experience support chiropractic care for common pediatric conditions such as colic, recurrent otitis media, bedwetting, birth trauma, and common childhood injuries. - Postural problems. Chiropractic care can assist in correcting postural faults, including scoliosis. - Injuries and Pain. Chiropractic care can help restore normal function after injuries, and help decrease pain when it results from abnormal function and compensation. - Geriatric problems. Chiropractic can be very effective with gentle and careful care for common sources of pain and dysfunction in older adults. Chiropractic care has not been demonstrated to optimize wellness. Chiropractic research has not been proven effective against common pediatric conditions and cannot modify a scoliotic curve. Chiropractic care may alleviate some common painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults, but most dysfunctional conditions are outside of its scope. What conditions or problems are treated by homeopathy? Almost all ailments or conditions are viewed within the profession as being amenable to homeopathic treatment. Homeopathy is best known, however, for its ability to treat chronic ailments. Skin diseases, chronic gastric and intestinal disorders, chronic fatigue syndromes, migraines, asthma, allergic disorders, menstrual complaints, other hormonal disorders, arthritis, psychological disorders, and so on are viewed as being potentially improved by the application of Homeopathy. Gross structural and pathological changes are not viewed as being strongly influenced by Homeopathy. Chiropractic philosophic principles learned and applied by Northwestern graduates, include an appreciation for the natural, innate self-regulating and healing capacities of the human body, which are coordinated by the nervous system. Normalcy of body structure, especially the spine, is imperative to normal nervous system function and body system regulation. The Northwestern curriculum emphasizes the important relationships between optimal health and both structural-neural integrity and healthful living. Simply stated, oriental medicine is based on balancing the body's positive energy. The science is made up of a myriad of therapies, including acupuncture, herbal and nutritional therapy, Tui-Na/massage, acupressure, meditation and physical exercise. Acupuncture is utilized to keep the normal flow of the body's energy, between its surface and internal organs, unblocked\u2014thereby restoring physical and mental health. Palmer Chiropractic University (3 schools) Science has found that the nerve system controls all other organs and tissues of the body, so a nerve system functioning at its best facilitates the body's ability to cope with disability and disease. Because of its potential to enable patients to live healthier, more fulfilling lives, chiropractic has been called \"The Big Idea.\" The chiropractic approach to health care is holistic, stressing the patient's overall well being. It recognizes that many factors affect health, including exercise, diet, rest, environment and heredity. Chiropractic focuses on maintaining optimal health naturally so that the body is better able to resist disease, rather than simply treating the symptoms of disease. Chiropractors use natural, drugless, non-surgical health care and rely on the body's inherent recuperative abilities. The nervous system does not control all the organs and tissues of the body. Nor has chiropractic care been shown to maintain optimal health or enable the body to resist disease. The passage also falsely implies that medical care merely \"treats symptoms,\" which is not correct. . . . the science of chiropractic emphasizes the relationship between structure and function, primarily that between the spinal column and the nervous system. Implicit within this statement is the significance of the nervous system to health and the effect of the subluxation complex upon the nervous system and, therefore, the body. [Parker College of Chiropractic](http://www.parkercc.edu/about/) The College recognizes that structural and spinal subluxation syndrome has a significant relationship to somato-somatic, somatic-visceral and viscero-somatic functions of the body, . . . The wholistic health model, not the allopathic disease model, will be the main thrust. All corrective intervention will be directed toward freeing the body from nerve irritation, treating the whole patient who has a disease, not the part of the patient that is diseased, and teaching the patient how to give food to the whole body, instead of food only directed at parts of the body. Students will be taught the foundations of chiropractic as given by our founder, D. D. Palmer, that disease is caused by trauma, poison, auto suggestion as interference is identified and corrected primarily from the nervous system. The subtle bio-energies of the body may then be reestablished by various techniques as taught throughout the curriculum. No \"structural and spinal subluxation syndrome\" has been scientifically demonstrated. Most diseases are not caused by 'trauma, poison, and auto suggestion.\" Nor can chiropractic treatment \"reestablish subtle energies.\" Parker College of Chiropractic Chiropractic restores health, relieves pain and restores life with drugless, knifeless, natural, holistic methods. And much of the public, fortunately, is turning away from dangerous drugs and unnecessary surgery, to natural healing. . . . And since the nervous system controls the human body by providing the \"life force,\" the whole body may benefit; and, therefore, chiropractic care may benefit the body with almost any health conditions. Parker College of Chiropractic The Science of chiropractic is based on the innate normal function of life energy, primarily through the nervous system, which is the master system, both motor and sensory. It controls and regulates all other systems (Gray's Anatomy), and normally functions 100% quantitatively and qualitatively both motor and sensory. Even though the body is basically chemical, life itself is electrical and controls chemical. It is homogeneous, balanced and present from birth to burial. Therefore, the chiropractic Science is a PRINCIPLE. An uninterrupted PRINCIPLE always works. . . . The principles of the Science and Philosophy have been growing by research, and are being accepted by the scientific community. Hundreds of well-researched studies, books, papers and abstracts have been conducted and published extolling what is now called, among other terms, Energy Medicine. It is all based on the body's innate intelligent energy, with the nervous system being supreme. Energy not matter, electricity not chemistry, the whole not the part will undoubtedly be a leading healing paradigm of the future. But, that is where chiropractic has been for over a century, and where it better remain. Freeing energy will probably be proclaimed as the 21st century's new, and often superior, scientific paradigm for relieving pain, restoring health and prolonging life. Who practices those principles will be the issue. Today, chiropractic has evolved into a highly developed science and art which deals not with disease, but with vertebral subluxation and its effect on the body's natural striving toward health. Chiropractic, as a primary health care profession, recognizes and respects the body's innate striving to maintain its own health and has developed sophisticated techniques for correcting vertebral subluxation, a major interference to that striving. Chiropractic views health as more than the absence of disease. It is optimum life expression on every level. [The WSCC philosophy of chiropractic is based on the concept that the human body has recuperative, self-healing capabilities, and that there is a correlation between skeletal structure and optimum bodily function. The interdependence of structure and function, and the relationship between the nervous system\u2014particularly the spine\u2014and the rest of the body is the core element of WSCC's approach to healing and wellness. This indicates that the first line of intervention for conservative care is to assure biomechanical integrity, with pharmaceutical and/or more invasive care (e.g., surgery) being utilized only after conservative options have been employed.](http://www.wschiro.edu/who/who_philosophy.html) Some chiropractors are trained in a special intervention called Endonasal Technique. This technique can relieve pressure from the middle ear and facilitate drainage. Your chiropractic physician can instruct you on some things you can do to ease the symptoms and to prevent recurrence. In addition, any spinal or muscular problems,, which may be related to your symptoms, can also be treated.

[Hide Full Content](#four-thousand-one-hundred-three) [Naturopathy: A Critical Analysis](https://quackwatch.org/naturopathy/general/beyerstein/) Naturopathy is the most eclectic of \"alternative\" practices. It has changed its methods in response to popular fads and beliefs. It practices no pool of consistent diagnostic or therapeutic methods. The most notable things that unite its practitioners are a penchant for magical thinking, a weak grasp of basic science, and a rejection of scientific biomedicine, which they refer to as \"allopathy.\" Because naturopathy lacks a coherent rationale, patients can encounter anything from commonsense lifestyle advice \u2014 eating a healthy diet, rest, exercise, and stress reduction \u2014 to an array of scientifically implausible nostrums and gadgets [1]. If a glue binds the diverse and changing patchwork of naturopathic practices together, it is espousal of the teachings of the early nineteenth-century romantic movement known as Naturphilosophie. ... Naturopathy is the most eclectic of \"alternative\" practices. It has changed its methods in response to popular fads and beliefs. It practices no pool of consistent diagnostic or therapeutic methods. The most notable things that unite its practitioners are a penchant for magical thinking, a weak grasp of basic science, and a rejection of scientific biomedicine, which they refer to as \"allopathy.\" Because naturopathy lacks a coherent rationale, patients can encounter anything from commonsense lifestyle advice \u2014 eating a healthy diet, rest, exercise, and stress reduction \u2014 to an array of scientifically implausible nostrums and gadgets [1]. If a glue binds the diverse and changing patchwork of naturopathic practices together, it is espousal of the teachings of the early nineteenth-century romantic movement known as Naturphilosophie. The central tenet of this movement affected the romantic poets and artists of the era and some noted scientists as well \u2014 that there is a single unifying force underlying the entirety of nature, one that steers all of its parts into a harmonious and indivisible whole [2]. Much like the concept of \"Qi\" in Chinese philosophy and medicine, this mystical force is said to permeate all living things. Believers in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) assert that imbalances in the flow of Qi are responsible for disease, fatigue, etc., and that that balance between yin and yang variants of Qi is essential to health. Acupuncture, Chinese herbs, etc., supposedly restore well-being by rebalancing the flow of this spiritual essence [3]. Naturopaths explain what they do by resorting to similar metaphorical usages of the terms \"balance,\" \"harmony,\" and \"flow,\" which in the final analysis boil down to synonyms for \"good\" and have no science-based meaning. The similarities of their theories may explain why TCM is taught in naturopathic colleges. A corollary of Naturphilosophie is that in order to comprehend nature one must experience it as a whole \u2014 i.e., intuitively rather than objectively and analytically. Openness to one's subjective feelings is considered the most reliable means of revealing the workings of the natural world. Not surprisingly, then, naturopathy has been quick to ally itself with the \"holistic health\" movement. This emphasis on \"holism\" helps explain the apparent indifference and/or antipathy of most naturopaths to objective, scientific research. Naturopathy views sickness as a generalized breakdown of the body in response to \"unnatural\" events in the enviroment that can be remedied by overall strengthening of the body's resistance. This clashes with scientific biomedicine's view that disease is a malfunction due to specific pathogens or processes that involve identifiable organ systems. Biomedicine tailors its treatments to the system and pathologic processes that are involved, whereas naturopathy claims to \"treat the whole person.\" Although naturopathy uses scientific terms and assumes some of the trappings of science, it exhibits more features of pseudoscience [4] and has magical and quasi-religious roots [5]. Its claim that healing stems from a supernatural \"life force\" is much like the abandoned principle from prescientific biology known as elan vitale [6]. Biologists once believed that a force that distinguished living from inanimate matter was derived from a cosmos whose natural order was governed by moral laws \u2014 as opposed to the mechanistic ones of modern science. For proponents of naturopathy, \"natural laws\" are not generalizations from observation and experimentation, but seem to be the moralistic dictates of an anthropomorphic \"Nature\" \u2014 usually capitalized to emphasize its purposeful, theistic properties. They also postulate that health is awarded or withdrawn in accordance with one's ability to maintain harmony and balance with the animistic, vital forces of the universe. In committing itself to vitalism, naturopathy puts bodily functions outside the realm of physics, chemistry, and physiology. This is apparent in the following excerpt from the writings of Harvey Diamond, an advocate of the \"Natural Hygiene\" movement: \"The true cause of impaired health lies in our failure to comply with the laws and requirements of life. All health problems arise from the abuse of natural laws. . . . Living healthfully is not an art that we must learn, it is an instinctive way of life to which we must return!\" [5:98] From Where Did Naturopathic Dictates Arise? Just as naturopathy reflects the nineteenth-century romanticism from which it sprang, the latter in turn bears the imprint of an older tradition of the ancient Greek mystery cults and the teachings of the pre-Socratic philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenedes [7]. Their descendants inspired the \"counterculture\" of the 1960s and 1970s with its passion for egalitarianism, naturalness, and the primitive, entwined in a narcissism that equates truth with emotion rather than reason [8]. At the same time, the humanistic psychology movement nurtured self-actualization, the wholeness of mind and body, personal responsibility for one's health, and the belief that mental conflict promotes disease. The counterculture's reaction to materialism helped revive naturopathy and other folk practices under \"holistic health\" and the New Age [9-11]. This metaphysical outlook places a trust in the fundamental goodness of the natural universe and the belief that we warrant favorable outcomes if we follow our \"natural\" inclinations. Disease is a form of hubris that descends when one trusts in reason over instincts \u2014 one gravitates to healthy choices if one follows one's intuition. Naturopathy also asserts that a \"vital curative force\" (which naturopaths confuse with what the Hippocratics called vis medicatrix naturae) flows through vaguely conceptualized channels akin to the \"meridians\" of TCM. Impedance, or \"unbalancing\" the flow of this force, can cause disease. Therapy therefore consists of restoring normal flow through \"balancing,\" \"cleansing,\" or \"detoxifying\" the system. Constrictions of the vital flow can arise from such causes as \"devitalized foods,\" psychological strain, \"autointoxication\" (toxins usually entering the body through the bowel), metabolic imbalances, colon toxicity, nutrient malabsorption, and \"liver sluggishness.\" [5:102] Germs are seen not as specific disease-causing entities but as parasites that attack a weakened body that has fallen into an unbalanced condition. Since naturopaths believe that diseases spring from this common underlying cause, all sickness would be within their ability to help. How Do Naturopaths Detect Disease? Naturopathy's \"energies\" and \"vibrations\" cannot be detected by scientific instruments. Most naturopaths use unsound diagnostic and therapeutic devices based on these dubious \"life forces.\" (One that was demonstrated with pride by a prominent British Columbia naturopath whom the senior author debated on TV was a black box with different colored lights that could be shone on samples of hair, sputum, blood, etc. By reading changes in the reflected light that no one but the naturopath could see, he diagnosed the ailments of several donors. The diagnoses turned out to be uniformly wrong.) Naturopaths also defend \"applied kinesiology,\" a pseudoscientific technique for diagnosing \"toxicities\" by subjectively assessing muscle weaknesses allegedly precipitated by refined sugar, food additives, and even fluorescent overhead lighting. In the mid 1970s, an Australian government Committee of Inquiry [12] concluded that a majority of naturopaths used iridology \u2014 a diagnostic technique based on the notion that pathology anywhere in the body signals its presence through signs in the iris of the eye. We have found that most naturopaths looking for spiritual energies defend [Kirlian photography](../../../quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/kirlian.html) as a diagnostic tool. However, this process, which spiritualists have long believed allows the human aura to be photographed, has a simple, normal physical explanation \u2014 a coronal discharge is created in the gas molecules surrounding animate or inanimate objects that are placed in a high-intensity electric field. This discharge is recorded by a conventional photographic process and has not been shown to have any diagnostic value [13]. Some naturopaths rely on \"radiesthesia,\" which is a form of dowsing. The naturopath passes a pendulum around the patient's body and watches for deviations that pinpoint the site of a problem. One practitioner told us that he likes to use a capsule of an antibiotic as the weight for his pendulum because, being a \"bad substance,\" the antibiotic would \"resonate\" in proximity to diseased organs. Dowsers and radiesthesiests do not recognize the fact that their own unconscious muscle contractions ( [ideomotor action](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ideomotor.html)) move the pendulum [14]. How Do Naturopaths Treat Disease? Naturopaths state that their remedies are spiritual as well as physical. The Trinity School of Natural Health offers a Doctor of Naturopathy degree to anyone with no prerequisites on completion of 12 correspondence modules. Its promotional literature states: \"The school makes no apology for its stance on issues of faith, such as the creation and nature of man, the resurrection, eternity, or any other subject which does not lend itself to double-blind studies, scientific duplication or investigation, but are essential to the spiritual aspect of the whole person.\" The practices we encountered in our survey of the occupation ranged from the generally supportable to the improbable to the disproved. The list includes: \"natural\" herbs and nutritional supplements, biofeedback, relaxation techniques, acupuncture, cupping, and moxibustion (also borrowed [3], massage, enemas [reflexology](../../../quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/reflex.html), joint \"Rolfing\"), bioenegetics, breathwork, magnetic healing, homeopathic potions, therapeutic touch, faith healing, copper bracelets for arthritis, and various Ayurvedic and Native-American healing practices. One naturopathy home page we visited recommended wearing socks chilled with ice water to \"tone up the immune system\" and its operator admitted practicing crystal \"healing.\" These treatments and diagnostic aids are ineffective or unproved. Some naturopaths we interviewed laughed at certain items in the list but embraced others that had even less credibility. History of the Naturopathy Movement Naturopathy claims affinity with Hippocrates and medical practices of ancient Egypt. Twentieth-century naturopathy owes an even greater debt to the central European \"health-spa\" movement of the 1700s and 1800s [11]. For instance, much in present-day \"natural healing\" can be traced to a Silesian shepherd, Vincenz Priessnitz (1791-1851). In tending his flocks, Priessnitz observed that injured animals often sought out streams, then later emerged apparently improved. From this he concluded that cold water was nature's panacea. He tested water on himself and his fellow villagers, starting with sprains and bruises, then cholera and diseases of the heart, lungs, kidney, liver, and brain [5:100]. He pioneered a network of spas throughout Europe that evolved into present variants such as the German therapeutic communities known as the Kurorte. Through these institutions a German naturopath (Heilpraktiker) can offer a collection of alternative therapies (the Kur), following the natural healing philosophy of Priessnitz [15]. Like their colleagues in North America, Heilpraktikers preach \"holism\" and oppose target-oriented, pharmacologically active substances. The pleasant, often-rural surroundings of these retreats are in keeping with Priessnitz's belief in the therapeutic benefits of bucolic environments. The ancient fascination with \"taking the waters\" lives on today, as many spas continue to be situated in scenic settings whose spring waters have been extolled (some since since Roman times), somewhat paradoxically, for both their purity and their mineral contents. Different mineral springs have reputations for special efficacy with particular diseases. At the spas, mineral baths may be supplemented by group gymnastics; massage; baths suffused with rest; dietary manipulations; and hot mudpacks. In present-day Germany, the Kur movement generally promotes itself as a preventive strategy and a rehabilitative therapy that strengthens during a period of recuperation rather than as an antidote to specific diseases. During the nineteenth century, European hydrotherapy (\"the water cure\") and Naturphilosophie crossed the Atlantic to inspire figures such as Joel Shew and Russell Thacker Trall who opened a hydropathic spa in Lebanon Springs, New York, in 1845. The herbalism extolled by the European imports built on ground prepared by an earlier radical crusade for botanical medicine. It was led by Samuel Thomson, a New Englander with no formal education who taught that since all disease stemmed from loss of bodily heat, the remedy was to restore internal warmth [16]. Thomson claimed this could be accomplished either directly by clearing intestinal \"obstructions\" so digestion could produce the additional heat, or indirectly by causing perspiration. Thomson's principal ways of achieving this were the strong emetic lobelia inflata and red pepper, combined with steam and hot baths. He opposed the use of all mineral substances because, coming from the ground, they were, by definition, deadly. On the other hand, because herbs grow toward the sun, the life-giving source of heat, Thomson argued that they must refresh one's health. The followers of Thomsonism exhibited the mix of populism and anti-intellectualism that still pervades the naturopathic community today. Thomson's mistrust of orthodox credentials was expressed in his analogy: book learning is to common sense as aristocracy is to democracy and as physicians are to folk healers. We now know the ineffectiveness and harmfulness of orthodox therapeutics in the early nineteenth century. The Thomsonians' skepticism and preference for less violent alternatives to the then orthodox practices of bloodletting, blistering, and purging were not entirely unreasonable. American naturopathy also has native roots in the \"hygienic movement\" of health reformers such as Sylvester Graham in the 1830s. A Presbyterian minister, Graham preached the gospel of vegetarianism, sexual moderation, abstinence from alcohol, the virtues of fresh air and exercise, and, of course, the water cure [17]. Graham, whose \"Graham crackers\" began life as the quintessential whole-grain health food, also influenced John Harvey Kellogg, another religiously inspired health reformer who was physician to the Battle Creek Sanitarium founded by the Seventh-day Adventist prophet, Ellen G. White. There, Kellogg concocted his original cornflakes recipe as a complete vegetarian source of nutrients. During its heyday from 1840 to 1870, hydropathy, as advocated by Kellogg, was practiced at over 200 spas in the U.S. and supported several publications such as the Water Cure Journal and the Hydropathic Review. The American hygiene movement entered one of its periodic downturns upon the death of its charismatic leader Russell Trall in 1877. Hydrotherapy all but disappeared before being rejuvenated in the 1890s by disciples of another European, Sebastian Kneipp. A Bavarian Catholic priest, Kneipp rekindled enthusiasm for the water cure along with a renewed interest in herbalism and \"health foods.\" He also recommended, quite reasonably, a vigorous outdoor lifestyle. However, he also showed zeal for such \"natural\" bracers as wearing coarse homespun undergarments, running barefoot on snow, and walking on dewy grass. American naturopathy was largely regenerated through the efforts of Benedict Lust who merged Kneipp's ideology with the American hydrotherapy and natural hygiene movements [11]. Lust was a German immigrant who contracted tuberculosis, returned to Europe, and recovered after being treated by Kneipp. Lust became the great proselytizer for \"Kneippism\" in the U.S. where he was commissioned to start schools, societies, magazines, health-food stores, and sanitariums to promote the water cure. Lust purchased the name \"naturopathy\" from John Scale who had coined the term in 1895 for his own health-care system. The Naturopathic Society of America was founded by Lust in New York City in 1902 and was renamed the American Naturopathic Association (ANA) in 1919. The ANA hoped to welcome under its umbrella virtually any healer who rejected the tenets of the then emerging field of scientific biomedicine. One of the ANA's publications boasted graduates from Nature Cure, hydrotherapy, diet, chiropractic, osteopathy, mechanotherapy, neuropathy, electropathy, mental and suggestive therapeutics, schools of natural healing [11:372]. Naturopaths still use many of these methods despite lack of validating research. Because Lust lacked the charisma of the founders of the other competing \"drugless healing\" modalities \u2014 Andrew Taylor Still (osteopathy) and Daniel David Palmer (chiropractic) \u2014 he was unable to impose a uniform dogma on his followers. Despite a period of rapid growth in the 1920s and 1930s, when 25 states licensed its practice, naturopathy began to decline again in the 1940s. The American Medical Association's 1906 decision to refuse licensure to all but the graduates of colleges acceptable to its Council on Medical Education was finally taking its toll, and the numbers of naturopaths began to dwindle. Upon Lust's death in 1945, the ANA he splintered into a half dozen separate organizations. Chiropractic colleges, many of which had offered naturopathic degrees, largely discontinued the practice, and several competing naturopathic schools sprang up to fill the void, most by offering mail-order degrees. Each grafted onto the virtues of fresh air, exercise, unrefined foods, pure water, light, and herbs its own eccentricities. A number of splinter groups tried to reverse this downward drift by forming a united front under the banner of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) in 1956. Despite some successes, progress remained sluggish while scientific medicine thrived and the AMA opposed \"drugless healers\" and publicized their low educational standards and shaky scientific support. During the 1950s, the legislative rights won by earlier naturopaths were rapidly eroded. Naturopathic practice became a gross misdemeanor in the states of Tennessee and Texas and was declared unconstitutional in California, although a \"sunset law\" of 1964 permitted existing practitioners to continue. The Pacific Northwest bucked this trend, however, preserving its reputation as a sanctuary for maverick social movements and medical systems. Washington, Oregon, and the Canadian province of British Columbia continued to provide a relatively friendly environment for \"sanipracters\" as naturopaths began to call themselves. Nonetheless, naturopathy had to await maturation of holdovers from the 1960s counterculture, New Age prophets of \"naturalism,\" and \"holism\" to regain its former popularity. Today, naturopaths are licensed as independent practitioners in 13 states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington), the District of Columbia, and several Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan) and can legally practice in a few other jurisdictions. Some practitioners hold an acupuncture or chiropractic license that enables them to practice naturopathy in jurisdictions where naturopaths are not licensed. Education of Naturopaths The Doctor of Naturopathy (ND) degree is currently offered by four full-time schools of naturopathy in the United States and two in Canada. In 1956 the [National College of Naturopathic Medicine](http://www.ncnm.edu/) was established in Portland, Oregon. A number of smaller institutions and correspondence schools followed, many of them little more than for-profit \"diploma mills.\" [11] In 1978, three Seattle-based graduates of the NCNM founded the John Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine, which later became Bastyr University. The [Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences](http://www.scnm.edu/) in Scottsdale, Arizona, was founded in 1992. The [University of Bridgeport College of Natural Medicine](http://www.bridgeport.edu/naturopathy/index.html) in Bridgeport, Connecticut, began classes in 1997. According to Raso [5], most of Southwest's funding came from companies marketing dietary supplements, homeopathic remedies, and medicinal herbs. Others, such as Ulett [18], have questioned the ethics of the relationship between naturopaths and the manufacturers and distributors of these products. In the late 1970s, Bastyr received its Candidacy for Accreditation by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges, a first for any naturopathic institution. In 1987, the U.S. Secretary of Education approved the [Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME)](http://www.cnme.org/) as an accrediting board for naturopathic schools. Most education-accrediting panels assess the academic merits of the curriculum and professional competence of faculty. The Department of Education and the accrediting board, however, were and are concerned not with academic merit, but solely with \"factors such as record keeping, physical assets, financial status, makeup of the governing body, catalogue characteristics, nondiscrimination policy, and self-evaluation system.\" [5:104] A CNME application for renewal was denied in 2001, but a new application was approved in 2003. The full-time institutions typically require an undergraduate degree for admission, although not necessarily in science. Our survey of entrance requirements indicated that the minimum grade-point average for admission was quite a bit lower than that of most post-baccalaureate programs. The curricula generally include two years of basic sciences, including human anatomy and physiology, and two years of clinical naturopathy. The basic-science portions of the required curricula appear acceptable, but our investigations incline us to believe that actual delivery has improved little since the aforementioned Australian Committee of Inquiry issued its findings in 1977. After attending some of these courses in person, this committee concluded: Although the Committee found the syllabuses of many [naturopathic] colleges were reasonable in their coverage of basic biomedical sciences on paper, the actual instruction bore little relationship to the [publicized] course. . . . [Lectures were] exposition[s] of the terminology of the medical sciences, at a level of dictionary definitions, without benefit of depth or the understanding of mechanisms or the broader significance of the concepts [12:74]. Present published naturopathic curricula include the basic science courses taught during the first two years of standard biomedical training, but our discussions with graduates of these programs have revealed glaring deficiencies in their knowledge of human physiology. This is in keeping with the conclusion of the Australian investigating team that the basic science standards in the naturopathy schools were \"disappointingly low.\" [12] How else could a graduate seriously beieve that there are anatomical connections between the iris of the eye and the liver, spleen, pancreas, and other organs that meter their distress, or that \"realigning\" the bones of the skull is possible or effective? The catalog of the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine also includes such scientifically suspect offerings as homeopathy, hydrotherapy (the \"water cure\"), and \"soft tissue manipulation.\" We wonder how students at this institution, which requires three terms of college-level chemistry for admission, can fail to balk at homeopathy, whose premises are contradicted by virtually everything they were exposed to in those prerequisite courses. Literature on the Portland-based NCNM's Web page also defends homeopathy, asserting that it \"works on a subtle, yet powerful, electromagnetic level. . . to strengthen the body's healing and immune response to provide a lasting cure.\" \"Subtle\" in such contexts is a widely used euphemism for \"scientifically undetectable.\" The authors seem oblivious to the harm such a public airing of the college's ignorance of electromagnetism and immunology does to the occupation's scientific pretensions. The development of naturopathy in Canada largely parallels that in the U.S. Canadian naturopaths depended until 1978 entirely on American schools for their training [19], and Canadian naturopaths from British Columbia had helped found the American colleges in the Pacific Northwest. The first Canadian naturopathic institution, the Ontario College of Naturopathic Medicine, opened its doors in 1978. It subsequently changed its name to the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine. Initially, it required entrants to be already certified in an allied health occupation and taught its curriculum on weekends over a three-year period. A four-year, full-time program was instituted in 1983. In Canada, federal and provincial fact-finding commissions have recommended against inclusion of naturopathic services in the national medicare system, on the basis that they lack scientific merit and are so loosely defined as to preclude establishment of acceptable standards of practice [19]. It has since come to light that the responses of some naturopaths to questionnaires sent by one of these investigative bodies, the Canadian Royal Commission on Health Services, were \"corrected\" by officers of the naturopathic association before they were forwarded to the Commission. In addition, when the Canadian Naturopathic Association (CNA) learned that its members could come under personal scrutiny of the Commission, its president sent the membership a \"checklist\" for sanitizing their offices to avoid embarrassment if the commissioners came to call. The letter included the following: Does your library look professional? This is most important: these men are bookworms. Dust your books' well even if you haven't used them recently. . . Get rid of all diplomas not directly related to Naturopathic Medicine. . . The wording on your stationary should be checked. No \"quackish\" wording or claims must be made; get rid of it at once [20]. The CNA was also invited to submit a formal brief to the Royal Commission. In their submission, naturopaths supported the establishment of the government-sponsored national health-insurance program but fought for individual \"freedom of choice of any recognized, accepted method of treatment.\" Gort and Coburn characterized the supporting arguments for naturopathy as lacking cogency and pointed out that the CNA failed to satisfy the Commission's request for scientific data to support their practices. Similarly, naturopaths in testimony before an Ontario government committee disputed the efficacy of polio vaccination and attacked the concept of immunization. The then president of the Ontario Naturopathic Association was questioned about a \"radionics machine\" that had been seen in his office. He denied that such devices even exist [19]. Radionics is the present-day version of the crackpot device concocted by the maverick San Francisco doctor, Albert Abrams, in the early 1900s. Dubbed \"dean of the gadget quacks\" by the AMA, Abrams amassed a huge fortune leasing diagnostic black boxes. Cracking open one of Abrams's contraptions, his contemporary, the physicist Robert Millikan, described the useless jumble of wires and components as \"the kind of device a ten-year-old boy would build to fool an eight-year-old.\" The recommendations of the official Canadian inquests that have looked into naturopathy have all been negative, a conclusion that was reached independently by a similar committee of inquiry struck by the Australian government. On page 99 of its final report, the Australian panel concluded: \"The Committee does not recommend licensing of naturopaths as a vocational group as it considers that such licensing may give a form of official imprimatur to practices which the Committee considers to be unscientific and, at the best, of marginal efficacy.\" [12] The committee did recommend official oversight, however, to protect the unsuspecting public from scientifically questionable practitioners. Judging from the experience of one observer, when his wife was treated by an Australian naturopath, the standards of education and care did not improve among Australian NDs after the panel issued this indictment [1]. For similar reasons, naturopathy was excluded from the Canadian Medicare plan that was instituted in 1965. Instead of embarking on an effort to improve the scientific status of the profession, the Canadian Naturopathic Association opted for an extensive lobbying campaign. Its leadership recommended that members join clubs frequented by members of Parliament, take legislators to dinner, and contribute to their political coffers. The province of British Columbia has partially insured naturopathic services since 1965. We wondered how this had come about. In our interviews with naturopaths and their associations, we repeatedly asked for scientific justification for their procedures. While producing nothing of substance, many practitioners argued that the fact that the partial coverage of their services by the British Columbia Medical Services Plan must mean that the Ministry of Health finds them scientifically acceptable. Deciding to pursue this, we contacted the Ministry in Victoria in March 1997. After outlining our request for information, we were referred to an official who identified himself but preferred, understandably, to speak off-the-record. Asked why coverage was extended to some naturopathic treatments, this senior administrator said that (a) the ruling was based on political rather than scientific grounds; (b) the Ministry was unaware of any scientific research supporting naturopathy; and (c) coverage of the services had been extended in response to consumer demand and intensive lobbying by naturopaths. He also hinted that cost-saving had also been a factor, because naturopaths are compensated at a lower rate than MDs and siphon off a portion of those with vague, self-defined ailments or chronic conditions who would otherwise congest the medical services sector at a much higher cost per patient. Is Naturopathy a Pseudoscience? Bunge [4] has provided a useful checklist for recognizing pseudosciences. While naturopathy would qualify on almost all of Bunge's criteria, four are especially noteworthy. They are paraphrased in the numbered statements below. 1. Pseudosciences are stagnant, preferring to perpetuate unquestionable dogma from the past rather than progressing as new knowledge emerges from intellectual ferment, debate, internal criticism, and, above all, new research. When ideas do change in pseudosciences, they do so in a cosmetic way and usually in response to popular fashions rather than empirical research. In this electronic age, one might expect an organization's page on the World Wide Web to extol its newest theories and latest scientific breakthroughs. Visiting the Web page of the Canadian Naturopathic Education and Research Society, however, we found instead reverence for the past as, for ample, in a laudatory obituary for the late Joseph Boucher, ND. Boucher had been a member of the British Columbia Naturopathic governing body and had helped found John Bastyr College \u2014 in other words, someone who surely would have been on the cutting edge (if there were one). An internationally acclaimed spokesman for naturopathy, Boucher remained, with approval of the Web page's originators, a strong champion of the eccentric California naturopath, Stanford Claunch, whose ideas date back to the earlier part of the century. Claunch was a founder of \"polarity therapy,\" which claims that numerous diseases result when an alleged left-right electrical polarization of the body becomes disordered. This is treated by the naturopath intuitively \"synching\" with the patient's \"energy field\" and laying on of hands to correct the \"imbalance.\" Claunch also advocated \"craniosacral therapy,\" which contends that this energetic imbalance stems from misalignment of the skull bones which must be manually forced back into a healthy configuration. Ninety-five percent of the population allegedly suffers from cranial misalignment. Of course, in the adult, the cranial bones are fused and not \"adjustable.\" Moreover, no competent electrophysiologist has ever detected the electrical fields postulated by Claunch. Undaunted, his supporters still claim that movements of the cranial bones cause movements in the sacrum and vice versa, offering further avenues for therapeutic manipulation. Claunch's other major contribution was his treatise Exploding the Germ Theory, an amusing display of biological fancy, again cited with approval on the society's Web page. In 1997, after seeking better fare by contacting the Canadian Naturopathic Education and Research Society and the Bastyr University Research Department in person, we had to conclude that research from naturopaths in support of their practices is still a promissory note. They were able to point to virtually none of the core empirical findings, institutionalized review processes, refereed granting procedures, rigorous methodologies, etc., that typify a legitimate scientific enterprise. Pressed for details of the research mentioned on Bastyr University's Web page, their spokesperson, Carlo Calabrese, ND, indicated that their primary efforts to date had been surveys of user satisfaction that employed such subjective yardsticks as patients' self-ratings of their \"quality of life.\" He said a large study was under way that would survey a sample of HIV-positive patients who use \"alternative\" treatments. Because almost all were also receiving conventional biomedical care and there seemed to be little attempt to control for such confounds, it was unclear how they could determine what would cause any differences in their measures. Concerted efforts to get several other naturopathic associations to steer us to scientific research that supports their premises produced only a handful of references from legitimate journals testing the efficacy of certain herbs. There was nothing to support the associations' eccentric beliefs about nutrition or any of the fringe therapies discussed earlier. The evidence naturopaths themselves presented was almost entirely composed of anecdotes and personal testimonials. In our own search of the relevant scientific literature, we found no compelling support, but we did find other results from empirical evaluations that question the value of the \"holistic\" approach of naturopathy [21,22]. Very little naturopathic research has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. In 2003, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study which found that echinacea was no more effective than a placebo in treating children with upper respiratory infections [23]. It now appears that naturopathy's academic community can do some significant research, but how much the outcome of well-designed studies will influence naturopathy's flawed theories and irrational practices remains to be seem. 2. Pseudosciences exhibit a general outlook that countenances immaterial entities and processes and untestable hypotheses that are accepted on authority rather than on the basis of logic and empirical evidence. Radionics, polarity therapy, and therapeutic touch are a few of the naturopathic standbys that postulate immaterial \"energy\" fields that legitimate scientists cannot detect. Homeopathy, too, posits subtle \"vibrations\" to explain how pure water can \"remember\" in order to produce the effects of molecules it no longer contains. As we have seen, naturopathy is thoroughly vitalistic, riddled with unique but undetectable forces and concepts of flow and balance that cannot be empirically tested. Naturopathic \"mission statements\" we encountered typically repeatedly the \"spiritual\" nature of healing. 3. Pseudosciences are isolated from relevant areas of science that they ought to learn from and contribute to. Bogus sciences have little interaction with and are often proud of their isolation from authentic sciences whose findings bear on their claims. Pseudosciences avoid contact with disciplines with which they ought to interact on a regular basis. It is telling that naturopathy has always had to establish its own colleges to teach its philosophy and practices because no reputable institution of higher learning has been willing to issue naturopathic degrees. As we have seen, naturopaths practically never do research that could be accepted by conventional biomedical journals. Nor is the occupation affiliated with any of the academic umbrella groups (such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Learned Societies of Canada, or the British Royal Society) that promote cooperation and sharing of information among specialized disciplines. 4. Pseudosciences promote hypotheses that are contradicted by an overwhelming body of data from legitimate fields of research. Applied kinesiology, radionics, craniosacral manipulation, homeopathy, are examples of dubious practices that clash with scientific knowledge. Similarly, naturopaths, who pride themselves on being specialists in nutrition typically espouse the unfounded claims propagated by the \"health-food\" industry. Scientifically trained dietitians have documented the isolation of naturopathy from mainstream science in this regard [24,25]. The Australian commission, referred to earlier, found that naturopaths in that country were disseminating potentially dangerous nutritional advice such as the avoidance by children younger than five years old of all sources of protein. Naturopathic publications assert that \"natural\" vitamins (e.g., vitamin C from rose hips) are better for one's health than the identical molecules synthesized on the chemist's bench. A magical orientation is apparent in the oft-heard slur that manufactured vitamins must be bad because they are derived from \"coal tar.\" This is equivalent to arguing that a house constructed of recycled bricks from a brothel will be inferior to one built of bricks from a demolished church. If naturopathy is so poorly validated, why would seemingly well educated therapists and their clients accept such antiscientific approaches to medicine? There are many cognitive biases that can lead both purveyors and purchasers to think that bogus therapies are beneficial [26]. A historical tradition and habits of mind have contributed to the will to believe such practices. These include errors of causality and misattribution (thinking a treatment causes improvement because it precedes the improvement), the power of ritual (physical applications, supplement taking), and suggestion. Curiously, surveys show that naturopaths' clientele are above average in earnings, suggesting a relative advantage in education as well [19,27]. In addition, the distribution is skewed in favor of female over male clients. Conclusion Our inquiry provided naturopaths and their professional associations ample opportunity to refute the conclusions of several major commissions of inquiry that deemed their therapeutic rationale lacking in scientific credibility. None of our informants was able to convince us that the field had taken these earlier critiques to heart; in fact, few seemed to recognize that a problem still exists. Throughout, we found underestimation of the power of the placebo. At the same time, our own bibliographic searches failed to discover any properly controlled clinical trials that supported claims of naturopathy, except in a few limited areas where naturopaths' advice concurs with that of orthodox medical science. Where naturopathy and biomedicine disagree, the evidence is uniformly to the detriment of the former. We therefore conclude that clients drawn to naturopaths are either unaware of the scientific deficiencies of naturopathic practice or choose to disregard them on ideological grounds. Naturopathy seems to appeal to magical thinking in people with nostalgia for a bygone \"Golden Age\" of simplicity when things moved at a more leisurely pace \u2014 a halcyon world that probably never existed [28]. Despite the scientific shortcomings of the occupation, there continues to be considerable satisfaction among clients. In addition to benefiting from the placebo effect, many find their sociopolitical outlook nurtured by naturopaths' antiestablishment, antitechnology stance, and others find reinforcement for their faith in a benevolent, human-centered universe. Naturopaths also attract people who, for one reason or another, have been dissatisfied with their contacts with biomedicine. They appeal to people with illnesses with a strong psychosomatic component and those who have chronic conditions for which biomedicine, at present, can offer little. Naturopaths' elaborate history-taking and prolonged \"hands-on\" interactions provide the human contact and social support that, perhaps unknowingly, many of the so-called worried well are really seeking. They also cater to those with exaggerated fears of side effects of standard medical treatments. To their credit, naturopaths emphasize the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, the value of prevention, and the desirability of using the least intrusive intervention that will do the job. However, their means of achieving these ideals leave much to be desired while fostering scientific illiteracy in the process. Like most pseudoscientific systems, naturopathy offers comfort to its adherents. But comfort afforded is not truth implied. References - O'Connor G. Confidence trick.
