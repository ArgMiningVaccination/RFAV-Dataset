Mustafa, MBBS, PhD, MPH Introduction: One-third of the general public will not accept Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vac- cination but factors influencing vaccine acceptance among health care personnel (HCP) are not known. We investigated barriers and facilitators to vaccine acceptance within 3 months of regulatory approval (primary outcome) among adult employees and students at a tertiary-care, academic medical center. Methods: We used a cross-sectional survey design with multivariable logistic regression. Covariates included age, gender, educational attainment, self-reported health status, concern about COVID-19,direct patient interaction, and prior influenza immunization. Results: Of 18,250 eligible persons, 3,347 participated. Two in 5 (40.5%) HCP intend to delay (n = 1020; 30.6%) or forgo (n = 331; 9.9%) 1.21-1.65; but not age, direct patient interaction, or self-reported over- all health - were associated with vaccine acceptance in multivariable analysis. Barriers to vaccinationincluded concerns about long-term side effects (n = 1197, 57.1%), safety (n = 1152, 55.0%), efcacy (n = 777, 37.1%), risk-to-benet ratio (n = 650, 31.0%), and cost (n = 255, 12.2%). Subgroup analysis of Black respondents indicates greater hesitancy to accept vaccination (only 24.8% within 3 Many HCP to delay or refuse COVID-19 vaccination. Policymakers should impartially address concerns about safety, efcacy, side effects, risk-to-benet ratio, and cost. Further research with minority subgroups is urgently needed.

Downloaded from 2 mRNA-based vaccines by P zer/ BioNTech (BNT162b2) and 1273).5-8These ever devel- oped.2Health care personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection.9Health sys- tems -in analogy to seasonal in fluenza campaigns - have begun efforts to promote workforce COVID- 19 vaccine uptake. Recent analyses show that vac- cine acceptance may be limited among the general public as between 10% to 35% of the individuals indicate that they will not accept a COVID-19 vac-cine. 10-12COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among the general population has been associated withage, sex, race, marital status, educational attain- ment, political ideology, trust in media/health agencies/scientists, fear of COVID-19, perceived severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, level of vac- cine ef cacy, duration of vaccine protection, fre- quency of reported adverse effects, attitudes towardvaccination in general and prior in fluenza vaccina- tion. 11-17An analysis using a behavioral economics approach also showed that rapid vaccine develop-ment suppressed vaccine uptake at the same level of effectiveness. 13FDA emergency use authorization, as compared with full FDA approval, was also asso-ciated with decreased vaccine acceptance. 16 Moreover, health care worker acceptance of influenza vaccination during an in fluenza pandemic -the most analogous vaccine-preventable disease for which there is signi cant data -indicates that vaccination uptake is greater in males, physicians, nurses, full-time employees, and persons who per- ceive greater disease risk.18Mandated vaccination by health care institutions was also markedly associ-ated with in fluenza vaccination uptake (from 45% to 90%). 19 Data were lacking, however, on attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination among HCPs. Some newdata has become available while this article was under review. A survey of the French public found that HCP were more likely to accept vaccination (multivariable odds ratio 1.53). 2047 76.9% would accept vaccination and that age, gen-der, fear of COVID-19, perceived individual risk and prior in fluenza vaccination promoted vaccine uptake. 21Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, however, among HCP varies signi cantly by geo- graphic location.22For example, in a survey of 613 HCPs in the Democratic Republic of Congo, only 27.7% would accept COVID-19 vaccination, andvaccination was promoted by male sex and physi- cian (vs non-physician) job role.23An online survey of 1205 nurses in Hong Kong indicated that 63% intended to accept COVID-19 vaccination; inter- estingly, this exceeded the rate of in fluenza vaccine uptake (49%).24In a separate study by the same research group, vaccine acceptance among HongKong nurses was positively associated with private sector employment, chronic medical problems, encounters with known or suspected COVID-19 patients, and prior in fluenza vaccination. 25Here, we evaluated HCP willingness to become vacci- nated against COVID-19 and identi ed barriers/ facilitators to vaccine uptake among all personnel ata large academic medical center in the Midwest United States. Methods Study Population and Survey Implementation Anonymous, electronic surveys in English were e- mailed to approximately 18,250 employees, faculty, and students at the University of Kansas Medical Center (comprising the ambulatory clinics and>750-bed hospital of the University of Kansas Health System; and the Schools of Medicine,Nursing and Health Professions) between August 14, 2020, and August 28, 2020. Individuals under the age of 18 years were excluded. Participants inthe health system were sent e-mails through the health system 's Corporate Communication division using internal e-mail lists. Participants in the uni-versity were e-mailed through broadcast e-mails to the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and HealthProfessions. Participants completed the survey elec- tronically through the REDCap survey plat- form. 26,27Two invitations were sent: an initial invitation and a reminder 1 week later. All medicalcenter personnel were included in our de nition of \"health care personnel \"and invited to participate. Potential respondents therefore comprised a widerange of clinical and non-clinical roles: for example, physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, re- spiratory therapists, front-desk staff, dietary staff,administrative staff, university research staff, and other personnel. Our prespeci ed hypotheses were that (1) most health care personnel would accept vaccination, (2) safety concerns would be the predominant barrier to vaccination uptake among those delaying vacci- nation, (3) job responsibilities involving direct doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200541 Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination Among Personnel 499copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from patient interaction would facilitate vaccine accep- tance, and (4) that educational attainment would beassociated with vaccine acceptance. Survey content was developed by the principal investigator and research team, based on a review of the literature of similar published studies, 11-17to interrogate these hypotheses and control for relevant covariables. Adraft of the surveys was discussed with stakeholders within the health system, university, and localcounty health department for comment. After incorporating feedback, these same stakeholders piloted the survey before the wide distribution of the survey. Measures Surveys queried participant intention to become vaccinated against COVID-19 following regulatory approval by the FDA (within the rst month of ap- proval, 1 to 3 months after approval, 4 to 6 monthsafter approval, 7 to 12 months after approval, more than 12 months after approval, or never). Early ac-ceptance of COVID-19 vaccination (primary out- come) was de ned as the intention to receive vaccination within 3 months of regulatory approval.Participants were considered to delay -but not forgo -vaccination if they planned to obtain the vaccination at least 3 months after approval. Barriers to vaccination were assessed among partici-pants planning to delay ( >3 months) or forgo vacci- nation. Self-reported health status, level of concernabout COVID-19, prior diagnosis of COVID-19, prior positive antibody testing, participation in ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials, job responsibil- ity involving direct patient interaction and in caring for patients with known COVID-19, clinical role,influenza immunization in the 2019 to 2020 season and demographic parameters (age, sex, race, ethnic-ity, and educational attainment) were also collected. To assess for response bias, aggregate demo- graphics of the entire eligible population were esti- mated from employee and student records obtained from the Health System Human Resources depart-ment and University Of ce of Enterprise Analytics (Appendix Table 1). Age data were collected on the survey in catego- ries (ie, 18 to 24 years, 24 to 29 years, 30 to 34 years,etc.). In the regression model, age was centered to the median of the respective category (eg, 30 to 34 years was modeled as 32 years). History of in flu- enza vaccination and job responsibilities involvingdirect patient interaction were dichotomous andused directly without any 7respondents (0.2%) reported \"other \"sex, which was treated as missing data in the regressionbecause of its extreme infrequency. Concern about COVID-19 infection was collected on a 5-point Likert scale (extremely, moderately, somewhat, slightly, not at all) and was dichotomized between extreme/moderately and somewhat/slight/not at all.Self-reported health was also collected on a 5-point Likert scale (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor), following Ware and colleagues, 28and was dichotom- ized between very good or better and good or worse.Finally, educational attainment was collected on a 6- point Likert scale (some high school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate, Master 's degree and Doctoral/Professional degree) and wasdichotomized between college graduate or less andMaster 's degree or greater. Dichotomization was undertaken to minimize the number of free modelparameters and because nonlinear effects were not expected within a level of concern about COVID-19, self-reported health status, and educational attain- ment. For example, we hypothesized, dichotomously, that persons with greater concern would be morelikely to accept vaccination than a person with less concern. We did not expect, a priori, a nonlinear effect such as persons who were \"extremely \"and \"slightly \"concerned might both have high accep- tance, but persons \"moderately \"concerned to have low acceptance). Statistical Analysis Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression modeling was conducted using R version 3.6.1 (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Vaccine ac- ceptance was modeled as a function of (1) age, (2)sex, (3) history of in fluenza vaccination in the 2019 to 2020 season, (4) job responsibility involvingdirect patient interaction, (5) concern about COVID-19 infection, (6) self-reported health, and (7) educational attainment. These independent var- iables were chosen because of their association with vaccine acceptance in prior analyses (gender, infl u- enza vaccination, concern about COVID-19, edu-cational attainment), 11-18or because an effect was plausibly expected among health care personnel as determined by our multidisciplinary research team (eg, we hypothesized that persons involved in direct patient interaction would be more likely to accept vaccination due to their greater risk of potential 500JABFM May -June 2021 Vol. 34 No. 3 http://www.jabfm.orgcopyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Odds ratios, 95% con dence intervals (CI), and 2-sided Pvalues were calculated for each variable. Of the 3347 surveys completed, 3292 (98.4%) had complete data records concerning the 8 regres-sion variables. The 55 records (1.6%) that were missing data elements were excluded from the regression analysis. Demographic characteristics ofrecords with missing data elements are shown in Appendix Table 2. Multicollinearity among predic- tor variables was excluded through the calculation of the variance in flation factor (VIF) for each vari- able. The maximal VIF was 1.11, indicating that multicollinearity was not signi cantly in fluencing the model t. Sensitivity analyses to control for the impact of (1) selecting different dichotomization thresholds, (2) discretizing age, or (3) including race in the regression model were also conducted.Post hoc exploratory subgroup analyses were per- formed for Black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents, who responded less frequently than expected based on their estimated prevalence among the eligible population. Human Subjects Projection The University of Kansas Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved this study.Informed consent was obtained through explana- tory text at the beginning of the survey that indi- cated its purpose, time commitment ( <5 minutes), anonymity, voluntary nature, and absence of signi - cant personal bene ts or risks. Participants were advised that participation or nonparticipation would not impact academic or employee perform- ance evaluations. All participants were gainfully employed or engaged in higher educational activ- ities at the Medical Center. Their decisionalcapacity to consent was presumed due to their cog- nitive capacity to carry out these activities. Results Approximately 18,250 survey invitations were sentand 3,347 individuals participated (18.3% response rate). Demographic features of respondents aresummarized in Table 1. Demographics of respond- ents are compared with the entire eligible popula- tion in Appendix Table 1. Most participants (n = 2453; 74.4%) had a job role involving clinical responsibilities, which were widely distributedbetween numerous clinical roles (Table 1). About half (n = 1823; 54.5%) had roles involving directpatient interactions, of which 807 persons (44.5% of those with direct patient interactions) had inter- acted with a patient known to have COVID-19 (data not shown). Very few respondents had prior diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 54; 1.6%) or positive antibody test (n = 13, 0.4%). A small fraction of respondents (n = 38; 1.1%) were already participat-ing in a vaccine trial. Most participants (n = 3123; 93.5%) were immunized against in fluenza in the 2019 to 2020 season (data not shown). Fully 40.5% (n = 1351) of respondents intended to delay (n = 1020; 30.6%) or forgo (n = 331; 9.9%)vaccination (Table 2). 11.4% (n = 379) of respond- ents intend vaccination during 4 to 6 months, 6.9% (n = 231) during months 7 to 12, and 12.3% (n = 410) after 1 year or more. Only 59.5% (n = 1985) intend to become immunized within 3 months of regulatory approval -37.2% (n = 1241) within the rst month and 22.3% (n = 744) during 1 to 3 months. Table 3 describes factors associated with inten- tion to receive vaccination within 3 months of ap- proval. Intention to receive early COVID-19 vaccination was more likely in men (adjusted OR[aOR], 2.43; 95% 2020 season (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.75-3.18; P<.001), persons with about COVID-19 (aOR, 2.40; 95% did not detect an associ- ation between early COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and (1) age, (2) having a job role involving direct patient interaction, or (3) lower self-reported over- all health in either bivariable or multivariable analyses. We considered that these associations might be detected (or fail to be detected) due to the choices we made for the dichotomization thresholds. To control for this, we performed bivariable and multi- variable sensitivity analyses using all possible com- binations of alternative dichotomization thresholds: (1) for viral concern, between somewhat or greaterand slightly or less; (2) for self-reported health sta- tus, between good or greater and fair or worse; (3) for educational attainment, between some college or less and college graduate or more; and (4) for intention to become vaccinated, between within doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200541 Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination Among Personnel 501copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

The results of these sensitivity analyses did not substantively alterour conclusions (see \"Sensitivity Analyses \"in Appendix and Appendix Tables 3 -9). Factors in fluencing a decision to delay or forgo vaccination (barriers) were also assessed. Among participants not planning for immediate vaccina- tion, the most common barriers included concernsabout (1) long-term side effects (n = 1197; 57.1%), (2) safety (n = 1152; (n = t ratio (n = 650; 31.0%) and (5) cost (n = 25; 12.2%). The frequencies of additional barriers are shown in Table 2. \"Other \" barriers were also allowed to be reported as free-text responses. Further barriers identi ed by this method included, inter alia , concerns about preg- nancy, teratogenicity, fertility and breastfeeding;mistrust of government; and desire to allow high-risk individuals access to the vaccine rst. In addition, we evaluated for nonresponse bias. We applied 3 common methods to estimate thisbias. 29First, a continuum of resistance theory pro- poses that survey respondents lie along a continuum from early respondents to late respondents to non- respondents.29Comparisons between early and late respondents ( \"wave \"analysis) may therefore pro- vide some insight into nonresponse bias.29We pro- duced a diagnostic plot using a 500-respondentrolling window for early ( <3 months), late (>3 months), and never vaccination acceptance (Appendix Figure 1). Vaccine acceptance patternsremain essentially stable as a function of respondent order, which is consistent with -but does not de n- itively establish -the absence of strong nonres- ponse bias. Second, we performed sensitivity analyses including the survey completion timestamp as a predictor variable (Appendix Tables 10- 11).Table 1.

Downloaded from Survey timestamp is nonsigni cant in all models and does not robustly alter the conclusions of the prior multivariable analysis. Third, a comparison of the demographic pro le of survey respondents to estimates of the eligible population (AppendixTable 1) suggests that survey responses broadly reflect a meaningful, representative cross-section of the relevant population with one clear exception: Black-identifying individuals were under-sampled (3.1%) due to lower response rate in this subgroup, relative to their estimated population prevalence (12.9%). Post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of Black respondents (n = 126 including persons who specifymore than 1 race; Table 4) revealed that only 31 Black respondents (24.8%) intend to become vacci- nated within the rst 3 months, far less than the rate among all respondents (59.5%; proportionalZ-test P<.001). Moreover, post hoc sensitivity analyses, including a regression term for 4-level race (White, n = 2873; Black or African American, n = 103; Asian, n = 124; or Other/Multiple, n = 173; Appendix Table 12 -14) reveal a robust association between Black racial identity and decreased vacci- nation acceptance at both 1 month (aOR, 0.20; 95% 0.10 CI, 0.08-0.21; sex, prior in fluenza vac- cination, greater concern about COVID-19, and higher education were preserved in the race-inclu- sive model. Barriers to vaccination among Black individuals nevertheless largely mirror the pattern seen in the full sample, viz.: long-term-side effects (n = 69; 63.9%), safety = 38; 35.2%). Similar post hoc exploratory subgroupanalyses for Hispanic and Asian respondents are presented in Table 4. Discussion Many COVID-19 vaccines are being concurrentlydeveloped to address the ongoing COVID-19 pan- demic, but evidence suggests enthusiasm forCOVID-19 vaccination among the general public may be limited. 10-12Data before this study are lack- ing for HCP. The attitude and behavior of HCP toward COVID-19 vaccination are speci cally important because (1) HCP are at increased risk of COVID- 19,9(2) infected HCP risk transmitting COVID-19Table 2.

Downloaded from to patients and their family members, and (3) HCP potentially serve as role models of appro- priate preventive health behavior by the general public. Widespread HCP refusal of COVID-19immunization may signal danger to the general public. This could imperil the overall ef cacy of the mass vaccination efforts that will be neces- sary to confer herd immunity among the public.Barriers to vaccine uptake among HCP must therefore be addressed vigorously. We found that fully 40.5% of personnel at a large tertiary care medical center will delay (30.6%)or forgo (9.9%) vaccination following regulatory approval; only 59.5% will accept vaccination within3 months. The intended non-vaccination rate for COVID-19 (9.9%) is similar to that reported for influenza in the 2019 to 2020 season (6.5%). The main factors limiting vaccination uptake are con-cerns about long-term side effects, safety, ef cacy, risk-to-bene t ratio, and cost. Those planning to delay, but not forgo, vaccination thus seem torequire high-quality, post-approval surveillance data to inform their decision to proceed with immunization.Multivariable analyses indicate vaccine accep- tance is greatest among persons with (1) male sex, (2) previous in fluenza vaccination, (3) high concern about COVID-19, and (4) high educational attain- ment. Black respondents were much less likely than all respondents to report intention to become vacci- nated within 3 months and over a quarter (28.8%)intend to forgo vaccination completely. This mayreflect mistrust of medical personnel in general, 30-32 but may also be exacerbated by under-representa-tion of minorities in COVID-19 related clinicaltrials. 33 Our data are concordant with prior analyses of the general public and HCPs which showed associationsbetween vaccine acceptance and male sex, 11,13,20,21,23 prior in fluenza vaccination,12,13,21,23,34concern about COVID-19,15,20,21,23,34and educational attain- ment.11,12,35The factors driving the association between male sex and greater COVID-19 vaccine acceptance are unclear; however, we note that males have a signi cantly high risk of COVID- 19-related intensive care unit admission and death than females.36Contrary to our expectations - and at variance with a recent study of Hong KongTable 3.

Downloaded from nurses25-we did not nd evidence that job role involving direct patient interaction increases vacci- nation acceptance. In addition, that same study25 showed that HCP with chronic medical problems were more likely to accept vaccination, but we did notnd an association between vaccine acceptance and poor self-reported health. Major concerns centered on vaccine safety, ef - cacy, and long-term side effects. Regulatory author-ities must assure HCP (and the general public) that forthcoming vaccines are safe and effective by con- sidering high-quality evidence through a rigorousand impartial process. The FDA has now grantedemergency use authorization to 2 mRNA vaccines after a thorough review of Phase 3 trial results and manufacturing quality data. 5-8Local and national institutions should develop evidence-based educa- tional materials that address these barriers, to allowtheir workforce to make informed vaccination decisions. Cost was the fth most commonly reported barrier. We did not collect information on nan- cial wellbeing because of the concern that itwould negatively in fluence the response rate. However, low-income individuals are the most likely to be cost-sensitive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have committedthat \"vaccine doses purchased with US taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at nocost. \" 37Health systems should promulgate mes- sages to their workforce that vaccination will beprovided free-of-charge. If public funding of vac- cination ceases in the future, health systems should adopt policies that address vaccinationcosts equitably to avoid exacerbating underlying workforce health disparities.Table 4.

First, data were col- lected at a single center. These results likely gener- alize to other academic medical centers or large community hospitals that are socially and demo- graphically similar but may not generalize well to rural areas or small community hospitals. Second, we used a written electronic survey rather than an in-person interviewer. Participants were required to use their best judgment in interpreting the meaning of questions and their responses, without the ability to easily clarify a misinterpretation. Third, the survey is observational and nonrandom- ized which allows for the possibility of nonresponsebias. Respondents with stronger views on COVID- 19 vaccination may have been more likely to respond to the survey. Our response rate was 18.3%. High response rates are thought to reduce the likelihood of nonresponse bias in survey stud- ies. 29Large unsolicited surveys (eg, those con- ducted by Pew Research38) commonly have lower response rates (5% to 15%). Lower response rates are not intrinsically bad, except insofar as theyincrease the risk of nonresponse bias. We failed to nd evidence of nonresponse bias in vaccine accep- tance (Appendix Figure 1) or the multivariable anal-ysis (Appendix Tables 10- 11). There is evidence, however, of nonrespondent bias among eligibleBlack participants. Black participants reported simi- lar barriers to vaccination but were less likely to accept vaccination. Low response rate of Black par- ticipants thus likely results in an underestimate of the total proportion of HCP who intend to delay or forgo vaccination. Further research on minorityattitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination -using community-based participatory methods thatinclude black HCP and other health system person- nel in the study design -is urgently needed. Fourth, we report an overview of perceived barriersto vaccination, without evaluating cognitive factors that in fluence participant 's assessments of risks and benets. Further analyses that speci cally interro- gate participant 's risk-bene t analyses should be conducted. Such analyses should speci cally con- sider cognitive risk assessment and decision-makingtheories that have been previously used to predict vaccination behavior, 39such as the health belief model,40the theory of planned behavior,41or pros- pect theory.42Fifth, our survey included 11 possible barriers to vaccination, but these are certainly notan exhaustive list of all possible barriers. For exam- ple, participants might consider the risk level oftheir family members and close contacts, the timing of vaccination for their family, and speci c comor- bidities in their decision-making process. Vaccine-or trial-speci c factors may also affect decision- making about speci c vaccines: whether or not a vaccine results in viral shedding, how the vaccine tri- als were conducted, and the length of follow-up invaccine trials. Analyses with a different design (eg, focus groups) would be helpful to more fully de ne the range of barriers to vaccination. Sixth, at thetime the survey was conducted, it was unclear which (if any) vaccines would receive approval soon. We,therefore, did not include any information about the specic properties of a vaccine or the trial designs. Educational material about some speci ct r i a l designs may nevertheless have utility; for example, information about the length of follow-up during the trial may help address concerns about the likeli- hood of long-term side effects of a given vaccine. In summary, many (40.5%) HCPs intend to delay or refuse COVID-19 vaccination. Policymakers atthe local, health system, and national levels, should be prepared to address concerns about vaccine safety, efcacy, and cost through the communication of rig- orously and impartially evaluated high-quality scien- tic evidence. Additional work to further investigate beliefs and attitudes -and to address barriers - among racial and ethnic minorities will be essential to promote vaccine uptake and public health duringthe COVID-19 pandemic.

Downloaded from Appendix: Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination amonghealth system personnel [Sensitivity Analyses] For intention to receive vaccination within 3 months (primary outcome), alternatively threshold- ing any predictor variable did not change the interpre- tation of results in bivariable analyses (Appendix Table 3) analyses. For multivariable analysis analyses(Appendix Table 4), the interpretation of results alsodid not change for any combination of predictor vari-able thresholds, except that in 1 threshold combina- tion (original concern, original education, alternative health status) age became a marginally signi cant pre- dictor variable nonsigni cant in the bivariable case and all other threshold combinations. For intention to receive vaccination within 1 month (alternative threshold for primary outcome), bivariable analyses(Appendix Table 5) showed a new marginally signi - cant association with job role involving direct patient interaction (crude OR [cOR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.34; P= .034). This did not persist (P>.05) in any multivariable analyses (Appendix Table 6) using all possible combinations of original and alternative predictor variables except in the case where original concern, original education, and alter- native health status thresholds were used. In this caseonly, job role involving direct patient interaction wasagain thatassociations between intention to receive earlyCOVID-19 vaccination and male gender, prior in flu- enza vaccination, higher concern about COVID-19, and higher educational attainment are robust against changes in the analysis method. We cannot fullyexclude a weak association between age and early (<3 months) vaccination intention or between job role involving direct patient interaction and very early (<1 month) vaccination intention. We also considered that age might in fluence vac- cine intention nonlinearly. To that end, we performed4-level, quantile discretization of age (age less than 30 years; n = 924; age 30 to 39 years, n = 846; age 40 to 54 years, n = 872; and age 55 years or greater, n = 650)and repeated the sensitivity analyses. The conclusions that male gender, prior in fluenza vaccination, elevated concern about COVID-19, and greater educational attainment -but not direct patient interaction or self- reported health -influence vaccination acceptance remain robust to this variation in the analysis.Bivariable analyses did not reveal a relationship between 4-level age and vaccination intention at 1 or 3 months (Appendix Table 7). Multivariable analyses (Appendix Tables 8 and 9) suggested that persons aged 30 to 54 years -but not persons older than 54 years -had reduced likelihood to obtain vaccina- tion by 3 months, but not at 1 month (alternativethreshold for primary outcome). Because of this sensi-tivity to details of the analysis method, we are thus hesitant to assert that a nonlinear association between age and vaccination intention can be inferred from theavailable data. doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200541 Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination Among Personnel E1copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

The proportion of respondents report- ing early (< 3 months), late ( >3 months), and never vaccine acceptance within 500-participant rolling windows is shown. Earlier respondents seem on the left while later respondents seem on the right. Rolling averages are compared with the whole-sample averages (solid lines). Vaccine acceptance patterns remain essentially stable as a function of respondent order, which is consistent with - but does not denitively establish - the absence of strong nonresponse bias.
