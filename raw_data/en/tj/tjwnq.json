She was evaluated by a Neurologist who felt that it could be a reaction to vaccination or a seizure disorder. No treatment was given. Over next two to three years she stopped having these movements but still has frequent facial grimacing. Mother and maternal aunt also had adverse side effects from DTap. The patient was given second MMR during this time and again she had involuntary movements for a few weeks only. She is due for Varicella and Hepatitis A & B vaccines. Is it safe for her to get these vaccines? Answer: Thank you for your question to Ask the Expert. To address this more thoroughly, I reached out to Dr John Kelso, an expert in adverse reactions with vaccines. I am a little confused by the question. It states that the child is now 4 years-old and was given the three vaccines at age two months, however MMR vaccine is not recommended until age 12 to 15 months. Per CDC ( [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/febrile-seizures.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/febrile-seizures.html)), \"Febrile seizures happen in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, with most occurring between 14-18 months of age. About 1 out of every 3 children who have a febrile seizure will have at least one more during childhood. There is a small increased risk for febrile seizures after MMR and MMRV vaccines.\" However, these would be uncommon in a 2 month-old, are typically a single seizure and occur only during the period of fever brought on by vaccination. Thus, this would not be an explanation for this child's ongoing symptoms. Tic disorders have been reported in temporal association with vaccination however, the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines including 2017 that \"current scientific evidence does not support a causal association between thimerosalcontaining and thimerosalfree vaccinations and tics/tic disorders.\" (Pages 72-100 Another consideration is a functional neurologic disorder (FND), also referred to as functional movement disorder (FMD). FND is reported to be a disruption in the brain's normal mechanisms for controlling the body and can be triggered by physical or emotional events, including head injury, a medical or surgical procedure, and vaccinations ( [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2778192](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2778192)). The precise incidence and prevalence of FNDs are unknown, as population-based studies are unavailable. Estimates of the prevalence of FND among adults and children with movement disorders vary between 2 to 4 percent. In most reports of adults and children with FND, functional tremor is the most frequent type of involuntary movement. A stressful event, including receiving a vaccine, can be a precipitator. This also seems unlikely to have begun at age 2 months of age. Whatever the cause, this does not represent an allergic or immunologic reaction, but rather a neurologic mechanism. I recommend you consider a referral back to a pediatric neurologist to evaluate for possible underlying neurologic mechanism. As to whether your patient should proceed with vaccination, this will require weighing the risk of a recurrence or exacerbation based on input from the neurologist versus the risk of remaining inadequately vaccinated against these vaccine-preventable diseases. I hope you find this helpful. Very special thanks to Dr John Kelso for his contribution to this response. Respectfully submitted, Jeffrey "}
