Well you are in good company if you do. According to a Health Canada Survey, some 71% of people use them. What are NHP's anyways? They are naturally occurring substances derived from plants, animals and microorganisms that are used to help restore or maintain good health. These concentrated isolates come in a wide variety of forms like tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, ointments and drops. Here are some common examples: vitamins and minerals herbal remedies homeopathic medicines traditional medicines like traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic (East Indian) medicines prebiotics and probiotics other products like amino acids, essential fatty acids and essential oils chondroitin and glucosamine Canada has Natural Health Product Regulations for human use. This is to ensure products are safe, effective, and are of high quality. They can be purchased as over-the-counter products and do not require a prescription. To be legally sold in Canada, all NHP's must have a product license, and the sites that manufacture, package, label, and import these products must have site licenses. To get a licence applicants must give detailed information about the product to Health Canada, including: medicinal ingredients, source, dose, potency, non-medicinal ingredients and recommended use(s). Efficacy of NHP's and their labelled health claims must be supported by proper evidence like clinical trial data or references to published studies, journals, pharmacopoeias, and traditional resources. Once approved, a product licence is issued as an eight-digit Natural Product Number (NPN) or Homeopathic Medicine Number (DIN-HM), which must appear on the label. Health Canada has not yet evaluated all natural health products currently on the market, so those products are labelled with an eight-digit Exemption Number (EN), but they can still be Mt.

Drop in with this Newsletter and get a free bag of cat or dog treats! Make them feel and look GREAT!!! Check out our GROOMING ServicesWelcome Spring! Last year the introduction of our newsletter reflected on what a LONG, SNOWY Winter we had experienced and that by the time you got the newsletter, Spring would have arrived. What turned out to be a rather cool Summer, led into a record breaking COLD winter! I can't believe I am saying, \"I can't wait to see some mosquitos!\" Warmth leads to the nuisance of bugs, but I will take it. We coordinate our Newsletter with the Heartworm, Flea and Tick season to remind you to PROTECT YOUR PETS FROM PARASITES, as well as inform you about pet related health issues, and update you on our practice. We appreciate your interest and ongoing support and hope you enjoy the read! Supplemental Knowledge We're on air!! We have launched some fun commercials on Strathroy's 105.7 MyFM. Hope you hear us! sold. There is a Natural and Non- prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD) listing the products available in Canada. Health Canada also emphasizes the importance of professional medical consultation prior to the use of NHP's. They should be fully informed of all other medication you are on, use only approved products, and should report any adverse reactions to the manufacturer. Most people want optimal health for their furry companions too, but are NHPs for humans safe and effective for animals? While we may consider our pets as family members, they are NOT small humans. Their bodies don't work in exactly the same way as ours, and may absorb certain substances and ingredients differently. For example, some types of oils used in omega-3 supplements are metabolized differently in animals so the intended benefit will not be achieved. Some ingredients approved to be safe in human supplements, like the sweetener xylitol, are actually toxic to animals. Are there pet specific supplements and are they regulated the same as human products? Pet Specific NHP's are a huge market, however supplements for pets can be sold without being registered - which is the case with many products on the market! Those who voluntarily submit their product for evaluation, and have been approved, are given a Notification Number (NN) to be printed on the label. The \"NN-labeled\" products meet ALL of the following Health Canada conditions: The product's active ingredients are on Health Canada's list of low-risk substances. Objective and credible evidence supports a reasonable expectation of the product's effectiveness. The product is manufactured according to rigorous quality, control and labelling standards. The product and its ingredients are traceable. Important information that could potentially affect your pet's health and safety (such as cautions and/or warnings) are printed on the product label. Much like Health Canada recommends you seek professional medical consultation prior to the use of NHP's, it is also recommended you do the same for your pet(s). Although we are not naturopathic veterinarians, we do value their effect and can advise on a variety of NHP's. We carry \"NN-labeled\", pet specific products intended to help restore or maintain health. Getting a thorough PHYSICAL EXAM and history on your pet's lifestyle, including EXERCISE, HEALTHCARE and NUTRITION, helps us make an appropriate recommendation. Visit www.hc-sc.gc.ca under \"drugs and health products\" for more information on NHP's. Kitty Health Secrets Cats are amazing at hiding health problems. Given they are typically independent creatures seeking attention when they want, sleeping a good part of the day and not requiring a walk or daily exercise, we don't challenge them much. So needless to say, they can be pretty sick and still meet their lifestyle demands! Identifying health problems early makes them easier to manage, but how do we know in cats? Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the most common diseases in cats and is the leading cause of death. The kidneys play the vital role of eliminating nitrogen toxins from protein metabolism (urea), maintaining hydration, electrolyte balance and blood pressure, and creating the hormone for red blood cell production (see image below). CKD affects about one-third of all cats over the age of 15, however most owners will not notice clinical signs of the disease in the early stages. The only way to know is to have an in-depth look into their secret lives. 2 Mt. Brydges Tails Spring 2015 Volume 8 April until the end of July are our Wellness and Parasite Prevention months. This is a great time to assess external as well as internal health through value bundled laboratory packages. Discounts also extend to needed flea, heartworm and tick preventives.3 Mt. Brydges Tails Spring 2015 Volume 8 Specific clinical signs to look for include: Weight loss Unkempt hair coat Picky or generally poor appetite Vomiting Constipation Increased water intake and urine production Sleeping more than usual The American Association of Feline Practitioners recommends annual preventive health care visits for all cats, but specifically, mature cats (7-10years) and every six months for geriatric cats (>11years). A thorough physical exam is one of the most valuable steps. Assessment of muscle and fat scores, heart sounds, blood pressure, and abdominal palpation are among the most important aspects of the exam. In addition, specific blood and urine tests can detect early changes in the kidneys, and other organs. With repeated testing, trends in the blood and urine values can be a way to detect and/or predict the progression of disease. Although these tests are available at any time of the year, we offer value added \"Wellness Packages\" from April to the end of July thanks to reduced laboratory fees during this time. Often with early detection and control, a significant increase in the Quality and Quantity of life can be achieved. Interestingly, the cornerstone of CKD management is all about the formulation and quality of the food being provided and encouragement of water intake. The old adage, \"You are what you eat!\" couldn't be more true. This further supports the use of high quality life-stage or disease specific foods throughout an animal's entire life. In this day and age, we have the luxury of readily available nutrition that feeds to THRIVE not just SURVIVE! Better yet, most cats are happy to eat it: So why not take advantage of it? Way to Spoil the Meal! When dealing with home prepared RAW diets, the risk of bacterial contamination is significant. Compared to other types of pet food, raw pet food is more likely to be contaminated with disease causing bacteria such as Salmonella or Listeriosis. Even if you take every precaution to store and prepare the food, if it is already contaminated, your pet may still become infected and potentially contaminate anyone who comes in contact with your pet or their feces. Be especially careful when these pets try to lick your face to give you a kiss! Contamination of food by yeasts and molds is also in the media. They can be hazardous to human and animal health because of the ability to produce toxic metabolites called mycotoxins. Most mycotoxins are heat stable, and can withstand the cooking process. Even though the actual organism may not survive food preparation, their toxins may still be present to cause both acute and chronic illness. Usually, contamination happens during the food preparation and processing, when either the source is already contaminated, or excess moisture is trapped during the packaging process. Don't be afraid to scrutinize what Quality Assurance Measures are in place at the source of the food you choose to feed. We did just that with Royal Canin Foods in Guelph Ontario. This fall our staff went directly to the plant and reviewed their process - Impressive! They voluntarily go beyond the standard and are the first Canadian Pet Food Manufacturer to obtain these 3 certificates: ISO 9001: Quality Management, ISO 22000: Food Safety, ISO 14001: Environmental Management. They source all available ingredients from Canada and each product, every time, must strictly adhere to the purity standard before it can even enter the factory. This \"finger-printing\" is done by way of Near Infa-Red Scanning (NIRS) that will detect ANY impurity or contaminant. The vertical cooking process is incredibly efficient and allows for small batches, numerous specific formulations, Comprehensive Blood Parasite Screening Our Heartworm Test also tests for 3 other common Tick Transmitted blood parasite diseases: Lyme Disease, Ehrlichiosis and Anaplasmosis. easy formulation changes and \"just-in-time\" inventory to optimize freshness. The product is analyzed again at the end to ensure purity, that the nutrient profile advertised on the bag is a match and that none of the vitamins or minerals were diminished in the process. It is a challenge to make a recommendation on another company's behalf, but we are confident in their products. Just Paying it Forward! The Farley Foundation is a charity that assists people in need by subsidizing the cost of non-elective veterinary care. The foundation relies totally on donations, and is run through the Ontario Veterinary Medical Association. We are so pleased to report that, with your help, we raised over $800 in donation for this charity. Donations that are made directly to our clinic go into the Shamley Rescue Fund. This is our exclusive clinic fund and every cent goes directly into needed medical care for stray animals. Although we are NOT a rescue facility, we recognize there is a need and we have helped many stray animals. For example, we had two kittens, at separate times, needing an eye removed due to injury. In another case, a cat was found that had a very bad leg fracture necessitating amputation. All patients healed well and we were able to find loving forever homes through our FANTASTIC network of clients. Thanks everybody! We look forward to seeing you soon! \"We're here for the ones that are there for you!\" 4 Mt.
