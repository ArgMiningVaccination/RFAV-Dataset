They address a policy gap by providing clear guidance for practitioners to make sure there is clarity and transparency about the expectations of practitioners providing Chinese herbal medicine services. The guidelines help Chinese medicine practitioners to practise Chinese herbal medicine safely and support the Board's effort to facilitate public access to safe health services. Revised Guidelines for safe Chinese herbal medicine practice were published by the Board on 1 September 2023 and will take effect on 1 December 2023.
