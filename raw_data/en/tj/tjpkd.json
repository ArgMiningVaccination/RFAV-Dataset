However, based on a review of the literature and stakeholder interviews, GAO identified several common themes underlying what sustainable chemistry strives to achieve, including: improve the efficiency with which natural resources \u2014including energy, water, and materials \u2014are used to meet human needs for chemical products while avoiding environmental harm; reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances i n the design, manufacture, and use of chemical products; protect and benefit the economy, people, and the environment using innovative chemical tranformations; consider all life cycle stages including manufacture, use, and disposal (see figure) when evaluating the environmental impact of a product; and minimize the use of non -renewable resources .

Why GAO did this study Chemistry contributes to virtually every aspect of modern life and the chemical industry supports more than 25 percent of the gross domestic product of the United States. While these are posi tive contributions, chemical production can have negative health and environmental consequences. Mitigating these potential consequences requires thoughtful design and evaluation of the life cycle effects of chemical processes and products. GAO was asked to conduct a technology assessment to explore, among other things , the opportunities, challenges, and federal roles in sustainable chemistry. This report discusses (1) how stakeholders define and assess sustainable chemistry; (2) available or developing technologies to make chemical processes and products more sustainab le; and (3) how the federal government, industry and others contribute to the development and use of such technologies. GAO selected for assessment three technology categories \u2014catalysts, solvents, and continuous processing; interviewed stakeholders from v arious fields, such as government, industry, and academia; convened a meeting of experts on sustainable chemistry technologies and approaches; and surveyed a non- generalizable sample of chemical companies. GAO is not making recommendations in this report, but is identifying strategic implications. United States Government Accountability Office GAO identified three categories of more sustainable chemistry technologies\u2014 catalysts, solvents, and continuous processing\u2014 that demonstrate both progress and potential. Catalysts reduce the energy input required for a chemical process and allow for more efficient use of materials. Stakeholders suggested future research be directed at developing less toxic or renewa ble catalysts, including those that are metal -free or those from earth -abundant metals such as iron. Solvents are used in many chemical processes but can create waste issues and be toxic. Alternatives include solvents from renewable, non- petroleum raw mat erials and solvents such as water that are less hazardous to human health and the environment, among other qualities. An alternative to traditional batch processing is continuous processing, in which materials react as they flow along a system of channels , pipes, or tubes. Compared to batch processing, continuous processing uses materials more efficiently, generates less waste, and has a smaller physical footprint. The federal government and other stakeholders play several roles, sometimes in collaboration, to advance the development and use of more sustainable chemistry technologies. T he federal government has supported research, provided technical assistance, and offered certification programs, while stakeholders have integrated sustainable chemistry principles into educational programs and addressed chemicals of concern in consumer products. While switching to more sustainable options entails challenges , this field has the potential to inspire new products and processes, create jobs, and enhance benefits to human health and the environment. Stakeholders identified strategic implications of sustainable chemistry and offered a range of potential options to address challenges and realize the full potential of these technologies, including the following: Break through technologies in sustainable chemistry could transform how the industry thinks about performance, function, and synthesis. Sustainable chemistry creates opportunities to use a different conceptual framework that allows industry to create molecules w ith better performance. The establishment of an organized constituency, with the involvement of both industry and government, could help make sustainable chemistry a priority. An industry consortium, working in partnership with a key supporter at the fede ral level, could lead to an effective national initiative or strategy. A national initiative that considers sustainable chemistry in a systematic manner could be useful. Such an effort could encourage collaborations among industry, academia and the governm ent, similar to other national technology Initiative s. There are opportunities for the federal government to address industry - wide challenges. Federal attention that facilitates development of standard tools for assessment and a robust definition could help clarify relevant participants in the field and improve information available for decision- makers at all levels. According to stakeholders, transitioning toward the use of more sustainable chemistry technologies will require national leadership and industry, government , and other stakeholders to work together .

Washington, DC 20548 Letter February 8, 2018 The Honorable Christopher Coons Ranking Member Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government Committee on Appropriations United States Senate The Honorable Susan M. Collins United States Senate The Honorable Edward J. Markey United States Senate Chemistry contributes to virtually every aspect of modern life, from the production of food and clean drinking water to medicines, cleaners, personal care products, and a host of other products. According to one recent report, the chemical industry supports more than 25 percent of the gross domestic product of the United States and, in 2016, accounted for $174 billion (14 percent) of U.S. goods exported.1 In addition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the chemical industry employed more than 821,000 people in October 2017 and the Department of Commerce estimates that the sector generates an additional 2.7 million indirect jobs via industry suppliers.2 Despit e these positive contributions to quality of life and other social and economic goals, chemical production can result in negative health and environmental consequences . Mitigating these potential consequences requires thoughtful design and evaluation of th e life cycle effects of chemical processes and products \u2014that is, a thorough assessment of effects resulting from stages of the life cycle such as sourcing the raw materials, processing raw materials into products, handling and disposal of byproducts and industrial waste, product use, and end -of-life disposal or recycling . In addition, the United States faces a number of environmental challenges , including water scarcity, reliance on nonrenewable resources including scarce metals and fossil fuels, and difficulty obtaining adequate information on chemical toxicity and exposure levels . Many in the chemical industry are working to address these issues through improving the environmental sustainability of their own chemical processes and providing more sustainable products and technologies to others. 1American Chemistry Council, 20 17 Element s of the Business of Chemistry (Washington, D.C.: 2017). 2International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce, Chemical Spotlight: The Chemical Industry in the United States , accessed October 5, 2017, https://www.selectusa.gov/chemical- industry -united- states . Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 2 In view of the potential benefits and nascent nature of the field of sustainable chemistry, you asked us to conduct a te chnology assessment to explore, among other things, the opportuniti es, challenges, and federal roles in this field. In response to that request, this report discusses (1) how stakeholders define sustainable chemistry and assess the sustainability of chemical processes and products; (2) technologies that are available or in development to make chemical processes and products more sustainable; and (3) how the federal government, industry, and others contribute to the development and use of such technologies. To address these objectives, we reviewed key reports and scientific literature to establish background, identify appropriate technologies and their advantages and disadvantages, identify stakeholders , and inform survey questions. We also interviewed approximately 80 stakeholders including federal and state officials, chem ical companies, industry and professional organizations, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), academics and educational institutions, and other s; conducted site visits to federal laboratories; and attended two technical conferences. In addition, we collabo rated with the National Academies to convene a two -day meeting of 24 experts on sustainable chemistry technologies and approaches. We selected participants from the chemical industry, academia, federal agencies including a national laboratory, professional organizations, and others with expertise covering most significant areas of our review. 3 During this meeting, we moderated discussion sessions on several topics, including examples of technologies to make chemical processes and products more sustainable; applications in industry; economic and business aspects of developing and implementing the technologies; approaches to assessing the sustainability of chemical processes and products; the role of standards, regulations, and related programs; and additional stakeholder perspectives. We continued to draw on the expertise of these individuals throughout our study and, consistent with our quality assurance framework, we provided them with a draft of our report and solicited their feedback, which we incorporated as appropriate. We also surveyed a non -generalizable sample of 27 chemical companies to gather data on four primary topics: ( 1) approaches these companies use to assess the sustainability of their chemical processes and products; ( 2) the extent and percei ved value of their interactions with other stakeholders, including federal agencies, customers, suppliers, academics, and NGOs ; (3) challenges or gaps in stakeholder interactions; and ( 4) challenges or barriers to the development and use of more sustainabl e chemistry technologies. We limited the scope of our review to selected technologies in three main categories: catalys ts, solvent use, and alternatives to batch processing (i.e., continuous processing and continuous 3After the expert meeting we changed one of our three target industry sectors from textiles/apparel to formulators (i.e., makers of personal care and cleaning products). We did not have a formulator represented at the meeting; however, we interviewed and surveyed representatives from several formulator companies during the course of our study. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 3 flow microreactors) . We did not assess all available or developing technologies in these three categories, nor did we assess technologies in other phases of the chemical product life cycle. For example, we did not assess technologies for recycling industrial waste into new feedstocks or for post-consumer recycling of chemical products. See appendix I for additional details on our scope and methodology, appendix II for a list of the experts who participated in our expert meeting, appendix III for a list of the chemical companies we interviewed an d surveyed, and appendix IV for the questions in the survey instrument and the quantitative results (i.e., response counts) from the survey. We conducted our work from October 2015 to February 2018 in accordance with all sections of GAO's Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to technology assessments. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations to our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for the findings and conclusions in this product. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 4 1 Background 1.1 Sustainability and the chemical industry The chemical industry relies on the use of natural resources as inputs to make chemical products, and the industry's outputs, in turn, can have an impact on the environment.4 The International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce identifies the chemical industry as one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, with more than 10,000 firms producing more than 70,000 products. 5 It is comprised of several industry subsectors including formulators (makers of cleaning and personal care produc ts), chemical manufacturers (makers of basic and specialty chemicals), and pharmaceutical companies .6 Since the beginning of the 20th century, the chemical industry has depended on fossil fuels as both an energy source and a primary feedstock for manufactu ring chemicals. The chemical industry is the second largest user of energy among manufacturing sectors, and more than 4For purposes of this report, the term 'chemical product' includes a wide variety of products manufactured by chemical companies, including single chemicals (e.g., methanol, ammonia) and other products made with chemicals or mixtures of chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals, cleaning products, cosmetics). 5International Trade Association, U.S. Department of Commerce, Chemical Spotlight: The Chemical Industry in the United States , accessed October 5, 2017, https://www.selectusa.gov/chemical- industry -united- states . 6Cleaning and personal care products include soaps, detergents, cleaners, toiletries, an d cosmetics. Basic chemicals include organic and inorganic chemicals, plastic resins, dyes, and pigments. Specialty chemicals include adhesives and sealants, water treatment chemicals, plastic additives, catalysts, and coatings. Pharmaceuticals include dia gnostics, prescription drugs, vaccines, vitamins, and over -the-counter drugs for human and veterinary applications. 98 percent of organic, or carbon -based, chemicals are derived from petroleum or natural gas (i.e., petrochemicals). Inorganic chemicals do not contain carbon as a principal element and the chemical industry generally derives these from metals and non -metallic minerals, some of which face supply limitations. The growth of the chemical industry in the 20 th century also resulted in the producti on of large quantities of waste, including hazardous waste. Chemicals, including basic and specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, are manufactured through chemical synthesis \u2014a process involving one or more chemical reactions.7 Chemical reactions generally follow a common pattern that chemists describe using a chemical equation as shown in figure 1. Figure 1: A standard chemical equation Although not shown in the figure, additional reactants may also be included above or below the arrow. The left side of the equation shows one or more reactants \u2014chemical substances that enter into and are chemically changed by the reaction. The arrow represents the reaction itself; additional information is often provided 7Formulators generally make their cleaning and personal care products by mixing chemicals together rather than through chemical reactions. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 5 above and below the arrow to describe reaction co nditions \u2014other factors that allow the reaction to occur optimally \u2014which can include components that are not chemically changed during the reaction, such as catalysts, solvents, or other conditions such as a specific temperature or pressure. The right side of the equation shows one or more products \u2014chemical substances that result from the reaction. In some cases, the goal is to produce only certain of these products; the others are often called 'byproducts' and may be commercially useful or considered waste. Within the chemical industry, the product of one company may be the raw material for another. For example, bulk chemicals \u2014a kind of basic chemical\u2014 are the building blocks for many chemical products. Other companies or industries can purchase bulk chemical s and incorporate them into other chemical products (e.g., chemical intermediates, pharmaceuticals) or manufactured products (e.g., textiles, automobiles), or use them in processing (e.g., pulp and paper, oil refining). For example, one chemical company ma y produce adipic acid, a bulk chemical used in the manufacture of one kind of nylon. Another chemical company may then buy the adipic acid as a raw material to produce nylon fiber, selling that product to textile companies that then incorporate it into oth er products such as apparel. In some cases, multiple steps may be required to produce a chemical intermediate or other product from a bulk chemical. Specialty chemicals, including fine chemicals, are often more technologically advanced and manufactured i n lower volumes than basic chemicals. Specialty chemicals are used for a specific purpose and can also be incorporated into a range of other products. The term 'sustainability' can have many interpretations depending on the context i n which it is used. The 1987 Brundtland report stated that sustainable development 'meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs .' 8 Sustainability may refer to economic, environmental, or soc ial sustainability. Achieving all three \u2014a concept known as the 'triple bottom line' \u2014has become a goal of some businesses, including many in the chemical industry. Sustainable development is relevant to the chemical industry as it concerns both the responsi ble use of natural resources \u2014using natural resources at rates such that supplies remain available over the long term \u2014as well as the minimization of pollution. Several organizations have attempted to define sustainability as it applies to chemicals and the chemical industry ( see table 1). 8World Commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future , (Oxford University Press, 1987). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 6 Table 1: Example definitions of sustainable (or green) chemistry Organization Definition Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Sustainable chemistry is a scientific concept that seeks to improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products and services. Sustainable chemistry encompasses the design, manufacture and use of efficient, effective, safe and more environmentally benign chemical products and processes, accessed January 4, 2018 (http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/risk - management/sustainablechemistry.htm ). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Green chemis try is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances. Green chemistry applies across the life cycle of a chemical product, including its design, manufacture, use, and ultimate disposal. Green chemistry is also known as sustainable chemistry, accessed June 19, 2017 ( https://www.epa.gov/greenchemistry/basics- green - chemistry ). American Chemical Society Sustainable and green chemistry [is] a different way of thinking about how chemistry and chemical engineering can be done. Over the years different principles have been proposed that can be used when thinking about the design, development and implementation of chemical products and processes. These principles enable scientists and engineers t o protect and benefit the economy, people and the planet by finding creative and innovative ways to reduce waste, conserve energy, and discover replacements for hazardous substances. [T]he scope of these green chemistry and engineering principles go beyond concerns over hazards from chemical toxicity and include energy conservation, waste reduction, and life cycle considerations such as the use of more sustainable or renewable feedstocks and designing for end of life or the final disposition of the product, accessed January 4, 2018 (https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what -is-green - chemistry/definition.html ). Source: GAO analysis of agency and other stakeholder documents. | GAO -18-307 As noted in table 1, green chemistry is another term that some associate with sustainability efforts in the chemical industry. Green chemistry reduces or elim inates the use or generation of hazardous substances in the design, manufacture, and application of chemical products using the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry (the 12 Principles). 9 See appendix V for the full list of the 12 Principles. According to the d efinitions of both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Chemical Society (ACS) shown in the table, the concepts of green chemistry 9Paul T. Anastas and John C. Warner, Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998). and sustainable chemistry are synonymous. Green chemistry is rooted in the Pollution Prevention Ac t of 1990, which marked a shift in regulatory policy from pollution control to pollution prevention. 10 Staff in EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics first used the term green chemistry in the early 1990s. The Green Chemistry Institute (GCI) \u2014an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing green chemistry \u2014was founded in 1997 and eventually became part of the ACS. 10Public Law 101 -508 (Nov. 5, 1990). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 7 Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one tool for evaluating the relative sustainability of a process or product. While reducing o r eliminating the use of hazardous substances (i.e., doing 'green chemistry') may offer one viable path for improving sustainability in the chemical industry, following these principles alone does not guarantee improved sustainability from a life cycle perspective. LCA is a method for systematically evaluating the environmental impact of a product through all the stages of its life cycle. 11 As shown in figure 2, life cycle stages for chemical processes and products can include raw materials extraction and processing, 11The Coca Cola Company together with the Midwest Research Institute developed the original concept of analyzing a product life cycle in the 1960's while trying to quantify the energy, material, and environmental impacts of different beverage containers. In the 1990's, the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry coined the term LCA and coordinated the harmonization of terminology and methodology. The 14040 series of the International Organization for Standardization contains standards and technic al reports for LCA. chemical processing, product use, and post - consumer or industrial disposal or recycling.12 By attempting to improve one stage of the life cycle without considering the others, chemists run the risk of moving sustainability problems around rather than solving them. Analyzing the full life cycle of a process or product can reveal benefits as well as tradeoffs or unintended consequ ences of different choices along the way. Practitioners use LCA to compare the environmental performance of processes and products under different conditions. 12Although sustainable chemistry technologies exist in each stage of the life cycle, we were not able to cover all life cycle stages in this report. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 8 Figure 2: Life cycle of chemic al processes and products Transportation an d distribution of materials and products, represented by the green arrows between stages, can also be considered a life cycle stage. LCA practitioners can tailor the parameters of the assessment to meet their needs; however, the use of this assessment in the chemical industry still faces challenges. Generally, LCA practitioners select system boundaries depending on the goals of the assessment. Example boundaries are 'cradle - to-grave' \u2014covering the entire supply chain from raw materials e xtraction to disposal, 'cradle -to-gate' \u2014covering and \u2014covering manufacturing or processing only. A number of quantifiable environmental indicators can contribute to the assessment including energy use , global warming, ozone depletion, human and environmental toxicity, and waste. The practitioner can also vary the relative importance of these indicators based on the needs of the assessment. The results of an LCA can depend on the amount and quality of d ata available as well as what the practitioner chooses to include. Therefore, different assessments of the same product or process can yield different results. A lack of data can be a challenge for the application of LCA to the manufacture of some chemical products. Additionally, there is not a coherent framework for characterizing the toxicological Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 9 impacts of chemicals. LCA can also be costly. As a tool, LCA can be more useful for products or processes that are at a high technology readiness level or already commercially available than those earlier in development, for which simpler metrics may be more appropriate. 1.2 Federal government agencies and other stakeholders The federal government and other stakeholders play a number of roles, sometimes in collabora tion, to advance the development and use of more sustainable chemical processes and products. Federal programs support research on the impacts of chemicals on human and environmental health. Federal programs also support the development of more sustainable chemical processes and their commercialization. Additionally, federal programs aid the expansion of markets for products manufactured with more sustainable chemicals and processes. Other stakeholders play similar roles and some additional roles that contr ibute to the development and use of more sustainable chemical processes and products. Federal programs conduct and fund basic research on the characteristics and biological effects of chemicals that underpins the development and use of more sustainable chemistry products and processes. Decision makers must have a scientific understanding of the potential harmful impacts of exposure to chemicals for multiple reasons. For example, federal regulators need information to effectively minimize the harmful effects of chemicals through regulations and other means and to assess the regulated community's compliance with them. Industry needs this information to make informed decisions about the selection, design, and use of more sustainable chemicals in their products and processes, including their impact on workers. Federal programs also seek to support the development of new, more sustainable chemistry processes and facilitate the commercialization of these processes. The federal government conducts and funds both basic and applied research in the development of more sustainable processes. In addition, federal programs seek to facilitate the transition of new technologies from the research and development phase to commercialization, a transition that can be expensive and challenging for researchers as well as small and medium companies, according to experts. To support the transition to commercialization, federal programs provide loan guarantees, grants, and technical assistance to researchers and companies and recogni ze innovative technologies through an award program, among other activities. Federal programs also aid market growth for products made with sustainable chemicals and processes by informing consumers about these products and by facilitating their purchase by federal offices. While growing numbers of consumers are seeking out \"greener\" or more sustainably manufactured products, it can be challenging for consumers to identify such products or verify company claims about their products. Companies seeking to ma nufacture more sustainable products strive to ensure that their products are differentiated from less sustainable products in order to reach these consumers. Federal sustainability certifications and evaluations are publically available to connect Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 10 interest ed consumers and purchasers with more sustainable products. Additionally, the Federal Acquisitions Regulation and Executive Order 13693 \u2014Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade \u2014requires that federal agencies purchase selected products manufac tured with more sustainable chemicals, creating a market for those products. 13 Various agency programs play a role in the development and use of more sustainable chemistry process es and products . Some federal agencies have programs with goals that support the development and use of more sustainable chemistry and others have programs that do so consistent with broader goals. As part of its mission to protect human health and the environment, EPA has programs that conduct and fund research to evaluate the impacts of chemicals on human health and the environment. Additional programs support the development of products and processes that are more sustainable by awarding innovators of sustainable chemistry technologies and by evaluating and certifying those products and making the results available publically. Similarly, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) conducts and funds research on the impacts of chemicals as part of its mission to enhan ce and protect the health and well -being of Americans. The National Science Foundation's (NSF) mission includes promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity, and welfare. In terms of sustainable chemistry, NSF carries out this mission by funding research on the impacts of chemicals 13See Exec. Order No. 13963, Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade, 80 Fed. Reg. 15871 (March 25, 2015); 48 CFR 1.102. on human and environmental health and on developing sustainable chemistry technologies. Part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) mission is to provide leadership on agriculture and ru ral development in order to provide economic opportunity, help rural America, and promote agriculture production. As part of that mission, USDA programs support the development and use of technologies that can convert agricultural and forestry biomass into fuels and other products such as chemicals, and thereby create markets for agricultural products. The biobased chemicals produced using these renewable resources rather than traditional non -renewable sources such as fossil fuels, may be more sustainable. A number of programs at the Department of Energy (DOE), which works to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through science and technology, seek to reduce the energy used in manufacturing, including energy used by chemical technologies. The Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) advances measurement science, standards, and technology, including those needed to measure sustainability. As part of its mission, the Department of Defense (DOD) protects readiness, people, and the environment by: (1) identifying and researching risks associated with chemicals ; (2) developing, evaluating, and demonstrating sustainable solutions to meet DOD's environmental and performance challenges, including more sustainable chemical products and processes ; and (3) ensuring DOD meets the requirements of applicable federal gr een procurement preference programs. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 11 Other stakeholders, such as industry, companies and retailers, states, academic institutions, and NGOs also seek to influence the development and use of more sustainable chemistry processes and products through activit ies such as supporting workforce development and developing tools and resources for industry. These organizations may work collaboratively to share expertise and resources or to identify areas of common interest in order to promote mutual goals related to sustainable chemistry. By focusing on a wide range of approaches to supporting sustainable chemistry, from transforming education to developing industry -specific standards, together these groups may facilitate the transition of the chemical industry to a n ew, more sustainable framework for chemical technologies. 1.3 Legal framework Consistent with the goals of sustainable chemistry that include making chemicals in a purposefully more environmentally benign way, several federal requirements and directives address chemical and other risks to public health and the environment. For example, EPA's ability to effectively implement its mission of protecting public health and the environment is critically dependent on credible and timely assessments of the risks posed by chemicals. Such assessments are the cornerstone of scientifically sound environmental decisions, policies, and regulations under a variety of statutes, such as the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 14 which provides EPA with 1415 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 et. seq. After many years of congressional committees considering legislation aimed at reforming TSCA, in June 2016, Congress passed and the President signed the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemica l Safety for the 21st Century Act, which authority to obtain inform ation on chemicals and to regulate those that it determines pose unreasonable risks; the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) ,15 which authorizes EPA to regulate contaminants in public drinking water systems; the Clean Air Act , 16 which regulates air pollution from stationary and mobile sources; and the Clean Water Act, which aims to restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the nation's waters.17 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the safety of food, drugs and medical devic es, and cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.18 The Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration jointly issue the Federal Acquisition Regulation19 for use by executive agencies for acquiring goods and services, and Executive Order 13693 encourages federal agencies, among other things, to acquire Safer Choice labeled products (chemically intensive products that contain safer ingredients).20 gave EPA greater authority to improve its processes for assessing and controlling toxic chemicals.

Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 12 1.4 Supply, demand, and economics Various economic factors influence the development of sustainable products. Stakeholders described how interactions between the demand for and supply of sustainable products can influence the extent and pace of growth. For example, the supply of any product is strongly influenced by the costs of production, as well as costs of getting that product to market. Whether that cost is worth the undertaking depends on what consumers are willing to pay for the product and the overall consumer demand. Consumer demand can be influenced by a range of factors such as changes in mindset, an increased willingness to pay, and price sensitivity. Consumers are increasingly seeking products that help them reduce their own environmental footprint and the footprint of their supp ly chain. Hence, chemical companies are innovating to develop products made with safer chemicals and are also increasing the use of recycled, biobased, and renewable materials. When consumers are willing to pay a premium for such products, increasing deman d, firms are incentivized to start producing more of them in order to preserve their market share, maintain their reputation, or even increase profits. According to a 2015 online survey of 30,000 consumers in 60 countries by Nielsen, 66 percent of consumer s say they are willing to pay more for sustainable brands \u2014up from 55 percent in 2014 and 50 percent in 2013. 21 Similarly, some large retailers such as Walmart and Target are also experiencing 21The Nielsen Company, The Sustainability Imperative, New Insights on Consumer Expectations , Global Sustainability R eport (October 2015), 2. increased demand for more sustainable products. Target's sales in natural and organic products are growing at a rate of about 15 to 20 percent per year. This growth resulted in Target launching \"Made to Matter\" in 2014, an initiative showcasing a selection of the company's \"handpicked natural, organic, and sustainable\" products. Walmart created a \"Sustainability Leaders\" website for consumers that rates suppliers on environmental and social criteria. The supply of such products can be influenced by the costs of production, competitive advantage and reputational effects. For example, if some technology or process offers a clear benefit to a firm in terms of lower costs of production, with no effect on quality, firms will have a natural incentive to adopt it. Similarly, if a more sustainable product or use of technology he lps a firm differentiate from another firm and creates a competitive advantage that consumers recognize and value, it will encourage firms to create more sustainable products. The creation of more sustainable products may have a good reputational effect fo r a firm in the minds of consumers, which may even extend to other products made by that firm, regardless of whether those products are also more sustainable. As a result, consumers may start regarding the products of these firms to have a greater quality or additional benefits and show a willingness to pay a premium for them. According to a Nielsen study, commitment to social and environmental responsibility is becoming more important than other traditional influences on consumer loyalty and brand performa nce. 22 Firms may also invest in sustainable chemistry to align 22Nielsen, The Sustainability Imperative , 3. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 13 with internal goals of corporate social responsibility. There are a number of inherent challenges in the market for sustainable products in the industry, such as the upfront costs in the face of uncertain demand. For any new industry, the substantial upfront costs in the face of uncertainty and risk associated with consumer demand would be a substantial barrier or challenge. If the benefits are obvious, firms may be able to increase prices to con sumers to recoup these costs without harming demand; however, if the benefits are not easily understood and measureable (e.g., long- term health benefits), or are external to consumers (e.g., broad environmental impacts), then consumers may not be willing to pay higher prices. Thus, the upfront costs required to create new products or use new technology can be a big challenge, especially when faced with uncertain demand. In addition to market incentives that encourage firms to produce more sustainable produc ts, government can offer subsidies, tax credits, and other incentives. For example, an Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development report on sustainable chemistry patent data identifies positive an d negative tools that aim to stimulate sustainab le chemistry. 23 Positive tools include such things as incentives for the adoption of green chemistry products, training, and award programs, while negative tools include such things as limits, bans, and taxes that discourage use of chemicals of concern. A report on the economic benefits of green 23Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development, Environment Directorate, Sustainable Chemistry: Evidence on Innovation from Patent Data, No. 25 (Paris, France: Feb. 2011), 43-45. chemistry published by the University of Massachusetts found that appropriately designed regulations support innovation, productivity, and employment despite the frequent argument that imposing new standards on the c hemical industry will damage competitiveness and cost the U.S. economy jobs. 24 They argue that just as the federal government has supported innovative developments in agriculture, biotechnology, computers, and the Internet, similar support is needed to buil d a green chemical industry. The report also makes a case for dissemination of environmental and health - related information to help guide the choices of consumers, workers, downstream users, and investors. For new markets and investments to be realized, su fficient information is needed on the environmental damage and health hazards associated with chemicals and the possibilities that exist to develop alternatives that overcome these challenges. Improving resource performance is also key to industry growth, according to a McKinsey report on the circular economy. 25 A linear model of production and consumption in which goods are manufactured from raw materials, sold, used, and then discarded or incinerated as waste is reaching its limits, according to the report . In the face of ongoing resource depletion, McKinsey makes the case for a substantial improvement in resource 24James Heintz and Robert Pollin, Political Economy Research Institute, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 14 performance, urging firms to explore ways to reuse products or their components. Strategies to co -produce other products to make the main product more economically viable are also worth considering, according to the report, and may be another way to become more cost -competitive. 1.5 The sustainability of catalysts A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being substantially consumed in the process. Many chemical reactions require energy input (known as the activation energy) to get the reaction started by 'pushing' the reactants over an initial energy barrier. A catalyst increases reaction rates by providing the reactants with an alternative reaction pathway that has lower activation energy than the uncatalyzed reaction thereby reducing the energy input required for a process (see fig. 3). This is one of the main sustainability advantages provided by catalysts. Figure 3 : Examples of c atalyzed and uncatalyzed reaction energy paths The activation energy for a catalyzed reaction is lower than the activation energy for an uncatalyzed reaction . Lower activation energy results in a faster reaction. In addition to reducing the energy input required for a process, catalysts allow for more efficient use of materials, thus reducing waste. For example, most catalysts can be recovered after the reaction and used again.26 26A 2013 study b y Bravo- Su\u00e1rez and colleagues reported that, among all the catalytic processes used in the industry, Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 15 In addition, catalysts are generally only required in small quantities. They also help to minimize waste by creating a more targeted and selective reaction pathway that forms fewer byproducts. This property, called selectivity, is among the most imp ortant sustainability feature of catalysts. One scientific paper reported that catalysts are a necessary and critical tool for achieving social and economic objectives as described in the 12 Principles, such as the economical use of materials, use of simp le and safe processes, avoidance of toxic chemicals, and reducing or avoiding waste formation. 27 (See app. V for a full list of the 12 Principles.) Today, catalysts play a critical role in promoting the feasibility, sustainability, and economics of over 90 percent of chemical processes.28 Specifically in the pharmaceutical industry, advances in catalysis have enabled the synthesis of highly complex active pharmaceutical ingredients (i.e., drugs) in fewer steps, with increased efficiency in material use, and o ften with high product heterogeneous catalysts (where the catalyst and the reactants are in different phases; e.g., solid catalyst and gaseous reactants) were the most widely use d and constituted 80 percent of the market share. Homogeneous catalysts (where the catalyst and reactants are in the same phase) constituted 17 percent of the market share, with enzymatic catalysts making up the remaining 3 percent. J. J. Bravo- Su\u00e1rez, R. V. Chaudhari, and B. Subramaniam, Design of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Fuels and Chemicals Processing: An Overview (ACS Symposium Series, American Chemical Society: (Washington, D.C., 2013). According to one of our experts, heterogeneous catalysts are rec yclable while homogeneous catalysts generally are not. Centi and Perathoner, \"Catalysis and Sustainable (Green) Chemistry,\" Today , vol. 77 (2003). 28F. Cavani, G. Centi, S. Perathoner, and F. Trifir\u00f2, Sustainable Chemistry: Principles Tools and Industrial Examples , Wiley -VCH (2009) 1 -72. yields.29 Without catalysts, many of the items we use each day such as medicines, fine chemicals, polymers, fibers, fuels, paints, lubricants, much of the food we eat, and a myriad of other products could not be produced in sufficient quantities to meet demand. For all of these reasons, catalysts improve the sustainability of chemical processes. Despite their many benefits, the use of catalysts also raises sustainability concerns. In particular, most catalysts in use today are platinu m group metals (PGM), which are scarce, nonrenewable, and potentially toxic. Platinum group metals (PGM) : PGMs are a group of six very similar chemical elements: platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, and osmium. Their leading role as catalysts stems from their unique characteristics and distinct advantages over other options, including chemical stability, selectivity, and predictable and well understood reaction mechanisms. PGMs are also resistant to the loss of catalytic activity known as catal ytic poisoning. 30 They have higher melting points than base metals \u2014 more earth -abundant metals such as lead or copper \u2014 so they are very stable at high temperatures. As a result, they can retain their catalytic activity for a longer period than other materials when exposed to harsh conditions such as automotive exhaust. PGMs 29An active pharmaceutical ingredient is any component that is intended to provide pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of d isease. In this report, we refer to active pharmaceutical ingredients as \"drugs .\" 30Catalytic poisoning results from the capture of chemicals (often impurities) on sites that would otherwise be available for catalysis. Over time this results in the loss of catalytic activity. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 16 are also recyclable, which means they can be re-used many times, thus minimizing their impact on the environment. Despite their prevalence as catalysts, the scientific community has raise d sustainability concerns about the continued use of PGMs by industry. For example, PGMs are scarce, generally nonrenewable, and susceptible to supply and price fluctuations. Their presence in the earth's crust is orders of magnitude lower than that of ear th-abundant metals. PGMs were included in the European Union's Report on Critical Raw Materials because, by the year 2020, they are expected to have insufficient supply to meet demand. Furthermore, the limited availability of PGMs is exacerbated by the gro wing demand for these materials in other applications, such as newer organic light emitting diode displays in smart phones and televisions, and renewable energy systems, such as fuel cells, wind energy, and photovoltaics. Additionally, PGMs \u2014mainly platinum and palladium \u2014have proven to be indispensable in the automotive industry for catalytic converters, which has driven recent demand. 31 Automotive emissions regulations in the United States and Europe and the burgeoning auto markets in China and India are exp ected to further strain the supply of these metals in the coming years. In addition, exposure to PGMs may be harmful to human health and the environment. As pollutants, PGMs are generally airborne particles; they are a health risk due to their small size and ability to react with many compounds in our body to form 31A catalytic converter is a device incorporated in the exhaust system of a motor vehicle, with a catalyst for converting pollutant gases into harmless products. more toxic compounds. Wiseman et al. reported that exposure to PGMs can lead to oxidat ive stress, pulmonary inflammation, and increased risk of pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.32 There is also some evidence that PGMs can cause autoimmune diseases. The risks are especially high for children and the elderly. Bioaccumulation of these metals in the food chain is another concern even when the environmental levels are not high. For all of these reasons, the scientific community is actively researching options for the replacement of PGMs in catalysis. Potential alternative catalysts include earth - abundant metals (iron, manganese, nickel, and cobalt) and metal -free catalysts such as organ ocatalysts and biocatalysts. 33 We discuss sustainable alternatives to PGMs in chapter 3. 1.6 The sustainability of solvents Rethinking solvent use in a number of different applications is another approach to increase sustainability in the chemical industry. A solvent is a substance capable of dissolving other substances in order to form a homogenous mixture, known as a solution 32C. L. S. Wiseman and F. Zereini, \"Airborne Particulate Matter, Platinum Group Elements and Human Health: A Review of Recent Evidence,\" Science of the Total Environment, vol. 407 (2009). The authors of this paper did an assessment of the risk related to environmental exposures to PGMs, particularly in airborne particulate matter and highlighted the need to monitor environmental levels of PGMs and continue research on their associated toxicity to better assess their potential to elicit health effects in humans. 33Organocatalysts are organic (non -metallic, carbon -based) compounds tha t can serve as catalysts. Biocatalysts are enzymes (proteins originating from living cells) that are used in chemical processes to perform reactions. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 17 (see fig. 4).34 The chemical industry uses solvents for several different purposes, including (a) as media for chemical reactions, (b) in the separation and purification of chemicals, and (c) for cleaning the equipment used in chemical processes. Solvents may also be included as a primary component or ingredient in formulated products such as paints, inks, or cleaning and personal care products. These uses can be interrelated; for example, the choice of reaction medium can facilitate the separation and purification of products. Figure 4: Substan ces dissolve in a solvent to form a homogenous mixture known as a solution Given the variety an d nature of their applications, solvents are used by a variety of industries and constitute a large portion of the total volume of chemicals used in industrial chemical processes. Benchmarking studies of the pharmaceutical industry by the 34A solution can be gaseous, solid, or liquid. ACS GCI Pharmaceu tical Roundtable in 2007 and 2008 showed that organic solvents constitute more than half of the materials by mass that are used to manufacture an active pharmaceutical ingredient. According to one analysis of papers published in 2010 in the journal Green C hemistry , much of the research on more sustainable solvents has focused on reaction media for chemical synthesis. 35 However, this is not the only solvent use for which alternatives could be used . In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, the purification of chemicals can be the largest contributor to solvent waste. Reducing overall solvent use, therefore, can impact the environmental performance, cost, and safety and health issues associated with a process. Additionally, many industries use solvent s, including industries not related to chemical synthesis. For example, in addition to the chemical industry several other industries use solvents for cleaning equipment and other items , including the automotive, electronics, textiles, and paper industries . Many conventional solvents are considered hazardous to both the environment and human health . Many conventional solvents are volatile organic compounds (VOC) \u2014 organic compounds whose composition allows them to evaporate at normal temperatures and pressures. 36 A low boiling 35P. G. Jessop, \"Searching for green solvents,\" Green Chemis try, vol. 13 (2011). 36There are multiple definitions of VOCs. EPA regulations define VOCs as any compound of carbon, with a few exclusions including carbon dioxide, which participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions, except those designated by EPA a s having negligible photochemical activity (40 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.100). However, the more general definition used in this report aligns with the scientific literature and is also used by EPA in certain contexts. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 18 point is advantageous because it facilitates removal of the solvent when it is no longer needed; however, this solvent property is associated with environmental health and safety concerns such as flammability and worker exposure. In additio n, conventional solvents are often toxic to both humans and the ecosystem and can be air pollutants. For the above reasons among others , both legislation and voluntary control measures regarding solvents have been introduced. There is not a single universa l green or sustainable solvent; chemical process es or other solvent application s will have different specifications , and require alternative solvent options that still meet performance characteristics . Solvents can serve multiple purposes when used as reac tion media for chemical processes. For example, the solvent can improve contact between the reactants. Depending on its properties, a solvent can affect the outcome or increase the speed of a reaction. For example, a particular reaction may result in diffe rent products depending on the choice of solvent. It can also stabilize the transition state of the reaction a high er energy species temporarily formed by reactants before forming the final productthus increasing the speed of the reaction. Solvents can al so aid in heat transfer. For reactions that generate heat, for example, a solvent can absorb excess heat thereby preventing runaway, or uncontrollable, reactions. Solvents can be a primary component or ingredient in formulated products, and a 2015 persp ective article from the ACS GCI Formulator's Roundtable highlighted the need for more sustainable solvent alternatives in formulations. 37 Solvents serve a number of purposes in formulated products including dissolving raw materials or essential oils to form the product; or dissolving unwanted materials, for example grease or ink, for cleaning. The authors of the perspective article stated that suitable alternatives must continue to meet key performance characteristics for these products, including cleaning benefits such as grease removal, stabilizing the formulation by keeping other ingredients in solution , and modifying particular physical properties in the final formulation. They also stated that alternative solvents should:38 be sourced from renewable, non - petroleum feedstocks; undergo a life cycle assessment that includ es the impact of solvent manufacture in addition to solvent use; show no reproductive toxicity and have low toxicity, in general, to humans; be non -sensitizing and non -irritating; and have minimal odor or color . We discuss more sustainable solvent use in chapter 4. 37P. G. Jessop, F. Ahmadpour, M. A. Buczynski , T. J. Burns, N. B. Green II, R. Korwin, D. Long, S. K. Massad, J. B. Manley, N. Omidbakhsh, R.

Wolf, \"Opportunities for Greener Alternatives in Chemical Formulations,\" Gre en Chemistry , vol. 17 (2015). 38The authors also mentioned that alternative solvents should meet the EPA Design for the Environment criteria for acceptable formulation ingredients. The Safer Choice Label replaced the Design for the Environment label in 2015 . For more on the EPA Safer Choice program see chapter 6. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 19 1.7 The sustainability of batch processing Historically, industrial chemicals have been produced mainly using an approach known as batch proce ssing. Batch processing is a discontinuous process. That is, finite quantities of raw materials (the reactants) and any other necessary components such as catalysts or solvents are combined in a closed vessel or vat \u2014also called a batch reactor\u2014 under approp riate conditions of temperature and pressure. The reaction takes place as the contents of the vessel are stirred and allowed to react together. When the reaction has proceeded as far as desired, the resulting mixture is transferred to the next vat or react or for the next stage of processing, the first vat is cleaned, and the process is repeated with the next batch. Batch processing is typically suitable for higher value, small- scale production, and when a range of different products such as pigments, dyes, and polymers are all produced using the same equipment. It is also well suited for reactions with long reaction times. Batch processing is currently used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food process industries . Batch processing can occur at small scales \u2014 for example, a chemical synthesis could be done in a test tube or a flask \u2014but in most of the chemical industry , it is typically a large - scale approach. Therefore , batch reactors typically have a large physical footprint (i.e., require significant space) . Batch processing raises other sustainability concerns as well. For example, cleaning the vats between batches can use significant amounts of cleaning solvents and energy. Researchers have reported that the large -scale operations often associated with bat ch processing may also pose a safety risk under some circumstances, such as when high pressures are required to complete a reaction or when a hazardous intermediate is produced during the course of a reaction. 39 Other considerations include potentially long wait times while a batch is processing and high capital expenses. Continuous processing (also known as continuous flow) is an alternative that allows chemical reactions to occur as the reaction mixture is pumped through a continuous processing line compo sed of pipes or tubes where reactions take place continuously. Reactants can be introduced and byproducts removed at appropriate points along the line; finished product materials are continuously removed at the end of the line. Microreactors are a specifi c technology that allows continuous processing to be conducted in relatively small volumes. 40 Continuous processing microreactors have enabled new paradigms in sustainable chemistry such as alternative reaction pathways, less hazardous and energy -efficient syntheses, and low - solvent or solvent -free reactions, among others. See chapter 5 for our discussion on the sustainability of continuous processing and microreactors. 39B. P. Mason, K. E. Price, J. L. Steinbacher, A. R. Bogdan, and D. T. McQuade, \"Greener Approaches to Organic Synthesis Using Microreactor Technology,\" Chemical Reviews , vol. 107, no. 6 (2007). 40A microreactor can be defined as a technology that couples the miniaturization of chemical reactors with continuous flow. This approach can provide optimal reaction conditions and eliminate typical scale -up problems. In this technology assessment we focus on applications of microreactors in the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to microreactors there are other types of reactors reported in the literature for more sustainable chemical processing and synthesis, including spinning disk reactors, cavitational reactors, and membrane bioreactors, among others. We have chosen to not include these additional reactor types in this technology assessment. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 20 2 Stakeholders vary in how they define and assess the sustainability of chemical processes and products Stakeholders define sustainable chemistry in a variety of ways. In addition, they use many different approaches for assessing the sustainability of chemical processes and products. For example, some chemical companies have designed their own in -house tools for assessing the sustainability of their own processes and products, while others use common methods considered appropriate by their industry sector. Stakeholders such a s federal agencies, professional associations, and non -governmental organizations have developed a variety of third -party certification and measurement programs to assess the sustainability of products and companies. However, these programs vary in the criteria they use and the factors they consider important to assess, making comparisons between them difficult. Similarly, chemical companies that responded to our survey vary widely on the environmental and health factors they consider most important to include when assessing sustainability. Nonetheless, most responding companies agreed that a standardized set of such factors for assessing sustainability across their industry sector and across the entire chemical industry would be somewhat or very useful. 2.1 Stakeholder definitions of sustainable chemistry vary Stakeholders do not agree on a single definition of sustainable chemistry, but there are some common understandings of what this term means. In total, we asked 71 representatives of stakeholder organizati ons how they or their organization define sustainable chemistry. 41 The most common response we received, with 28 respondents agreeing, was that sustainable chemistry includes minimizing the use of non -renewable resources such as feedstocks. The second most common response (27) was that sustainable chemistry is similar, synonymous, or interchangeable with green chemistry. However, 17 stakeholders described sustainable chemistry as broader than green chemistry. Stakeholders mentioned various ways in which sust ainable chemistry may go beyond green chemistry, for example by considering the entire life cycle of a process or product, or by incorporating economic considerations. Other concepts that stakeholders commonly associated with sustainable chemistry include d: minimizing the negative impact of chemicals, products, or processes on the environment (24) as well as human health and safety (17); considering various factors in each phase of the life cycle, including potential tradeoffs (23); minimizing the use of t oxic or hazardous chemicals (22) and increasing the use of environmentally benign chemicals in products and processes (7); 41Stakeholders we interviewed included federal and state officials, chemical companies, industry and professional organizations, academics and educational institutions, NGOs, and others. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 21 minimizing energy (22) and water use (14); conserving or using resources and materials efficiently (21); minimizing waste and pollution, particularly hazardous waste (20); including economic considerations such as cost (12); minimizing the impact of product end of life, for example by increasing biodegradability or recyclability (9); and encouraging innovation and the creation of new p rocesses (9). For the purposes of this report, we refer to a chemical process, product, or technology as 'more sustainable' compared to a conventional alternative if it better aligns with one or more of the goals above or with one or more of the 12 Princip les. 2.2 Stakeholders vary in the approaches they use for assessing the sustainability of chemical processes and products Stakeholders such as chemical companies, federal agencies, and others use many different approaches for assessing the sustainability of ch emical processes and products. For example, some chemical companies have designed their own systems for assessing sustainability, while others use a common approach considered appropriate by their industry sector. While the varying approaches provide flexibility to meet the priorities of the user, the lack of a standardized approach makes it very difficult for customers, decision makers, and others to compare the sustainability of various products to make informed decisions. 2.2.1 Company -designed approaches Som e companies and organizations design their own approaches for assessing chemical sustainability and use those approaches to make internal decisions on product design and processing. For example, the pharmaceutical and healthcare company GlaxoSmithKline has created the GSK Solvent Sustainability Guide, which combines multiple health, environment, safety, and waste categories to reach a single composite score and color assignment for each of the 154 solvents included in the 2016 version of the guide. 42 Dow Ch emical uses an internally developed metric called the Dow Chemical Sustainability Footprint Tool that asks 23 questions across six dimensions: economic, social, greenhouse gas emissions, water use, nonrenewable resource requirement, and a company dimension .43 Many of the questions involve comparisons of a project or new idea with an incumbent project (the base case) that delivers an equivalent service to the end user. For example, one question asks the end user to assess whether the toxicity profile of the new product \" is expected to: [considerably improve / slightly improve / remain the 42For additional details, see C.M. \"Updating and Expanding GSK's Solvent Sustainabil ity Guide,\" Green Chemistry , vol. 18, no. 13 (2016). 43For additional details, see D. A. M. Russell and D. L. Shiang, \"Thinking about More Sustainable Products: Using an Efficient Tool for Sustainability Education, Innovation, and Project Management to Encourage Sustainability Thinking in a Multinational Corporation,\" ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, vol. 1, no. 1 (2013). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 22 same / get worse] compared to the current product -service provided to the end user.\" The questions allow Dow to rate each project on a 7 -point scale for each of the six dime nsions, where a higher number is a less desirable ( i.e., less sustainable) result. Dow then combines the scores for each of the six dimensions into a diagram that visually presents the sustainability footprint for the project (see fig. 5). The goal is to a chieve a smaller footprint inside the web, indicating improved sustainability. For an entirely new project that has no incumbent project for comparison, Dow assigns the base case score of 5.0 to encourage future sustainability improvements. Figure 5: A hypothetical result for the Dow Chemical Sustainability Footprint Tool Dow can use this tool to assess an entirely new project or to compare a newly developed approach (represented in this hypothetical example by the colored polygon) to an existing approach (represented by the blue hexagonal line at the 5.0 mark). 2.2.2 Common approaches used to assess sustainability Some stakeholders assess the sustainability of chemical processes and products us ing a common approach that others also accept as appropriate. These include metrics, chemical selection guides, and third -party certifications. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 23 Metrics Companies in the chemical industry use several established metrics to measure their efficiency in using materials to generate products; each metric accounts for one or more factors related to the efficiency of chemical processes. For example, the scientific literature reports a variety of metrics including atom economy, carbon efficiency, mass intensity, process mass efficiency, solvent intensity, and wastewater intensity, among others. 44 Each of these metrics is calculated using a different set of underlying factors, such as the amount of waste produced, the yield of the desired product, solvent use, and w ater use. The variety of metrics used \u2014and variation in the underlying factors included in their calculation \u2014hinders the ability of companies and others to compare the sustainability of chemical processes or products. Although a full discussion of these me trics and others is beyond the scope of this report, mass -based metrics \u2014that is, metrics that assess a chemical process based on the total mass of materials used or the mass of waste produced \u2014are common. According to scientific literature, t he Environmenta l factor (E factor) and process mass intensity (PMI) are two examples of commonly used mass - based metrics. E factor: R.A. Sheldon published the first paper describing the E factor in 1992, based on discoveries about the enormity of the waste problem result ing from methods in use 44See F. Roschangar, R. A. Sheldon, and C.H. Senanayake, \"Overcoming Barriers to Green Chemistry in the Pharmaceutical Industry - the Green Aspiration Level Concept,\" Green Chemistry , vol. 17, no. 2 (2015). at that time across different segments of the chemical industry.45 He and his coworkers conducted an inventory of the amounts of waste generated in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceutical intermediates, and some bulk chemica ls. They calculated the results using a new quantitative metric: In the original 1992 paper, Sheldon defined waste as \"everything but the desired product,\" including solvent losses but excluding water. An ideal process would have an E factor of zero (no waste produced) , and higher E factors indicate more waste and thus (presumably) greater negative environmental impact. Sheldon's inventory indicated that the production of bulk chemicals had E factors ranging from less than 1 to 5 \u2014that is, up to 5 kg of wa ste produced per kg of product. E factors for fine chemicals were higher, ranging from 5 to 50, and for pharmaceuticals the E factors ranged from 25 to greater than 100 kg of waste produced per kg of product . According to Sheldon, lower E factors correlat e well with reduced manufacturing costs for drug ingredients, which reflects lower materials input and reduced hazardous waste disposal, among other factors. This provides an economic incentive for companies to reduce waste in their chemical processes. How ever, simply reducing the amount of waste, even to a significant degree compared to the original process , does not 45R. A. Sheldon, \"Organic Synthesis - Past, Present, and Future,\" Chemistry and Industry , vol. 23 (1992). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 24 indicate an optimized process.46 The process may still be inefficient and have unnecessarily adverse environmental impacts. Specifically, two issues with the use of E factors affect the interpretation of results. First, the final E factor depends on the boundaries used for the calculation. Sheldon's original formula set gate -to-gate boundaries \u2014that is, the starting point was the material entering the factory gate and the end was the product leaving it. However, in a later paper Sheldon noted that this gate -to-gate approach could lead to inconsistenci es in the application of E factors, given that purchasing an intermediate rather than producing it in -house can allow a company to claim a dramatically lower E factor.47 He suggests that one possibility to avoid this inconsistency is to define the starting point as a commodity -type, commercially available raw material. As an example, he describes a process for the manufacture of the drug ingredient sildenafil citrate in which using the original formula (including an estimate of 10 percent of solvents going t o waste and excluding water) gives an E factor of 6.4 kg waste per kg product for the production process. However, one of the primary raw materials does not meet the definition of a commodity -type chemical; including the intrinsic E factor resulting from t he production of that raw material more than doubles the E factor to 13.8 kg waste per kg product. A second issue is that the E factor does not differentiate between wastes that are relatively benign and 46F. Roschangar, R. A. Sheldon, and C.H. Senanayake, \"Overcoming Barriers to Green Chemistry in the Pharmaceutical Industry - the Green Aspiration Level Concept,\" Green Chemistry , vol. 17, no. 2 (2015). 47R.A. Sheldon, \"The E Factor 25 Years On: The Rise of Green Chemistry and Sustainability,\" Green Chemistry , vol. 19, no. 1 (2017) . those that are highly toxic and environmentally pers istent. Therefore, one process with a low E factor (based on producing a relatively small amount of highly toxic waste) may actually be much more environmentally harmful than another process with a higher E factor where the waste, although produced in larger quantities, is environmentally benign. Process Mass Intensity (PMI) : The ACS GCI Pharmaceutical Roundtable has identified PMI as the key mass -based metric for the pharmaceutical industry. In a 2011 publication discussing the rationale for this selection , the authors noted the routine use of PMI to benchmark the greenness of processes and to drive greater efficiency and innovation in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. 48 PMI is a measure of the total mass of materials used per mass of product : The calculation includes the mass of reactants, reagents, catalysts, and solvents , including water, used for the reaction or for purification. In an ideal situation, no waste is produced and all materials are incorporated into the product, resulting in PMI = 1. Benchmarking analyses conducted by the Pharmaceutical Roundtable in 2008 indicated that solvents make up the majority (56 48C. Jimenez -Gonzalez, C.S. Ponder, the Right Green Yardstick: Why Process Mass Intensity Is Used in the Pharmaceutical Industry To Drive More Sustainable Processes,\" Organic Process Research & Development , vol. 15 , no. 4 (2011). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 25 percent) of the total mass of materials used to manufacture drug ingredients, with water (32 percent) making up much of the remaining mass.49 The Roundtable uses PMI to compare data from each company on an equivalent basis, starting from commonly available materials. This approach accounts for all steps in the synthesis of a drug ingredient regardless of whether a company perfor ms all steps in -house or outsources some of them. Although PMI does not account for many possible factors that a full LCA would include, the Pharmaceutical Roundtable reported that PMI correlates well with the life cycle global warming potential and life cycle water use of a portfolio of pharmaceutical chemical processes, and thus can be a convenient surrogate for a more time -consuming and complicated LCA. 50 Further, they report that PMI is a better surrogate for assessing cumulative environmental effects than the E factor. Chemical selection guides In addition to common metrics, some sectors have developed guides that companies and others can use to compare the sustainability of materials used in chemical processes. These include solvent selection guides an d reagent guides. 49Jimenez -Gonzalez, Ponder, Broxterman, and Manley, 913. 50Jimenez -Gonzalez, Ponder, Broxterman, and Manley, \"Using the Right Green Yardstick,\" 915. Solvent selection guides: Several pharmaceutical companies as well as industry consortia, including the Pharmaceutical Roundtable, have developed or made publicly available solvent selection guides to help chemists make informed solvent choices for use in chemical processes. 51 Thes e guides assess both conventional and newer solvents based on a variety of sustainability criteria, such as life cycle analysis; environmental, health, and safety impacts; recyclability; and regulatory concerns, among others. Several pharmaceutical companies have published multiple iterations of their guides, expanding and updating them as new data and solvents become available. Some guides rank solvents by preference , while others do not give an overall recommendation but rather provide users with addition al information to consider in conjunction with relevant process specifications. Many of the published guides attempt to present the data in a simplified manner, for example, by color coding solvents from the most (green) to least (red) sustainable, while s till providing access to more detailed assessments in recognition that simple systems may mask the complexity of solvent selection (see fig. 6). 51More information about solvents, including access to thei r solvent selection guide, is available from the Pharmaceutical Roundtable at https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/research -innovation/research -topics/solvents.html (accessed September 12, 2017). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 26 Figure 6: Excerpt from the ACS GCI Pharmaceutical Roundtable solvent s election guide The creators of these guides have stated a variety of goals for their development in addition to improving process sustainability. One pharmaceutical company reported that one aim of their guide is to highlight the use of more sustainab le solvents including those of limited availability, thereby incentivizing manufacturers to increase supply. The increasing regulation of certain potentially hazardous solvents has also encouraged the development of selection guides. For example, another o bjective of some guides is to reduce the use of chlorinated solvents, which pharmaceutical companies wide ly use early in the drug development process . These solvents pose environmental health and safety issues and face a growing legislative burden in some cases. One pharmaceutical company reported a 50 percent decrease in the use of chlorinated solvents after the introduction of a solvent selection guide. Reagent guides: The Pharmaceutical Roundtable and pharmaceutical companies have also released reagent g uides with a similar aim of helping scientists to make informed decisions regarding reagent sustainability. 52 The Pharmaceutical Roundtable organize s their guides by selected chemical transformations (e.g., oxidation of an alcohol functional group) and has assembled them together in an interactive online tool. 53 Users can select a transformation to read an overview of various known methods, a list of reagents from which to choose, and a Venn diagram comparing the reagents ( see fig. 7). Although the Pharmaceut ical Roundtable designed the guides to promote green chemistry, they also included reagents not considered 'green' with the aim of creating a more exhaustive reference. The Venn diagram provides a visual depiction of which reagents meet the three criteria of wide utility, scalability, and greenness of the various reagents. In the ethos of the guides, the Pharmaceutical Roundtable encourages scientists to use the guides a part of a holistic approach \u2014to 52In this case, a reagent refers to a substance that is added to a mixture to cause a reaction, which we generally refer to as a reactant in this report. 53The reagent guides are available at https://www.reagentguides.com/ (accessed October 20, 2017) . The guides are available for use following registration. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 27 consider how reagent selection affects sustainability of the overall process and not just reagent 'greenness.' Figure 7: Exam ple Venn diagram from GCI Pharmaceutical Roundtable reagent guide Third -party certifications and assessment tools NGOs, federal agencies, and professional associations are also developing methods for measuring and assessing the relative sustainability of products and processes, including product certification programs and assessment tools. One approach to measure sustainab ility is the use of third -party certifications. Companies that we surveyed told us that they use third -party certifications to provide independent verification of sustainability that may be attractive to customers. Certification programs examine a range of different sustainability factors for products and processes. Each program sets minimum criteria that products must meet to be certified, including, for example, biodegradability, toxicity, performance, or water and energy usage. Certifying bodies make dat abases of certified products available online for public access and allow manufacturers to affix certification labels or logos to their products. Certifications are available from federal offices, such as EPA's Safer Choice or USDA's BioPreferred programs, from non -profit organizations, such as the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute and Green Seal, or from private companies, such as UL's EcoLogo program. See table 2 for examples of certification programs and a summary of the criteria each uses t o measure sustainability. For additional information on certification programs, see chapter 6.

Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 29 Furthermore, manufacturers and formulators can also make use of tools designed to facilitate internal or business -to-business assessmen ts and benchmarking to measure sustainability. For example, Clean Production Action Network , Lowell Center for Sustainable Production, and Pure Strategies developed the Chemical Footprint Project, an assessment tool for companies to measure their progress toward the use of safer chemicals. The tool measures company performance on a 100 point scale based on the company's chemical management strategy and policies , chemical inventory and data collection practices , measures and goal- setting on sustainability , and public disclosure and verification practices. Another example of an assessment tool is the Higg Index. The index, an industry framework for measuring and evaluating sustainability at the brand, facility, or product level, was developed by the apparel an d footwear industry, retailers, brands, suppliers, and other stakeholders working through the Sustainable Apparel Coalition . An internal tool that assesses sustainability across a product life cycle, the index measures a number of factors including energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, waste, water, chemical management , and social impacts, among others. A compan y can share its index performance score with other companies in its product supply chain . Project staff also aggregate and anonymize the scores so that companies can benchmark their progress against others in the industry and identify areas for improvement. For examples of questions used in the Chemical Footprint Project and Higg Index assessments, see table 3. Table 3: Selected questions from the Chemical Footprint Project and Higg Index assessment tools related to sustainable chemistry Chemical Footprint Project Does your company have a chemicals policy that aims to avoid chemicals of high concern?

In order to examine these differences in detail, we surveyed 27 chemical companies and asked respondents to indicate the relative importance their company gives Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 30 to each of 13 environmental and health factors. Specifically, we presented the factors in pairs (e.g., factor A with factor B) and asked respondents to select the factor in each pair for which they considered it most important to maximize the sustainability benefit, even if that benefit came at the expense of the other factor in the pair. For example, a company might compare 'energy use' with 'water use' and determine that it was more important to their company to maximize the sustainability benefit relative to the ' energy use' of a process even if it resulted in less sustainable use of water. (See app. IV (question 6) for a complete list of response counts for each pair of factors .) The 13 environmental and health factors we examined in the survey were: Percentage o f renewable or biobased content Amount of materials required Toxicity of required materials Energy use Water use Land use/physical footprint Greenhouse gas emissions Other air emissions Volume of process waste generated Toxicity of process waste Recyclabi lity of (or other uses for) process waste Toxicity of the product Recyclability of the product We analyzed the results by assigning 1 point for a factor each time a company chose that factor as more important than another factor and \u00bd point each time a com pany chose that factor as equal to another factor. Figure 8 provides median of the company -assigned scores for each factor, with the 13 factors arranged from top to bottom in order based on the median score each factor earned. 'Toxicity of the product' ear ned the highest median score of 11.5 points (i.e., most important factor) and 'percentage of renewable or biobased content' earned the lowest median score of 1.5 points (i.e., least important factor). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 31 Figure 8: The median score assign ed to each factor by the companies that responded to our survey A low score for a given factor indicates that a company considered it more important to maximize the sustainability benefits of other environmental or health factors rather than the given factor. A higher score indicates that a company considered it important to maximize the sustainability benefits of the given factor rather than other factors. In addition to the median scores, we also examined the full range of scores assigned to each factor by the companies that responded to our survey. A narrow range of responses indicates general agreement among the 15 responding companies regarding the importance of that factor compared to the other 12 factors. Such factors include: toxicity of the product, volume of process waste generated, and land use/physical footprint . For example, 7 of the responding companies gave 'toxicity of the product' a score of 12 points (see fig. 9, top graph), indicating that these companies judged it most important to maximize the sustainability of this factor over any other fa ctor. In fact, 10 of the 15 respondents gave 'toxicity of the product' a score of at least 10.5 points. Interestingly, 3 companies gave this factor a score of 0 points, meaning that they never judged it more important (or equally important) to maximize the sustainability of this factor compared to the other factors. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 32 Figure 9: Company -assigned scores for three environmental or health factors A low score for a given factor indicates that a company considered it more important to maximize the sustainability benefits of other environmental or health factors rather than the given factor. A higher score indicates that a company considered it important to maximize the sustainability benefits of the given factor rather than other factors. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 33 As shown in figure 9 (middle graph) , scores for 'land use/physical footprint' were clustered from 0 to 4 points with the exception of a single score of 10 poin ts. In fact, 12 of the 15 respondents gave 'land use/physical footprint' a score from 0 to 2 points. That clustering of scores at the low end indicates that the responding companies generally agreed that this was a less important factor compared to the oth er factors, although one company had a very different view of this factor. Similarly, scores for 'volume of process waste generated' (fig. 9, bottom graph ) were generally clustered in the middle of the range (from 4 to 8.5 points), indicating agreement amo ng most respondents that this factor is moderately important to maximize for sustainability compared to the other factors. In contrast, figure 10 shows two factors that earned an exceptionally wide range of scores, indicating considerable lack of agreement among responding companies regarding their importance: amount of materials required and greenhouse gas emissions. Figure 10: Company -assigned scores for two environmental factors A low score for a given factor indicates that a company considered it more important to maximize the sustainability benefits of other environmental or health factors rather than the given factor. A higher score indicates that a company considered it important to maximize the sustainability benefits of the give n factor rather than other factors. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 34 As shown in figure 10 (top graph) , scores for 'amount of materials required' ranged from 0 to 10.5 points, with no single score having agreement from more than 2 respondents. The scores for 'greenhouse gas emissions' (fig. 10, bottom graph ) exhibited an even wider range, from 0.5 to 12 points. From these data, it is clear that the responding companies had a wide range of views regarding the importance of maximizing the sustainability benefits of these two factors. In addition to determining the individual company scores for each factor, we also added the points across all 15 responding companies to produce a total score for each factor, with a maximum possible score of 180 points. 54 We interpreted factors with higher overall scores to be relatively more important to our survey respondents as a group compared to factors with lower overall scores (see fig. 11). 54Fifteen companies responded to this question on our survey and each company could give a maximum score of 12 to a single factor, so the maximum possible score each factor could earn was 180 points (i.e., 12 points from a given company multiplied by 15 companies). Figure 11: The total scores for each factor across all 15 responding compa nies Note: Partial scores (e.g., 84.5) were rounded up to the next whole number. Our survey respondents represented companies in three industry sectors: chemical manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and formulators (i.e., makers of personal care and cleaning products). There were some noteworthy differences among sectors in their views on the importance of these 13 factors ( see table 4).

For example, s takeholders in the sustainable chemistry c ommunity have reported in the literature that the lack of a clear definition and agreed upon standards for assessing the sustainability of chemical processes and products inhibits the advancement of the goals of sustainable chemistry. According to the Gree n Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3), the lack of a clear definition and metrics for measuring green chemistry can lead to confusion in the marketplace. Such misunderstandings occur where innovations that are not truly \"green\" are mislabeled as such. 55 Moreover, academic 55GC3 is a cross -sectoral business- to-business network of firms working collabora tively to accelerate green chemistry. See J.A. Tickner and M. Becker, \"Mainstreaming Green Chemistry: The literature on green chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry has described the current green chemistry community as one that is dealing with a plethora of similar metrics without standardized definitions or agreed upon process starting points, inhibiting industry -wide green chemistry integration. 56 It is difficult for consumers, purchasers, policymakers, and even manufacturers to compare the sustainability of one process or product with another when such processes and products are assesse d using different metrics that incorporate different factors. The stakeholders we interviewed also had varying definiti ons of sustainable chemistry and disagreed about whether it was the same as green chemistry. In addition, the companies that responded t o our survey varied significantly with regard to which environmental and health factors they Need for Metrics,\" Current Opinion in Green and Sustainable Chemistry , vol. 1 (2016). 56Roschangar, Sheldon, and Senanayake, \"Overcoming Barriers to Gr een Chemistry,\" 2015. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 36 considered most important to prioritize when optimizing the sustainability of a chemical process or product, as discussed in section 2.3. Despite this variation of opinion on the importance of different factors, most companies responding to our survey agreed that it would be somewhat or very useful to have a standardized set of factors for assessing sustainability across their industry sector and (to a lesser degree) across the entire industry. Specifically, most respondents indicated that it would be useful for all companies in their sector to use a common set of factors for assessing sustainability (see table 5). Respondents also indicated that it would be useful f or all companies across the entire chemical industry to use common factors, but the responses to that question were not as strong. Table 5: Company responses when asked how useful it would be for all companies to use a standard set of factors when assessing sustainability How useful would it be for all companies in your sector to use a standardized set of factors for assessing sustainability? How useful would it be for all companies across the entire chemical industry to use a standardized set of factors for assessing sustainability?

Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 37 3 Technologies to make catalysts more sustainable According to one of our experts, catalysts have long been known to provide economic and environmental benefits. For e xample, most chemical companies conduct significant research and development in catalysis (action of a catalyst), according to this expert. Platinum group metals (PGMs) are the most frequently used catalysts for a variety of industrial applications. Howeve r, PGMs are expensive, scarce, generally non -renewable, and susceptible to supply and price fluctuations. Their continued use has raised sustainability concerns among the scientific community. Current research efforts are directed at finding alternatives t o PGMs , such as earth -abundant metals. Metal -free catalysts such as organocatalysts and biocatalysts (catalysts having a biological origin) are other emerging options that are gaining popularity with the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries. Due to their potential advantages, the industry has begun to research and implement these options as alternatives to PGMs in some chemical processes. See table 6 for our assessment of alternative catalyst technologies; we provide additional details in the remain der of the chapter. Table 6: Summary of assessment of selected catalyst technologies as alternatives to platinum group metals (PGM) Technology Advantages Disadvantages Earth -abundant metals Relatively less costly with fewer supply fluctuations than precious metals. Abundance and relatively low toxicity relaxes the recycling and separation burden, resulting in lowering of operational costs.

Biodegradable and derived from renewable resources. Enzymatic polymerization can be used to synthesize commodity plastics, and new environmental ly friendly polymers that may not have a traditional chemical route of production. Bioc atalytic or enzymatic route s have realized significant improvements in productivity in the development of many life-saving pharmaceutical drugs. The use of water as a so lvent can result in a large amounts of water as a waste product that would typically need treatment leading to additional economic and energy costs. Performing reactions in water instead of organic solvents can reduce the solubility of some reactants. Majority of biocatalysts are unstable, and difficult to recycle and reuse. However, immobilization techniques can help mitigate this problem and make their utilization in biotechnological processes more favorable. Source: GAO. | GAO -18-307 3.1 Earth -abundant metal catalysts One option for improving the sustainability of catalysts is to replace PGMs with more earth - abundant metals such as nickel, iron, cobalt, titanium, copper, and others. According to a company scientist w e interviewed, these metals are not only more abundant in nature but are generally less toxic than PGMs. Nickel is one of the most commonly used earth - abundant metals. It has chemical properties similar to palladium and platinum and is capable of performin g many of the same reactions. Iron is the second most abundant metal in earth's upper crust and is an essential element for human life. For example, the iron complex in hemoglobin (a protein contained in red blood cells) acts like a catalyst that binds to oxygen and helps transport it to the tissues of the body. Cobalt is also an essential metal for humans. It is present in vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and its radioactive form is widely used for medical applications. However, it is gaining traction as a catalyst as well. Catalysts derived from these metals offer several advantages over PGMs but also have trade -offs that should be considered. These metals are used as catalysts in some key industrial processes and researchers are continuing to seek additional appli cations. However, despite the recent advances in this field, the industry has generally been slow to replace PGMs for several reasons, including risk aversion and an incomplete understanding of the newer catalytic mechanisms, according to an ACS article. Advantages and disadvantages of earth- abundant metal catalysts Earth -abundant metal catalysts offer several advantages that could make chemical processes and products more sustainable, including generally lower toxicity, a range of applications, and reduced costs. Relatively less toxic : Some earth -abundant metal catalysts are relatively non toxic and environmentally friendly. For example, iron is relatively nontoxic compared to palladium and nickel. Titanium is also considered Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 39 nontoxic, and is biocompa tible \u2014attractive features for handling and disposal\u2014 and thus potentially a sustainable catalyst. Their low toxicity can mitigate the need for the often energy -intensive separation and recycling processes. That is, unlike PGMs, it is often acceptable if a t race amount of an earth - abundant metal such as iron ends up in a final product; this might eliminate costly and time - consuming purification processes. Range of potential applications : Because earth -abundant metals such as nickel and iron have a wide range of available oxidation states, they are more versatile as catalysts.57 For example, depending on its oxidation state, iron can be used to either donate or accept electrons in a chemical reaction. Thus, iron catalysts can facilitate a broad range of syntheti c transformations. In addition, nickel is reported to be enantioselective for many different reactions, offering the potential for reducing waste by avoiding unwanted byproducts. 58 Reduced costs : Using earth -abundant metal catalysts such as iron and nickel in place of PGMs can help reduce costs. For example, various iron salts and iron complexes are commercially available on a large scale or are easy to synthesize, thus they are a low cost 57Oxidation state, also called oxidation number, is a number assigned to a particular atom in a molecular entity that represents the relative charge on that atom. For metals, it indicates the total number of electrons that the atom eit her gains or loses in order to form a chemical bond with another atom. 58An enantiomer is one of a pair of molecules which are non - superimposable mirror images of each other. Because enantiomers can have different properties, often one form is preferred ove r the other. Enantioselectivity is the preferential formation of one enantiomer over another in a chemical reaction, which reduces waste by reducing the amount of the unwanted enantiomer that forms. alternative to PGMs. Similarly, nickel costs significantly less than PGMs \u2014about 2,000 times less than palladium and 10,000 times less than platinum , according to a published 2014 review by academic researchers .59 In addition, earth -abundant metals tend to have fewer supply fluctuations than PGMs. Furthermore, because these m etals are less expensive and more abundant, it is not as crucial that they be completely recovered for reuse, which may also lift an economic burden. However, earth -abundant metal catalysts also have trade -offs that must be considered. Instability and ten dency to react with other elements : Earth -abundant metals have not been extensively studied as replacements for PGMs, and only recently have become a significant area of research. Furthermore, progress in earth -abundant metal catalysts has lagged due to ch allenges associated with their inherent reactivity (tendency to react with other elements), which causes instability as well as difficulties with selectivity and scope. That is, their selectivity is lower relative to PGMs and the scope of the reactions is limited. Lack of \"drop -in\" substitutability : Another consideration is that earth -abundant metals cannot simply be interchanged in place of PGMs. New and more expensive ligands, mechanisms, and reaction conditions may be necessary in order to successfully u se earth - abundant metals as industrial catalysts . 60 In 59S. Z. Tasker, E . T. \"Recent Advances in Homogeneous Nickel Catalysis,\" Nature , vol. 509 (2014). 60A ligand is an ion or molecule that binds to a central metal atom to form a complex. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 40 addition, earth -abundant catalysts are compatible with fewer functional groups compared with PGMs.61 Toxicity concerns : Some earth -abundant metal catalysts still raise toxicity concerns. For example, des pite nickel's presence in natural biological enzyme complexes and metabolic pathways, it may be carcinogenic. Therefore, despite its sustainability advantages over palladium and platinum, it can have significant drawbacks when used to catalyze pharmaceutic al reactions . A recent study has reported that the concept of toxic heavy metals and safe nontoxic alternatives based on lighter metals should be re -evaluated. 62 According to the authors of this study, a comparison of the toxicological data indicates that p alladium and platinum compounds may be less toxic than previously thought, whereas complexes of nickel and copper, typically assumed to be sustainable alternatives, may possess significant toxicities due to their solubility in water and biological fluids. In addition, a pharmaceutical company official we interviewed told us that earth - abundant metals can be just as toxic as rarer metals. Applications of earth -abundant metal catalysts Earth -abundant metals are used in some key industrial processes such as t he Haber -Bosch process, a well- known but highly unsustainable reaction that uses iron as a 61A functional group is a group of atoms that helps define chemical properties of a molecule. 62K.

More recently, some researchers are exploring iron - catalyzed reduction of carbon dioxide to methane to supplement fossil -fuel sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other examples of the use of earth -abundant catalysts include steam reforming, which uses nickel for the production of syngas; the FischerTropsch synthesis, which uses cobalt, iron, and syngas for the production of hydrocarbon chains; and the watergas shift reaction, which uses iron, chromium, copper, and zinc to convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and hydrogen. 63 More recently , applications of nickel catalysts instead of palladium -based catalysts in the Suzuki -Miyaura cross -coupling demonstrate a more sustainable alternative catalytic route.64 Cobalt is very promising in the activation and functionalization of bonds.65 Specifically, researchers have reported many functionalization strategies that use cobalt to form carbon -hydrogen bonds. These are viable replacements for current PGM catalytic approaches. Activation of the carbon - hydrogen bond can improve the efficiency of a reaction by eliminating certain synthesis 63Syngas (or synthesis gas) is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide . 64Cross -coupling refers to one of the most fundamental reactions in organic synthesis for carbon -carbon bond formation. Cross -coupling reactions combine two molecular fragments and lead to the formation of new bonds. In 2010 the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Akira Suzuki and two other scientists for the development of palladium -catalyzed cross -coupling reactions. The committee recognized the remarkable impact of this class of reactions on academic research and the development of new dr ugs and materials. 65Carbon -hydrogen bond functionalization is a type of reaction in which a carbon -hydrogen bond is cleaved and replaced with a carbon -X bond where X is usually a carbon- , oxygen -, or nitrogen -containing group such as OH or NH 2. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 41 steps. It may also be useful in converting renewable feedstocks into high -value chemicals. Cobalt is also used in many other types of chemical reactions. Titanium complexes are used to catalyze a broad range o f transformations including polymerizations. 66 For example, titanium dioxide has become an important photocatalyst in environmental bio - decontamination for a large variety of organics, bacteria, viruses, and fungi. 67 Titanium -based catalysts are commercially used on a large scale for the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen compounds in air pollution control. Researchers have shown that titanium -based catalysts can transform the toxic pollutants of automobile exhaust emissions under ultraviolet irradiation. This property is used to develop a titanium -based photocatalytic converter for automobiles, thereby avoiding the use of PGMs and reducing costs. Recently, Dow Chemical and BASF jointly developed an innovative sustainable hydrogen peroxide -to-propylene - oxide alternate route that uses a titanium - doped catalyst for industrial manufacturing of propylene oxide ( among the largest -volume industrial chemicals in the world and used in a vast array of products). 68 This route eliminates most of the organic waste and byproducts and greatly reduces water and energy use. 66Polymeriz ation is the process of connecting monomers (small molecules) into a polymer (a longer chain of repeating units). 67A photocatalyst accelerates a photochemical reaction \u2014 that is, a chemical reaction caused by light or ultraviolet radiation. 68The Dow Chemica l Company and BASF jointly won a Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2010 for this innovative, environmentally benign production of propylene oxide. 3.2 Organocatalysts Organocatalysts are metal- free small organic molecules that can catalyze many different reactions. Consequently, considerable effort has recently been directed toward the development o f these metal -free catalysts. For example, Lelais and MacMillan reported on several significant organic chemical transformations that can be conducted with organocatalysts, providing a valuable complement to other routes.69 In many cases , organocatalysts ar e complementary to metal and biocatalysts. That is, they can be used in place of PGMs, earth -abundant metal catalysts, and biocatalysts in some reactions. They are composed of nonmetallic elements such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and pho sphorous. Among the most common examples are amino acids.70 Advantages and disadvantages of organocatalysts Organocatalysts offer several sustainability advantages including greater availability, ease of handling, the ability to use a more sustainable appr oach to solvents, and reduced energy consumption. Ease of availability and handling : Organocatalysts offer ease of availability, an advantage compared to metals. Another advantage is easy handling; organocatalysts tend to be stable and unreactive in water and air. Thus the demanding reaction conditions 69G. Lelais and D. W. C. MacMillan, \"Modern Strategies in Organic Catalysis: The Advent and Dev elopment of Iminium Activation,\" Aldrichimica ACTA , vol. 39, no. 3 (2006). 70The amino acid known as proline was one of the earliest organocatalysts used. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 42 typically required of metal- catalyzed reactions \u2014such as an inert atmosphere and low temperature \u2014are usually not required with organocatalysts. Elimination of metal contamination risk : Organocatalysts eliminate the risk of metal contamination in the final product, which is especially valuable to the pharmaceutical industry. Compatible with more sustainable solvent use: Many organocatalysts have been found to work better (e.g., to be more selective or more rapid) in water than in organic solvents. For example, a stud y by Breslow showed that certain organocatalyzed reactions were accelerated in water. 71 Other researchers have also reported on efforts to develop organocatalyzed reactions with enhanced yield and ena ntioselectivity . Additionally, some reactions have been successfully demonstrated with organocatalysts under solvent -free conditions. For example, a recent review of advances in sustainable organocatalysis by Branco et al. reported two new catalysts for co nducting organocatalytic reactions under neat (solvent -free) conditions. 72 However, these often require a large amount of other substances involved in the reaction, which can present a waste problem similar to organic solvents. (See chapter 4 for more details on alternative solvents.) 71R. Breslow, \"Hydrophobic Effects on Simple Organic Reactions in water,\" Accounts of Chemical Research, vol. 24, no. 6 (1991). 72L. C. Branco, A. M. F. Phillips, M. M. Marques, S. Gago, and P. S. Branco, \"Recent Advances in Sustainable Organocatalysis,\" INTECH (2016). Reduced energy consumption : The use of organocatalysts can reduce energy consumption, which is consistent with one of the 12 Principles \u2014namely , number 6: design for energy efficiency (see app. V).73 However, as with all catalysts, organocatalysts also have some disadvantages that must be evaluated against their advantages when choosing the best options for a particular reaction. Need for large quantities : One disadvantage of organocatalysts is that a large amount may be needed for appreciable increases in reaction rates, especially for industrial use. However, organocatalysts are much cheaper than PGMs so the use of more catalyst may not necessarily translate to higher cost. This can depend on the cost of purification processes, but this tradeoff depends largely on the specifics of each process. Also, research has shown that while decreasing the amount of catalyst may decrease the reaction rate, it can increase stereoselectivity. 74 That is, a slower reac tion rate can produce a more uniform product, resulting in less waste. Difficulties with recycling : Organocatalysts can be challenging to recycle. Because many standard organocatalysts are dissolved in a reaction medium that is typically in the same phase as the reactants, they are difficult to separate and reuse, which can limit their industrial use. However, immobilization 73Branco, Phillips, Marques, Gago, and Branco, \"Recent Advances in Sustainable Organocatalysis,\" 141. 74Stereoselectivity is the preferential formation in a chemical reaction of one stereoisomer over another \u2014stereoisomers are isomers that have the same chemical formula and functional groups but differ in the arrangement of their funct ional groups in space. Enantiomers are one example of stereoisomers. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 43 techniques are being studied to allow for easier recovery and reuse of organocatalysts.75 For example, Corma and Garcia have reported silica- bound organocatalysts as recoverable, recyclable catalysts in several organic transformations.76 Other immobilization methods involve electrostatically attaching the organocatalysts to solid supports; for example, relying on ion pairs to form between the solid support and the catalyst. Another technique involves the use of zeolite supports; this is somewhat analogous to immobilizing the catalyst in a cage. Unknown toxicity : Organocatalysts are now widely used in polymer synthesis as an alternative to traditional metal- based catalysts, in some cases because of concerns about metal toxicity. However, little is known about the toxicity of most organocatalysts. For example, a recent scientific study attempts to assess whether well -established organocataly sts may present a certain level of cytotoxicity when used to produce FDA - approved polyesters for use in food packaging. 77 75Immobilization means to restrict mobility in a fixed space. This technique is used for easy separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture and minimizes the loss of catalyst in the product. 76A. Corma and H. Garcia, \"Silica -Bound Homogenous Catalysts as Recoverable and Reusable Catalysts in Organic Synthesis,\" Advanced Synthesis and Catalysis , vol. 348, no. 12 (2006). 77A. Nachtergael, O. Coulembier, P. Dubois, M. , vol. 16, no. 2 (2015). Cytotoxic means poisonous to living cells. 3.3 Biocatalysts Biocatalysts, as might be expected from the name, have a biological origin. Typically these compounds are enzymes (natur al compounds originating from living cells) or engineered enzymatic complexes (i.e., one part of the enzyme engineered to work somewhat differently than it would in a living organism) that catalyze biochemical reactions in organic substances . 78 While these comprise only 3 percent of the catalyst market (as of 2013) , they are the most efficient and sustainable catalysts found in nature . Because biocatalysts come from natural sources, they are biodegradable and renewable .79 Biocatalysts have been used for thous ands of years \u2014for example, to catalyze fermentation for brewing and baking.80 They are increasingly being used to improve the sustainability, efficiency, and cost of chemical production. In the past, biocatalysts were used in drug discovery and production. Today they are also being used to make non - medicinal bulk chemicals such as biofuels, surfactants, and plastics. Molecular biology has expanded knowledge of enzymes and pathways and this has led to an increased use 78Enzymes are proteins that speed up a biochemical reaction. That is, they catalyze nearly all of the chemical reactions that occur in biological systems (chemical reactions that take place inside the cells of living things). 79In addition to organocatalysts and biocatalysts there are other categories of catalysts such as, nanocatalysts, solid acid catalysts, photocatalysts, and electrocatalysts that are also in use or being researched. However, we did not assess these technologies or their sustainability in this report. 80Fermentation is a biochemical process by wh ich organic substances are decomposed by the action of enzymes to provide chemical energy, as in the production of alcohol. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 44 of biocatalyzed chemical processes. Recen t research has led to the engineering of both reaction pathways and enzymes to make customizable biocatalysts starting from a natural process . Researchers have used such reaction pathways and biocatalyzed processes to develop or improve the production of many life -saving drugs. Representatives we interviewed from the pharmaceutical industry told us that biocatalysts are a major area of development and investment for their industry. For example, researchers are exploring ways to replace metals, including PGM s, with enzymatic processes. Industry representatives noted that they have used biocatalysts to perform syntheses that reduce waste and the use of solvents, thus improving the sustainability of their processes. Types of biocatalysts Biocatalysts can take two forms: fermentation and free enzymes. Fermentation : The earliest form of an industrial biocatalyst was fermentation. Brewing and baking employ this type of biocatalyst, usually in the form of yeast cells. At the outset of industrial fermentation, onl y natural products \u2014substances that are naturally produced by living organisms \u2014could be produced using biocatalysts, but today scientists are able to engineer cells to allow the production of compounds not traditionally made by an organism. For example, res earch efforts are underway to develop fermentation pathways to produce vitamins, steroids, solvents, valuable drugs, and polymer precursors. Free enzymes : Enzymes (proteins) are natural substances that catalyze almost all of the chemical reactions in living organisms. Without enzymes, these reactions would take place at a rate far too slow to sustain life. Several enzymatic reaction pathways have been researched and developed recently for the synthesis of chemical and pharmaceutical products. For example, enzymatic polymerization reactions can be used to synthesize commodity plastics, as well as new environmentally friendly polymers that may not have a traditional chemical synthesis route. For example, lipases (a class of enzymes) have shown industrial potential in polyester synthesis. Polyesters are an abundant organic material in living systems and many compounds in this class have commercial applications, especially in the biomedical field , so a lipase -based polymerization process can help make the chemical industry more sustainable. In addition, Patel and Kharat report that the application of enzyme engineering to the pharmaceutical industry is growing rapidly. 81 Advantages and disadvantages of biocatalysts Biocatalysts offer several advantages compa red with PGMs, including easier handling, higher selectivities, and reduced waste and energy use that can make them more cost -effective relative to traditional catalysts . Easier handling : Unlike many industrial processes using traditional catalysts, 81H. H. Patel and A. R. Kharat, \"Comparative Study of Free Enzyme & Immobilized Enzyme on BSA Digestion,\" International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research, vol. 3, no. 12 (2012). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 45 biocat alysts can generally be used at or near ambient temperature and pressure. Enzymes can also be used in water, u nlike many industrial catalysts, which predominantly require organic solvents. Higher selectivities : Both forms of biocatalysts \u2014fermentation and enzymes \u2014 have higher selectivity than traditional catalysts. This includes high substrate specificity (meaning they only catalyze a specific chemical reaction) as well as stereoselectivity. Both features are important because they make enzymes promising as catalysts . Furthermore, high selectivity yields high purity products. Reduced waste and energy use : Biocatalysts are also inherently more efficient than other catalysts because they tend to catalyze in one step without need for functional group protection, activation, or deprotection steps that generate more waste and use more energy. Furthermore, they can operate under moderate reaction conditions at near ambient temperature and pressure, thus resulting in reduced energy consumption. As a result, biocataly sts are often more cost effective than synthetic catalysts . Biodegradable and renewable : Because biocatalysts come from natural sources, they are biodegradable and renewable. Furthermore, new methods and techniques have emerged that can use biocatalyzed processes in the production of a variety of compounds from renewable feedstocks such as biomass . As with other technologies designed to make chemical processes and products more sustainable, biocatalysts have tradeoffs from both a sustainability and a feasibility perspective. These include the potential for generating significant quantities of wastewater, limitations with use, and instability, among others. Potential for large quantities of wastewater : The use of water as a solvent, while it provides some sustainability advantages over the use of organic solvents, can generate large amounts of wastewater. Unless this can be easily recycled, wastewater treatment typically involves additional economic and energy costs. Performing reactions in water instead o f organic solvents can also reduce the solubility of some reactants. However, there are methods available to expand the utility of water as a reaction m edium under these circumstances . (See chapter 4 for details) . In addition, water -based solutions may need a large volume of solvent s for product isolation, which minimizes the solvent -related gains of doing the reaction in water. Limitations with use : Enzymes' high substrate specificity, while generally an advantage as discussed above, can complicate the process of finding a well- suited enzyme to catalyze a particular chemical process. Furthermore, many enzymes are subject to product inhibition \u2014the decrease in rate of reaction brought about by the addition of a substance . Researchers have attempted to sol ve this problem by forming molecular complexes with the product molecules, so these molecules are not able to inhibit the enzyme. Instability and difficulties with recovery : Most enzymes are fairly unstable. In addition, they are often hard to recover fro m the reaction mixture. Thus, industrial applications of enzymes are often constrained by a lack of long- term stability and the challenges Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 46 involved in their recovery and reuse . Enzymes are often immobilized to help mitigate these issues and make their use more favorable. Immobilization makes the enzyme easier to handle and easier to separate from the reaction mixture, which lowers the total production cost of enzyme -mediated reactions. Applications of biocatalysts Manufacturing of penicillin : The main sta rting block for the synthetic production of penicillin is a compound called 6 -aminopenicillanic acid. Until the mid -1980s, the conventional chemistry used to produce this compound included environmentally unattractive feature s such as chlorinated reagents and a reaction temperature of - 40 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C). In contrast, the newer enzymatic process for producing 6 -aminopenicillanic acid uses penicillin amidase (an enzyme) in water at 37\u00b0C, without the use of chlorinated reagents. Currently the majority of this compound produced on a world -wide basis (more than 10,000 metric tons annually) uses the enzymatic route. A key sustainability advantage of the enzymatic process for the manufacture of 6 -aminopenicillanic acid is the avoidance of protecting groups be cause such steps require additional reagents, use more energy, and generate waste. 82 This also aligns with Principle 8 of the 12 Principles , which calls for minimization or avoidance of such steps (see app. V). 82A protecting group refers to a temporary functional group added during organic synthesis to prevent a portion of a molecule from reacting. While protecting groups play an important role in multist ep organic syntheses, they are usually considered undesirable because it adds additional steps to the length of the overall synthesis. They can also have sustainability issues including the use of additional materials and production of additional waste. Production of adipic acid : Production of adip ic acid through a n enzymatic route has been demonstrated in the scientific literature.83 This process can replace conventional synthesis routes that may have sustainability issues. Currently, the large scale manufacture of adipic acid, a commercially import ant compound used for nylon production, involves a multistep synthesis with several unsustainable features. For example, it requires the use of cyclohexane , which in turn is made from benzene. Benzene is flammable, highly toxic, and carcinogenic material. Furthermore, the production process involves high temperature oxidation steps, and the use of corrosive reagents such as nitric acid. This is subsequently followed by an energy - intensive distillation to recover and recycle the unreacted raw material. In co ntrast, producing adipic acid via fermentation could significantly improve the sustainability of this process. Researchers Draths and Frost received a Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 1998 for their development of an alternative synthesis of adipic acid from glucose using fermentation. In this process, glucose is first converted to muconic acid using a single, genetically engineered microbe via a novel biosynthetic pathway that does not exist in nature. Muconic acid is subsequently hydrogenat ed in a fermentation broth using a platinum catalyst in a pressurized atmosphere of hydrogen at ambient temperature to yield adipic acid. Although the resulting process 83L. C. Webster, P. T. Anastas, and T. C. Williamson, \"Environmentally Benign Production of Commodity Chemicals Through Biotechnology: Recent Progress and Future Potential ,\" ACS Symposium Series; American Chemical Society: Washington, DC (1996). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 47 used a PGM catalyst, other sustainability gains were significant.84 Production of the drug sitagliptin : Enzymatic processes have been researched in recent years in the pharmaceutical industry as a sustainable and efficient biocatalytic manufacturing route to make certain drugs such as sitagliptin (the active ingredient in Januvia \u00ae, a type 2 diabetes drug). The multistep manufacturing route used several complex reagents and solvents, high pressure hydrogenation reaction requiring expensive specialized equipment and a rhodium -based catalyst, and a yield -reducing crystallizati on 84According t o one of our experts, Draths and Frost's fermentation process is not used commercially, mainly because significant amounts of petroleum -derived adipic acid are produced overseas. step ( see fig. 12).85 In 2010, Merck and Codexis received a Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award for developing a more sustainable biocatalytic manufacturing process for sitagliptin using a transaminase enzyme. 86 This approach eliminates several unsustainable reaction steps to provide high purity sitagliptin directly, followed by a phosphate salt formation step to provide sitagliptin phosphate . The reported benefits of this process include a significant improvement in productivity by 56 percent with the existing equipment, a 10 -13 percent increase in percentage yield, and a 19 percent reduction in overall waste. 85Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction in which hydrogen atoms add to carbon -carbon multiple bonds. In order for the reaction to proceed at a practical rate, a catalyst is almost always needed. 86Merck & Co., Inc. and Codexis, Inc. jointly won a Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2010 for the greener manufacturing of sit agliptin enabled by a transaminase enzyme.

Solvents constitute a large portion of the total volume of chemicals used in industrial processes and thus have an influence on the overall environmental impact of those processes. Chemists consider a number of key properties when selecting a solvent for a particular application or seeking alternative solvent technologies. An overall assessment of the environmental impact of a solvent can include factors from both an environmental health and safety perspective and a life cycle perspective. Several commonly used solvents are problematic from a sustainability or regulatory perspective but have been particularly challenging to replace. However, there are more sustainable solvent technologies available to replace some conventional solvents, including a variety of biobased solvents; non -VOC solvents such as water, supercritical carbon dioxide, and ionic liquids; and solvent -free or reduced -solvent technologies. Table 7 summarizes our assessment of t hese technologies; we provide additional details in the remainder of the chapter. Table 7: Summary of a ssessment of selected alternative solvent technologies Technology Advantages Disadvantages Biobased solvents (volatile organic compounds (VOC) or non- VOC) Sourced from renewable raw materials Can be biodegradable Can be safer or less toxic than petroleum -derived solvents Some can directly replace conventional solvents Some pose the same inherent risks as other VOCs such as atmospheric pollution, flammability, and user exposure Can be more expensive than other materials Can have v ariability in supply and quality control of feedstocks Challenges associated with building new processes at commercial scal e Non - VOC solvents Water Environmentally benign, nontoxic, and nonflammable Abundant and inexpensive Some reactions proceed faster in water Many chemicals are not soluble in water Reaction with water can compete with the desired reaction Conventional solvents may be required to separate reaction products from water Removing unwanted byproducts from water for recycling can be energy -intensive Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 50 Technology Advantages Disadvantages Supercritical carbon dioxide Environmentally benign, nontoxic and nonflammable Inexpensive Supercritical temperature and pressure are relatively mild compared to some other substances Tunable (adjustable) solvent properties Ease of separation from the reaction product Requires elevated pressure Requires specialized equipment and additional safety precautions May not be a suitable solvent for reactions involving polar or high molecular weight chemicals Ionic liquids Low volatility Tunable solvent properties Concerns over toxicity and environmental persistence and footprint Can be complicated or costly to make Solvent -free or reduced -solvent Reduces solvent use and waste Decreases the need to recycle or dispose of used solvents Solvents may still be required for product purification Technical challenges to achieving solvent -free reactions on an industrial scale Source: GAO. | GAO -18-307 4.1 Key properties of solvents There are a number of properties that influence which solvent to select for a particular use. For example, the polarity of a solvent \u2014that is, the distribution of electrical charges within the solvent molecules \u2014 significantly affects how that solvent behaves. Depending on its chemical structure, a solvent can be classified as polar or nonpolar. 87 Electron s are not symmetrically distributed in molecules of polar compounds, resulting in partially positively and negatively charged regions. 88 In contrast, m olecules of nonpolar 87Although polarity is a property often used to predict the solubility of compounds, it can be difficult to quantify. Classifying solvents as polar or nonpolar is a simplification of the concept. 88Electrons are su batomic particles that have a negative electric charge. compounds have a relatively symmetrical distribution of electrons. Compounds can also be ionicconsisting of positively and negatively charged component(s), or ions, held together by electrostatic forces.89 The concept of \"like dissolves like\" is a simplified rule for understanding solvents and solubility. For example, polar solvents tend to dissolv e other polar compounds or ionic compounds (e.g., salts), while nonpolar solvents tend to dissolv e other nonpolar molecules (e.g., fats and oil s).90 The term miscible describes two liquids that are completely soluble in each other. For example etha nol and water, which are both polar, are miscible, whereas 89Table salt, for example, is an ionic compound called sodium chloride, consisting of positively charged sodium ions and a negatively charged chloride ions. 90Hydrocarbons are compounds made up of only hydrogen and carbon atoms. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 51 hydrocarbons and water are not. Solvents and other compounds can also be classified as hydrophilic ( having affinity for water, e.g., miscible with or soluble in water); hydrophobic ( lacking affinit y for water, e.g., not miscible with or soluble in water); or amphiphilic (molecules that contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, such as surfactants). Solvents can also be either protic or aprotic. Protic solvents contain hydrogen atoms bound t o an electron -attracting atom such as an oxygen or nitrogen atom. These hydrogen atoms allow the solvent and solute molecules to form hydrogen bonds a strong interaction between or within molecules. Although aprotic solvents can also contain hydrogen atoms , those atoms are not bound to electron -attracting atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen and therefore do not participate in hydrogen bonding. Solvents that are both quite polar and aprotic are called dipolar aprotic. 4.2 Sustainability challenges of solvents The environmental impact of a solvent can be assessed using an environmental health and safety method or a life cycle method , the results of which can be combined into an overall assessment. The goal of the environmental health and safety assessment method is to identify potential hazards of solvents. An environmental health and safety assessment considers factors such as the flammability, toxicity, and environmental persistence of the solvent. The LCA method evaluates the environmental impact of the solven t through all the stages of its life cycle, including production, use, and potential recycling or disposal (see chapter 1 for a more detailed discussion of LCA). An LCA considers factors such as nonrenewable resource depletion, emissions associated with th e incineration of solvent waste, and the energy required for solvent recovery and recycling (see f ig. 13). 91 The combination of both assessments can help chemists to select solvents with the least environmental impact. These assessments can also be applied to new solvent technologies, some of which are discussed later in this chapter. 91Although we do not discuss it in depth in this report, solvent recycling can make an important contribution to the life cycle assessment of a process.

There are several classes of solvents that are problematic from a sustainability or regulatory perspective but that are particularly challenging to replace. For example, halogenated compounds such as chlorinated solvents and dipolar aprotic solvents, among others lack sufficient replacement options. 92 In December 2016, EPA released the list of the first 10 chemicals for assessment under the amended TSCA regulations; the list includes di polar aprotic and halogenated solvents (see text box below). 93 92Halogenated compounds contain one or more atoms from the halogen group such as fluorine, chlorine, or bromine. 9381 Fed. Reg. 91,927 (December 19, 2016). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 53 Several regulations in the United States are relevant to solvent use in the chemical industry In the United States, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Clean Air Act both have implications for solvent use, as do FDA regulations and guidance. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to regulate hazardous air pollutantschemicals known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effectsfrom various industrial facilities. EPA is working with state, local, and tribal governm ents to reduce air emissions of 187 hazardous air pollutants, including some commonly used solvents. The Clean Air Act also requires EPA to manage ozone- depleting substances, which also includes some solvents. FDA has regulations and guidance regarding sol vents. FDA regulates additives in food and beverage, including some residual solvents, as well as the use of certain solvents as ingredients in cosmetics. FDA also provides guidance to industry on residual solvents in pharmaceuticals. TSCA as amended by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century act requires that EPA now systematically prioritize and assess existing chemical substances and manage identified risks. In December 2016, EPA published an initial list of 10 chemical substances that will be subject to assessment. Seven out of those 10 chemical substances could be classified as solvents; 1,4 -dioxane, tetrachloroethylene. TSCA requires that EPA choose the first 10 chemical substances from the list of 90 chemical substances on the 2014 update of the TSCA Work Plan for Chemical Assessments. TSCA Work Plan chemicals were selected based on their hazard and potential exposure, as well as othe r considerations such as persistence and bioaccumulation.

While these solvents are widely used, some in the industry are making efforts to reduce their use. A recent study reported the atmospheric concentration of dichloromethane \u2014an ozone -depleting substance \u2014is increasing rapidly, and that continued growth of dichloromethane could delay recovery of the ozone layer. 94 The authors note that it is probable that demand for dichloromethane for a number of applications is relatively high in developing countries such as India. Disposal of th ese solvents can also be challenging or costly. For example, the low flammability of 94R. Hossaini, M. P. Chipperfield, S. A. Montzka, A. A. S. S. Dhomse, and J. A. Pyle, \"The Incr easing Threat to Stratospheric Ozone from Dichloromethane,\" Nature Communications, vol. 8 (2017). dichloromethane hinders incineration. Due to these issues, reducing the use of dichloromethane is a goal of many green chemistry programs within the pharmaceutical industr y. Two pharmaceutical companies told us that they track use of chlorinated solvents as a percentage of total solvent use as a sustainability metric. One of those companies reported that dichloromethane has decreased from 35 percent to 10 percent of total s olvent use since they started tracking in 2012. Chemists commonly use several di polar aprotic solvents , however there are concerns regarding the associated toxicity and potential negative environmental impact of these solvents . Commonly used dipolar aprotic solvents include dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, and N - methylpyrrolidone. However, these solvents are designated as reproductive toxins and Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 54 included on the European Union's Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH ) substances of very high concern candidate list.95 Dipolar aprotic solvents are difficult to remove from a reaction mixture by distillation and therefore are usually extracted into water instead. Separation from water is also difficult and can be energy -intensive or costly. Release of wastewater contaminated with these solvents presents environmental challenges. Finding more sustainable replacements for dipolar aprotic solvent s has been a challenge; however , researchers have reported the use of several alt ernatives. Dipolar aprotic solvents are particularly useful for certain reactions. For example, nucleophilic substitution reactions a common type of reaction used in the pharmaceutical industrycan be up to 100,000 times faster in dipolar aprotic solvents as opposed to protic solvents. A ccording to one study, a survey of solvent usage in papers published in the journal Organic Processes Research and Development from the years 1997 -2012 found that close to 50 percent of the usage of dimethylformamide, dimeth ylacetamide, N- methylpyrrolidone, and dimethyl sulfoxide was in nucleophilic substitution reactions. 96 One expert told us that currently there are not good replacements for these solvents. However, the study that conducted the 95The substances of very high concern candidate list aims to ensure that the included hazardous chemicals are progressively replaced by less dangerous substanc es or technologies where technically and economically feasible alternatives are available. 96C.

Researchers have also recently demonstrated this type of reaction in water under mild conditions through the use of micellar catalysis, which we discuss later in this chapter.97 Other potential alternatives for dipolar aprotic solvents include organic carbonates and biobased cyrene. However, one expert told us that neither of these substitutes is currently widely employed. 4.3 More sustainable solvent technologies We assessed three general classes of more sustainable solvent technologies: ( 1) biobased solvents ( VOC or non-VOC )\u2014that is, solvents produced from renewable rather than petroch emical resources, ( 2) non -VOC solvents, and (3) solvent -free or reduced - solvent strategies to decrease the volume of solvents required for a process. 98 4.3.1 Biobased solvents The benefits and challenges of biobased solvents \u2014which can provide alternatives to petroleum -derived solvents as either a direct replacement or a substitute \u2014vary based on 97N.

However, we did not assess these technologies in this report. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 55 the nature of each solvent. Biobased solvents (whether VOC or non -VOC) are sourced from renewable raw materials such as forestry or agricultural materials. According to a 2013 report by the International Energy Agency and others, use of biobased feedstocks for chemical production is a potential game changer in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.99 The three main benefits are: (1) reduced dependency on fossil fuels, ( 2) absorption of carbon dioxide while the feedstock source is growing, and (3) the feedstock source is renewable and therefore may not experience the same price volatility in the future as fossil fuels. However, any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions mu st be weighed against the energy requirements for biobased production, according to the report. According to one expert, studies have shown that the manufacture of many, but not all, organic solvents from biomass may be more environmentally damaging or ene rgy intensive than their manufacture from petroleum. Certain biobased solvents may be biodegradable or may be safer or less toxic than petroleum -derived solvents. However, many biobased solvents are VOCs and therefore maintain the inherent risks of VOCs including atmospheric pollution, flammability, and user exposure. Some are toxic or have other negative environmental health and safety properties. Some biobased solvents can serve as a direct replacement for conventional solvents without having to alter the equipment or process . Other biobased 99International Energy Agency (IEA), International Council of Associations, and Dechema Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Chemische Technik und Biotechnologie e. V., Technology Roadmap: Energy and GHG Reductions in the Chemical Industry via Catalytic Proce sses, (Paris, France: IEA Publications, 2013). solvents are not direct replacements but may lead to opportunities for new technologies . One company told us that new biobased materials are frequently more expensive than other materials, which presents a challenge t o their use. There is ongoing research in academia and industry examining chemical processes that may be suitable for these new solvents. We identified several examples of biobased solvents and the associated benefits and challenges they may face in indus trial applications. Although a variety of solvents and solvent classes can be renewably sourced, current technology does not offer direct replacements for all conventional solvents. Because biobased raw materials, such as cellulose and starch, contain oxygen atoms, most biobased solvents are oxygen - containing compounds such as alcohols, esters, and ethers. Other solvents, such as certain hydrocarbons, can potentially be produced from cellulose and lignocellulose materials. Chlorinated solvents cannot curren tly be produced from biobased raw materials. However, as previously discussed , many in the industry are already working to reduce the use of this class of highly regulated solvents in part due to their environmental and health hazards. We discuss several biobased solvents below . Ethanol Ethanol is a conventional solvent that can be renewably sourced for use in several industrial applications. Ethanol is an inexpensive product of fermentation of starch crops or can be produced from cellulose from waste mate rials. Ethanol is biodegradable, less toxic than some other solvents , and miscible with both water and many organic Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 56 solvents. However, ethanol is a volatile solvent and has a relatively low flash point, which can present hazards to users.100 A manufacturer o f cellulosic ethanol cited several advantages, including that it is sourced from a non -food feedstock and its production uses less water compared to the conventional production of ethanol. They also told us that production of cellulosic ethanol as a replac ement solvent faces challenges, including building a supply chain, variability in the supply and quality of agricultural feedstocks, scalability, public awareness, and public policy uncertainty. E thanol is commonly used in products such as scents, flavors, and medicines. It is also conventionally used as a solvent in chemical processes including both reaction and separation applications. Ethanol can also serve as a solvent in formulated products . For example, DuPont and Procter & Gamble announced a partnership in 2014 to use ethanol derived from cellulose in Tide\u00ae Cold Water laundry detergent. 1,3-Propanedio l 1,3-Propanediol is another biobased solvent used in formulated products. A joint team from DuPont and Genencor International, Inc. won a Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2003 for the microbial production of 1,3-propanediol from glucose sourced from renewable cornstarch (see text box below ). 101 100The flash point is the lowest temperature at which sufficient vapor of a volatile liquid has collected in order to form an ignitable mixture with air. 101For a full list of Presidential Green Chemistry Challeng e Awards from 1996 -2016, see https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016 - 10/documents/award_recipients_1996_2016.pdf , accessed August 1, 2016 . Representatives from a chemical manufa cturer told us that in addition to being sustainably and renewably sourced, 1,3 - propanediol is nontoxic and safe for food. They also mentioned that it is a USDA Certified Biobased Product and that there is customer and consumer value in biobased alternativ es. However, they also mentioned that building new processes at commercial scale can be expensive and high -risk. 1,3 - Propanediol can be used as a solvent in personal care products as well as household cleaning products such as liquid laundry or hand detergents, dish detergent, hard surface cleaners, glass cleaners, and carpet and rug cleaners. Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award for the Microbial Production of 1,3 - Propanediol In addition to its use as a biobased solvent, 1,3 - propanediol is a buildi ng block for other chemical products. According to the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award summary for this technology, for more than 50 years , scientists recognized the performance benefits of polyesters produced with 1,3 -propanediol; however, the high cost of manufacturing the ingredient using petroleum feedstock and traditional chemistry kept it from the marketplace. The microbial process is both less expensive and more productive than the traditional chemical process. In terms of sustainability , the microbial process allowed replacement of a petroleum feedstock and increased both the energy efficiency and safety of the manufacturing process. Polymers containing 1,3 - propanediol are used in a variety of applications including apparel and upholster y.

Glycerol is available in a variety of grades based on the level of purity. Crude glycerol is both the l east expensive and the most environmentally -friendly grade because it requires the least amount of purification to produce. Glycerol is a polar solvent and has been shown to increase the rate of some organic reactions. However , it is not a good solvent for hydrophobic compounds or for certain gases including hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Glycerol is also highly viscous, which can be drawback for certain chemical processes. 103 The price of biobased glycerol is tied to fluctuations in the biodiesel mark et, which could affect its adoption as a solvent by the chemical industry. Researchers have demonstrated the use of biobased glycerol as a medium for a variety of reactions, including as a substitute for di polar aprotic solvents. Glycerol and s everal deriv atives show promise as a reaction medium for biocatalysis among a variety of other applications. Glycerol carbonate, for example, is an ingredient in personal care products. However, the synthesis required to make glycerol derivatives remains an issue from a sustainability perspective. 102A derivative of a chemical is another chemical that is structurally similar to or made from it. See chapter 3 for more details on biocatalysis. 103A viscous liquid is resistant to flow, meaning it has a thick consistency. Molasses is a classic example of vis cous liquid. Methyl soyate Methyl soyate is a type of biodiesel used industrially as a cleaning and degreasing solvent. Methyl soyate is produced from methanol and soybean oil\u2014 the predominant seed oil crop in the United States. Methyl soyate is nontoxic, nonhazardous, and biodegradable. Methyl soyate evaporates slowly and is not considered a hazardous air pollutant or an ozone -depleting substance ; however if used alone it can leave behind a residue which is a drawback in certain applicatio ns. In cleaning formulations, u se of a more volatile co -solvent such as ethyl lactate can mitigate th is drawback. Methyl soyate and ethyl lactate blends can replace chlorinated and other petroleum -derived solvents in applications such as paint strippers, p rinting ink cleaners, and graffiti removers. Other potential solvent applications of methyl soyate include household and industrial cleaners, paints, and oil spill cleanup. For extraction applications, the distribution behavior of various substances in methyl soyate in liquid -liquid extraction processes with water has been shown to be comparable to that of conventional solvent -water systems .104 Ethyl lactate Lactate esters such as ethyl lactate are another of biobased solvents with a variety of applicat ions. The parent compound for this class, lactic acid, is produced via fermentation of a variety of carbohydrates, such as corn starch, sugar beets, sugarcane, 104Liquid -liquid extraction is a technique to transfer a dissolved substance from one liquid phase to another (immiscible or partially miscible) liquid phase in contact with it and in which it is more soluble. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 58 or wheat. Ethyl lactate is produced through the reaction of ethanol and lactic acid in a low-cost process with water as the only byproduct. Lactate esters are generally biodegradable or recyclable and not corrosive, carcinogenic, or ozone -depleting. In addition to the environmental advantages associated with lactate esters, as a solvent ethyl lactate is compatible with water, miscible with organic compounds, and has a relatively high boiling point (154 \u00b0C). Ethyl lactate is a possible substitute for halogenated solvents. Industrially, ethyl lactate is used for several applications including as a solve nt in the coatings and inks industry and as a biodegradable cleaning fluid. It has also been used as a reaction medium, although to a lesser extent than some other biobased solvents. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran is a biobased solvent wi th growing use in industry. It can be produced from renewable raw materials including agricultural waste such as corncobs. This solvent has a number of properties in common with some conventional solvents such as tetrahydrofuran. However, 2 - methyltetrahydr ofuran is less miscible with water than tetrahydrofuran, thus facilitating separation from water and reducing waste in some cases. 2 -Methyltetrahydrofuran suffers from some of the same drawbacks as related solvents. For example, 2 - methyltetrahydrofuran is susceptible to the formation of peroxides when exposed to air if no stabilizer is present which can be explosive under certain circumstances. In preliminary toxicological studies, 2 - methyltetrahydrofuran was not associated with genotoxic ity. 105 The use of 2 - methyltetrahydrofuran in industry is growing. For example, in 201 1, the pharmaceutical company G laxoSmith Kline reported 16 percent of the chemical processes in their pilot plants used 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran in 2007- 2009, up from 3.5 percent in 2005- 2006. 106 A study from 2015 proposed 2 - methyltetrahydrofuran as an industrial alternative to n -hexane in the extraction of vegetable oils from their source plants.107 It is also considered a viable substitute for chlorinated solvents in both extraction and reaction m edium applications . d-Limonene Terpenes such as d -limonene in a number of applications. Terpenes are sourced from essential oils of plants, including citrus and conifers. d-Limonene , which is extracted from citrus peel waste, has the most widespread use as a solvent. In addition to being biobased, d-limonene is less volatile than conventional solvents and therefore poses a lower risk of exposure to humans and the environment. FDA reg ulations list d -limonene as a generally safe for use as a flavoring 105Genotoxic substances are a type of carcinogen, specifically those capable of causing genetic mutation and of contributing to the development of tumors. This includes certain chemical compounds, metals, and certain types of radiation. 106R. K. Henderson, C. Jim\u00e9nez -Gonz\u00e1lez, D. J. C. Constab le, S. R. Alston, G. G. A. Inglis, G. Fisher, J.

One formulator told us that d - limonene is one of the top 10 raw materials they use and it ha s been found to be ozone - friendly. Due to its low polarity , d-limonene offers a replacement for petroleum -derived hydrocarbons, such as n-hexane, which are commonly used in the extraction of fats and oils from natural sources. One drawback of this approach is that separating d -limonene from the desired fats and oils after extraction may be more energy intensive than the removal of n -hexane given its higher boiling point. Although the use of d-limonene as a solvent for organic reactions has not been studied as extensively, researchers have reported examples of d-limonene as a reaction medium in catalytic reactions, including biocatalysis. d -Limonene has also found use as a solvent in the hydraulic fracturing industry (see text box ). 10821 C.F.R. \u00a7182.60. Citrus terpenes and hydrau lic fracturing A representative from Florida Chemical, a company that produces terpene products, told us that the hydraulic fracturing industry is using d -limonene and other citrus terpenes as green solvents. The chemicals, as part of the fracking fluid mi xture, are injected into a wellbore to break apart shale or sand and allow natural gas and crude oil products to escape. According to the representative, d - limonene is a better solvent for asphaltene and wax than the traditionally used fossil fuel products , and the hydraulic fracturing industry is concerned about contamination of source and groundwater and therefore values the low toxicity of citrus terpenes. Source: GAO analysis of industry interview . | GAO 18- 307 4.3.2 Non -volatile organic compound (non -VOC) solvents Water Although water is in some ways considered an ideal sustainable solvent, it also faces certain challenges and tradeoffs. In addition to being environmentally benign, nontoxic, and nonflammable, water is also abundant and inexpensive. Water i s sometimes referred to as 'nature's solvent' as many biochemical reactions occur in water. However, many chemicals (e.g., nonpolar hydrocarbons) are not soluble in water. Other chemicals may react with water instead of undergoing the desired reaction. Man y catalysts are moisture -sensitive and become inactive in the presence of water. Modern organic chemistry processes have been developed for the most part in conventional organic solvents . However , there are several methods available to expand the utility o f water as a reaction medium when working with hydrophobic chemicals including aqueous -organic biphasic systems and micelles. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 60 The use of water as a reaction medium can sometimes affect the outcome of a reaction in advantageous ways. For example, some react ions have been shown to proceed faster in water than in conventional organic solvents even though the components may not fully dissolve. The hydrophobic effect \u2014a phenomenon believed to contribute to this observation \u2014describes the fact that nonpolar molecul es tend to aggregate in water to minimize interactions with water molecules . Water can provide additional benefits as a reaction medium even in cases where it does not accelerate the rate of reaction \u2014for example, through improved temperature control and ea sier product separation. Despite its advantages, water is not always the most sustainable reaction medium , often due to issues associated with recovery of products or removal of byproducts. In some cases, large amounts of organic solvents are necessary to separate the desired product from the aqueous (water -based) reaction medium, which could counteract sustainability gains. The resulting aqueous solution could also be contaminated by organic compounds. In the case of reactions that generate salts as byprod ucts, such as certain metal- catalyzed cross -coupling reactions, removing the salt in order to recycle the water can be energy -intensive. In contrast , when using a VOC solvent , unwanted salt byproducts can often be removed by filtration and the low -boiling solvent can easily be recovered by distillation. Chemistry in natural systems predominantly occurs in water as the solvent, making it a good solvent for related processes and chemicals. Water is used in many biocatalytic reactions. It is also a good solve nt for many inorganic chemicals and certain organic chemicals such as sugars, proteins, and some acids. Chemists have also studied water as a reaction medium for transformations of biobased raw materials. For example, cellulose can be broken down in water to yield glucose under relatively mild reaction conditions. Water is also used in steam distillation, a process for isolating heat - sensitive chemicals, such as essential oils. Aqueous -organic biphasic systems are an effective method for using water as a s olvent when working with hydrophobic chemicals, which can facilitate additional sustainability benefits such as catalyst recycling. In a biphasic system, hydrophobic substances are dissolved in the organic phase while hydrophilic substances are dissolved i n the water phase. Aqueous -organic biphasic systems can be especially useful for catalyst recycling. The catalyst can be selected to preferentially dissolve in the water phase, facilitating recovery and recycling from the rest of the reaction mixture, whic h remains in the organic phase. Vigorous stirring can be used to increase contact between the hydrophilic catalyst and hydrophobic reactants at the aqueous -organic interface. In another technique , a phase -transfer catalys t is added to the reaction, which f acilitates the transport of reactants between phases thereby increasing the rate of reaction. Water can also form biphasic systems with other non-VOC solvents such as supercritical carbon dioxide and others, further reducing the use of VOCs in a process. Micelles are another method for using water as a reaction medium with hydrophobic chemicals. A micelle is a sphere (or bubble) with a wall composed of a single layer of molecules. In water, micelles are formed by surfactants whose hydrophobic portions poin t Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 61 toward the center of the micelle to form the interior 'lining' of the bubble while the hydrophilic portions interact with water on the exterior of the micelle.109 Hydrophobic molecules will aggregate inside the hydrophobic center of these micelles and reactions can occur between the molecules gathered there. (See fig. 14.) One estimate is 109Commercial surfactants are typically derived from petroleum, but there are efforts underway to make from biobased feedstocks new surfactants that could be biodegradable or biocompatible. that micelles are used to produce ten million tons of polymer each year , primarily for use in environmentally friendly coatings.110 Micellar catalysis allows for catalysis of hydrophobic reactants or the use of hydrophobic catalysts in water. Micelles can be used with nanoparticle catalysts, and organocatalysts. 111 110F. M. Kerton and R. Marriott, Alternative Solvents for Green Chemistry , 2nd ed. (Cambridge, U.K.: The Royal Society of Chemistry, 2013), 102. 111For more on different types of catalysts see chapter 3. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 62 Figure 14: Reactions between hydrophobic reactants can occur inside micelle s in water This figure depicts a cross- section of a spherical micelle . There are several benefits to using micelles for catalytic purposes; however , there may be a limitation to using this method on a large scale . In addition to allowing reactions to occur in water, micellar catalysis offers other sustainability benefits such as facilitating production extraction. Similar to biphasic systems, an organic solvent that does not mix with water can be used to extract hydrophobic products from the mixture , leaving the micelles and catalysts in the water phase, which facilitates catalyst recycling. In cases where the product is completely insoluble in water, it can be collected by filtration and product extraction with an organic solvent is not necessary . A potential limitation is that the amount of reactants inside the micelles may be lower than in conventional solvents. However, according t o one of our experts, the limited volume inside the micelle can be an advantage, as the higher concentrations of reactants found there can allow some reactions that require the addition of heat when run in conventional solvents to proceed at ambient temper ature instead. One study by a pharmaceutical company found that use of surfactant technology in water in the synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient provided both environmental and economic benefits as Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 63 compared to the conventional route.112 The study compared two possible synthetic routes to an active pharmaceutical ingredient: conventional catalysis using organic solvents, and catalysis using surfactant technology in water. The authors used the metric PMI to assess the environmental performance of the two routes. 113 Using surfactant technology, the authors carried out the entire multi -step synthesis in water and reduced the overall PMI by over 30 percent as compared to the conventional route. The overall yield increased by five percent as well. Theref ore, the authors reported both an environmental improvement and better process performance . In particular, t he reduction in solvent use \u2014approximately 50 percent \u2014 provided most of the environmental benefits. The surfactant technology process produced a similar amount of water waste as the conventional process and the nature of the contamination did not vary , which the authors report ed as a benefit. For the purposes of this study the authors did not attempt to recycle the catalyst system. The authors propose t hat the reported process could also result in economic benefit s due to increased yield and decreased costs of raw materials, among other reasons. Supercritical carbon dioxide Supercritical carbon dioxide is an environmentally benign solvent with a 112F. Gallou, N. A. Isley, A. Ganic, U. Onken, and M. Parmentier, \"Surfactant Technology Applied Toward an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient: More than a Simple Green Chemistry Advance,\" Green Chemistry, vol. 18 (2016). The authors reported that the process may involve a micellar - assisted mechanism, although a nother mechanism is possible and further elucidation was still needed. 113See chapter 2 for a more detailed discussion of PMI. number o f interesting solvent properties; however , there are limitations to its use for certain applications.114 It is inexpensive, nontoxic, nonflammable, and the temperature and pressure at which it becomes a supercritical fluid are relatively mild compared to som e other substances . However, the use of supercritical fluids also violates the green chemistry principle that synthetic methods should be carried out at ambient temperature and pressure. Chemists can adjust, or tune, the solubility of other substances in s upercritical carbon dioxide by changing the pressure of the system. It can serve as an inert reaction medium or in reactions where carbon dioxide is consumed as one of the reactants. After a reaction, supercritical carbon dioxide can be separated from the product by depressurization, reducing energy consumption as compared to a process in which organic solvents must be removed. Many gases are soluble in supercritical carbon dioxide, which is not the case for most conventional solvents. However, it is nonpolar and may not be a suitable solvent for reactions involving polar or high molecular weight chemicals. Several techniques have been developed to mitigate this limitation including the use of cosolvents such as alcohols, or t he introduction of agents such as surfactants to enhance solubility. There are several types of reactions for which supercritical carbon dioxide is potentially a suitable solvent; however , there are still some barriers to implementation on a commercial scale. Supercritical carbon dioxide may be a 114Supercritical fluids are substances that have properties in between those of a gas and a liquid at or above a given temperature an d pressure, known as the critical point. Several other supercritical fluids are used by industry as solvents; however supercritical carbon dioxide is particularly relevant to sustainability efforts. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 64 particularly suitable solvent for reactions that: (1) run in nonpolar solvents, (2) are solvent - sensitive and thus likely to be 'pressure - tunable', (3) use gaseous reactants, and (4) have products of high enough v alue to offset the capital investment required to implement this technology. In some cases, the use of supercritical fluids in industrial processes is not commercially viable, most often due to the perceived high energy and equipment costs of pressurizing and working with the fluids . Special reactors and additional safety precautions are usually required for conducting reactions at elevated pressure. However, a 2015 study found that pressurizing carbon dioxide only accounted for a small portion of the total energy consumed in a pilot plant process, and therefore concluded that the perception that working at higher pressures means higher operating costs may not necessarily be true. 115 A process for the production of fluoropolymers such as TeflonTM in supercritical carbon dioxide was commercialized; however , this process is no longer in use by that company .116 Use of supercritical carbon dioxide improve s several environmental health and safety issues associated with the aqueous process for certain fluoropolymer s, such as eliminating the use and disposal of large quantities of acid, including the hazardous chemical perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA). 115L. Martin, C. Skinner, and R. J. Marriott, \"Supercritical Extraction of Oil Seed Rape: Energetic Evaluation of Process Scale,\" The Journal of Supercritical Fluids, vol. 105 (2015). 116According to an article written by one of the academic inventors of this t echnology and others, the licensing company did not scale the technology up beyond the initial investment, not due to problems with the technology but rather based on internal economic and other decisions. J. M. DeSimone, S. J. Mecham , and C. L. Farrell, \" Organic Polymer Chemistry in the Context of Novel Processes,\" ACS Central Science , vol. 2 (2016). Supercritical carbon dioxide has been demonstrated as a solvent in a variety of other applications. For example, supercritical carbon dioxide can replace ultrapure water in the manufacture of circuits and eliminate the need to use an alcohol solvent as a drying agent , or replace hazardous dry -cleaning chemicals. It can also be used to separate or purify substances in a process called supercritical fluid chromatography, providing an alternative to conventional liquid chromatography techniques that contribute significantly to organic solvent waste . One company representative we talked to told us that the use of this technology in the pharmaceutical industry has grown in the past 5 to 10 years. However, the representative cited the upfront costs of instrumentation and infrastructure, the high pressures required to run the process, and the solubility limitations of supercritical carbon dioxide due to its nonpolar nature as some of the challenges to implementation. Supercritical carbon dioxide is also a good extraction solvent because it is nontoxic; does not have a color, odor, or taste; and is easy to remove from the extracted mater ials, among other reasons. It is a potential replacement for n - hexane due to its nonpolar nature. T he beverage, food, flavor, and cosmetic industries have used supercritical carbon dioxide extraction to process various products, for example coffee decaffe ination. Instrumentation for supercritical chromatography and extraction are commercially available for both large and small scale processes. Ionic liquids The use of ionic liquids as sustainable solvents is a popular topic in research; however, there is some debate as to sustainability benefits of Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 65 this class of compounds. Ionic liquids are salts, usually composed of a positively charged organic ion and a negatively charged organic or inorganic ion , that are liquid at or below 100\u00b0C \u2014the boiling point of water. Ionic liquids generally have low volatility, which is the primary potential sustainability gain they offer over conventional solvents. However, there are concerns about the toxicity as well as environmental persistence and footprint of ionic liquids. One of our experts told us that many ionic liquids have been shown to be acutely toxic. However, whether an ionic liquid is toxic or nontoxic depends on the compound , and according to scientific literature and one of our experts, more research and data are needed to fully understand the toxicity of these compounds. The complex synthesis required to make some ionic liquids may also reduce their sustainability or increase costs. Recent research efforts have attempted to address these challenges by reducing th e toxicity and increasing the biodegradability of ionic liquids. According to one of our experts, a major disadvantage of ionic liquids is that often another solvent is required for product separation and purification, in which case recycling the ionic liq uid is usually not possible or not economically viable. Many ionic liquids are available and many more combinations of ions are possible, making it difficult to describe general properties of this class of solvents. Depending on their design, ionic liquids may be characterized by low volatility, overall robustness, and high heat capacity, among other properties. 117 The solvent properties of 117The heat capacity of a substance describes the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a particular quantity of the substance by one degree Ce lsius. ionic liquids can be tuned by varying the positively and negatively charged components of the compound (see text box below for an example of federal efforts to support the development of ionic liquids). Research has demonstrated the use of ionic liquids in a wide range of applications , including extraction of renewable raw materials, catalysis, and degreasing. According to one of our experts, industry is commercializing applications of ionic liquids, but at a slow rate. Example federal government program to support the development of ionic liquids The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosts an Ionic Liqui ds Database, ILThermo (http://ilthermo.boulder.nist.gov/ ). The database, which was created in 2006 in cooperation with the International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), is a free, web -based resea rch tool that allows users worldwide to access current data on various properties of both pure ionic liquids and mixtures. In creating the database, NIST and IUPAC recognized the need for organized, reliable data on the properties of ionic liquids, which a re critical when designing industrial processes. Source: GAO analysis of agency announcement . | GAO -18-307 In one industrial example, employing ionic liquid technology resulted in several benefits , including increased productivity and recycling of materials. This process, known as the BASIL process (Biphasic Acid Scavenging utilizing Ionic Liquids), was established in 2002 by BASF. This process replaces the conventional approach for making a raw material used in coating and ink technologies. In both the conventional and BASIL approaches, hydrogen chloride forms as a byproduct of the process and significantly decreases the yield if not removed. In the conventional process, triethylamine was Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 66 added to scavenge hydrogen chloride. However, the resulting triethylammonium chloride formed a thick mixture that reduced the efficiency of the reaction. In the BASIL process, 1 -methylimidazole is added to the reaction mixture instead; it reacts with the hydrogen chloride to form an ionic liquid (1 - methylimidazolium chloride) which melts at around 75\u00b0C. These conditions reportedly increased the reaction rate and increased the yield from 50 to 98 percent. In addition, the pure product can be easily separated from the 1 -methylimidazolium chloride, and the latter can be recycled back to 1 - methylimidazole and reused. The new process also allowed BASF to replace the use of batch processing in large reaction vessels with new reactor technologies, greatly increasing produ ctivity. (For more on the disadvantages of batch processing, see chapter 5). Figure 15: The redesign of the s ertraline manufacturing process Note: Adapted with permission from G. P. Taber, D. M.

Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 67 4.3.3 Solvent -free or reduced- solvent technologies Reduction in reaction steps The amount of solvent used in a chemical process can also be reduced by simplifying a multistep reaction scheme, thereby decreasing the volume and number of different solvents used. Many conventional chemical processes include multiple chemical reactions occurring in a stepwise manner. Often the desired intermediate c ompound produced in one step is isolated \u2014separated from the rest of the reaction mixture\u2014 and purified before proceeding to the next step. The process of separation and purification can be solvent -intensive , leading to large quantities of solvent waste. Additionally, a multistep chemical process may use multiple solvents, and cross -contamination of solvents can make recycling a challenge. Examples of this strategy come from the pharmaceutical industry , where complex multistep processes are commonly used in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Pfizer redesigned the synthetic process for sildenafil citrate (brand name Viagra \u00ae) in transitioning from the medicinal chemistry route used in the early stages of drug development to the commercial route of production.118 Pfizer developed a more efficient synthetic process , while also moving steps involving toxic chemicals to the beginning of the process and the cleaner steps closer to the final product. The new process reduced the number of purification 118P. J. Dunn, S. Galvin, and K. Hettenbach, \"The Development of an Environmentally Benign Synthesis of Sildenafil Citrate (Viagra) and Its Assessment by Green Chemistry Metrics,\" Green Chemistry, vol. 6 (2004). steps and consequently the volume of solvent used. The process change together with the introduc tion of a solvent recovery system reduced the volume of organic waste generated in the production of one kilogram of product from 1,300 liters to 7 liters. They also eliminated the use of chlorinated solvents and several other VOCs. In another example, Pfi zer won a Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2002 for redesigning the synthesis of sertraline, the active ingredient in the antidepressant marketed as Zoloft \u00ae.119 In redesigning the process, Pfizer streamlined a three -step sequence into a single step (see fig. 15 ).120 They also optimized the process by eliminating the need to use, distill, and recover four conventional VOC solvents \u2014 dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and hexane \u2014by using the more benign solvent ethanol. The use of ethanol as a solvent also reduced the need for large quantities of a problematic chemical (titanium tetrachloride). The final process used two different solvents rather than five and reduced the total volume of solvent by 76 percent. 119For a full list of Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards from 1996 -2016, see https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016 - 10/documents/aw ard_recipients_1996_2016.pdf , accessed .

Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 68 Solvent -free or neat reactions Chemical processes that do not use any solvents at all may offer the most sustainable option in terms of reducing waste. Solvent - free reactions can occur between chemicals in the liquid, gas, or solid states. For liquid phase reactions with no added solvent , often one of the reactants may be used in excess, essentially forming a solution.121 With solvent -free processes there is no reaction medium to remove , recycle , or dispose of as waste . This can lead to cost savings in addition to potential sustainability g ains. Solvent -free reactions can also be very rapid and high yielding. For example, researchers reported incorporating a solvent -free step into the synthesis of a potential antituberculosis drug, which had a higher yield than the same transformation conduc ted in ethanol.122 Introduction of a solvent -free reaction also facilitated the integration of multiple steps, thereby decreasing the number of energy -intensive separation and purification steps and further reducing solvent consumption . The optimized process including the solvent -free step allowed the authors to achieve almost three times the yield while using one -third as much solvent as compared to the original synthetic approach. Although solvent -free reactions are common in some sectors of the chemical in dustry, there are technical challenges to achieving new solvent -free chemical processes, 121Such cases may be more approp riately referred as neat reactions rather than solvent -free. Orita, K. Miwa, G. Uehara, and Solventless Reaction in a Multi -Step Process: Application to an Efficient Synthesis of PA -824,\" Advanced Synthesis & Catalysis , vol. 34 9 (2007). especially on an industrial scale. Solvent -free reactions are well established in some sectors of the chemical industry . For example, gas phase chemical processes are common in the manufacture of bulk chemicals such as polyethylene. One drawback to solvent -free reactions is that without a reaction medium, it can be difficult for heat generated during the reaction to dissipate evenly throughout the mixture. This can lead to 'hot spots' and unwanted side reactions. Further, some chemical reactions may become explosive when conducted in the solid or neat liquid state, something which solvent use generally prevents. Additionally, these reactions can lead to highly viscous or solid products, making industrial development a challenge. As VOCs are used for separation and purification in many solvent -free approaches , a reaction may be solvent -free while the chemical process as a whole is not . There are tech niques with the potential to overcome the challenges associated with solvent -free reactions at the industrial scale. In an approach called mechanochemistry, grinding is used to initiate chemical reactions in the solid state. One variant of this approach is the use of a ball mill\u2014 a vessel containing the reacting chemicals and ball bearings which is shaken at high speed. However, solid state reactions do not yet have widespread application in industry. In another approach, microwave reactors have been reporte d for use in solvent -free reactions that could be relevant to the pharmaceutical industry. 123 (See text box below for some examples of low- and no -VOCs in formulations). 123A. Domino Cyclization An Efficient Approach for the Synthesis of Substituted Quinolines,\" Green Chemistry , vol. 12 (2010). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 69 Low - or no -VOC formulations in coating technologies Industry has developed a variety of new coating technologies in response to regulations and environmental concerns regarding volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Many industry sectors are currently using coatings, such as paints or printing inks, containing low or no VOCs or h azardous air pollutants (HAPs) in the formulation. Examples of these coatings include water borne, biobased solventborne, and powder coatings, among others. Several new technologies for low -VOC coatings have received Presidential Green Ch emistry Challenge Awards. For example, in 2011, Sherwin -Williams developed low -VOC water borne paints made from recycled soda bottle plastic, acrylics, and soybean oil. They manufactured enough of these new paints in 2010 to eliminate over 800,000 pounds of VOCs. In 2009, Procter & Gamble and Cook Composites and Polymers developed paint formulations using biobased Sefose\u00ae oils to replace petroleum -derived solvents. Sefose\u00ae oils, made from sugar and vegetable oil, enabled the production of paints with less than half the solvent. (For more information on the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards, see c hapter 6.) Powder coatings are applied to a surface as a dry powder and do not require any solvent. The powder is sprayed electrostatically and then heate d to allow the coating to fuse. Powder coatings improve product durability as they can protect the product from scratches, corrosion, and other damage. In the 2015, the DOD's Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) awarded its proj ect-of-the-year award to the development of powder coating technology for Chemical Agent Resist ant Coatings (CARC). (For more information on SERDP, see chapter 6.) According to a SERDP press release, a t the time of the project the use of conventional CARC topcoats contributed 2.3 million pounds of VOCs and hazardous air pollutants to the environment each year. The key challenges to developing powder coatings suitable for this application were chemical warfare agent resistance, extremely low gloss, and high durability. A collaborative team from industry, academia, and the military successfully developed a CARC powder coating technology. These powder coatings emit nearly zero VOCs, can be recycled, and are compatible with existing CARC systems. Initial testing also indicates the powder coatings have better exterior durability than liquid CARC systems , which is important for corrosion prevention and mitigation.

This approach, which is still widely used in some sectors of the chemical industry, raises a num ber of sustainability concerns \u2014 especially when conducted on a large scale. These include the significant physical footprint required for the equipment; high energy and solvent use; and safety concerns under certain condit ions, such as when high pressures are required or when a hazardous intermediate is produced in significant quantities. Furthermore, processing in batch reactors can be labor- intensive and require a lot of manual coordination to execute the process flow, ac cording to one industry representative we interviewed. Therefore, the industry is researching and developing alternative technologies to improve efficiencies in manufacturing while also realizing significant gains in sustainability and environmental benefi ts. We assessed two such technologies \u2014continuous processing and continuous flow microreactors \u2014that can help chemical companies address some of these sustainability concerns. Table 8 summarizes some of the advantages and disadvantages of these two technolog ies; we provide additional details in the remainder of the chapter.

Workforce challenges: may need specialized personnel to design, develop, validate and operate a continuous flow process. Source: GAO. | GAO -18-307 5.1 Continuous processing In contrast to batch processing, in continuous processing the reaction mixture is continuously pumped through a reactor consisting of pipes or tube where reactions take place in a continuous mode. Rea ctants can be introduced and by products removed at appropriate points along the line , while finished product materials are continuously removed at the end. For reactions consisting of multiple steps using different conditions or components, vessels with different purposes can be linked and reaction components can flow from one stage to the next. In 2007, the ACS GCI Pharmaceutical Roundtable highlighted continuous processing as a key area where research was required to facilitate the development of sustainable manufacturing. 124 Continuous manufacturing is not new. It has been widely used by many sectors of the chemical industry for decades. Industries as diverse as oil, gas, chemicals, polymers, and food currently operate in continuous processing mode . One of our experts told us that his company uses continuous proces sing 124In 2005, the ACS GCI and global pharmaceutical corporations developed the ACS GCI Pharmaceutical Roundtable to encourage innovation while catalyzing the integration of green chemistry and green engineering in the pharmaceutical industry. The activities of the Roundtable reflect its member's shared belie f that the pursuit of green chemistry and engineering is imperative for business and environmental sustainability. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 72 in most \u2014estimated to be over 95 percent\u2014 of their production and generally at large scales. In contrast, the pharmaceutical industry has traditionally been dominated by batch process ing and only recently has there been a drive towards continuous proce ssing. The current adoption rate is approximately 5 percent in the pharmaceutical sector, despite one report noting that up to 50 percent of reactions could benefit from a continuous process.125 In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has started to research continuous processing as a manufacturing strategy to realize operational efficiencies and drive down cost. Continuous flow systems have become popular for the preparation of fine chemicals such as natural products and drugs, especially in academic research. For example, a collaborative effort between Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the pharmaceutical industry at the Novartis -MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing seeks to develop new technologies to replace the pharmaceutical industry 's conventional batch processing with continuous processing. Advantages of continuous processing One of the key benefits of continuous processing is eliminating a fixed batch size, thus allowing operational flexibility. Because of operational efficiencies achieved with continuous flow, the processing time can be reduced from mo nths to days. Continuous processing product lead times (i.e., the time 125T. S. Harrington, L. Alinaghian, and J. S. Srai, \"Making the Business Case for Continuous Manufacturing in the Pharmaceutical Industry\" (pap er presented at the 25th Annual Production and Operations Management Society Conference, Atlanta, GA, May 2014). from raw materials procurement to distribution of finished product) are typically significantly less than for b atch, which can substantially reduce inventory carrying costs. According to a university research presentation, p roduct yield and quality can be better in continuous processing compared to batch process es.126 Furthermore, continuous processing supports many of the key aspects of sustainable chemistry that are beneficial to workers and the environment, such as lower energy consumption, less waste production, less consumption of solvents, safer processes, and less exposure to chemicals. This technology can meet 10 out of the 12 Principles as outlined by Anastas et al., according to authors of a recent scientific publication. 127 According to one researcher, c ontinuous processing is usually preferred for large -scale production and is particularly well- suited for cases involving considerable heat transfer and whe n high pressures and high or low temperatures occur.128 For example, the Haber -Bosch process for production of ammonia\u2014 a gas phase reaction run under very high pressure \u2014is a good candidate for 126J.

It can reduce the physical footprint of a chemical process as well as labor costs through automation. This can reduce capital and ma intenance costs, according to a company official we interviewed . The official noted that they recently converted from batch processing to continuous processing for their polystyrene - to-styrene conversion process. The operational efficiency realized through continuous processing was critical to making the economics workable for them. A leading pharmaceutical company told us that they have installed an integrated continuous processing system at one of their manufacturing sites for making tablets from drug pow ders.130 This approach resulted in lower upfront investment costs compared to traditional facilities, a reduced environmental footprint, and savings of up to 35 percent in energy and resource use compared to batch processing. Estimates from an experimental study of process equipment showed approximately 10 times less material usage and 10 times faster processing than conventional batch equipment. According to a company's technical product literature and a conference paper, the 129The Haber -Bosch process is used to synthesize ammonia from gaseous nitrogen and hydrogen under high pressure and temperature in the presence of a catalyst. 130One pharmaceutical company has adopted a hybrid manufacturing approach that incorporates the best of batch and continuous manufacturing. That is, only certain segments of their operation are run in a continuous mode while the rest of the line is still run in a batch mode. Company representatives told us that they have used this approach to produce drug powders using a batch processing mode and then make tablets from the drug powders in a continuous mode. introduction of high levels of automation and reduced manual intervention , together with integrating inline analytical tools , provides significant benefits in terms of improved product consistency, high product quality , and a more controllable and repeatable process. Other benefits incl ude faster time- to- market for new drugs by saving time at the development stage and in the move from development to production. Furthermore, a continuous processing system also improves overall safety and reduces risk. Interconnected unit operations typica l of continuous processing systems can mean less product exposure to the environment and to operators , leading to increased product safety. Pharmaceutical company representatives we interviewed told us that some of the challenges they face in implementing continuous processing are: global regulatory uncertainty \u2014that is, the need to satisfy regulatory requirements in multiple countries; risk aversion \u2014a reluctance to change an already validated process, including the need to have changes in manufacturing app roved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); and economic uncertainties related to costs involved in developing new infrastructure for continuous manufacturing. 5.2 Continuous flow m icroreactors for pharmaceutical s and fine chemical s Innovations in conti nuous processing have led to the development of new reactor designs and support apparatus that allow substantially smaller, cleaner, safer, more energy -efficient, and more scalable methods for the production of pharmaceutical and fine (specialty) chemical products. One such Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 74 reactor design that is gaining acceptance in pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industry is the continuous flow microreactor. As the name indicates, these reactors have very small dimensions and use continuous flow for chemical processin g. Microreactors can potentially improve chemical processes and routes . However, their integration into chemical production processes depends on many factors such as technical advancements, costs, and production logistics, among others. Microreactors have various designs, but one design consists of channels of small dimensions that are etched in glass, silicon - glass, ceramic, polymers, or stainless steel that have volumes typically ranging from 50 microliters to 100 milliliters and channel diameters from 5 0 to 1000 micrometers. The chemical reactions take place in a series of microchannels forming the core of the reactor (see fig. 16 ). Microreactors can include additional elements to precisely control the reaction parameters and improve energy efficiency. Microreactor technology has been adopted by companies in the pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance, fine chemical, and agricultural chemical industries, among others. New generations of pharmaceutical drugs have been developed through research using microre actors. This technology enables cost- effective synthesis and screening of novel chemicals with enhanced speed. Miniaturization of chemical reactors offers many fundamental and practical advantages to the pharmaceutical industry. Figure 17 illustrates a gen eric multi- step synthesis that uses continuous flow microreactors to produce a drug or other chemical. Figure 16: Pictures of the channels of a microreactor and a production scale continuous flow microreactor Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 75 Figure 17: A generic multi -step synthesis that uses continuous flow microreactors to produce a drug or other chemical Recent publications report on the growing interest of pharmaceutical companies in the use of microreactor technology for the s afe and efficient production of drugs. Figure 18 shows c ontinuous flow microreactors used in a pharmaceutical production plant . Figure 18: Continuous flow microreactors in a pharmaceutical production plant According to m any pharmaceutical company represe ntatives we interviewed , their companies are researching continuous flow processes because this technology offers several benefits, including a smaller manufacturing footprint, higher throughput compared to a batch process, and safety, among others. Advan tages of microreactor technology Innovations in the developing field of microreactors have delivered more sustainable chemical processes and technologies resulting in higher productivity and commercially viable high -purity products. The advantages inheren t to microreactors \u2014 enhanced reaction control, improved safety, reduced material inputs, and reduced levels of hazardous waste, among others \u2014provide a more sustainable option for the chemical industry . Enhanced reaction control : According to some researche rs, the key advantage of microreactors in organic synthesis is the ability to achieve a high degree of control over reaction parameters such as temperature, pressure, and residence time (i.e., the amount of time the reactants spend inside the system). The high surface -to- volume ratio of microreactors \u2014potentially over 1000 times higher than a batch reactor\u2014and the reactor design allow for rapid and efficient mixing to achieve homogeneity, precise control of stoichiometry, high reaction speed, and improved he at transfer leading to enhanced temperature control compared to a batch reactor. According to pharmaceutical company representatives we interviewed , for Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 76 reactions requiring mixing, continuous processing achieves a higher degree of mixing than can be achiev ed in batch processing. Furthermore, at this scale the reactants do not mix by turbulent flow, as when a batch reactor is stirred, but rather diffuse together as they move along the channel, allowing for a highly controllable and repeatable process. Micror eactors are also much easier to pressurize, allowing for high pressure and high temperature operations that can be advantageous for some reactions. This offers additional flexibility for process chemistry. For example, solvents such as dichloromethane can be used at 70\u00b0C, or acetonitrile at 140\u00b0C, much above their respective boiling points. 131 Additionally, the smaller reactor volume makes it relatively easier to scale -up exothermic reactions without the need for special equipment or additional precautions.132 Safe completion of hazardous reactions involving unstable or potentially explosive intermediates : According to pharmaceutical company representatives we interviewed, a continuous flow microreactor provides an opportunity to safely handle hazardous materials \u2014including potentially explosive intermediates such as azides that may form during a reaction \u2014because such intermediates move right into subsequent 131These solvents have boiling points of 40\u00b0C and 82\u00b0C respectively at norma l atmospheric pressure. Thus, higher pressure operation elevates their boiling points so they can remain in liquid phase even at temperatures above their boiling points. Putting the solvent in a super -heated state above its normal boiling point speeds up t he reaction. 132An exothermic reaction releases heat into its surroundings. reactions as soon as they are produced.133 For example, a review article by Mason and colleagues reported a well-controlled and direct fluorination reaction (a carbon -fluorine bond -forming reaction that introduces fluorine into a compound) in microreactors.134 These reactions typically cannot be run on a large scale because of their exothermicity, potential for explosion, and lack of selectivity. According to one of our experts, w hile the use of inherently hazardous substances does not meet the goals of sustainable chemistry, a microreactor can make their use in a process possible . Furthermore, some exothermic reactions require extremely low temperatures to control \u2014as low as - 80\u00b0C , which can be very challenging to achieve, requiring costly cryogenic systems \u2014and may not be practical on a large scale. For these processes, a continuous flow microreactor can be cons idered as an alternative to low temperature reactions, because at very small volumes, managing temperature becomes less important, according to pharmaceutical company representatives we interviewed. The unique heat transfer characteristics of a continuous flow microreactor allow highly exothermic reactions to be conducted in a controlled manner at significantly higher temperatures than in batch processing, thus decreasing the overall process energy demands. 133Azides are any class of chemical compounds containing three nitrogen atoms as a group, represented as ( -N3). Most azides are unstable substances that are highly sensitive to shock a nd have explosive characteristics. 134B. P. Mason, K. E. Price, J. L. Steinbacher, A. R. Bogdan, and D. T. McQuade, \"Greener Approaches to Organic Synthesis Using Microreactor Technology,\" Chemical Reviews , vol. 107, no. 6 (2007). Fluorinated molecules are valuable as pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals, among other uses. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 77 In another example, tetrazoles are not suited for large -scale synthesis since explosive reagents, toxic metal -containing compounds, or an excess of azide are required.135 The hazard with azide use is the generation of hydrazoic acid, which is a volatile and explosive liquid. Palde and Jamison reported a safe and efficient synthesis of tetrazole products from nitrile compounds and sodium azide performed in a flow microreactor that minimized safety risks while allowing a shorter reaction time due to the flexibility of operating at elevated temperature and pressure. 136 The authors concluded that the most important attributes of this process \u2014 high yield, near -equal nitrile:azide ratio, minimal hydrazoic acid generation, and short reaction time\u2014 are collectively possible only because the reactions can be conducted at elevated temperature (190\u00b0C). This critical reaction feature is feasible only in the continuous flow format, wherein there is no headspace in which hydrazoic acid could accumulate to an explosive level. In contrast, a closed -system batch process at 190\u00b0C would be far too hazardous, and without elevation of the reaction temperature, the reaction rate would be well below a usable level. Thus, the continuous flow microreactor made it possible to safely produce tetrazoles on a commercial scale. Shorter reacti on time : Continuous flow microreactors generally increase the 135Tetrazoles are an important class of cyclic compounds which are used in a wide range of applications such as organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis, as propellants and explo sives, and perhaps most commonly in medicinal chemistry. Their wide utility has prompted significant efforts towards their safer synthesis. 136P. B. Palde and T. F. Jamison, \"Safe and Efficient Synthesis in a Continuous- Flow Microreactor,\" Angewand te Chemie International Edition, vol. 50, issue 15 (2011). efficiency of a process, which is reflected in a decrease in total reaction time. This is possible through better temperature control compared to batch process ing. Shorter reaction times allow f or lower energy use, especially in high or low temperature reactions or for reactions requiring very precise temperature control. The improved efficiency also leads to more selective chemistry, which reduces waste. Therefore, a short reaction time generall y correlates to lower waste, less energy consumption, and a more efficient reaction overall. For example, scientists from Eli Lilly reported on a multi- step flow synthesis of the drug fluoxetine, the active ingredient in Prozac \u00ae, in 2011. The flow reactor afforded a shorter reaction time and the safe handling of hazardous intermediates. In general, the hazard potential of strongly exothermic or explosive reactions can be significantly reduced because of ease of control of process parameters \u2014including pressu re, temperature, residence time, and flow rates \u2014in reactions that take place in small volumes. Prevention of waste through optimization of solvents : According to authors of a recent scientific publication , reaction solvents contribute greatly towards wast e generation in synthetic processes. Performing reactions under solvent -free conditions is still a desirable approach. 137 However, in batch reactions, there is often poor thermal management and solvents are needed to keep solutions dilute and prevent an unco ntroll ed reaction. Thus, batch processes can be wasteful. 138 In contrast, continuous 137Wiles and Watts, \"Continuous Flow Reactors,\" 38. 138For example, Gerogiorgis and Jolliffe reported that the E - factor (waste -to-product ratio) of a batch procedure could be as high as 25 -100 for drug s, indicating that 25 -100 kg of waste Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 78 flow microreactors have much better thermal management . Therefore, it is possible to manage such reactions in a safe and efficient manner in the absence of a diluting solven t. Thus, continuous flow microreactors help to prevent waste as they are more amenable to low-solvent or no -solvent reaction conditions. In this regard, Jamison and co -workers developed a continuous flow process using a microreactor for the synthesis of diphenhydramine hydrochloride, which is an active ingredient in several widely used medications (e.g., Benadryl\u00ae, Tylenol\u00ae PM) and has a worldwide demand higher than 100 tons/year.139 By using a microreactor at 175\u00b0C with a residence time of 16 minutes, their process minimized waste and reduced purification steps and production time with respect to existing batch synthetic routes. The reaction rate was also enhanced by running the reaction at a higher temperature (above the boiling point of the reactant) under solvent -free conditions. Similarly, Merck and Lonza devised a simpler and safer continuous flow synthesis of efavirenz (an essential drug for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) ) without the use of toxic solvents that led to its shortest manufacturing route. Continuous flow reactions also align with atom economy (a measure of the percentage of the mass of reactants that are incorporated into the product), another metric to assess waste. Because continuous flow allows for enhanced control ove r the reaction conditions, high - are generated for every 1 kg of drug produced. D. I. Gerogiorgis and H. G. Jolliffe, \"Continuous Pharmaceutical Process Engineering and Economics,\" Chimica Oggi - Chemistry Today , vol. 33, no. 6 (2015). 139D. R. Snead and T. F. Jamison, \"End- to-End Continuous Flow Synthesis and Purification of Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride Featuring Atom Economy, In -line Separation, and Flow of Molten Ammonium Salts,\" Chemical Sc ience, vol. 4 (2013). purity products can be produced. This reduces waste that may otherwise be produced from subsequent purification processes. Automated process optimization and analysis : According to a company's microreactor technology review, m uch of the effort of organic chemists is consumed in searching for optimal reaction conditions to achieve a particular transformation resulting in a specific molecular target. For example, many organic transformations depend on multipl e factors that determine the outcome of the reaction. Thus, process optimization frequently requires an investment of time and large quantities of valuable starting materials. Additionally, in traditional batch processing, reactions may take days to optimize because processing takes place in a series of discrete steps, with hold times between steps so samples can be tested offline for quality. In contrast, in a flow process , a sequence of reactions can be run continuously through the system. High levels of automation and rapid screening of reaction conditions reduces processing time. That is, process monitoring is automated in continuous processing and is carried out more frequently than in batch processing. Reaction parameters such as reaction time, stoichi ometry, temperature, and the timing for adding reactants can be varied in any combination. Each experiment consumes very little of the starting material\u2014 as little as 100 microliters \u2014according to one company's product literature . This means that many experi mental points can be generated in a short time, allowing the chemist to quickly identify the optimum conditions. This greatly reduces drug development time. A company's product literature report ed that continuous flow microreactors have the ability to acce lerate the research and development phase in organic chemistry and Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 79 reduce development cost so that companies can benefit from much shorter time -to- market for new drugs. Another advantage over batch processing is the tunable nature of continuous flow throu gh the use of in -line analytics. In -line analytics are used to monitor the process in real- time and its implementation is considered key to quality control in continuous processing. The introduction of in - line analytics improves the quality, consistency, a nd efficiency of process steps, leading to improved product quality. For example, real -time monitoring of continuous flow processes through the use of in -line analytics enables rapid identification and resolution of issues with product quality. In - line analytical tools such as Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy have been coupled to microreactors. These tools allow a researcher to monitor the reaction in real time, determine reaction parameters, and characterize intermediates. T hese data can help improve process understanding and control which may reduce the risk of wasting product because of non -compliance with desired product quality. Real time analysis also assists with the optimization of key reaction parameters such as resid ence time, temperature, reaction time, pressure, feed rate of contents, and concentration of reactants, leading to improved product quality and consistency. Ease of scale -up: One of the benefits of microreactor technology is its ease of scalability compared to conventional batch reactors. 140 For example, continuous flow 140Scale- up in this case refers to increasing product output by adding more microreactors to the production line, rather than processes allow reactions to be conducted with fewer steps and fewer formal protecting groups. This eliminates the need for extra purification steps and allows for more efficient use of time and materials. Overall, this enables a safer scale -up process, which is among the primary reasons companies consider using continuous flow microreactors, according to a review by Wiles and Watts . 141 Additionally, continuous manufacturing can potentially allo w increased production volume without the bottlenecks related to scale -up, providing more response capacity. Eliminating such bottlenecks may facilitate rapid clinical development of breakthrough drugs. For example, the authors of a published review of dru g synthesis using continuous flow chemistry reported on AstraZeneca's scale -up efforts for their gastroesophageal reflux inhibitor target drug called AZD6906, which they achieved through better control of exothermic reaction with flow chemistry. 142 In early development , this drug was prepared in batches. H owever, studies showed potential concerns regarding exothermic reaction profiles as well as product instability which needed to be addressed when moving to larger scale synthesis. They used microreactor flow chemistry to circumvent some of these issues and subsequently developed a route to increasing the reactor volume as is generally done during a scale- up operation. 141C. Wiles and P. Watts, \"Continuous Process Technology: A Tool for Sustainable Production, \" Green Chemistry , vol.16, no. 55 (2014). According to the authors, a recent survey of 50 European Companies reported that safety was the primary reason for choosing to implement or investigate flow processing. 142M. Baumann and I. R. Baxendale, \"The Synthesis of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) Using Continuous Flow Chemistry,\" Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry , vol. 11 (2015). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 80 efficiently and reliably provide sufficient quantities of AZD6906 in continuous flow mode while addressing safety issues. The benefits of a continuous flow microreactor\u2014superior heat dissipation and improved temperature control due to reduced reaction volume \u2014allowed the exothermic reaction to be carried out safely. More recently, scientists at Novartis developed a semi- continuous flow process for the synthesis of the oral an ti- diabetic agent vildagliptine. The flow process allowed for the instantaneous consumption of a hazardous intermediate formed during the reaction, thus allowing for a safe scale -up. Savings in capital and operational expenditures : Pharmaceutical companies also consider using continuous processing in response to increasing research and development costs and competition from manufacturers of generic drugs . Several studies have reported that continuous manufacturing could reduce both operating expenditures and capital expenditures for the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries . 143 According to the authors of these studies , capital expenditures are reduced because continuous manufacturing allows the use of smaller production facilit ies that also have a smaller plant footprint and fewer unit operations. Operational expenditures are lower in continuous manufacturing due to factors such as reduced 143T. Harrington, L. Alinaghian, and J.

According to a company scientist we interviewed , alth ough an upfront capital investment is required to implement microreactor technology, the reactions associated with this approach are generally 5 to 10 times lower in cost. That is, the relatively smaller footprint of a continuous flow microreactor has an economic advantage compared to batch flow reactors. According to another company scientist we interviewed, continuous flow technology is a significant area of investment, justifying new development funding, because it ultimately reduces costs through lower energy usage and also reduces waste. Potential for improved product yield : A review article by Mason and colleagues reported that a Suzuki reaction \u2014an important type of reaction \u2014achieved 68 percent conversion in a microreactor, a notable increase relative to the batch reaction (10 percent yield) . 144 144Mason, Price, Steinbacher, Bogdan, and McQuade, \"Greener Approaches to Organic Synthesis,\" 2300. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 81 5.3 Disadvantages of and barriers to continuous manufacturing However, despite the many advantages offered by continuous processing and microreactors for some processes, there are also trade -offs. According to repr esentatives of a pharmaceutical company we interviewed , some of the reasons for the slow adoption of continuous manufacturing by the pharmaceutical industry include risk aversion and economic aspects \u2014for example, the cost of building new infrastructure for flow system s. Batch manufacturing has been the process of choice for the pharma industry because of its familiarity, among other reasons. Industry scientists told us that it is challenging to change from what is proven and accepted to something new. Furth ermore, pharmaceutical company officials we interviewed told us that the cost involved in developing new infrastructure for continuous processing may discourage the use of this technology. Complex processing conditions : According to a white paper by Baxend ale et al., the diversity and complexity of molecules of interest and the consequent need for diverse and complex processing conditions makes the adoption of continuous manufacturing challenging for the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. 145 Pharmac eutical molecules typically have complicated synthetic routes requiring several steps that involve highly specialized molecular transformations, such as separation and purification steps. This is a key reason why 145Baxendale, Braatz, Florence, Hodnett, Jensen, Johnson, Sharratt, and 781. processing dominates in pharmaceutica l production: a small number of temperature - or pressure -controlled, agitated vessels can be used for virtually all of the necessary reaction, liquid -liquid extraction, distillation, adsorption, and crystallization steps associated with a drug's synthetic route. Integrating these steps in a continuous process is challenging because it requires carefully controlled reaction rates that are coordinated with the process flows of sequential steps. Furthermore, most routes conceived during small -scale laboratory development have historically been batch - based and were scaled -up accordingly. Economic uncertainties : While cost savings can be expected from continuous processing in a microreactor through improved yield, automation, new reaction pathways such as solven t-free reactions, and improvements in safety, these economic gains are difficult to evaluate, according to the authors of a report. 146 However , representatives from one pharmaceutical company we interviewed told us that they are manufacturing tablet drug products from drug powders \u2014previously a batch operation \u2014in a continuous mode . According to a company's website article, tablet manufacturing is one area where pharmaceutical companies are choosing to demonstrate continuous processing in drug manufacturing. Th e reported benefits are increased equipment efficiency , savings in space , reduction of raw material and energy usage , reduction of scrap waste , and reduction of h uman interference, among others, which the company believes would 146D. M. Roberge , L. B. Zimmermann, \"Microreactor Technology: A Revolution for the Fine Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industries?\" Chemical Engineering & Technology , vol. 28, no. 3 (2005). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 82 also result in lower costs of operations and improved safety .147 Different reaction phases : While pharmaceutical companies are developing continuous processing to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability, it is not a universal solution for every reaction, according to scient ists from one company we interviewed. For example, continuous processing is not well- suited to a slurry -based reaction. 148 An analysis by Roberge et al. of various aspects and applicability of microreactor technology reported that continuous flow microreacto rs handle solids very poorly.149 Rather, they are suited for homogenous reactions \u2014those occurring in a single phase \u2014and, to some extent, gas -liquid , or liquid -liquid reactions. The authors found that solids were present as catalysts, reactants, or products in more than 60 percent of the reactions they studied . They noted that this limitation of microreactor technology is an important consideration , given that the number of potential candidates drops significantly after discounting reactions involving solids \u2014unless technological capabilities are developed that allow microreactors to handle solids . Workforce challenges : According to the authors of a white paper, \"Achieving Continuous Manufacturing,\" another 147I. Backx, The Key to Continuous Manufacturing, accessed -industries/continuous- manufacturing/Documents/Article- a semi- liquid fine particles suspended in water. 149Roberge, Ducry, Bieler, Cretton, and Zimmermann, \"Microreactor Technology,\" 318. challenge with con tinuous manufacturing is that the sk ill set and capabilities required to design, develop, validate, and operate a continuous flow process are different from those required for conventional batch processing. 150 Furthermore, according to a policy article on promoting continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical sector, \"designing, implementing, and adequately regulating these new approaches to manufacturing will require a highly skilled and well- trained workforce .\"151 Global regulatory uncertainty : According to a policy article on continuous man ufacturing and industry representatives we interviewed, the pharmaceutical sector is highly regulated, and any changes to an established manufacturing process may face regulatory delays. 152 Therefore, global regulatory uncertainty may be another barrier to implementing continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry. Industry representatives we interviewed told us that while FDA may support continuous manufacturing, regulatory authorities in other countries may not be as accommodating or may impose a heavier burden in terms of having to demonstrate product equivalency for any process changes, among others. 150Baxendale, Braatz, Florence, Hodnett, Manufacturing,\" 781. 151Center for Health Policy at Brookings, Promoting Continuous Manufacturing in the Pharmaceutical Sector, Discussion guide, October 19, 2015, accessed November 17, 2017, https://www.brookings. edu/wp- content/uploads/2015/10/Continuous- manufacturing - discussion- guide.pdf . 152Center for Health Policy at Brookings, Promoting Continuous Manufacturing, 2015. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 83 6 Roles of the federal government and other stakeholders in supporting the development and use of more sustainable chemical processes and products The federal government and other stakeholders play a number of roles, sometimes in collaboration, to advance the development and use of more sustainable chemical processes and products. First, federal programs and offices support research on the impacts of chemicals on human and environmental health. Second, federal program s and offices support the development of more sustainable chemical processes and their commercialization. Third, federal programs and offices aid in the expansion of markets for products manufactured with more sustainable chemicals and processes. In additi on, other stakeholders play similar roles and some additional roles that contribute to the development and use of more sustainable chemical processes and products. 6.1 Federal programs support research on the impacts of chemicals on human and environmental health A number of federal programs and offices support basic research on the characteristics and biological effects of chemicals that underpins the development and use of more sustainable chemistry products and processes. Federal programs fund and study the impacts of chemicals on human health and the environment, develop new methodologies for testing and predicting these effects, award grants for research on chemicals and new methodologies, identify more sustainable chemical alternatives, and evaluate the risks of chemicals. See table 9 for selected examples of federal programs and offices that support research on the impacts of chemicals on human health and environment health. ( For more information how these programs and offices were selected, see app. 1.) 6.1.1 The National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducts studies on chemical substances that inform regulatory agencies NTP, headquartered at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), conducts and coordinates HHS toxicology research on the p otential human health effects of chemicals, develops improved methods and approaches for testing these effects, and shares information about hazardous chemicals with decision makers. According to NTP's 2016 Annual Report, the program's budget was $131 million in fiscal year 2016.153 Since its inception in 1978, NTP has studied the health effects of more than 2,500 chemical substances, including dietary supplements, industrial chemicals, consumer products, and complex mixtures. NTP selec ts which chemicals to study based on recommendations from a range of stakeholders, including academic institutions, advocacy groups, federal, state, and local 153U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Toxicology Program Office of Liaison, Policy, and Review, Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2016 (Research Triangle Park, N.C.: 2017). Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 84 agencies, industry, and programs within NTP. NTP's current research portfolio focuses on testing synthetic industrial chemicals, pesticides, drugs, metals, and food additives. For example, NTP has investigated such things as the health effects of a flame retardant used in furniture materials , an artificial flavoring used in food and beverages , and a p erfume ingredient used in soaps and shampoos. In 2014, when about 10,000 gallons of coal- processing chemicals spilled into the Elk River in West Virginia, the water source for the city of Charleston, West Virginia, NTP evaluated the potential toxicity of the chemicals to inform the public and federal and local decision makers .

Chemical and Material Risk Management Program Department of Defense Identifies and seeks to manage the risks associated with hazardous chemicals and materials. Source: GAO analysis of agency documentation. | GAO -18-307 NTP also develops new and improved testing methodologies to evaluate the human h ealth effects of chemicals. While NTP generally conducts toxicological testing using rodent models, the program also seeks to develop faster and predictive tests for toxicological research that reduce or replace animal testing. NTP also participates in p rograms that support alternative testing methods includ ing the Toxicology in the 21 st Century (Tox21) program (described in more detail below) and the Transform Tox Testing Challenge: Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 85 Innovating for Metabolism.154 NTP is also working to ensure that new tests are accepted for regulatory decision making. NTP manages the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods , which includes representatives from 16 federal regulatory and research agencies and offices that use, generate, or disseminate toxicological and safety testing information, including the National Cancer Institute and Occupational Safety and Health Administration.155 NTP makes its research available to federal agencies, states, scientists, the medical community, and the pu blic and provides guidance and interpretation of the scientific data and its appropriate use. NTP information is available through technical, toxicity, and research reports, federal register notices, journal publications, press releases , and online databas es. Agencies use NTP's research for decision making when developing guidelines and regulations to protect public health. For example, NTP findings are used by the EPA in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), which identifies and characterizes the health hazards of chemicals found in the environment and by the Human Health Risk 154In 2016, EPA, NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH's NIEHS, and NTP announced the Transform Tox Testing Challenge: Innovating for Metabolism , which plans to award up to $1 million for improvements in the relevance and predictivity of data generated from automated chemical screening technology used for toxicity testing. 155The 16 agencies and offices include: Agency for Toxic Substances and Di sease Registry, Consumer Product Safety Commission, DOD, DOE, Department of Interior, Department of Transportation, EPA, FDA, NIEHS, NIH, USDA, National Cancer Institute, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Institute of Standards and Technology, National Library of Medicine, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Assessment program, which supports environmental decision making by assessing the human and environmental health risks posed by chemicals. Based on NTP's study findings that hexavalent chromium in drinking water can cause cancer, California adopted drinking water standards for the chemical in 2014. In 2016, citing NTP's Report on carcinogens and others that found that the chemical trichloroethylene can lead to a cancer, the De partment of Veterans Affairs amended its regulations regarding veteran's service -connected disability benefits for service members exposed to the chemical in the water supply at U.S Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. NTP also interprets relevant scientific re sults for the public's benefit through factsheets and podcasts. For example, NTP has compiled a factsheet and produced a podcast for the general public on the potential health hazards of b isphenol A (BPA), a chemical found in many plastic products such as water bottles. 6.1.2 HHS and EPA s creen chemicals through the Tox21 program Tox21 seeks to improve how scientists predict the safety of chemicals by developing and applying new testing methods to accurately and quickly predict whether chemicals have the potenti al to affect human health. Tox21 combines funding, expertise, data, and tools from NIH, including NTP at NIEHS and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and EPA and FDA. The Tox21 testing methods allow officials to prioritize chemicals for further, more costly and time -consuming toxicological evaluations and could be used to develop strategies that can be used directly by regulatory agencies to regulate chemicals). For example, high -throughput screening uses automated methods (including the robotic Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 86 arm pictured in fig. 19) to rapidly evaluate a large number of chemicals for biological responses to determine how the chemicals affect cellular functions that are linked to diseases. The partner agencies work together and solicit input from re searchers, companies, and NGOs to select the chemicals and tests that will be performed as part of the Tox21 program. Since 2008, the Tox21 partner agencies have used a high -throughput screening platform to assess approximately 10,000 chemicals for their p otential impacts on biological systems. The results of these tests, which are available free of charge, allow researchers to prioritize chemicals that have shown a potential to effect human health for testing and are also used by decision makers to assess health risks. For instance, the Minnesota Department of Health is using Tox21 data for assessing health risks associated with water contaminants. Tox21 relies on voluntary budget allocations and in kind contributions from its partner agencies. Figure 19: High throughput screening equipment at the Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21) robotics facility at the National Institutes of Health National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences 6.1.3 EPA's Chemical Safety for Sustainability (CSS) program generates data and develops tools and public databases The CSS research program develops tools and methodologies to test the properties of chemicals and generate hazard, exposure, and risk assessment data across the life cycle of thousands of chemicals. A number of EPA laboratories and centers contribute to the CSS research program, including the National Center for Computational Toxicology and the National Risk Management Research Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 87 Laboratory.156 According to EPA officials, CSS's budget for fiscal year 2016 was $89 million. CSS develops new methodologies, tools, and models for evaluating and predicting the safety of chemicals for human health and generates data using these tools. For example, the National Center for Computational Toxicology runs the Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) which uses high throughput screening data to identify and prioritize chemicals used in industrial and consumer products that may present a potential risk to human health. The Center , in partnership with the National Exposure Research Laboratory, also manages an Exposure Forecaster tool that predict s the potential for human and environmental exposures to chemicals. To address a critical gap in data on the potential of chemicals to disrupt neurodevelopment, CSS is also working to develop faster and less costly methods for testing for neurodevelopmental toxicity, acco rding to EPA officials. CSS uses these tools and others to identify the characteristics and potential human health risks of chemicals, evaluating thousands of chemicals more efficiently than is possible using traditional research methods such as animal testing. For example, over 1,800 chemicals have been evaluated by ToxCast and the Exposure Forecaster has predicted exposures for almost 8 ,000 chemicals. CSS develops public databases and tools to facilitate the use of chemical data by industry in the selection, design, and use of chemicals by federal regulators. For example, CSS has 156Other EPA entities that contribute to the CSS research program include the National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, National Exposure Research Laboratory, and National Center for Environmental Assessment. made the results of ToxCast and Tox21 testing publically available for decision makers through a ToxCast Das hboard and is developing guidance for decision makers on how to interpret and evaluate ToxCast data in several different decision contexts. CSS is also working on case studies to guide decision - making when using its data, including two with the EPA's Offic e of Pesticide Programs to support the prioritization of pesticide ingredients for further testing. CSS compiles and centralizes data for decision makers from a wide range of sources. One of these resources, the CompTox Chemistry Dashboard, provides users access to curated information from a wide variety of sources on the structures and properties of more than 700,000 chemicals. According to EPA officials, the data in the dashboard can be used by decision makers to inform regulations, prioritize chemicals f or additional testing, or support the use of alternative chemicals. Information generated by CSS supports decision making by federal and state actors. For example, CSS data are used to inform EPA legislative mandates and policies, including the Clean Air and Water Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and others. EPA's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention is using CSS tools and approaches to support the implementation of TSCA and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, according to EPA officials . To assist EPA in fulfilling its congressional mandate to screen certain chemicals for potential endocrine disruption, 157 CSS used data from ToxCast, to 157Specifically, the Food Quality Protection Act requires EPA to develop a screening program to determine whether certain substances may have an effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen, and other other endocrin e effects that EPA may designate. 21 U.S.C \u00a7 Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 88 create a customized tool , the Endocrine Disruption Screening Program. According to officials, the State of California uses National Center for Computational Toxicology data to support risk assessments of pesticides and companies include the data in dossiers on their products subm itted to the European Chemicals Agency. CSS works closely with the offices that administer federal regulations to shape CSS's research plans to best meet their needs. The National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), one of the EPA offices that support CSS research, works to identify risks to human and environmental health, including those posed by chemicals, and develops tools to help manage those risks . According to EPA officials, these tools and data enable decision makers to identify and design chemicals that are more sustainable. NRMRL also develops and conducts life cycle inventories to develop a base of information for use by decision makers in conducting LCAs. For instance, NRMRL is working with DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on a life cycle model of electricity production and distribution that can be dropped into other analysis or tools that provide life cycle impact analysis for chemicals. NRMRL, along with EPA's National Exposure Research Laboratory, is also developing a Life -Cycle Human Exposure Model that will allow decision makers to rapidly evaluate chemical and product safety by bringing together life cycle assessment and chemical exposure modeling. 346a(p)(1). The substances include pesticide chemicals and those chemicals that may have an effect that is cumulative to an effect of a pesticide chemical if the Administrator determines that a substantial popul ation may be exposed to such substance. 21 U.S.C \u00a7 346a(p)(3). 6.1.4 EPA, NSF, HHS, and DOE fund research on how chemicals impact human and environmental health Federal programs provide funding for research on the impacts of chemicals and how to measure those impacts. EPA and NSF fund academic research in the development of new methodologies and models for testing and understanding chem ical effects and exposure through several grant programs. EPA's Science to Achieve Results (STAR) grant program provides funding for research into safer, more sustainable use of chemicals in products . For instance, EPA awarded approximately $3.8 million in funding to six universities through the STAR Systems -Based Research for Evaluating Ecological Impacts of Manufactured Chemicals grant program to develop new methods for evaluating how exposure to chemicals influences the health of ecosystems and how to pr edict, prevent, and mitigate these effects. EPA and NSF jointly awarded grants through the Networks for Characterizing Chemical Life Cycles program which provided approximately $10 million over four years to two interdisciplinary research teams that explor ed methods and tools to characterize and predict the impacts of chemicals. HHS provides funding through NIEHS to support research on the impacts of chemicals on human health , such as how bisphenol A ( BPA) acts as an endocrine disruptor and evaluating the t oxic and carcinogenic potential of chemicals in dietary supplements and herbal medicines. DOE funds basic sustainable chemical research as well. For example, several of the Energy Frontier Research Centers focus on long -term fundamental challenges in chemi cal research including the Center for Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Biofuels and the Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 89 Integrated Mesoscale Architectures for Sustainable Catalysis. 6.1.5 EPA identifies substitutes for ozone - depleting substances EPA's Office of Air and Radiation Significant New Alternatives Policy ( SNAP ) program evaluates alternatives for ozone -depleting substances to help industry identify acceptable alternatives in order to comply with Clean Air Act regulations restricting use of these chemicals. 158 According to EPA, ozone -depleting substances accelerate the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer which protects humans and the environment from damaging ultraviolet light. SNAP evaluates manufacturer, formulator, or user- proposed substitutes for ozone -depleting subs tances . To do this, they use data primarily from the submitter of the substitute for review as well as data from a variety of sources such as other federal agencies on the health and environmental impacts of substitutes for ozone -depleting substance during the manufacturing, use, disposal, and recycling phases of the chemical's life cycle. SNAP evaluates substitutes based on their atmospheric impacts, (e.g., ozone depletion potential, global warming potential, and air quality), toxicity, flammability, and effect on occupational and consumer health and safety, and ecosystem effects. SNAP also evaluates potential exposure of the substitute by manufacturing facility workers, servicing 158Title VI of the Clean Air Act required EPA to establish regulations protecting the ozone layer by phasing out the production of substances that deplete it. The Act requires EPA to publish a li st of safe and unsafe substitutes for ozone - depleting substances, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons and to ban the use of unsafe substitutes. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7671 -7671q.b. technicians, and the general public. SNAP publishes an evolving list of accep table and unacceptable substitutes in eight industrial sectors including, for example, refrigeration and air conditioning, cleaning solvents, and fire suppression. In addition , SNAP publishes a series of factsheets and case studies on transitioning to alte rnatives. Companies can use the online list to identify alternatives to ozone -depleting substances to use in their manufacturing and products. 6.1.6 DOD assesses chemical risks on human and environmental health DOD's Chemical and Material Risk Management Progra m is designed to manage risks associated with hazardous chemicals and materials in order to minimize adverse impacts on human and environmental health and DOD mission areas , as well as to reduce life cycle costs of weapons systems, platforms, equipment, an d facilities . The program identifies and assesses the risks of emerging contaminants \u2014chemicals that lack human health standards or have an evolving science and regulatory status. The program has scanned over 500 emerging contaminants to identify their impo rtance to DOD, conducted approximately 50 impact assessments of emerging contaminants that pose risks to DOD, and developed 60 risk management actions for high -risk emerging contaminants. For example, the program issued an alert for decision makers on the potential risks to humans and the environment of the chemicals used in a fire suppressant for liquid fires, how to identify whether the chemicals were present, when the firefighting foams could be used, and how Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 90 to dispose of them properly.159 According to DOD, the budget authority for the p rogram in fiscal year 2016 was $818,000. 6.2 Federal agencies support the development and commercialization of more sustainable chemistry technologies Multiple federal agency programs and offices support the development of new more sustainable chemistry processes and facilitate the commercialization of these processes. These programs provide support in a variety of ways including conducting and funding basic and applied research to develop more sustainable processes and products ; providing loan guarantees, grants, and technical assistance to researchers and companies ; and recognizing innovative technologies through an award program. The following are selected examples of federal programs and o ffices that support the development a nd commercialization of more sustainable chemistry technologies (see table 10 ). 6.2.1 NSF grant programs support research to develop more sustainable chemistry processes NSF funds academic research on sustainable chemistry technologies through targeted grant funding from the Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials (SusChEM) initiative as well as through its core research grant programs. In response to a 2011 law passed by Congress, NSF established the SusChEM program to support research into 159Chem ical & Material Emerging Risk Alert: Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF). Risk Alert #03 -11. Department of Defense, Chemical and Risk Management Directorate. sustainab le chemistry which would lead to clean, safe, and economical alternatives to traditional chemical products and practices.160 NSF awarded SusChEM grants for research throughout the life cycle of chemicals, but focused on awarding grants for research on improv ing the processing and use of raw materials. For example, Stanford University and IBM received a SusChEM grant to develop catalytic methods to produce biodegradable polymers that could be used to manufacture a range of plastic products , including medical stents and compostable plastic ware. Another SusChEM grant funded research at Arizona State University on the use of iron oxysulfide to replace the toxic materials currently used to manufacture solar cells. When determining what research it would fund, NSF officials considered the chemical breakthroughs and research priorities identified by participants in workshops they sponsored. Workshop participants included academic researchers, federal agency officials, representatives from the American Chemical Societ y, and chemical manufacturers and users . SusChEM awarded 349 grants totaling about $134 million between 2013 and 2017. While the SusChEM program ended in fiscal year 2017 as planned, according to officials, NSF will continue to fund grants related to sustainable chemistry through its core research grant programs in the conventional scientific disciples. 161 The 160America Competes Reauthorization Act of 2010, PL 111 -358, Section 509. 161SusChEM is part of the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability programs. When this program was initiated, it was envisioned as a limited -life focus, as is typical for NSF topical initiatives. SusChEM ended in fiscal year 2017 along with the Science, Engineering an d Education for Sustainability program. According to NSF officials, the Divisions of Chemistry; Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems; Materials Research; Earth Sciences; and Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation have pledged to continue to support sustainable chemistry technologies. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 91 results of NSF funded research are published in peer reviewed journals and freely available on the NSF website. NSF also funds nine Centers for Chemical Innovation, research centers that include scientists from across academic institutions to focus on major chemical research challenges. According to NSF officials, five of the Centers focus on challenges related to sustainable chemistry technologies, incl uding, for example, the Center for Enabling New Technologies through Catalysis and the Center for Sustainable Polymers. NSF funds Centers in two phases of research: Phase I Centers receive a total of $1.75 million over three years for the formation and development of a research center and Phase II grants provide follow -on, renewable funding of $4 million a year for five years to Centers. For example, the Center for Sustainable Polymers focuses on identifying and developing biobased, nontoxic, renewable, and functional polymer -based plastics, as opposed to traditional petroleum - based plastics. The Centers are collaborative, bringing together the expertise and perspectives of a variety of stakeholders, including scientists from different universities and indus try. The Center for Selective C -H Functionalization \u2014which explores methods for making organic molecules in a more streamlined, cost -effective, and environmentally benign way \u2014includes collaborators from 14 universities, a research institution, international collaborators, and industry. The Centers also organize educational outreach programs for elementary, middle, and high schools, colleges and universities, and the community to increase understanding about chemicals. The NSF and EPA Networks for Sustainable Molecular Design and Synthe sis grant program funded research on the development of safe and sustainable chemicals, awarding approximately $19 million over four years to fou r research groups. Each research group that received one of these awards was required to develop an innovation plan describing how the team would collaborate with industry or support technology transfer. For example, a University of Arizona research team w orked with a startup company to commercialize a technology to develop a more sustainable surfactant . (For a list of all the selected grants described in this report, see table 12.) 6.2.2 USDA supports more sustainable biorefining technologies and biobased chemic als USDA supports the development and commerci alization of more sustainable chemistry technologies that convert renewable feedstocks into biobased products, including biobased chemicals. Biobased chemicals are chemicals that are manuf actured using renewable resources such as municipal solid waste, algae, and the byproducts of other processes \u2014such as corn oil produced in the process of producing corn ethanol. While the goals of USDA's support of biorefining are to increase the profitability and market for agricultural feedstocks and biobased products and to support the existing biorefining industry, there is also a sustainability benefit to replacing petroleum - based chemicals with those manufactured using renewable resources. The following are examples of USDA programs that support the development of more sustainable biorefining technologies and the manufacture of biobased chemicals.

Source: GAO analysis of agency documentation. | GAO -18-307 Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 93 The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) National Program on Biorefining conducts research on feedstocks and commercially - viable technologies to convert agricultural material into biochemicals and other byproducts. For example, in 2015, researchers identified an enzyme that converts citrus peel waste into an acid that can be u sed for the development of fine chemicals, such as adipic acid. Adipic acid is used in making nylon, which is manufactured using benzene, a carcinogenic chemical manufactured from nonrenewable fossil fuels. Furthermore, the National Program on Biorefining 2014- 2019 5 - Year Action Plan lists research on the use of biochemical conversion processes to create biobased chemicals, including alcohols, carboxylic acids, and biopolymers, as a way to maintain the economic viability of biorefineries in the face of the relatively low value of fuel products. The National Program on Biorefining researchers coordinate with other USDA programs working on related research as well as with industry to ensure the research will benefit industry and maximize economic impacts. Acco rding to ARS officials, the National Program on Biorefining budget in fiscal year 2016 was approximately $15 million. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) program awards grants for more sustainable chemistry technologies. For example, NIFA awards funding for research into the development of renewable feedstocks and biobased products and related analytical tools through the Biomass Research and Development Initiative, a partnership between NIFA, USDA's Institute of Bioenergy, Climate, and En vironment, and DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Golden Field Office, Bioenergy Technologies Office. In 2012, for instance, the Biomass Research and Development Initiative awarded a tire company approximately $6.9 million over five years to rese arch biorefining technologies to convert a desert shrub into biobased polymers that could be used to replace petroleum -based polymers in rubber tires. The research team, which included academic and federal partners, successfully produced and tested concept tires that will be commercialized within the next two years, according to ARS officials. Through the Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical and Biobased Product Manufacturing Assistance Program, USDA supports the commercialization of biorefining technologies and production of biobased products by providing loan guarantees for developing, constructing, or retrofitting commercial- scale biorefineries that can convert biomass to biofuels, biobased chemicals, and other products. Eligible projects may receive loan guarantees through the program for up to $250 million, not to exceed 80 percent of the total project costs. According to USDA officials, as of October 2017, USDA has committed to conditional loan guarantees for nine projects. The budget authority for the program in fiscal year 2016 was $50 million, according to officials. 6.2.3 DOE programs seek to reduce energy use in chemical processing DOE supports programs that seek to reduce the energy used in manufacturing, including by chemical processes and technologies. DOE funds research through cooperative agreements to reduce energy intensity in manufacturing and also supports technology transfer and the commercialization of the technologies developed through its research and grant programs. The followin g are Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 94 examples of DOE programs that support the reduction of energy use in chemistry technologies. DOE's Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) supports the development of materials and technologies that reduce the energy intensity of manufacturing processes throughout the life cycle of a product, including through sustainable chemistry technologies. For example, in order to support the development of less energy intensive manufacturing processes, AMO awards funding to scientists, consortia, national laboratories, companies, and state and local governments, and also provides technical assistance to industry. AMO funded a team of researchers at Purdue University in partnership with several chemical companies to develop an algorithm to increase energy efficiency in chemical distillation processes , for instance . With proof -of-principle financial assistance from AMO, a company commercialized a method for recycling nylon carpeting that recovers the chemical building blocks of nylon carpeting for reuse while consuming less total energy compared with convention al production. According to DOE officials, AMO identifies challenges to using sustainable chemistry technologies by conducting its own analysis and gathering information from stakeholders including companies, univ ersities, and trade associations, and by holding workshops with stakeholders. DOE also supports reductions in energy consumption in chemical processes by sponsoring the Rapid Advancement in Process Intensification Deployment (RAPID) institute , one of 14 Manufacturing USA Institutes that seek to bring together industry, academia, and federal partners to create a national manufacturing research and development infrastructure. 162 The mission of the RAPID institute is to research, develop, and demonstrate new ch emical processes that will increase energy efficiency in a variety of chemical processes , including mixing, reaction, and separation. Launched in March 2017, the RAPID Institute is led by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and its members include 22 academic institutions, 5 government and national laboratories, 18 companies, and 4 NGOs. In addition, more than 130 i nstitute partners committed to cost-shares of $70 million to match DOE's contribution of $70 million over five years. Using cutting- edge scientific facilities and equipment, DOE scientists, engineers, and others employed at DOE's 17 national laboratories carry out research and development on a range of topics, including research on sustainable chemistry technologies. In addition, the nat ional labs support technology transfer and commercialization of processes and technology developed in the labs. According to officials at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), technology transfer of lab-developed processes can be moved into commercial production through a range of activities including: direct interactions between scientists or engineers at a lab and a company, co -development of intellectual property, laboratory support during scale up, assis tance with initial operations, and 162The Manufacturing USA initiative, also known as the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, was authorized by Congress in December 2014 with the passing of the Revitalize American Manuf acturing and Innovation Act. The Manufacturing USA network of institutes is operated by the interagency Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office, headquartered at NIST. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 95 licensing agreements. Examples of programs at National Labs that support the development and use of more sustainable chemistry technologies include the following. At NREL, scientists are researching materials and process es to efficiently convert biomass to high value, biobased chemicals. In addition, NREL develops analytical tools, methodologies, and studies to increase understanding of the potential impact and challenges of the emerging bioeconomy. Researchers at PNNL ar e developing new processes for the conversion of biomass into biobased chemicals. For example, PNNL developed an innovative catalytic process that converts plant -based feedstocks into propylene glycol, a chemical additive in liquid detergents, pharmaceutic als, and plastics typically made from petroleum. The research was supported by PNNL and cost -sharing agreements between DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the National Corn Growers Association, and other companies. One of the companies licensed the technology from PNNL and began operating a full -scale production facility producing the chemical from soybeans and canola in 2011. Argonne has a number of research initiatives that contribute to the development of more sustainable chemistry technologies. For example, Argonne is researching more sustainable catalysts for converting renewable feedstocks to biofuels and biochemicals. The lab also conducts life cycle analysis of bioproducts. Argonne conducted a life cycle analysis to identify a s ustainable process for converting non -recycled plastic into fuel, which can provide a viable waste management option for petroleum -based plastics. To facilitate the development and commercialization of innovative technologies, DOE provides funding for rese arch and to allow academic researchers and small businesses to take advantage of the state- of- the-art facilities and scientific expertise at national labs. Some of this funding support s the development and commercialization of sustainable chemistry technologies. For example, through cooperative agreements, the Bioenergy Technologies Office provided $13.1 million to four research projects through the Bioproducts to Enable Biofuels Funding Opportunity to support the development of biomass conversion processes that can produce coproducts such as biobased chemicals along with biofuels. The Advanced Manufacturing Office's Cyclotron Road program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory helps entrepreneurs bridge the gap between early stage technology concepts and commercialization. Through the program, DOE awards two -year fellowships to scientists who are developing innovative energy technologies, and provid es funding, lab space, access to scientists at the national lab, and business mentoring. For example, the founders of a company received funding from Cyclotron Road to develop a method to recycle waste carbon dioxide back into fuels and chemicals using only water and electricity as inputs. In 2015, DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy launched the Small Business Vouchers Pilot to help small businesses overcome technology and commercialization challenges in bringing new clean technologies to market. Through the program, DOE provides businesses with Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 96 vouchers that can be used to request technical as sistance from national labs for activities such as prototyping, scaling, regulatory compliance, or modeling and simulations. For example, in 2016 , another company received $300,000 to use facilities at NREL and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to scale up a new technology to produce biobased malonic acid, a chemical used to produce electronics, medicine, and fragrance, th rough a sugar and water fermentation process rather than the current process which uses toxic chemicals. T he Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy announced that 38 small businesses would participate in the voucher program in fiscal year 2017. 6.2.4 Federal small business programs encourage the development and commercialization of sustainable chemistry t echnologies Federal agencies also support the development and commercialization of more sustainable chemi stry technologies through the congressionally -mandated SBIR and STTR programs. The SBIR program was initiated in 1982 and has four purposes: (1) to use small businesses to meet federal R&D needs, (2) to stimulate technological innovation, (3) to increase commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&D efforts, and (4) to encourage participation in technological innovation by small businesses ow ned by disadvantaged individuals and women. The purpose of the STTR program \u2014initiated in 1992\u2014 is to stimulate a partnership of ideas and technologies between innovative small businesses and research institutions through federally funded R&D . Together, the agencies that participate in SBIR and STTR have awarded more than $40 billion through the two programs since their inception. 163 Some of the funding has been awarded to support the development of more sustainable chemistry technologies. Examples of two resea rch efforts are included below. A company received SBIR funding from DOE and NSF to develop a catalytic process to convert lignin found in waste from paper pulping facilities and biorefineries into high value biobased chemicals. A company that has develop ed a process to capture methane and convert it into various biobased products using bacteria has received two SBIR grants through NSF to support the production of biobased, biodegradable polymers from methane gas at a wastewater treatment plant. The compan y also received two STTR grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) to modify their technology to produce biobased polymers in space, where they could be produced on-demand. 6.2.5 NIST develops methodologies and standards for evaluating the sustainability of chemical technologies NIST develops methodologies and standards for measuring and evaluating the sustainability of materials and manufacturing processes, including chemicals and chemistry technologies. In order to improve sustainability, industry need s to accurately measure and evaluate the consumption of 163SBIR participants include USDA, DOD, DOE, EPA, NSF, HHS, NASA and the Departments of Commerce, Education, Homeland Security, and Transportation. STTR participants include the DOD, DOE, HHS, NASA, and NSF. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 97 energy and materials, emissions, waste, and water usage, as well as environmental impacts, at each step in the life cycle (see chapter 2). NIST does not quantify the sustai nability of technologies, but provides methodologies, standards, metrics, and validated data to decision makers to assess the sustainability of their choices on a case - by-case basis. NIST works with industry stakeholders to prioritize research goals and identify areas lacking standards. According to NIST officials, the Institute has engaged largely with traditional manufacturers, but is beginning to engage more with chemical manufacturers. For example, NIST's Sustainable Manufacturing project develops metho ds for characterizing the environmental aspects of manufacturing processes at the unit, factory, and network levels, which enables the evaluation of the sustainability of these processes. Additionally, according to NIST officials, NIST collaborates with st andard setting organizations such as ASTM International to provide industry and federal agencies with protocols and methods for measuring the sustainability of manufacturing processes including inputs, outputs, and waste. NIST led the development of ASTM E3012- 16, the Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes, which enables manufacturers to virtually characterize their production processes as computer models, and then, using a standardized method, 'plug and play' the environmental data for each process step to visualize impacts and identify areas for improving overall sustainability of the system. The Materials Science and Engineering Division, in partnership with industry, other government agencies, and academia, develops the measurement science, technology, and research required to support the design, manufacture, and use of materials, including chemicals. One program, the Sustainable Composites project, is developing tools to measure the characteristics of sustainable polymer composites in order to enable manufacturers to develop high performance bio -based composites. According to NIST officials, other Division researchers are exploring using biomass to produce nanocellulose materials, a sustainable alternative to p etroleum -based chemicals. Division officials also said they are coordinating with companies to develop methods for reducing the amount of solvents companies use and working to develop new solvents that are less toxic. The budget authority for the Materials Science and Engineering Division was approximately $25 million in fiscal year 2016, according to NIST officials. In addition, NIST maintains a number of tools that facilitate the selection and use of more sustainable chemicals and processes. For example, NIST maintains a database of information on the thermochemical properties of organic materials that can be used to calculate the energy content for various fuels and the energy used in chemical processes that industry decision makers can use to design more sustainable chemical and manufacturing processes and a database on chemical reactions th at occur under gaseous conditions. NIST has also developed calculations that estimate the global warming potential of molecules, which allows for the screening and ide ntification of candidate chemicals to replace hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants that cause climate change. To help industry measure their sustainability Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 98 performance, NIST's Sustainable Manufacturing Indicator Repository provides access to centralized informat ion on a range of sustainable indictors from sources such as Dow Jones, the United Nations, and Walmart. 6.2.6 EPA recognizes companies with innovative sustainable chemistry technologies Since 1996, the EPA in partnership with the American Chemical Society Green Chemistry Institute has awarded the annual Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards to academics and companies for the development of innovative, sustainable chemistry technologies. The awards are presented for new technologies that incorporate the p rinciples of green chemistry into chemical design, manufacture, and use, including technologies that reduce toxicity, improve use of natural resources, or reduce the production of waste, among others.164 Awards are presented in six categories: Greener Synthe tic Pathway, Greener Reaction Conditions, Design of Greener Chemicals, Small Business, Academia, and for Specific Environmental Benefit: Climate Change, for a technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in 2016, Newlight Technologies won the award in the Climate Change category for developing and commercializing a biocatalyst technology that combines captured methane, a potent greenhouse gas, with air to create a material that matches the performance of petroleum - based plastics at a lower cost. Several companies are now using this material to make a range of products including packaging, cellphone cases, and furniture. In 2017, the 164See appendix V for the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry. companies Amgen, Inc. and Bachem won the Greener Reaction Conditions Award for their process for manufacturin g the active ingredient in the drug ParsabivTM, which uses 71 percent less chemical solvent. 6.2.7 DOD funds research to develop products using more sustainable chemistry that also meet performance needs DOD's Strategic Environmental Research and Development Pr ogram (SERDP) funds basic and applied research on contaminants of concern to DOD and DOD's Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) funds validation and demonstrations of new, more sustainable chemistry technologies and products, amo ng other activities. SERDP is jointly managed by DOD, EPA, and DOE and research funding priorities for both programs are identified by these agencies, experts, and by DOD's Emerging Contaminants program . SERDP and ESTCP fund federal organization and award contracts to universities and private industry. For example, according to DOD officials, after Camp Edwards was shut down in part because hazardous chemicals from flares were leaching into the community water supply, SERDP funded research to develop new fl ares without the chemicals of concern. According to officials, DOD has invested in research on new paint technologies that eliminate carcinogenic hexavalent chromium in paint primers and in research into methods for reducing or eliminating solvents. ESTCP funded research at the Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center to validate the performance of nontoxic, biodegradable biobased cleaner, lubricant, and preservative products as potential alternatives to petroleum -based Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 99 products or other p roducts containing chemicals that may cause eye, skin, and respiratory irritation. SERDP and ESTCP make the results of funded research, development and demonstration, and validation efforts available to the public through its websites when possible. Accord ing to DOD officials, SERDP's budget authority for fiscal year 2016 was $54.3 million and ESTCP's budget authority for the same time period was $51.4 million. 6.3 Federal programs aid market growth for products made with sustainable chemicals and processes Federal programs aid the growth of markets for products developed using more sustainable chemistry by informing consumers about these products and by facilitating their purchase by federal offices. For example, federal programs conduct evaluations of the chem ical content of products, manage product certification and labeling programs, provide information to consumers and federal purchasers on the chemical content of products, and develop purchasing and sustainability plans to support agency purchase and use of more sustainable products. In addition, federal programs facilitate compliance with Executive Order 13693 and the Federal Acquisitions Regulation federal regulations that require agencies to purchase certain more sustainable products when practicable. The following are selected examples of federal programs and offices that facilitate the growth of markets for more su stainable products (see table 11 ).

More than 2,350 products from nearly 500 formulators and manufacturers currently qualify for the Safer Choice labe l, including products such as odor removers, hand soap, and pet care products (see fig. 20) . In order to carry the Safer Choice label, a third -party reviewer must certify that the chemical ingredients in the product comply with Safer Choice criteria on cat egory specific attributes such as carcinogenicity, human and environmental toxicity, skin sensitization, and recyclability of packaging. Safer Choice evaluates each chemical ingredient by functional class (e.g., colorants, solvents, or preservatives), comp aring the profiles of chemicals to identify those that pose the least health and environmental concerns among chemicals that serve a similar function. Safer Choice also evaluates product performance to ensure it is comparable to that of a similar conventio nal product. Safer Choice assessments focus on the health and environmental impacts of consumer and institutional use and disposal of chemical- based cleaning and related products and do not assess chemical manufacturing processes or technologies. In additi on to meeting all the Safer Choice criteria, manufacturers seeking certification must disclose all product ingredients on the product label or on the manufactures website and undertake continuous product improvement. Safer Choice has also developed the onl ine Safer Chemical Ingredients List for manufacturers, which includes more than 800 chemicals that meet Safer Choice criteria. Safer Choice certified products are listed in the publically available Safer Choice database, facilitating their purchase by both consumers and federal agencies. Federal agencies are required by Executive Order 13693 to purchase Safer Choice products when practicable. Figure 20: The Environmental Protection Agency's Safer Choice certification label Safer Choice works closely with manufacture rs and other stakeholders in developing program goals, logistics for certificate application, meeting standards and criteria, outreach, and selecting new product types to be included in the program. For Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 101 example, Safer Choice holds an annual summ it to gather feedback from manufacturers, NGOs, and other stakeholders to improve the program and advises companies on identifying safer ingredients. Safer Choice conducts public outreach and awareness campaigns for the Safer Choice program, such as promot ing the label in social media, through targeted factsheets, and through seasonal promotions. Through its \"Safer Choice Partner of the Year Awards,\" Safer Choice recognizes manufacturers for advancing the goal of chemical safety through participation in or promotion of Safer Choice. For example, in 2017, a supermarket chain was recognized for its use of social media to promote the Safer Choice program. USDA's BioPreferred program supports federal purchasing requirements and administers a voluntary labeling program to increase the purchase and use of biobased products in order to increase the use of renewable agricultural resources, minimize the use of petroleum, and reduce health and environmental impacts, according to USDA . The Farm Security and Rural Inves tment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Bill) as amended in 2008 and 2014 establishe s federal purchasing requirements for biobased products . The act defines a biobased product as a product that is DOE determines is composed in whole or part of biological products or renewable agricultural materials, including plant, animal, and marine materials, or forestry materials. 165 The BioPreferred program maintains a catalog through which consumers and federal purchasers can identify approximately 15,000 1657 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101(4). The term also includes intermediate ingredients and feedstocks. Id. biobased products in 97 categories ranging from asphalt removers to deodorants. Product categories are added based on market research that identifies a government need as well as suggestions from stakeholders, such as industry associations or the public. To be included in the cat alog, manufacturers must self- certify that a product contains the minimum required biobased content for a given product category as determined by the BioPreferred program. For example, general purpose carpet cleaners must have a minimum biobased content of 54 percent to qualify and candles must have a minimum of 88 percent. To facilitate the purchase of products listed in the catalog by federal agencies, officials also provide acquisition tools and training resources for federal agencies. The Bio Preferred program also manages a voluntary certification and labeling initiative that helps consumers identify and purchase products with a verified minimum of biobased content. Manufacturers can use USDA's \"Certified Biobased Product\" label on their product after a third -party organization verifies the amount of biobased content (see fig. 21) . BioPreferred has certified approximately 3,000 products, including stain removers, fertilizers, and notebooks. Certified products are also included in the BioPreferred Catalog and labeled as such. According to USDA officials, the fiscal year 2016 authorized budget for the Biopreferred program was $3 million. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 102 Figure 21: The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) BioPreferred label Note: The above figure shows a sample of the BioPreferred label, showing the percent of biobased content in a hypothetical product and packaging. NIST's Applied Economics Office conducts life cycle analyses of building products to help decision makers, such as architects, builders, and product manufacturers, select more sustainable building materials through the online Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) tool. The BEES database includes life -cycle environmental and economic performance data for 2 56 building mate rials and products including wall insulation, floor coverings, interior wall finishes, and parking lot paving, based on data provided by product manufacturers. The data are made available through the interactive BEES tool that allows users to evaluate both the cost and the environmental impacts of a material throughout its life cycle, including use of raw materials, transportation to site, and disposal. For example, a decision maker could use the BEES tool to compare the economic s and environmental impacts of different types of flooring, such as wool or nylon carpet tiles, including their lifetime toxicity, ozone depletion, and use of fossil fuels. NIST conducts outreach to industry associations to increase industry participation in submitting data and for growing the user base for BEES, according to this official. In addition, according to officials, the Office is working with green building certification, standards, and codes development organizations, such as the U.S. Green Build ing Council, to align development of BEES with future stakeholder needs. 6.3.2 Agency plans encourage the purchase of products with more sustainable chemicals To encourage the purchase of more sustainable products, including those manufactured with more sustainable chemicals and processes, federal agencies have developed sustainable purchasing and sustainability plans and developed tools to facilitate green purchasing. Executive Order 13693, \"Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,\" issued in 20 15, directs agencies to develop plans to advance waste prevention and pollution prevention by, among other things, reducing or minimizing the quantity of toxic and hazardous chemicals and materials acquired, used, and disposed. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's 2016 Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan states that the agency will implement integrated pest management and improved landscape management practices to reduce and eliminate the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals and materials . Additionally , the Department of Commerce Green Procurement Program states that the agency will provide preference to the purchase of nontoxic or less toxic product alternatives, including cleaning products that are nontoxic, non-volatile, an d biodegradable. EPA enables federal purchasers and the public to identify more sustainable products by maintaining an online Sustainable Marketplace that Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 103 recommends greener products and services, standards, and ecolabels. The General Services Administrati on also provides a compilation of federal green purchasing resources. DOD has several programs that encourage and facilitate the purchase of more sustainable chemicals products. DOD encourages acquisitions managers to purchase cost effective products that conform to federal sustainable procurement requirements by developing and testing products that contain more sustainable chemicals, setting purchasing policies and recommendations for these products, and providing DOD decision makers with data and demonstr ations to inform purchasing decisions. DOD's Chemical and Material Risk Management Program develops policies, procedures, and guidance to integrate life cycle environment, safety, and health considerations into DOD 's acquisition processes of products conta ining chemicals. For example, the program developed a policy to minimize the use of hexavalent chromium DOD -wide and developed an acquisitions rule that sought to minimize the chemical in new acquisitions. According to DOD officials, this requirement pro vided an incentive for the industry to create products without the harmful chemical. The program has also developed a life cycle analysis process that allows decision makers to accurately compare the life cycle impacts and costs of conventional and more su stainable alternatives. In addition, DOD's Sustainable Products Center compiles information on sustainable products, evaluates the military's need for more sustainable products, hosts sustainable product demonstrations, and highlights success stories and l essons learned . DOD's Sustainable Procurement Program encourages DOD programs to procure more sustainable products and conducts life cycle assessment to evaluate how improvements in sustainability may result in cost savings.

For example, the chemical industry conducts and supports research into more sustainable chemistry technologies, collaborates with other stakeholders to support sustainability initiatives, and other activities. Large purchasers such as companies and ret ailers create demand for more sustainable products from their suppliers by setting sustainability criteria for purchases. Academic institutions conduct research on the impacts of chemicals and sustainable chemistry technologies and train the next generatio n of chemists and engineers. States seek to protect public health by regulating chemicals in products. NGOs also play a diverse range of roles such as supporting workforce development, facilitating collaboration between other stakeholders, and developing t ools and resources for industry. 6.4.1 The chemical manufacturing industry collaborates with stakeholders to address common challenges and goals in using more sustainable chemistry Interested companies in the chemical manufacturing industry collaborate with each other and other stakeholders to advance sustainable chemistry practices. These companies support the development and use of more sustainable chemistry through a variety of activities, including conducting and funding research, setting standards, and supporting sustainable chemistry education. For example, industry collaborates through the American Chemistry Society's Green Chemistry Institute to encourage the integration of g reen chemistry and engineering throughout research, education , and industry. For example, the Green Chemistry Institute's Pharmaceutical Roundtable brings together pharmaceutical manufacturers to implement green chemistry in the industry through activities such as developing solvent and reagent selection guides for decision makers and awarding grants to support academic research. Industry also collaborates with other stakeholders through the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council, a project of the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production at the University of Massachuse tts, Lowell that seeks to integrate green chemistry across business sectors and the supply chain. Members include manufacturers, retailers, education institutions, and state and federal government agencies. Green Chemistry and Commerce Council activities include convening working groups, supporting education and training in sustainable chemistry, and developing tools for collaboration and information sharing. In an example of a public -private partnership, NIKE , Inc. joined with NASA, the United States Agenc y for International Development, and the State Department to create the LAUNCH program, which funds innovative approaches to sustainability challenges, including a 2016 Chemistry Innovation Challenge and a 2014 Green Chemistry Challenge. Among the 18 chemi cal companies that responded to our survey, 10 indicated that, with respect to the development and use of Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 106 sustainable chemistry technologies, they interacted a moderate or large amount with academics and 12 indicated that they interacted with scientific an d professional organizations a moderate or large amount. Less than half of responding companies said they interacted a moderate or large amount with environmental advocacy groups. In terms of interactions with federal agencies related to sustainable chemis try technologies, half of the responding companies had performed collaborative research and development with a federal agency and 6 out of 18 had received federal funding for research and development. Of the responding companies, half had a large to modera te amount of interaction s with EPA related to sustainable chemistry technologies, the most interaction s of any of the federal agencies included in the survey. Of the companies surveyed that interacted with EPA with respect to the development and use of sustainable chemistry technologies, 9 found the interactions very or moderately valuable. For more infor mation on the survey, see appendix IV . 6.4.2 Companies develop policies to encourage suppliers and others to develop products using more sustainable chemistry Corporations that set policies on purchasing products manufactured with more sustainable chemistry may increase the incentive for the development and use of more sustainable chemistry technologies by chemical manufacturers and formulators. Selected companies, such as Target and Kaiser Permanente , are developing policies and tools to ensure the products they p urchase meet certain criteria with regard to chemical ingredients and other life cycle factors , and are working with purchasers and suppliers to encourage the development of these products. Target Corporation : Target, a retailer with more than 1,800 store s and sales of nearly $70 billion in 2016, has launched two major initiatives that seek to encourage and incentivize its vendors to supply products that use more sustainable chemistry technologies . According to a Target official, these efforts are driven b y consumer concern about the safety of chemicals in the products they buy , as well as to prevent regulatory fines by strengthening internal regulatory processes. In 2013, Target introduced a Sustainable Products Index, an internal tool that collects inform ation from suppliers and assesses products based on sustainability criteria such as the presence of certain chemical ingredients, transparency about those ingredients, packaging, certifications, and sourcing information. The Index applies to the personal c are, beauty, household cleaning, and baby care product categories. In 2017, Target introduced a new chemical policy and goals governing chemicals in products it sells in stores and uses operationally , as well as timelines for meeting these goals. Through the policy, Target commits to work toward full transparency of chemicals contained and used to make the products it sells, to collaborate with its business partners to managing chemicals through the supply chain, and to support initiatives seeking to identi fy, develop, and commercialize safer chemicals and processes. In addition, Target plans to contribute $5 million by 2022 to support research to identify methods for effectively communicating about green chemistry, to develop an infrastructure for information sharing about product ingredients, and to create industry -wide hazard profiles for Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 107 chemicals, as well as to invest in companies developing products with less hazardous chemicals through a green chemistry venture capital fund. Target also collaborates with other stakeholders. For example, it is a member of the Retailer Leadership Council, consisting of leaders from seven retailers and five chemical manufactures convened by GC3 that are working together to promote safer chemicals, materials, and products a cross retail supply chains by committing to dialog around goal setting and continuous improvement, communication about green chemistry throughout the supply chain, sharing information on chemical hazards and risks, providing information across the value chain with consumers, and supporting green chemistry education. 166 Kaiser Permanente: Kaiser Permanente, which spends approximately $5.8 billion per year on medical products and equipment , has developed goals, policies, and tools to support the purchase of pro ducts manufactured using more sustainable chemistry. According to Kaiser Permanente officials, the organization's goal is to increase the percentage of products it purchases meeting its environmental standards to 50 percent by 2025. In 2006, Kaiser Permane nte created Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Principles requiring that certain criteria on chemical content and waste be considered in all major purchasing decisions. In 2017, Kaiser Permanente extended and strengthened the Principles by introducing a n Environmentally Preferable Purchasing 166The Retail Leadership Council membership includes officials from retailers Wal- mart; Staples; Target; Home Depot; Best Buy; Lowe's Companies, Inc .; and CVS Health; and chemical manufacturers BASF Corporation, Chemours, Dow Chemical, Akzo Nobel, and Eastman. Standard that mandates specific environmental criteria in the area of chemicals and waste to be met in purchasing decisions. For example, products must not contain toxic chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA), or flame retardants. According to Kaiser Permanente representatives, if multiple suppliers can provide a product that equally meets the organization's clinical, regulatory, and sourcing requirements, Kaiser Permanente can choose one over another based on sustainability factors. However, if Kaiser Permanente is procuring a product that does not meet the Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Standard then the organization informs the supply base that it is actively seeking alterative suppliers or negotiates contract terms th at include sustainability requirements. In addition, when Kaiser Permanente has a particular sourcing requirement, they may have the purchasing power to ensure a new product is developed that meets its criteria. When the company decided it would no longer purchase exam and surgical gloves made from polyvinyl chloride, which produce toxic dioxin as a byproduct during the manufacturing process and disposal, the decision impacted the entire medical glove industry, according to organization representatives, bec ause Kaiser Permanente purchases more than 50 million gloves each year. Kaiser Permanente relies on other organizations such as EPA , Healthcare Without Harm, and other NGOs for information on hazardous chemicals . Kaiser Permanente's Division of Research al so conducts studies on the impacts of chemicals on human health, including the effect of workplace exposure to bisphenol A ( BPA). Kaiser Permanente collaborates with other stakeholders such as NGOs on a number of initiatives. For example, t he organization' s Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 108 Standard was developed with expertise from the Center for Environmental Health, Healthcare Without Harm, Clean Production Action, and Practice Greenhealth, among others , and used benchmarks from other organizations including Green Seal , EcoLogo, Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, and EPA's Design for the Environment program . 6.4.3 Academic institutions train the next generation of chemists Academic institutions and the academics that work in them play a role in supporting the development and use of more sustainable chemistry technologies by training the next generation of chemists, conducting relevant research, and sharing their expertise in collaborations with other stakeholders. One barrier to the devel opment and use of more susta inable chemistry technologies may be the conventional chemistry methods and practices taught in schools , which has led to a chemistry workforce that may not understand the principles of sustainable chemistry, according to officials GAO interviewed. One faculty member GAO interviewed said that one of the challenges to changing curriculums is a lack of incentives for professors along with the significant time and resources required to do so . However, some colleges and universities are beginning to integrate sustainable chemistry programs and classes into their chemistry curriculum. In addition, some academic institutions are collaborating with businesses, state and federal government, and NGOs to support the development and use of s ustainable chemistry technologies. The University of Toledo's School of Green Chemistry and Engineering and University of California's Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry are two examples of academic programs focusing on education and research in sustainab le chemistry. In 2011, the University of Toledo established the School of Green Chemistry and Engineering, which, together with other university departments, offers a range of classes in green chemistry and engineering to interested students (see text box below ). The mission of the university is to promote the sustainable use, production, and recycling of chemical materials through research, education, and outreach. The university awards an undergraduate minor in Green Chemistry and Engineering as well as a Professional Science Master's Degree in Green Chemistry and Engineering that requires students to incorporate aspects of business and other professional skills into their M.S. degree, including courses such as \"Technology Commercialization\" and \"Supply Chain Management.\" Students in the more traditional M.S. and Ph.D programs in chemistry and chemical engineering can take the sustainability -related courses. Selected courses related to sustainable chemistry offered at the University Toledo by the School of Green Chemistry and Engineering and its partner departments Green Chemistry Green Engineering Principles for Chemical Processes Environmental Chemistry Green Engineering Applications in Chemical Industry Chemistry of Sustainable Energy Resources Biofuels Environmental Geochemistry Hazardous Waste Management Environmental Economics Environmental Policy Source: University of Toledo School of Green Chemistry and Engineering.| GAO -18-307 Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 109 The Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley is an interdisciplinary program that integrates teaching and research on chemistry, environmental health, and public and private governance and management with the goal of bringing about a generational change in the design and use of more susta inable chemicals and materials. One of the courses offered by the Center is Greener Solutions, an interdisciplinary, project -based class in which students partner with a company to develop solutions to a particular sustainable chemistry problem. For exampl e, students partnered with a technology firm to address emerging contaminants in e -waste, with an outdoor clothing ma nufacturer on the design of nontoxic mosquito repellency for polyester clothing, and with a workspace furniture company on developing safer colorants for a polypropylene chair. The Greener Solutions program has been supported by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and a Pollution Prevention Grant from EPA Region 9. 6.4.4 States protect public health by establishing requirement th at can encourag e the use of sustainable chemistry in products State officials are enacting regulations to protect the human and environmental health of citizens and ecosystems by requiring the use of more sustainable chemistry in products and manufacturing processes. An NGO official that we interviewed noted that states have the advantage of being able to move faster than the federal government in making regulations, allowing states to play a leadership role in this area. State regulations range from bannin g specific chemicals, to requiring the disclosure of chemical ingredients in certain types of products, to more comprehensive approaches to reducing toxic chemicals in products. State officials work together through organizations such as through the Inters tate Chemicals Clearinghouse to collaborate and share information and grow state government capacity. Massachusetts' Toxic s Use Reduction Act and California's Safer Consumer Products program are examples of state- level regulation that can support the use o f more sustainable chemistry. The state of Massachusetts enacted the Toxics Use Reduction Act in 1989 to reduce the use of toxic chemicals to promote industrial hygiene, worker safety, and protection of the environment and public health . 167 State industry, labor unions, and regulatory bodies came together to negotiate the statewide policy, which is loosely based on the federal Toxic Release Inventory program, according to state officials.168 Under the act, facilities in the state that use defined amounts of a pproximately 1,500 specific toxic chemicals are required to annually report their chemical use and conduct toxic chemical use reduction planning biennially . Facilities that use toxic chemicals must also pay an annual fee based on the number of employees an d toxic chemicals used at the facility . Two state offices and an academic institute work together to implement the act. The 167ALM GL ch. 21I, \u00a7 Release Inventory program , more than 22,000 U.S. facilities report how much of 675 toxic chemicals they released to the environment and/or managed through recycling, energy recovery and treatment. EPA compiles the information submitted by facilities into the Toxics Release Inventory in order to provide the public with information about chemicals that may pose a threat to human and environmental health. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 110 Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection enforces the law's mandates for annual reporting and biennial planning. The Toxics Use Reduction Institute, hosted by the University of Massachusetts Lowell, assists companies in meeting the act's requirements by conducting and funding research on safer chemicals and processes, and providing training and advice to companies. The Office of Technical Assistance provides confidential, free technical assistance to companies wishing to reduce their use of toxic chemicals, comply with regulations, or make their processes more sustainable. Officials said that resources for both the Office of Technical Assistance and the Department of Environmental Protection have been reduced, creating challenges for implementing the program, particularly given the numbers of chemicals entering commerce and pressure from companies that have the incentive and resources to fight new regulations. State officials work with a range of stakeholders to advance the provisions of the act. For example, the Toxics Use Reduction Act Advisory Committee includes members from organized labor, large and small businesses, sta te agencies, and health and environmental advocacy groups. State officials also work with EPA. For example, state officials said they partner with EPA on conducting trainings and have received grants from EPA's Pollution Prevention program. Under California's Safer Consumer Products program, established pursuant to state law, California's Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) identifies and evaluates chemicals of concern and their potential alternatives, to determine how best to limit exposure or to reduce the level of hazard. According to a DTSC official, state officials were frustrated the federal government was not taking action to update TSCA. DTSC, which oversees the Safer Consumer Products program, established a four- step iterat ive process to encourage the use of safer substitutes for chemicals of concern in consumer products. 1. DTSC establishes a list of Candidate Chemicals that have at least one quality that could harm human health or the environment. The initial list of Candidate Chemicals, released in October 2013, contained approximately 1,200 chemicals. 2. DTSC releases a list of Priority Products that DTSC has proposed for regulation that contain one or more of the Candidate Chemicals. A list of three products containing specif ic harmful chemicals was released in March 2014 , which included certain children's foam - padded sleeping products, spray polyurethane foam, and paint strippers. 3. Responsible entities, including manufacturers, importers, assemblers, and retailers, must notify DTSC if they are manufacturing or selling Priority Products in California. The entities generally must perform an Alternative s Analysis for those products to identify how to reduce risks to human and environmental health by, for example, replacing the ch emical or redesigning the product. Specific life cycle impacts must be evaluated as part of an Alternative s Analysis and DTSC provides guidance and training in conducting the analysis. 169 According to officials, DTSC is 169Under California law, the followi ng factors must be considered: (A) product function or performance; (B) useful life; (C) materials and resource consumption; (D) water conservation; (E) water quality impacts; (F) air emissions; (G) production, in- use, and transportation energy inputs; (H) energy efficiency; (I) greenhouse gas emissions; (J) waste and end-of-life disposal; (K) public health impacts, including Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 111 expecting the first Alternative s Analysis from responsible entities in 2018. 4. Following the A lternatives Analysis, DTSC may choose to regulate a Priority Product or an alternative that a responsible entity selected to replace it if needed to protect human health and the environment . DTSC works closely with a range of stakeholder s to implement the Safer Consumer Products legislation and on broader sustainable chemistry issues. For example, DTSC maintains an online database (CalSAFER ) where information and comments related to regulatory action can be uploaded and shared by state offices and other stakeholders. An advisory board with members from academic institutions, industry, federal and state agencies, and others, provides advice t o DTSC on scientific and technical matters. In addition, DTSC has a memorandum of understanding with EPA and Oregon and Washington for collaboration and information sharing to advance sustainable chemistry and, according to a DTSC official, has worked with the European Chemicals Agency and Organization for Economic Co - operation and Development on issues related to safer chemicals. 6.4.5 Non -governmental organizations play a range of roles in supporting the development and use of more sustainable chemistry proces ses and products Through a range of activities and initiatives, often in collaboration with other stakeholders, NGOs encourage and support potential impacts to sensitive subpopulations, including infants and children; (L) environmental impacts; and (M) economic impacts. the development and use of more sustainable chemical processes and products. For instance, NGOs develop tools and res ources to en able industry and consumers to choose more sustainable products and processes, support the integration of sustainable chemistry principles into educational programs, and develop standards and best practices to guide decision makers seeking to be more sustainable. The following organizations are examples of NGOs working though diverse means to support more sustainable chemistry. Beyond Benign, founded in 2007, supports professional development of chemistry teachers and professors and the integrat ion of green chemistry principles and practices into all levels of education. For example, the organization equips elementary, middle, and high school educators to teach green chemistry by conducting in -person and online teacher training for middle and hig h school teachers, and developing teaching and curriculum materials. Working with the State of New York's Department of Environmental Conservation , Beyond Benign conducted a series of 13 trainings for high school teachers across the state , according to Bey ond Benign officials. Beyond Benign also works with industry to incorporate case studies on the companies' green chemistry technologies into curriculum. Through Beyond Benign's Green Chemistry Commitment program over 40 academic institutions have committed to implementing certain green chemistry learning objectives at their schools and collaborate to address common challenges. Clean Production Action acts as an umbrella organization over three programs that support the use of inherently safer chemicals, materials, and products through convening Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 112 collaborators to work on sustainable chemistry and developing and managing tools to support the use of more sustainable chemicals. BizNGO is a working collaborative that brings together stakeholders to identify areas of consensus between business and environmental groups to advance the use of safer chemical alternatives in product areas such as electronics, building products, and health care, according to a Network official. For example, the group created a protocol for ass essing chemical alternatives and case studies that identified less hazardous alternatives for specific chemicals (such as surfactants and flame retardants), according to a Network official. GreenScreen \u00ae is a chemical hazard assessment tool that can be used by industry, government, and NGOs to identify chemical hazards and safer alternatives. GreenScreen Benchmarks allow decision makers to identify and rank increasingly safer chemicals as defined by environ mental persistence, bioaccumulation, human - and eco - toxicity, and other factors. GreenScreen benchmarks can also be used by companies and state and federal agencies. For example, Wal- mart used GreenScreen to identify priority chemicals for substitution in its chemicals policy, eight states recommend GreenScreen as a tool for hazard assessments, and the U.S. Green Building Council offers Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design credits for using GreenScreen. The Chemical Footprint Project allows manufac turers and retailers to benchmark and communicate their progress in chemicals management performance and in reducing potentially hazardous chemicals relative to industry peers. Green Seal awards certifications for products in over 400 product and service c ategories, based on a number of sustainability criteria, including those for chemical ingredients. The criteria identify ineligible chemicals by class (such as carcinogens), sets requirements chemicals must meet (such as biodegradability), limits certain c ompounds (such as volatile organic compounds), and sets requirements for use or disposal. Both state and federal offices have policies recommending the purchase of Green Seal certified products in specific categories; for example, EPA recommends Green Seal certified paints in its revised recommendations for federal purchasing. When developing a new standard for a product, Green Seal gathers information from a range of sources including the EPA's Integrated Risk Inf ormation System ( IRIS) database, NTP, and NIH's Hazardous Substances Data Bank, and solicits information and comments from stakeholders including industry, the public, federal and state government, academic experts, NGOs, and others. In addition, Green Seal provides technical advice and assistance for companies and organizations developing policies and purchasing plans that incorporate sustainability concerns. Green Seal developed a green purchasing manual for the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, for instance, that included specifications for environmentally preferable alternatives for products containing toxic chemicals that are frequently used by state departments of transportation. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 113 GreenBlue seeks to provide tools and resources to industry decision makers to inform choices about the use of safer chemicals and materials in their products. The organization encourages industry to conserve material resources, eliminate toxicity throughout the supply chain, and recover and reuse materials. The following programs are examples of how GreenBlue advances these goals. The Sustainable Package Coalition, whose membership consists of industry (including, for example, brands, packaging designers, retailers, and the recycling community ), academic institutions, and government age ncies, supports collaboration, research, and tool development with the purpose of improving the sustainab ility of packaging. CleanGredients is a database of chemical ingredients that have been pre -approved to meet EPA's Safer Choice certification criteria . The database also includes information on products and manufacturers to help formulators more efficiently obtain Safer Choice certification. The Material IQ program is developing a standardized methodology to facilitate the communication of chemical information between manufacturers without compromising proprietary information. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 114 7 Strategic Implications Sustainable chemistry is an emerging, innovative field within the chemical sciences that has the potential to inspire new products and processes, create jobs, and enhance benefits to human health and the environment. Chemical companies engaged in sustainable chemistry are working to reassess the entire chemical product life cycle from cradle -to-grave, seeking new conceptual frameworks f or producing chemicals. These companies can be highly motivated and cited several drivers for their sustainable chemistry efforts , including consumer demand, reduced business costs, and company culture or mission. The three technology categories we discuss ed in this report \u2014catalysts, solvents, and continuous processing \u2014offer illustrations of the progress and potential for creating more sustainable chemistry technologies. However, as our survey and interviews with industry and other stakeholders found, there are a number of challenges to implementing more sustainable chemistry technologies. The technologies we assessed offer a number of potential environmental and human health benefits. Earth -abundant metals and metal - free catalysts are often readily availabl e, less expensive than current catalysts, and less toxic. In addition, they can provide greater selectivity while reducing solvent use and other waste. Alternatives to current solvent use, such as biobased solvents, water and other less toxic solvents, and solvent -free technologies, can be safer or less toxic than conventional solvents, reduce dependence on non-renewable resources such as petroleum, and limit the need for costly solvent removal and disposal. Continuous processing can offer a number of advan tages over conventional batch processing, including improved safety for workers and the environment, cost savings, and the potential for more controllable and repeatable processes. The small scale of continuous flow microreactors allows further benefits in cluding shorter reaction times, lower energy consumption, and improved efficiency. However, technological challenges remain. Alternative catalysts can be challenging to separate and reuse. In addition, some have a limited scope of reaction that can make th em less widely useful, while others can be required in large quantities in order to provide sufficient reaction speed. Some biobased solvents pose the same inherent toxicity and volatility risks as their conventional counterparts; in addition, they can var y in supply and quality and can be expensive. The use of water and other less toxic solvents may require specialized equipment, greater energy input, or elevated pressure, and can be difficult to scale up for industrial use. Continuous processing can requi re significant capital investment to develop new infrastructure as well as specialized personnel for effective operation, among other challenges. In addition to these technological barriers, companies told us they face many business challenges in their eff orts to implement more sustainable chemistry technologies. These include the need to prioritize product performance; weigh sustainability tradeoffs between various technologies; risk disruptions to the supply chain when switching to a more sustainable opti on; address limited and expensive supplier options; consider regulatory challenges; develop a business case for sustainability investments; and address the often higher initial cost of more sustainable options. If Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 115 these challenges can be overcome, then com panies can see a variety of economic benefits. For example, more sustainable products or technology uses can help firms differentiate from one another; this can create a competitive advantage that consumers recognize and value, and encourage firms to creat e more sustainable products. Similarly, the creation of more sustainable products can have good reputational effects that extend to other products made by that firm, regardless of whether those products are also more sustainable. Furthermore, as our survey and interviews with industry and other stakeholders found, there are several basic, industry -wide challenges to implementing more sustainable chemistry technologies, such as the lack of a standard definition for sustainable chemistry as well as the lack o f agreement on standard ways of measuring or assessing it. Without a standard definition that captures the full range of activities within sustainable chemistry, it is difficult to define the universe of relevant players. Without agreement on how to measur e the sustainability of chemical processes and products, companies may be hesitant to invest in innovation they cannot effectively quantify, and end users are unable to make meaningful comparisons that allow them to select appropriate chemical products and processes. Sector -specific challenges exist as well. For example, industry representatives from the pharmaceutical sector told us that they can incorporate more sustainable technologies early in the drug development process, but changing the manufacturin g process for an already marketed drug triggers the need for revalidation, which can result in delays and additional costs \u2014thus discouraging innovation that could make their chemical processes more sustainable. Experts also noted the challenge of overturni ng proven conventional practices, and acknowledged that existing capital investments in current technologies can create barriers for new companies to enter a field full of well- established players. The varied nature of chemical processes and the diverse r ange of stakeholders in the United States \u2014ranging from private companies and government agencies to academics, states, and non -governmental organizations \u2014also contribute to difficulties making progress within the field of sustainable chemistry. There is no mechanism for coordinating a standardized set of factors for assessing sustainability across these stakeholder groups at present, despite the motivation that specific sectors possess. Moreover, although the federal government has worked with stakeholders through its research support, technical assistance, and certification programs, among other efforts, there are still gaps in understanding. Many stakeholders told us that without such basic information as a standardized approach for assessing the sustainab ility of chemical processes and products, better information on product content throughout the supply chain, and more complete data on the health and environmental impacts of chemicals throughout the life cycle, they cannot make informed decisions that com pare the sustainability of various products. Experts noted that much more work is needed to realize the full promise of sustainable chemistry. For example, they raised a range of concerns and potential solutions, such as: Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 116 Sustainable chemistry creates opportunities to use a different conceptual framework that allows industry to create molecules with new functional performance. There are major innovations demonstrating that it isn't just about being less toxic or less polluting; breakthrough technologies in sustainable chemistry could transform how the industry thinks about performance, function, and synthesis. The establishment of an organized constituency, with the involvement of both industry and government, could help make sustainable chemistry a priority. An industry consortium, working in partnership with a key supporter at the federal level, could lead to an effective national initiative or strategy. A national initiative that considers sustainable chemistry in a system atic manner could be useful. Suc h an effort could encourage collaborations among industry, academia and the government, similar to the National Nanotechnology Initiative. 170 There are opportunities for the federal government to address industry -wide challenges. Federal attention that facilitates development o f standard tools for assessment and a robust definition could help clarify relevant participants in the field and improve information available for decision makers at all levels . 170The National Nanotechnology Initiative is a U.S. government R&D initiative involving 20 departments and independent agencies working on science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers; a nanometer is one billionth of a meter. A research agenda that links research to policy is lacking. In Canada, for example, there is a coordinated technology effort that is focused on basic R&D and scale testing, addressing chemical substitution from the beginning to the end of the life cycle process. A focus on the bigger problems that need to be solved, such as supply chain issues, is an important priority. Federal agencies can play a role in demonstrating, piloting , and de -risking some of these technology development efforts . STEM -related initiatives and intellectual property tools can add va lue. For example, R&D tax credi ts for qualified resea rch expenses could provide subsidies to encourage business investment in research. 171 In addition, patent term restoration, as has been applied to drug products, is designed to encourage innovation, as pro fits resulting from patent protection can serve as incentives for creating innovative products that benefit the public.172 Furthermore, students and adults could be empowered to create, innovate, and turn their ideas into new products, through either volunte erism or public service. 171GAO, Tax Policy: The Research Tax Credit's Design and Administration Can Be Improved, GAO -10-136 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 6, 2009). 172Patents issued by the Patent and Trademark Office grant patent holders the right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention. The granting of this exclusive right is designed to encourage innovation. The patent holder is likely to reap greater profits if protected from direct competition. These profits are intended to serve as incentiv es for creating innovative products that benefit the public. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 117 New training to upgrade the chemistry and manufacturing workforces could encourage innovation. Integrating sustainable chemistry principles into educational programs could bolster a new generation of chemists and advance student ac hievement in the field. According to experts, transitioning toward the use of more sustainable chemistry technologies requires that industry, government, and other stakeholders work together. As they and others noted, there is a need for new processes that make more efficient u se of the resources that are available, reuse products or their components during manufacturing, and account for impacts across the entire life cycle of chemical processes and products. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of disseminating environmen tal and health - related information to help guide the choices of consumers, chemists, workers, downstream users, and investors to facilitate further progress. They also indicated that momentum in this field will require national leadership in order to reali ze the full potential of sustainable chemistry technologies. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 118 8 Agency and expert comments We provided a draft of relevant excerpts from this report to the Department of Commerce (National Institute of Standards and Technology), Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and U.S. Department of Agriculture, with a request for technical comments. We incorporated the comments received into this report as appropriate.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VII. Timothy M. Persons, Ph.D. Chief Scientist John Neumann Director Natural Re sources and Environment Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 119 Appendix I : Objectives, scope, and methodology We describe our scope and methodology for addressing the three objectives outlined below, related to technologies for making chemical processes and products more sustainable. Objectives 1. Identify how stakeholders define sustainable chemistry and approaches that are used to assess the sustainability of chemical processes and products. 2. Assess selected technologies that are available or in development to make chemical processes and products more sustainable. 3. Describe the contributions of the federal government, industry, and others to the development and use of such technologies. Scope and methodology To address our objectives, we reviewed key reports and scientific literature to establish background, identify appropriate technologies and their advantages and disadvantages, identify stakeholders , and inform survey questions. We also convened an expert meeting with the assistance of the Natio nal Academies; interviewed representatives of federal and state agencies , chemical companies, industry and professional organizations, academic institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and other stakeholders; conducted site visits to federal labo ratories; fielded a survey of selected chemical companies; and attended two technical conferences. Limitations to scope We limited the scope of our review to selected technologies in three main categories that are primarily related to the raw materials and chemical processing phase s of the product life cycle: catalysis, solvent use, and alternatives to batch processing. We did not assess all available or developing technologies in these three categories, nor did we assess technologies in other phases of the chemical product life cycle. For example, we did not assess technologies for recycling industrial waste into new feedstocks or for post -consumer recycling of chemical products. Expert meeting Early in our study , we collaborated with the National Academie s to convene a two -day meeting of 24 experts on sustainable chemistry technologies and approaches. Specifically, we collaborated with National Academies staff to select participants from the chemical industry, academia, federal agencies including a national laboratory, professional organizations, and others, with expertise covering most significant areas of our review. 1 A conflict of interest was considered to be any current financial or other interest that might conflict with the service of an individual b ecause it (1) could impair objectivity or (2) could create an unfair competitive advantage for any person or 1After the expert meeting, we changed one of our three target industry sectors from textiles/apparel to formulators (i.e., makers of personal care and cleaning products); thus we did not have a formulator represented at the meeting. However, we interviewed and surveyed several formulator companies during the course of our study. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 120 organization. The 24 experts were determined to be free of conflicts of interest except those that were easily addressed, and the group as a whole was judged to have no inappropriate biases. (See appendix II for a list of these experts and their affiliations.) During this meeting, we solicited input from the experts on the design for our work. Specifically, we moderated discussion sessions on several topics, including examples of technologies to make chemical processes and products more sustainable; applications of such technologies in industry; economic and business aspects of developing and implementing the technologies; approaches to assessing the sustainability of chemical processes and products; the role of standards, regulations, and related programs; and additional stakeholder perspectives. The meeting was recorded and transcribed to ensure that we accurately captured the experts' statements. We also continued to draw on the expertise of these individuals throughout our study and, consistent with our quality assurance framework, we provided them with a draft of our report and solicited their feedback, which we incorporated as appropriate. Site v isits We conducted site visits to federal laboratories to discuss technologies that are in development, including challenges to developing and commercializing such technologies. Specifically, we visited the Toxicology in the 21 st Century (Tox21) Robotics F acility at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, as well as the National Institute of Standards and Technology's ( NIST ) Materials Science and Engineering Division and Facility for Adsorbent Characterization and Testing. Additional inte rviews We conducted a total of 8 2 interviews with representatives from the following groups of stakeholders: Federal and state agencies including the Department of Commerce and NIST, Department of Defense, Department of Energy including three of its nation al laboratories, Department of Health and Human Services including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Science Foundation (NSF), Small Business Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) Safer Consumer Products Program, and two Massachusetts state offices . Chemical companies that we or other interviewees identified as involved in developing and implementing relevant technologies. (See app. III for a list of participating chemical companies.) Industry and professional organizations including the American Chemical Society (ACS) and ACS's Green Chemistry Institute (GCI); the American Chemistry Counc il (ACC); and the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA). Academic institutions including the Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry, the University of Massachusetts - Lowell 's Toxics Use Reduction Institute (TURI) , and the University of Toledo. NGOs including Beyond Benign, the Clean Production Action, the Green Chemistry and Commerce Council (GC3), GreenSeal, GreenBlue, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 121 One institutional purchaser ( Kaiser Permanente ) and one retailer ( Target Corporation ). Identifying interviewees Federal programs and offices We relied on recommendations from federal agency officials to identify specific federal programs and offices that conduct work related to supporting the development and use of sustainable chemistry technologies. We then interviewed officials from those programs , gathered documentary evidence on their activities , and identified which of these programs and offices had activities directly related to sustainable chemistry technologies. Based o n our analysis of the activities performed by those programs and offices, we identified three key roles federal agencies play in supporting sustainable chemistry technologies. For federal agencies, our goal was to identify all relevant federal programs that conduct activities to promote the development and use of sustainable chemistry technologies. We described selected programs and offices to illustrate each of these roles in the report. Other stakeholders Our aim was to identify stakeholders to serve as illustrative, non -generalizable examples of the roles that stakeholders play in supporting the development and use of sustainable chemistry technologies. Where appropriate, we sought diversity among the selected stakeholders with regard to their mission, sector focus, or policy orientation. Our primary method for obtaining specific names of organizations and individuals was to ask interviewees for recommendations of additional stakeholders; we supplemented this approach with other methods such as searching relevant grant databases and other lists. We ended this selection process when we felt that the representation of interviewees within each category was sufficient. Company selection To select companies for our interviews and survey, our purpose was to firs t identify three industry sectors on which to focus: basic chemical manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and formulators (i.e., makers of personal care and cleaning products such as soaps, detergents, toiletries, and cleaning compounds). These sectors were chos en based on expert recommendations of sectors which are active in implementing more sustainable chemistry technologies, as well as the size of these sectors and the proportion of the chemical industry they represent. According to the Bureau of Labor Statis tics within the Department of Labor, as of July 2016 these three sectors were the three largest in the chemical industry in terms of number of employees. Specifically, basic chemical manufacturing (148,500 employees), pharmaceutical and medicine manufactur ing (281,440 employees), and formulators (i.e., soap, cleaning compound, and toilet preparation manufacturing; 104,150 employees) accounted for about 65 percent of the 819,700 employees across the chemical industry. We then used an iterative process to identify companies within these sectors, relying on each of our interviewees to refer us to other companies that could provide perspectives on the development and implementation of technologies within our scope. Specifically, we first interviewed two chemical manufacturers (Dow Chemical and Elevance) and two pharmaceutical companies (Merck and Pfizer) because representatives of these Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 122 companies participated in our expert meeting and thus had already demonstrated an interest in and knowledge of relevant technolo gies. As a second step, we contacted the ACS GCI to ask for a list of companies that belong to the three most relevant GCI industry roundtables: the Chemical Manufacturers Roundtable, the Pharmaceutical Roundtable, and the Formulators Roundtable. We believ e that this was an appropriate approach for identifying companies because these companies, by voluntarily choosing to participate in the ACS GCI industry roundtables, have clearly demonstrated an interest in (and therefore increased likelihood of using) mo re sustainable chemistry technologies. Next, we asked each of our industry interviewees from these first two steps for additional suggestions of companies to interview and interviewed any within our target sectors that agreed to participate. We turned next to companies recommended by the federal agencies we interviewed and selected additional companies to contact, with a focus on small or medium -sized companies within our three target sectors because most of the companies from our first two rounds of interv iews were large. In total we interviewed representatives of 27 companies including 16 chemical manufacturers, 9 pharmaceutical companies, 6 formulators, and 1 company from another industry sector. (See app. III for a list of participating chemical companies.) Some of the 27 companies identified themselves with more than one industry sector. In addition to conducting interviews with these companies, we also sent our survey to these same companies and received responses back from 18 of the companies. Because this is a small and non -generalizable sample of the universe of U.S. chemical companies, the results of our interviews and survey are illustrative and indicative of important issues , but not generalizable. Survey of selected chemical companies We surveyed the same non -generalizable sample of 27 chemical companies we previously interviewed in order to collect data on several items that were relevant to our objectives. Questionnaire design We designed a questionnaire covering four primary topics: (a) approaches the selected companies use to assess the sustainability of their chemical processes and products; (b) the extent and perceived value of their interactions with other stakeholders, including federal agencies, customers, suppliers, academics, and NGOs ; (c) challenges or gaps in stakeholder interactions; and (d) challenges or barriers to the development and use of more sustainable chemistry technologies. After drafting the questionnaire, we pretested it over the telephone with four officials from chemical companies. During these pretests we focused on making sure that (1) the questions were clear and logical, and (2) the questionnaire could be completed without undue burden on company officials. In three cases , the officials were from companies that would not receive the full survey; the final pretest was with a company that did receive the full survey. After each pretest we made revisions to clarify the questions, decrease the likelihood of inaccurate responses, and minimize response burden on company off icials. The questionnaire was independently peer - reviewed by a GAO survey specialist. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 123 Appendix IV provides the questions in the survey instrument and quantitative results (i.e., response counts) from the survey. Survey administration The surveys were sen t by email on January 4 - 6, 2017; in all cases they were sent to the same company officials who participated in our interviews with each company. A reminder email was sent one week after deployment and a similar reminder was sent on the original due date of January 18, 2017, to provide a one -week extension. In total, responses were received from 18 of the original 27 recipient companies, for a 67 percent response rate. Survey data analysis In general, our analysis involved primarily generation of frequenc y counts for all of the close -ended variables in our survey. We also performed cross -tabulations of our survey data by industry sector. There was one question in our survey that involved more advanced analytical techniques. This was the complex matrix question 6 that asked respondents to compare a set of 13 environmental and health factors, one by one, against each other factor. For each pairing, respondents were asked: \"If your company could only achieve a benefit for one of the factors in the pair at the expense of the other, for which factor would your company generally consider it more important to achieve a benefit?\" To summarize the resulting data in a concise form and ascertain the relative importance of the 13 factors, we developed the following scoring approach: Assign one point to a factor each time a company responded that it was more important to achieve a benefit for this factor than for the other factor in the pairing. If the two factors were rated as equal, assign 0.5 points to both factors. If there was no answer provided or the company said it had no opinion, no score was assigned. These scores were then added for each factor across every pair of factors. Results from these analyses are provided in chapter 2. Technology Assessment GAO -18-307 124 Appendix II: Expert participation We collaborated with the National Academies to convene a two -day meeting of experts to inform our work on sustainable chemistry technologies; the meeting was held on May 24 -25, 2016. The experts who par ticipated in our study are listed below. Many of these experts gave us additional assistance throughout our work, including 12 who provided additional technical assistance during our study by sending additional technical material for our review, commenting on the proposed scope of our technology chapters, or answering technical questions; 1 who pretested our survey; and 6 who reviewed our draft report for accuracy and provided technical comments.

When making a change to a chemical process or product, it may sometimes be necessary to make sustainability tradeoffs. That is, a given change may produce a sustainability benefit for one factor at the expense of reduced sustainability for the other fac tor. When comparing each pair of factors in the matrix below, if your company could only achieve a benefit for one of the factors in the pair at the expense of the other, for which factor would your company generally consider it more important to achieve a benefit? How to fill out this table: For each cell, compare the factor listed in the row (items down the left side, in red) with the factor listed in the column (items across the top, in blue). For each pair of factors , choose your response as follows: Row - It is generally more important to achieve a benefit for the factor in the Row Column - It is generally more important to achieve a benefit for the factor in the Column Equal - We give the two factors Equal emphasis None/NA - We have No opinion or N ot Applicable (Note: Unless otherwise noted, 15 of the 18 respondents answered this question for each cell in the matrix.)

Technology Assessment GAO -17-75 144 Appendix V: The 12 Principles of G reen Chemistry Principle 11 It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is formed. Principle 2 Synthetic methods should be designed to maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product. Principle 3 Wherever practicable, synthetic methodologies should be designed to use and generate substances that possess little or no toxicity to human health and the environment. Principle 4 Chemical products should be designed to preserve efficacy of function while reducing toxicity. Principle 5 The use of auxiliary substances (e.g. solvents, separation agents, etc.) should be made unnecessary wherever possible and, innocuous when used. Principle 6 Energy requirements should be recognized for their environmental and economic impacts and should be minimized. Synthetic methods should be conducted at ambient temperature and pressure. Principle 7 A raw material of feedstock should be renewable rather than depleting wherever technically and economically practicable. Principle 8 Unnecessary derivatization (blocking group, protection/deprotection, temporary modification of physical/chemical processes) should be avoided whenever possible. Principle 9 Catalytic reagents (as selective as possible) are superior to stoichiometric reagent s. 1 Paul T. Anastas and John C. Warner, Green Chemistry: Theory and Practice (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 3 0. Technology Assessment GAO -17-75 145 Principle 10 Chemical products should be designed so that at the end of their function they do not persist in the environment and break down into innocuous degradation products. Principle 11 Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to allow for real- time , in-process monitoring and control prio r to the for mation of hazardous substances. Principle 12 Substances and the form of a substance used in a chemical process should be chosen so as to minimize the potential for chemical accidents, includ ing releases, explosions, and fires. Technology Assessment GAO -17-75 146 Appendix VI: Roles of selected federal programs and offices in supporting the development and u se of more sustainable chemistry processes and p roducts The following table, organized by federal agency, summarizes the roles played by the selected agency programs highlighted in chapter 6. This is not a comprehensive list of federal programs and agencies that play a role in supporting the development and use of more sustainable chemistry processes and products and represe nts only a selection of relevant federal activities. GAO selected the programs based on recommendations from agency officials and other experts and on GAO's analysis of the relevancy of program activities.
