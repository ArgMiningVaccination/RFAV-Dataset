About Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic medicine originated in the 1890's with emphasis on the self-healing process (aka the Vis). It is a primary health care system focusing on prevention and wellness using natural modalities. This is an evidence based approach to medicine, while also being effective and functional. Naturopathic doctors attend a 4 year accredited naturopathic medical school with clinical training ranging from pediatrics to geriatrics. Education involves clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, physical medicine, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, psychology and counseling as well as, conventional medicine and pharmacology. Naturopathic doctors pass professional board exams to receive proper licensure, which then allows them to diagnose and treat. The 6 principles of Naturopathic Medicine: 1. The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae) Naturopathic medicine recognizes the body's inherent ability to heal itself. Naturopathic doctors identify and remove obstacles in order to facilitate this healing ability in patients. 2. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam) Naturopathic doctors seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than eliminate or merely suppress symptoms. 3. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere) Naturopathic medicine follows three principles to avoid harming the patient: Use methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects Avoid, when possible, the harmful suppression of symptoms Acknowledge and respect the individual's healing process, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat illness 4. Doctor as Teacher (Docere) Naturopathic doctors educate and empower the patient to encourage self-responsibility for health. They also acknowledge the therapeutic value in the doctor-patient relationship. 5. Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic doctors treat each individual by taking into account physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental and social factors. 6. Prevention Naturopathic doctors emphasize disease prevention, assessment of risk factors while making appropriate interventions to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine strives to create a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. We are shaped by our experiences, beliefs, genetics, diets, medications, traumas, habits, relationships, and environments. In order to address the whole person, naturopathic doctors are trained using various healing tools including: - Thorough health intakes & physical exams - Nutrition & lifestyle changes - Herbal medicine - Targeted nutrient therapy including vitamin injections - Nutraceuticals/supplementation - Natural hormone balancing & bio-identical hormones - Mind-body interventions (biofeedback, meditation, breathing) - Hydrotherapy and various physical medicine techniques Naturopathic medicine is here to support your healing journey.
