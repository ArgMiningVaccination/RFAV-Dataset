Why choose Immune Boost? Think of your immune system as your body's security detail. It helps repel foreign invaders like bacteria, parasites and viruses. The Immune Boost program is designed to help you maintain a robust immune system through a comprehensive combination of Acupuncture, ATP Resonance BioTherapy, BioLight Frequency Therapy and physician-grade supplements specifically formulated for immune health. The Immune Boost program enhances a weak immune system and regulates an overactive immune system. Initial Consultation Required An initial consultation with one of our doctors is required to evaluate your case and determine if you are a good candidate for an Immune Boost. Returning patients are eligible for our \"Seasonal Tune-Ups.\" What to expect with an Immune Boost? Common Questions Regarding an Immune Boost + When is the best time to come in for an immune boost? Immune boosts are best received during times of increased stress, after vaccinations, seasonal changes, toxic exposure and anytime the body feels rundown. + What's the difference between your vitamins and mine? The supplements we prescribe contain pharmaceutical-grade nutrients from reputable companies that are easily absorbed and bioavailable. Each case is evaluated based on individual conditions, such as sleep quality, pre-existing conditions, severity of stress, genetic vulnerabilites, autoimmune factors and various pathogenic loads, thus ensuring that all nutritional needs are met. + How long will my treatment last? Typical immune boost treatments range from 30 minutes to an hour. + What do I do after my immune boost? Rest, relax and stay hydrated. After immunity treatments, it's advised to allow the body 12 to 24 hours to adjust. It's advised to refrain from alcohol and large quantities of caffeine after the boost. + Do you take insurance? As of December 1, 2020, both Dr. Shivali Panchal Gruer and Dr. Dimitri Gruer are out-of-network providers. The office accept FSA and HSA wellness cards and offers superbills for direct reimbursement for plans that provide out-of-network acupuncture coverage. Insurance companies only cover a limited number of visits and conditions without focusing on optimal corrective care. + What is a healing crisis? For a small percentage of new patients that are suffering from chronic ailments, autoimmune conditions or stress-related syndromes, the body may undergo a temporary worsening of symptoms for a 12-24 hour period known as a healing crisis. A healing crisis is a form of an intense shift of toxic burden and a nervous system reset (similar to the effects of a new workout). In this situation, the body will feel significant relief within a day or two. "}
