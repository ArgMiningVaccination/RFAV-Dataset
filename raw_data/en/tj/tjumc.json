Christians refer to it as \"Light or Holy Ghost\" whereas Russian Researchers consider it as Bio-Plasmic Energy. Even popular individual healers use different names like Animal Magnetism, Archaeus & others. LIFE FORCE ENERGY \"LFE\" is also known by some different NAMES in ENGLISH like \"vital energy\", \"breath of OF \"LFE\" Nature's five ELEMENTS - EARTH, WATER, FIRE, AIR & SPACE could be the main source of this Non-Visible LIFE FORCE ENERGY \"LFE\" which functions effectively & efficiently around & within the body for sustaining LIFE providing necessary health, vitality & strength for survival. \"LFE\" enters easily into the body through the FOOD we eat, the WATER we drink & the AIR we breathe absorbing the basic ENERGY of five nature elements including sun & Space. Actually \"LFE\" also flows through all living things including HUMANS, animals, plants, water, crystals, and anything that comes from nature as well as Earth itself. EXISTENCE OF LIFE The existence of LIFE depends upon the continuous, uninterrupted & non-stop movement of LIFE FORCE ENERGY around & within the body traveling to all its parts through a highly complex network of energy centers, cells & thousands of tiny channels called nadis located within enabling it to keep us alive without which otherwise Life cannot survive. HEART & SOUL OF LIFE \"LFE\" is like the heart & soul of LIFE which keeps constantly flowing around as well as inside the body providing life to keep forming not only the energy of our consciousness, but also regulating all of our conscious and unconscious bodily functions like our breath, digestion, blood flow, elimination, and cellular growth. LOW & HIGH LIFE FORCE ENERGY \"LFE\" The amount of \"LFE\" and its level varies from person to person, time to time & day to day. \"LFE\" can either be low or exhausted/depleted & or normal high depending upon prevailing conditions & circumstances relating to the person concerned. When our \"LFE\" is high /full and keeps flowing freely around & inside our whole body, we feel strong, active & healthy. The high level of energy tends to encourage & enhance our self-confidence to take initiative, & face challenges leaving negligible chances of becoming ill. CAUSES for LOW OR IMBALANCED \"LFE\" There are various factors responsible for causing low or blocked & or imbalance such as; lack of self-care, poor nutrition, inadequate sleep, dehydration, overwork, too much stress, overthinking, & other reduced physical as well as mental activities resulting in laziness & lethargic Lifestyle. These & other unhealthy factors like junk food, smoking, alcohol intake, drugs, etc. can create imbalance or obstruction in movement & flow around & within the body making you sick and unwell leading to serious health issues. IMPACT ON HEALTH & WELL-BEING As mentioned before, when the flow & movement of \"LFE\" around or within the body tends to become slow, obstructed, depleted, blocked & or imbalanced then it can lead to multiple physical & mental health-related issues like fatigue, stress, anxiety, pressure, depression, pain, aches, weight loss or gain, negative attitude, lack of sleep, mood variation, mental instability, laziness, lethargic, & Illness. Its slow movement or low level may also fail to nourish the structure, organs, and systems of the body having an adverse impact on our inherent & natural HEALING ABILITY/ POWER making it weak enough to be unable to provide the required support for the healthy growth and renewal of cells to function effectively and efficiently. APPROACH OF DIFFERENT CULTURES Many Cultures worldwide strongly believe that LIFE FORCE ENERGY is directly connected with health & well-being. It is therefore evident that most of the complementary therapies and holistic treatments have been sharing a common theme originating from ancient folk traditions across the world being an integral part of traditional treatments since ages which have resulted in the development of many forms of ENERGY MEDICINES, HEALING THERAPY, SPIRITUAL PHILOSOPHY and other forms of Remedial Systems. Truly speaking each culture has developed its specific approach based on history, philosophy, environment & availability of natural resources. It has further been observed that mostly health-related issues & illnesses have always been treated with herbs, plants, spiritual energy and hands-on healing, etc. for thousands of years even much before the arrival of modern medicine & no wonder that these age-old remedies still continue to be used today successfully by millions of people world over.

As a matter of fact, people living in every region of the global world from Japan & India to Australia & Africa, have their own rich and fascinating cultural beliefs as well as natural resources which are being used as indigenous remedies & folk medicines till date. Some of the most popular herbal medicines & healing rituals across the globe are; the Ayurvedic healing system, Chinese herbal medicines, Japanese traditional treatments like shiatsu therapy & reiki healing, and Aura healing techniques. hot stone massage, reflexology,& other cultural or religious healing rituals.

Ayurvedic Healing System Ayurveda being an ancient Indian energy healing system is one of the oldest practices in the world based on a very strong traditional approach to medicine based on the idea that the world is made up of five elements \u2014 Aakash (space), Jala (water), Prithvi (earth), Teja (fire), and Vayu (air)and a combination of each element results in three HUMORS, or DOSHAS- known as vata, kapha, and pitta believed to be responsible for a person's physiological, mental, and emotional health. According to Ayurveda PRANA (life force energy) nourishes & sustains all the inner systems in the body and when its flow & or any DOSHA gets disturbed, depleted, blocked, or imbalanced then, it can result in various health-related issues & diseases including illness. Hence Ayurveda practitioners concentrate & place their focus on Prana (life force energy) to remove any blocks or obstructions allowing its smooth flow throughout the whole body for well-being applying various techniques like body massage, yoga postures, deep breathing, nutrition, adequate sleep, social relations, meditation, herbal remedies & incorporating healthy lifestyle habits into daily routine to promote optimal health and balance. 2.

Chinese practitioners believe that when CHI's flow is blocked or imbalanced, then it leads to various health issues which they treat using acupuncture, herbal remedies, and other techniques to restore balance promoting the flow of CHI (LFE) It's worth noting that the Jade Stone Roller, which was originally a skincare ritual reserved for the elite in Ancient China during the 7th century, has now become a common practice for everyone.
