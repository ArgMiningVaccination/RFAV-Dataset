An FAD outbreak threatens animal health and animal agriculture and may have significant economic consequences. There may be disruptions in the U.S. food supply. In addition to the economic impact, the social and psychological impact on producers, owners, and consumers can be serious . For example, t he 2001 foot -and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the United Kingdom had an estimated impact of between $12-18 billion. An FMD outbreak in the United States could cause economic losses ranging from $15-$100 billion, depending on a number of factors; these include the duration of the outbreak, delay in detection, extent of trade embargoes, choice of response strategies, and consumer reaction to control measures. 1 The overall economic impact would result from lost international trade, as well as costs directly associated with the eradication effort, such as the expenses of depopulation, indemnity, carcass disposal, and cleaning and disinfection. Over $850 million dollars were spent responding to the 2014-2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in the United States . In addition, there are direct and indirect costs related to foregone production, unemployment, and losses in related businesses, including tourism. The U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) has established the Foreign Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Plan ( FAD PReP ) to provide a framewor k for FAD preparedness and response. This document provides the resp onse strategies , zone and premises designations, and critical activities for controlling, containing, and eradicating a n FAD . This document also has a companion document, the APHIS Foreign Animal Disease Framework: Roles and Coordination ( FAD PReP Manual 1 -0), which provides an overview of FAD PReP, F ederal roles, APHIS authorities and funding process es, incident management, and communication strategy. The APHIS goals of an FAD response are to (1) detect, control, and contain the disease in animals as quic kly as possible; (2) eradicate the disease using strategies that seek to stabilize animal agriculture, the food supply, and the economy and that protect public health and the environment ; and (3) provide science - and risk -based approaches and systems to facilitate continuity of business for non- infected animals and non- contaminated animal products. Achieving these three goals will allow individual livestock facilities, States, Tribes, regions, and industries to resume normal production as quickly as possi ble. The objective is to allow the United States to regain disease -free status 1 See page 1 -1 for citations from this section. October 2015 iv without the response effort causing more disruption and damage than the disease outbreak itself. There are five traditional strategies for the control and eradication of an FAD in domestic livestock that are not mutually exclusive: stamping -out, stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to kill, stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to slaughter, stamping- out modified with emergency vaccination to live, and eme rgency vaccination to live without stamping -out. Any response strategy or strategies implemented will be based on the best available information during the incident. In order to achieve the goals of an FAD response, critical activities and tools must be implemented to execute the response strategies . Box 1 lists these critical activities and tools. Additionally, to assist in executing response strategies , zones, areas, and premises will be designated . Box 1.

Animal health and animal agriculture will be threatened; an FAD outbreak may impact the security, cost, and safety of the U.S. food supply. In addition to the economic impact, the social and psychological impact on both producers and consumers may be signi ficant. The 2001 foot -and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the United Kingdom had an estimated impact of between $12 -18 billion. 1 In the United States, the impact of an FMD outbreak would be contingent on many factors, including the duration of the outbrea k, delay in detection, extent of trade embargoes, choice of response strategies, and consumer reaction to control measures. Depending on these factors, estimates suggest that economic losses in the United States could range from $15-$100 billion. 2 The economic impact of an FAD outbreak would result from lost international trade, as well as from costs directly associated with the eradication effort, such as the expenses of depopulation, indemnity, carcass disposal, and cleaning and disinfection. Over $850 million dollars were spent responding to the 2014- 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in the United States . In addition, there are indirect costs related to foregone production, unemployment, and losses in related businesses , including tourism . The United States undertakes many preventive measures to keep FAD agents out of susceptible U.S. animal populations \u2014including import restrictions, exclusion activities at borders, and public education. However, in order to execute a timely, efficient, and appropriate FAD response effort , it remains essential to plan and prepare for an incident . The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has established the Foreign Animal 1 Thompson D, Muriel P, Russell D, Osborne P, et al. 2001. \"Economic Costs of the Foot - and-Mouth Disease Outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001.\" Rev Sci Tech Off Int Epiz . 465- 493; USDA Foreign Agricultural Service. 2007. \"UK Foot & Mouth Disease \u2014Recovery Timetable, the Economic Impact and Who Pays?\" Global Agriculture Information Netw ork Report .

This document \u2014APHIS Foreign Animal Disease Framework: Response Strategies (FAD PReP Manual 2 -0)\u2014provides significant detail on response strategies for highly contagious FAD outbreaks , including information on zone, area, and premises designations and an overview of other critical activities needed for an effective FAD response . This document has a companion document \u2014 APHIS Foreign Animal Disease Framework: Roles and Coordi nation (FAD PReP Manual 1 -0)\u2014which provides an overview of Federal roles, APHIS authorities and funding processes, incident management, and communications . Together, these and other FAD PReP documents provide a comprehensive preparedness and response framework for an FAD outbreak. Appendix A contains a list of current FAD PReP documents. 1.1 FAD S IN THE UNITED STATES The United States has been involved in a number of animal disease outbreaks over the past 125 years. Lessons learned from the very first eradication campaign that successfully eliminated contagious bovine pleuropneunomia in 1892 through successive control efforts to the present day , including the 2014-2015 HPAI outbreak, the largest incident in U.S. history, have shaped our current strategies. Please refer to Figure 1 -1 for selected FAD events in the United States. Introduction October 2015 1-3 Figure 1-1.

The type and magnitude of activities depends on the response goals and regulatory intervention for the FAD outbreak. The APHIS goals of an FAD response are to (1) detect, control, and contain the disease in animals as quickly as possible; (2) eradicate the disease using strategies that seek to stabi lize animal agriculture, the food supply, and the economy and that protect public health and the environment ; and (3) provide science - and risk -based approaches and systems to facilitate continuity of business for non- infected animals and non- contaminated animal products. Achieving these three goals will allow individual livestock facilities, States, Tribes, regions, and industries to resume normal production as quickly as possible. The objective is to allow the United States to regain disease -free status without the response effort causing more disruption and damage than the disease outbreak itself. 1.3 OVERVIEW OF CRITICAL ACTIVITIES FOR AN FAD RESPONSE In order to achieve the goals of an FAD response, c ritical activities and tools must be implemented to execute the response strategy. Box 1 -1 lists key critical activities and tools. Box 1 -1.

Prevent cont act between the disease and susceptible animals . a. This is accomplished through quarantine of infected animals, movement c ontrols in the Infected Zone(s) (IZ) and Buffer Zone(s) (BZ) (Control Area [ CA(s)]), and biosecurity procedures to protect non-infected animals. b. Certain circumstances may warrant accelerating the depopulation of animals at risk for exposure to the disease to decrease the population density of susceptible animals. c. There is a serious but lesser transmission risk posed by people, material, co nveyances, and non- susceptible animals that may have been in contact with the disease and serve as mechanical vectors. Contact with susceptible animals should be prevented and transmission risk mitigated through stringent biosecurity and cleaning and disin fection measures. 2. Stop the production of the FAD agent in infected or exposed animals . This may be accomplished by slaughter or rapid mass depopulation (and disposal) of infected and potentially infected animals. 3. Increase the disease resistance of susceptible animals to the disease or reduce the shedding of the FAD agent in infected or exposed animals . This can be accomplished by emergency vaccination if a suitable vaccine is available and can be administered in a timely manner. 2.2 REGULATORY INTERVENTION DURING AN FAD OUTBREAK Each State has statutes/regulations governing animal disease reporting. Federally accredited veterinarians are required to report suspected cases of FADs . An FAD October 2015 2-2 outbreak in the United States m ay result in emergency regulatory intervention by State, Tribal Nation, and/or Federal authorities. The type and scope of regulatory interventions will depend upon the disease agent, the circumstances of the outbreak, and the consequences of the outbreak. The U nited S tates D epartment of Agriculture (USDA) and the affected States and Tribal Nations will work together in a U nified C ommand, per the National Incident Management System (NIMS), to detect, control, contain, and eradicate the disease as expeditiously as possible. Incident m anagement for a unified State -Federal -Tribal -stakeholder response is discussed in Chapter 4 of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS ) Foreign A nimal Disease Framework: Roles and Coordination ( FAD PReP Manual 1 -0). The following are examples of State- Federal -Tribal emergency regulatory interventions for an FAD outbreak: Emergency eradication effort. Twelve months or less. Regulatory intervention at time of outbreak by State -Federal -Tribal authorities. Extended emergency eradication effort. Greater than 12 months. Regulatory intervention at time of outbreak by State -Federal -Tribal authorities. National animal disease control program. Long -term program. Regulatory control program conducted by State -Federal -Tribal authorities. Individual State or Tribal Nation animal disease control program. Short - term or long- term. State requirements or Tribal Na tion requirements. Animal disease monitored with limited or no regulatory intervention. Short -term or long- term. Little or no regulatory intervention by State - Federal -Tribal authorities. The scope of regulatory intervention and the selection of a response strategy or strategies in an FAD outbreak will depend on the following: Transmission characteristics of the FAD agent. The rate of contagious animal disease agent transmission, potential for zoonotic transmission, and the number and types of susceptible a nimal species. Transmission characteristics of FAD disease agents are discussed in Section 2.3. Consequences of the FAD outbreak. The consequences of the disease outbreak, and the impact of the response, in terms of disruptions to national security ; food s ecurity ; public health ; Response Strategies and Principles October 2015 2-3 animal health ; environment ; economy \u2014short - and long -term impacts for owners, growers, rural economy, and overall economy Local economy and intrastate commerce Interstate commerce International trade ; and regulatory impacts, including short - and long- term for owners, growers, stakeholders, and general public Local, State, and Tribal regulatory impacts Interstate commerce regulatory impacts International trade regulatory impacts . Acceptance. Acceptance of response policy (social and political) by different communities: Local, State, and Tribal U.S. regional U.S. national North American International . Scale of outbreak. The number of animals infected, species infected, number of premises infected, and susceptible animal population density for infected areas or high -risk areas of becoming infected with an FAD . Rate of outbreak spread. The rate of spread of infection in te rms of number of premises, types of premises, number of animals, and types of animals; rate at which each Infected Premises (IP) leads to infection of one or more additional IP. Veterinary countermeasures available. The availability and efficacy of veteri nary countermeasures such as FAD vaccines. October 2015 2-4 Resources available to implement response strategies. The capabilities and resources available to eradicate an FAD in domestic animals and to control and eradicate an FAD in potential wildlife reservoirs. Dome stic animal disease management capabilities. The capability, feasibility, and res ources available to eradicate an FAD in dome stic animals as an emergency response operation, or control as an animal disease program, or monitor as an endemic animal disease. Wildlife management capabilities. The capability, feasibility , and resources available to eradicate, control, or monitor an FAD in wildlife reservoirs. In the event of an emerging animal disease outbreak, APHIS VS has developed a framework for responding to such incidents. The \"Veterinary Services Proposed Framework for Response to Emerging Animal Disease in the United States\" is available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/downloads/ vs_emerging_diseases_framework.pdf . 2.2.1 Authorization for Response and Associated Activities When the criteria for a presumptive case have been met, the APHIS Administrator or the Veterinary Services ( VS) Deputy Administrator (DA), who is the U.S. Chief Veterinary Officer ( CVO) , can authorize APHIS personnel \u2014in conjunction with State, Tribal, and Incident Command ( IC) personnel \u2014to initiate response activities. When an FAD is detected, USDA, State, and/or T ribal authorities will immediately quarantine the relevant regions or zones , restrict specific movements, depopulate or euthanize affected animals as determined necessary and as humanely as possible , dispose of carcasses, disinfect property, and increase surveillance in the area to ensure that the FAD has not spread. The Incident Commander works with the Operations Section and Situation Unit in the Planning Section to determine zone, area, and premises designations during an FAD outbreak. 2.2.2 Management of Inc ident The outbreak response effort should be implemented through a Unified Command with an appropriate span of control and delegation of authority , employing NIMS . Responses will be as local as possible. Good communication within the chain of command is imperative. An Incident Commander should be identified and an Incident Command Post (ICP) established. In- State resources (whether State, Federal, Tribal, or privately owned) should be used to manage a local response. Out -of-State resources may be used to support the State impacted by the outbreak. Response Strategies and Principles October 2015 2-5 Incident management will include quarantine and movement control, tracing, and activation of response plans to communicate these actions to all stakeholders, the public, and the international community. Cooperative Federal, State, Tribal, local, and indust ry response measures will be carried out with extreme urgency using the most appropriate geographic and jurisdictional scope s required to manage the situation . Incident management for unified State -Federal -Tribal -stakeholder response is discussed in Chapte r 4 of the APHIS Foreign Animal Disease Framework: Roles and Coordination (FAD PReP Manual 1-0). 2.3 TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTICS OF FAD AGENTS When evaluating the response strategies to contain, control, and eradicate an FAD affecting livestock, poultry, or other animals, it is necessary to consider the disease agent's transmission characteristics. An animal disease agent is either contagious (transmitted through animal -to-animal contact or fomite -to-animal contact) or not contagious (transmitted through some other means, often an arthropod vector). Contagious diseases may further be categorized as either \"highly\" contagious or \"not highly\" contagious. This characterization is based on the epidemiology of the diseas e and is related to how fast the disease agen t can move from animal to animal and farm to farm. A highly contagious disease is one that spreads rapidly from animal to animal and, if uncontrolled, from herd to herd or flock to flock. Transmission can occur via direct and indirect modes. A highly conta gious disease may be recognized by greater than normal morbidity or mortality per unit time (high incidence rate or high attack rate). Sometimes morbidity can be characterized by a loss of production (for example , in milk or eggs) even without overt signs of clinical illness. Some non- contagious diseases are spread by insect or arthropod vectors. Some of these vectors are found in the United States, while others are foreign to the United States. As such, detecting foreign animal pests is also critical in pr eventing the introduction and transmission of FADs to the United States. Any highly contagious FAD agent will require very rapid response actions to control its spread. An animal disease outbreak caused by an agent that is not highly contagious may allow for a less rapid response and still result in elimination of the agent of concern. However, disease agents that are not highly contagious often require a rapid response for reasons other than rapid spread of the agent, including disruptions to interstate c ommerce, international trade, or their zoonotic potential. The basic pathway for success in eliminating a highly contagious FAD agent is to control infected and exposed (potentially infected) animals, prevent exposure of susceptible animals, and eliminate an animal's ability to produce the agent. October 2015 2-6 Unfortunately, depending upon the number of animals infected and their locations, the basic pathway for eliminating an agent can become disruptive to the normal business operations of both inf ected and non -infected premises . 2.3.1 Terrestrial FAD Threats Table 2- 1 identifies some of the key terrestrial FADs that pose a risk to the United States.

An emerging animal disease may also become a threat to animal health or public health. An emerging animal disease incident may include any terrestrial animal, aquatic animal, or zoonotic disease not yet known or characterized, or any known or characterized terrestrial or aquatic animal disease in the United States or its territories, that changes or mutates in pathogenicity, communicability, or zoonotic potential to become a threat to animals or humans. An FAD or emerging animal disease incident may involve livestock, poultry, other animals, or wildlife. In the event of an incident involving wildlife, APHIS will work in close collaboration, communication, and coordination with State, Tribal, and Federal wildlife agencies that have primary jurisdictional authority and subject matter expertise for wildlife. 2.4 FAD INVESTIGATIONS Identification of a n FAD begins with the suspected index case investigation and National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) diagnostic testing. VS Guidance Document 12001, defines APHIS policies and procedures for FAD investigations, including response and communication procedures during the investigation period. The FAD/emerging disease incident investigation period is defined as the time from when the investigation is initiated until the time an FAD/ emerging disease incident is ruled out or confirmed. The objectives of an FAD/ emerging disease incident investigation are to provide a veterinary medical assessment, provide presumptive and definitive diagnostic testing results, and ensure that the appropriate veterinary medical countermeasures, regulatory actions, and communications are recommended and implemented during the investigation period. Once an FAD agent is detected, then incident management will be tailored to the specific disease agent and circumstances of the outbreak. Response Strategies and Principles October 2015 2-9 A goal for FAD investigations is to provide presumptive and confirmative diagnostic testing results , as rapidly as possible , given the classification of investigation and designation of diagnostic sample priority. This may include rapid or extraordinary methods for diagnostic sample collection, tra nsport, and testing for those investigations classified as \"high suspicion\" for an FAD. Rapid diagnostic results facilitate the implementation of appropriate regulatory actions, the application of relevant medical countermeasures, and effective communications, all of which can prevent and/or mitigate the dissemination of the FAD agent by interstate commerce or international trade. In the past 1 8 years , there have been over 9,500 investigations conducted on possible FAD or emerging disease incidents throughout the United States, ranging from a yearly low of 254 investigations in calendar year 1997 to a high of 1,013 investigations in 2004 ( Figure 2 -1). Figure 2-1. FAD Investigations from 1997 to 2014 This summary of FAD investigations was compiled from annual reports on animal health in the United States published by APHIS VS (available here ), data from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) World Animal Health Information Database ( http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=home ), and data in the Emergency Management Response System (EMRS , available here). From 2005 through 2014 , 5,095 possible FAD or emerging disease incidents were investigated by VS and State collaborators . However, only a small percentage of those were confirmed to be actual emerging or foreign animal diseases. The exception s during this period were the occurrence of wide spread vesicular stomatitis outbreak s that contributed to the 446 confirmed FAD findings in 2005 and the 449 confirmed FAD findings in 2014 ( Figure 2- 2). The increase in FAD findings during 2012 was also due to an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis. October 2015 2-10 Figure 2-2. FAD Investi gations by Result, 2005 to 2014 2.5 EXAMPLE RESPONSE STRATEGIES The response strategy or strategies used for the control and eradication of an FAD in domestic livestock or poultry depends on the disease agent, zoonotic potential, ability to control the agent, economic impact, and availability of emergency vaccines. There are five strategies for the cont rol and eradication of a highly contagious FAD in domestic livestock or poultry following an outbreak; these strategies are not mutually exclusive. They are as follows: Stamping -out; Stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to kill; Stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to slaughter ; Stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to live ; Emergency vaccination to live without stamping -out. This section defines and describes each of these strategies in turn. Depending upon the circumsta nces and scale of the outbreak, a combination of one or more of these strategies can be applied. In some situations, where stamping -out is not feasible and vaccine is not available, the decision may be made to manage the disease to the extent possible through biosecurity and other control measures (e.g., quarantine and movement control). This could result in the United States being endemic for a given disease agent for some period of time. Analogous strategies for FMD are recognized in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2015) , Article 8. 8.42. Response Strategies and Principles October 2015 2-11 2.5.1 Stamping- Out 2.5.1.1 DEFINING STAMPING -OUT AS A RESPONSE STRATEGY Box 2- 1 defines stamping -out. Box 2-1. Stamping- Out 2.5.1.2 DESCRIBING STAMPING -OUT AS A RESPONSE STRATEGY Stamping -out has been a common approach in a number of past FAD outbreaks. This strategy is most appropriate if the outbreak is contain ed to a jurisdictional area or a region in which the FAD can be readily contained and further dissemination of the agent is unlikely. Stamping -out is currently defined in the OIE Terres trial Animal Health Code (2015 ). Stamping- out m eans a policy designed to eliminate an outbreak by carry- ing out under the authority of the Veterinary Authority the following: a. the killing of the animals which are affected and those suspected of being affected in the herd and, where appropri ate, those in other herds which have been exposed to infection by direct animal to animal contact, or by indirect contact with the causal pathogen; this includes all susceptible animals, vaccinated or unvaccinated, on infected establishments; animals shoul d be killed in accordance with Chapter 7.6; b. the destruction of their carcasses by rendering, burning or burial, or by other method described in Chapter 4.12; c. the cleansing and disinfection of establishments through proce- dures defined in Chapter 4.13. Box 2- 2 lists the critical elements of stamping -out. The OIE recognizes that if outbreaks cannot be confined to a Containment Zone (equivalent to a CA ), response strategies other than just stamping -out may be necessary. Stamping -Out Depopulation of clinically affected and in- contact susceptible animals. October 2015 2-12 Box 2-2. Critical Elements of Stamping- Out 2.5.1.3 ZONES AND AREAS IN RELATION TO STAMPING -OUT Figure s 2-3a and 2 -3b show an example of a stamping -out response strategy where IP are depopulated. Figure 2-3a. Example of Zones and Areas in Relation to Stamping- Out (Infected Premises Would Be Depopulated) Note: Figure is not to sca le. Stamping -Out: Critical Elements The goal is that, within 24 hours of (or as soon as possible after) a presumptive positive classification, infected animals are depopulated in the quickest, safest, and most humane way as possible. In many cases, susceptible livestock or poultry on Contact Premises (CP) may also be depopulated as soon as possible. Where resources are limited, premises will be prioritized so that those with the highest potential for active FAD spread are \"stamped -out\" first. Based on an epidemiology of the outbreak, prioritizing the animals to depopulate first may be necessary. Public concerns about stamping -out will require a well- planned and proactive public relations and liaison campaign. Stakeholders, the public, and the international community must be involved. Care should be taken to consider mental health implications for owners and responders in the event a stamping -out strategy is implemented.

Depopulation and disposal of vaccinates can be delayed until logistically feasible. October 2015 2-14 depopulation and disposal of vaccinated animals. This strategy involves the following: A suppressive emergency vaccination strategy ; The goal is to suppress agent replication in high -risk susceptible animals by using emerging vaccination and then depopulating vaccinates at a later date as determined by IC and the V S Deputy Administrator, the U.S. CVO; The targeted vaccination of high- risk susceptible animals in an IZ, BZ, or Vaccination Zone (VZ). Ring or regional vaccination around an IP or IZ is a frequently cited example of this strategy; May require vaccinated a nimal traceability and the diagnostic capability to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) for movement between zones, interstate commerce, and international trade. These requirements will depend on the length of time between vaccination and depopulation and disposal , as well as other logistical and epidemiological factors ; and Vaccinated animal identification, movement controls, traceability, and an effective, scalable permitting syst em may be necessary. 2.5.2.3 ZONES AND AREAS IN RELATION TO STAMPING -OUT MODIFIED WITH EMERGENCY VACCINATION TO SLAUGHTER Please see Figure 2 -4a and 2 -4b for examples of the zones and areas in relation to stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to kill and stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to slaughter (Section 2.5.3.3 ). The zones and areas are likely to be analogous in these two response strategies; the difference is in the disposition of the vaccinated animals. 2.5.3 Stamping- Out Modi fied with Emergency Vaccination to Slaughter 2.5.3.1 DEFINING STAMPING -OUT MODIFIED WITH EMERGENCY VACCINATION TO SLAUGHTER AS A RESPONSE STRATEGY Box 2- 4 defines stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to slaughter.

Animals on IP would be depopulated, while other animals in a Containment Vaccination Zone ( CVZ ) may be vaccinated. Stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to slaughter is the slaughter and processing of vaccinated animals, if animals are eligible for slaughter under USDA FSIS authority and rules and/or State and Tribal authority and rules.

Vaccinated animals intended for breeding, slaughter, milking, or other purpose s live out their useful lives. If animals are intended for slaughter, animals must be eligible for slaughter under USDA FSIS authority and rules and/or State and Tribal authority and rules. This strategy involves the following: A protective emergency vaccinatio n strategy; The goal is to pr otect susceptible animals from infection using emergency vaccination with the deliberate intent to maintain vaccinates for the duration of their usefulness; The targeted vaccination of non- infected animals. This may include valuable genetic stock, long -lived production animals, or areas with a high-density population of susceptible animals at high risk of becoming infect ed; Requires the establishment of one or more VZs free of disease , the establishment of one or more CAs for infected animals , and movement controls to keep infected animals out of VZs free of disease; DIVA testing may be necessary for movement between zones, interstate commerce, and international trade; and Vaccinated animal identification, movement controls, traceability, and an effective, s calable permitting system may be necessary. 2.5.4.3 ZONES AND AREAS IN RELATION TO STAMPING -OUT MODIFIED WITH EMERGENCY VACCINATION TO LIVE Figure 2- 5a and 2 -5b show how a stamping -out modified with emergency vaccination to live response strategy might be impleme nted.

October 2015 2-20 2.5.4.4 STAMPING -OUT MODIFIED WITH EMERGENCY VACCINATION TO SLAUGHTER AND EMERGENCY VACCINATION TO LIVE It is possible to implement multiple emergency vaccination response strategies in the event of an FAD outbreak. For example, i n Figure 2- 6, both emergency vaccination to slaughter and emergency vaccination to live strategies are implemented in different regions, with stamping -out on IP. Figure 2-6. Examples of Implementing Multiple Emergency Vaccination Strategies with Stamping -Out: Stamping -Out with Vaccination to S laughter and Vaccination to Live Note: Figure is not to scale. 2.5.5 Emergency Vaccination to Live without Stamping- Out 2.5.5.1 DEFINING EMERGENCY VACCINATION TO LIVE WITHOUT STAMPING - OUT AS A RESPONSE STRATEGY Box 2- 6 defines emergency vaccination to live without sta mping -out.

Emergency Vaccination to Live without Stamping- Out Emergency Vaccination to Live without Stamping -Out Vaccination used without depopulation of infected animals or subsequent depopulation or slaughter of vaccinated animals. This can be described as emergency vaccination to live without stamping -out. Response Strategies and Principles October 2015 2-21 2.5.5.2 DESCRIBING EMERGENCY VACCINATION TO LIVE WITHOUT STAMPING - OUT AS A RESPONSE STRATEGY This strategy involves targeted emergency vaccination of susceptible animals, with the intention of not depopulating or slaughtering these animals at a later date because of their vaccination status. This strategy is reserved for a disease outbreak in which the disease is widely disseminated across the United States, affecting many animal industries, whe re resources are not available for stamping -out, and a policy decision has been made not to stamp- out. Although this strategy is highly unlikely to be employed initially in an FA D outbreak response, it is possible that , given the course of an outbreak, the decision might be made to switch to this strategy if the disease becomes widespread. This strategy involves the following: A protective emergency vaccination strategy; The goal is to protect susceptible animals from infection with emergency vaccination, w ith the intention of not slaughtering vaccinates at a later date because of vaccination status ; The establishment of one or more VZs free of disease , the establishment of one or more CAs for infected animals , and movement controls to keep infected animals out of VZs free of disease; DIVA testing may be necessary for movement between zones, interstate commerce, and international trade; and Vaccinated animal identification, movement controls, traceability, and an effective, scalable permitting system may be necessary. 2.5.5.3 ZONES AND AREAS IN RELATION TO EMERGENCY VACCINATION TO LIVE WITHOUT STAMPING -OUT Figure s 2-7a and 2 -7b provide examples of emergency vaccination to live without stamping -out. There would be no stamping -out under this response, only emergency vaccination to live. This strateg y would not be employed unless the disease is widely disseminated across the United States, resources are not available for stamping -out, and a policy decision has been made to not stamp- out. While it is highly unlik ely that this would be the initial strategy employed in an FAD outbreak response, it is possible that , given the course of an outbreak, the decision might be made to switch to this strategy if the disease becomes widespread.

Response Strategies and Principles October 2015 2-23 2.5.6 Manage Outbreak Without Widespread Stamping - Out or Vaccination In some cases, such as when the disease agent is already widespread prior to de- tection or when it involves a large number of animals, and when no effective vac-cine is readily available in sufficient quantities, the decision may be made to manage the outbre ak without widespread stamping -out or vaccination. The dis- ease would be controlled to the extent possible through rapid and effective imple-mentation of other critical activities, including biosecurity and quarantine and movement control. This approach to a n FAD outbreak may result in the United States being endemic for the disease for a more extended period of time; a longer -term control program for eradication may be developed. While the United States actively works to pre- pare for FAD outbreaks, there are scenarios in which managing the outbreak with-out widespread stamping- out or vaccination may be the only option. Effective and rapid FAD tracing, as well as securing appropriate veterinary medical counter- measures, like vaccine, for high- consequence, contagi ous disease agents is critical to protect animal agriculture and the economy. 2.6 SUMMARY OF SELECTING A RESPONSE STRATEGY The previous sections have identified and described different response strategies. Choosing one strategy, multiple strategies, or modifying strategies as an out break unfolds is a complex decision process. Depending upon the circumstances and scale of the outbreak, a combination of one or more of the response strategies can be applied. If it becomes apparent at any point in the response that stamping -out will not achieve control, containment, and, ultimately , eradication of the disease, alternative strategies will immediately be considered. Currently, it is not possible to delineate a priori the specific factors that might signal the n eed to modify the response to an FAD outbreak. No single FAD control or eradication strategy may be perfect or appropriate for all scenarios. Regardless of the FAD agent, the response will use science - and risk-based approach es that protect public health, the environment, a nd animal health, and stabilize animal agriculture, the food supply, and the economy. Stamping -out is a viable eradication strategy if an outbreak is detected quickly, while still reasonably localized and contained by quarantine and movem ent control and biosecurity measures. An essential prerequisite for stamping -out is the existence of good epidemiological investigation functions and FAD tracing October 2015 2-24 capabilities, which allow the locations and extent of the IP and Control Areas to be rapidly a nd accurately determined. Regulatory officials and stakeholders who plan for stamping -out must also have other viable response strategies, in case the spread of the FAD outpaces the resources for stamping -out, or if other factors direct the response away f rom a stamping -out strategy alone. In circumstances or scenarios where stamping -out alone will not be a viable eradication strategy, modified stamping -out with vaccination to kill, modified stamping -out with vaccination to slaughter, modified stamping -out with vaccination to live, and vaccination to live without stamping -out are all potential options. Emergency vaccination strategies can be adopted for agents having an effective, safe, available vaccine, and when those strategies are consistent with nationa l and international standards. In order to implement a vaccination strategy, the United States must also have timely access to sufficient quantities of effective vaccine. This can be a significant technical and logistical challenge for many disease agents. In any situation involving emergency vaccination, movement control, FAD traceability , and a robust information t echnology system to support permitting, epidemiology , and tracing are essential for the timely continuity of business for non-infected animals, emergency vaccinated animals, and animal products. Regardless of the response strategy or strategies adopted, early detection and field operations that act with speed and certainty to identify the source of infection and stop the FAD agent from spreading further will decrease the size and duration of the outbreak. See Table 2- 3 for factors that determine whether emergency vaccination strategies are advantageous for responding to an FAD outbreak. Table 2-3. Factors Determining Viability of Emergency Vaccination Factor or criterion Vaccination Decision Points For vaccination Against vaccination Suitable vaccine for effective control against FAD agent Available Not available Public health assessment Supports vaccination Does not support vaccination Population density of susceptible animals at high risk of becoming infected High Low Movement of infected animals, product s, or fomites out of CA Evidence of widespread movement No evidence of widespread movement Origin of outbreak Unknown Known Spread of outbreak Rapid Slow Distribution of outbreaks Widespread Limited or restricted Response Strategies and Principles October 2015 2-25 Factor or criterion Vaccination Decision Points For vaccination Against vaccination Public reaction to total stamping- out strategy (Public reaction may vary by animal species, scale of stamping- out policy, and disease agent ) Strong opposition Neutral reaction or weak opposition Domestic stakeholders' acceptance of regionalization with vaccination zones Yes No Third country acceptance of regionalization with vaccination zones Known Unknown Assessments and economic analysis of competing control strategies It is likely that a control strategy without emergency vaccination will lead to significantly higher economic losses or longer duration of the outbreak It is likely that a control strategy with emergency vaccination will lead to significantly higher economic losses or longer duration of the outbreak Note: This table was adapted from: Council Directive 2003/85/EC of 29 September 2003.

FAD Response and Vaccination Strategies 2.7 OIE-LISTED ANIMAL DISEASES AND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR RESPONSE 2.7.1 Recognition of Disease- Free Statu s In May 1994, the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE requested the FMD and Other Epizootics Commission (now called the Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases) to develop a procedure for OIE to officially recognize the FMD -free status of members. In 1998, the official agreement between the World Trade Organization and the OIE further confirmed the OIE's mandate to recognize disease - and pest -free areas and/or risk status (Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures) for trade purposes. The recognition of official disease status has since been expanded to include official FAD Response and Vaccination Strategies The use of emergency vaccination strategies may be considered in an FAD outbreak. An emergency vaccination strategy can help to achieve the goals of an FAD response effort, based on the three epidemiological principles of response. There are many challenge s to using emergency vaccination in an FAD response, but also many benefits. An FAD response may use one strategy or a variety of strategies in order to detect, control, contain, and ultimately eradicate the disease in domestic animals. The use of emergenc y vaccination if an appropriate vaccine is available, will be determined by the IC, the State Animal Health Officials (SAHOs), and the VS DA (U.S. CVO). October 2015 2-26 recognition of a disease status for ,1 CBPP , and bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE).2 Since 2012, AHS, CSF, and PPR have also been added to the list of diseases for which official freedom is recognized. Any M ember that wishes to be included in the list of designated disease- status countries or to change its status (for example, to move from the list of FMD free countri es or zones where vaccination is practiced to the list of FMD free countries or zones where vaccin ation is not practiced) sends an application to the OIE Scientific and Technical Department , accompanied by specific documentation and the relevant questionna ires. The Director General then submits the request to the Scientific Commission for evaluation. The OIE Scientific Commission is responsible for assessing these applications for their compliance with the OIE standards. 3 If there is a disease outbreak, or if the Scientific Commission determines that the country no longer complies with relevant requirements, disease status may be suspended. Suspended status can be reinstated when the country submits a new application that complies with requirements. The Dir ector General of the OIE announces suspension and recovery of official OIE disease status. For example, t he OIE -categories for official country recognition for FMD virus are as follows ( Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2015) Articles 8.8.2, 8.8.3, 8.8.4, 8.8.5): FMD -free country or is not practiced (Article 8.8.2) FMD -free country or zone where vacci nation is practiced (Article 8. 8.3) FMD -free compartment (Article 8. 8.4) FMD -infected country or zone (Article 8. 8.5). OIE Members can also self -declare their entire country, zone , or compartment free from certain OIE -listed diseases other rinderpest, and PPR . In this case, delegates are advised to consult the Terrestrial Animal Health Code or the Aquatic Animal Health Code to verify whether specific requirements for self -declaration of freedom from that particular disease are available.

These critical activities are important capabilities for an effective response. This section describes some of those activities ; Appendix B contains a list of example preparedness and response goals for selected activities and tools . Epidemiolog ical investigation and FAD tracing : Critical in minimizing the size and duration of an FAD outbreak. Includes activities such as the trace -forward and trace- back of infected animals, expo sed animals, contaminated animal products, and fomites to determine the source of infection and stop the spread of infection from animals on IP and CP. Surveillance: Determines the extent of infection for premises and zones with defined plans for clinical observation and diagnostic testing. 4 For further information, the OIE provides Standard Operating Procedures for Official Recognition of D isease Status or R isk Status of B ovine Spongiform E ncephalopathy and for the Endorsement of N ational Official Control P rogrammes of Member Countries , http://www.oie.int/ fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/SOP2015/EN_SOP2015.pdf . October 2015 2-28 Also provides information for disease -freedom for premises and zones with defined plans for clinical observation and diagnostic testing. Biosecurity : Necessary to (1) contain the agent on IP (biocontainment), and (2) prevent the introduction of the agent via movement of personnel and material to na\u00efve animals and premises (bioexclusion). A careful balance must be maintained between facilitating response activities and ensuring personnel do not expose na\u00efve animals and premises to the disease. Information management: EMRS 2.0 is the system of record for all FAD investigations, FAD incidents, and other animal health events as specified. Data must be entered into the EMRS system in a timely manner (ideally less than 24 hours), consistently, and accurately for situation reporting at all levels. Quarantine and movement control : Quarantines will be implemented for IP, Suspect Premises (SP) , and CP. Movement controls will be implemented for At- Risk Premises (ARP) and Monitored Premises (MP) within a CA . Movement control of susceptible animals and animal products within, into, and out of a CA is accomplished by risk assessments, surveillance requirements, biosecurity procedures, and perm itting. Movement controls of susceptible animals may also be implemented on broader geographical areas or by jurisdictions, such as a State, regionally, or nationally, to limit the \"silent spread\" of infection (for certain disease agents, such as FMD ). The time period for this type of movement control needs to be defined, such as for an incubation period for the disease or other specified period. Continuity of business : Provides science - and risk- based approaches and systems for the continuity of business involving non- infected animals and non- contaminated animal products. Establishes a transparent and effective system for risk assessments, surveillance requirements, biosecurity procedures, and a permit Response Strategies and Principles October 2015 2-29 process in order to promote stakeholder acceptance and compliance with regulatory interventi ons by State, Federal, and Tribal authorities. Cleaning and disinfection/virus elimination : This activity eliminates a contagious agent from contaminated premises and fomites with proper sanitary procedures including cleaning (e.g., removal of contaminatio n; organic matter) and disinfection (application of physical or chemical measures to eliminate the disease agent ). Cleaning and disinfection activities should eliminate the virus in the most cost -effective way possible. Any method selected should consider the characteristic s of the premises/houses and other factors which may impact the effectiveness of virus elimination. Disposal : This activity dispose s of animal carcasses, contaminated and potentially contaminated materials, animal products, and items th at cannot be properly cleaned and disinfected in a biosecure manner that does not allow disease spread with minimal negative environmental impact. Public awareness campaign : Public awareness campaigns engage and leverage State, Federal , Tribal , and stakeh older relationships to provide unified public messages for local, national, and international audiences. This activity addresses issues and concerns relating to food safety, public health, and animal welfare. This activity address es issues and concerns related to interstate commerce, continuity of business, and international trade. Emergency vaccination : Emergency vaccination may be employed depending upon the availability and efficacy of a vaccine, the goals of the outbreak response , the circumstances of the outbreak, approval of the IC, the SAHOs , and the VS DA (U.S. CVO). DIVA testing may be necessary for movement between zones, interstate commerce, and international trade. October 2015 3-1 Chapter 3 Designating Zones and Premises 3.1 AREAS AND Z ONES In general, an animal disease outbreak response may involve seven types of zones/areas. These zones and areas are the 1) Infected Zone (IZ); 2) Buffer Zone (BZ); 3) Control Area (CA) ; 4) Surveillance Zone (SZ); 5) Free Area (FA) ; 6) Containment Vaccination Zone (CVZ); and 7) Protection Vaccination Zone (PVZ) . This section provides detail on these areas and zones. 3.1.1 Infected Zone An IZ immediately surrounds an Infected Premises (IP) (see Figure 3 -1). IP, Suspect Premises (SP), and Contact Premises (CP) are subject to individual premises quarantine. At-Risk Premises (ARP) and Monitored Premises (MP) are subject to movement control. An IZ will initially encompass all presumptive or confirmed positive premises and include CP as required epidemiologically or logistically. The size of an IZ depends upon the foreign animal disease (FAD) agent and may be modified or redefined as needed by the circumstances of the outbreak. The perimeter of an IZ should be at least 3 km (1.86 miles) beyond the perimeters of presumptive or confirmed IP. An IZ may initially be as large as a county, township, district, or other jurisdictional area. Considerations for establishing the size of an IZ: potential consequences of not containing the disease agent to a particular jurisdictional or geographical area; and potential consequences of movement restrictions (or implementation of a permit process) on a large geographical or jurisdictional area. October 2015 3-2 See the tables in Section 3.4 and the disease specific response plans for more guidance on moving animals and animal products into, within, and out of a CA. Figure 3-1. Infected Zone Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.1.2 Buffer Z one A BZ immediately surrounds an IZ or a CP (see Figure 3 -2). A BZ and IZ together constitute a CA. Within a BZ, CP are subject to individual premises quarantine. ARP and MP are subject to movement control. A BZ is a scalable are a with a width that is never less than the minimum radius of the associated IZ, but may be much larger. The perimeter of a BZ should be at least 7 km (4.35 miles) beyond the perimeter of the IZ. The size of a BZ depends upon the FAD agent and circumstances of the outbreak. The boundaries of a BZ may be modified or redefined as needed by the circumstances of the outbreak. Considerations for establishing the size of a BZ. potential consequences of not containing the disease agent to a particular jurisdictional or geographical area; and Designating Zones and Premises October 2015 3-3 potential consequences of movement restrictions (or implementation of a permit process) on a large geographical or jurisdictional area. See the tables in Section 3.4 and the disease specific response plans for more guidance on moving animals and animal products into, within, and out of a CA. If a CP is identified outside a CA, it may be surrounded by a BZ until the disposition of the CP is determined. Figure 3-2. Buffer Zone Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.1.3 Control Area A CA consists of an IZ and a BZ (see Figure 3-3 ). IP, SP, and CP are subject to individual premises quarantine. ARP and MP are subject to movement control. The size of a CA depends upon the FAD agent and circumstances of the outbreak and may be modified or redefined as needed by the circumstances of the outbreak. The perimeter of a CA should be at least 10 km (6.21 miles) beyond the perimeter of the closest IP. Initially a CA may be much larger, such as multiple counties, a State, a Tribal Nation, or multiple States. The size of a CA is scalable to the risk, or the uncertainty of the risk, posed by the disease agent and the circumstances of the outbreak. October 2015 3-4 The boundaries of a CA can be modified or redefined when tracing and other epidemiological information becomes available. Table 3 -1 lists factors that should be considered when determining the size of a CA. Considerations for establishing the size of a CA: potential consequences of not containing the disease agent to a particular jurisdictional or geographical area; and potential consequences of movement restrictions (or implementation of a permit process) on a large geographic or jurisdictional area.

Control Area Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.1.4 Surveillance Zone An SZ should be established in the FA, outside and along the border of a CA, separating the remainder of the FA from a CA (see Figure 3-4 ). Surveillance in an SZ will focus on premises determined to be at the highest risk of infection. The width of an SZ should be at least 10 km (6.2 miles). The maximum size of an SZ may be much larger. October 2015 3-6 Figure 3-4. Surveillance Zone Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.1.5 Free Area The FA is the area not included in any CA. The FA includes an SZ but can extend beyond it (see Figure 3-5 ). The FA may also include a PVZ. Figure 3-5. Free Area Note: Figures are not to scale. Designating Zones and Premises October 2015 3-7 3.1.6 Containment Vaccination Zone A CVZ is an emergency vaccination zone, typically inside a CA. It may include all or part of an IZ and/or a BZ (see Figure 3 -6). A CVZ may be a secondary zone designation. Quarantine and movement control requirements, surveillance requirements, and biosecurity procedures for a CA (IZ and BZ) apply to a CVZ. Animals receiving emergency vaccination within a CVZ may be subject to vaccinated animal traceability and DIVA testing, as determined by the Incident Command ( IC). Depending upon the circumstances of the outbreak, the emergency vaccination strategy within a CVZ may be one or more of the following: Suppressive vaccination strategy (for example, stamping-out modified with emergency vaccination to kill or to slaughter). Protective vaccination strategy (for example, stamping-out modified with emergency vaccination to live). Protective vaccination strategy (for example, emergency vaccination to live without stamping-out). October 2015 3-8 Figure 3-6 . Examples of Containment Vaccination Zones Emergency Vaccination in Infected Zone Emergen cy Va ccination in Buffer Zone Emergency Vaccination in Control Area Emergency Vaccination Partial BZ and IZ Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.1.7 Protection Vaccination Zone A PVZ is an emergency vaccination zone, typically outside the CA (see Figure 3 -7). A PVZ may be subject to movement control requirements, surveillance requirements, and biosecurity procedures. A PVZ may be a secondary zone designation. Animals receiving emergency vaccination within a PVZ may be subject to vaccinated animal traceability and DIVA testing, as determined by IC. Designating Zones and Premises October 2015 3-9 A PVZ is consistent with the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) definition for a Protection Zone. A Protection Zone is defined by the OIE as a zone established to protect the health status of animals in a free country or free zone, from those in a country or zone of a different animal health status, using measures based on the epidemiology of the disease under consideration to prevent spread of the causative pathogenic agent into a free country or free zone. These measures may include, but are not limited to, vaccination, movement control and an intensified degree of surveillance. More information can be found at the OIE website, www.oie.int . Depending upon the circumstances of the outbreak, the emergency vaccination strategy within a PVZ may be one or more of the following: Protective vaccination strategy (for example, stamping-out modified with emergency vaccination to live). Protective vaccination strategy (for example, emergency vaccination to live without stamping-out). S uppressive vaccination strategy (for example, stamping-out modified with emergency vaccination to kill or to slaughter). Fi gure 3-7. Protection Vaccination Zone Note: Figures are not to scale. The smaller zones on the lower left or right hand corner of the above figures illustrate an example of another PVZ, and associated SZ, which is not surrounding a CA. October 2015 3-10 3.2 PREMISES In general, any animal disease outbreak involves six types of premises: 1) IP; 2) CP; 3) SP; 4) ARP; 5) and 6) Free Premises (FP). If emergency vacc ination is used, there will be a seventh type, Vaccinated Premises (VP). 3.2.1 Infected Premises An IP is located in an IZ (see Figure 3 -8). An IP is a premises where a presumptive positive case or confirmed positive case exists as determined by laboratory results, compatible clinical signs, case definition, and international standards. All presumptive and confirmed positive premises are classified as an IP. In addition, all other premises that meet the current case definition are classified as an IP. Figure 3-8. Infected Premises Note: Figu res are not to scale. 3.2.2 Contact Premises A CP can be located in an IZ or BZ (see Figure 3-9 ). A CP is a premises with susceptible animals that may have been exposed to the FAD agent, either directly or indirectly, including but not limited to exposure to animals, animal products, fomites, or people from an IP. The specific transmission characteristics of the FAD agent should be considered when assigning the CP designation. A premises that is contiguous to an IP may also be classified as a CP. Designating Zones and Premises October 2015 3-11 If a CP is identified outside a CA, it may be surrounded by a BZ until the disposition of the CP is determined. A CP designation outside of a CA in a BZ is intended to be a short-term designation. A CP will be subject to quarantine and movement controls, surveillance requirements, and strict biosecurity procedures. Other disease control measures may include depopulation and disposal of susceptible animals as determined by IC. If the susceptible animals on a CP are not depopulated, they will be placed under surveillance in accordance with the surveillance plan. Following epidemiological investigation, surveillance requirements, diagnostic test results, and biosecurity requirements, a CP within a CA can be designated as an IP, ARP, or an MP. If a CP is in a BZ outside of a CA, the BZ will be removed if the premises is not infected. If the premises is infected, a CA, comprising an IZ and BZ, will be placed around the IP. Figure 3-9 . Contact Premises Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.2.3 Suspect Premises An SP can be located in an IZ, BZ, SZ, or VZ (see Figure 3 -10). An SP is a premises under investigation due to the presence of susceptible animals reported to have clinical signs compatible with the FAD. This is intended to be a short-term premises designation. An SP is subject to quarantine and movement controls, surveillance requirements, and strict biosecurity procedures. October 2015 3-12 Surveillance will be conducted in accordance with the surveillance plan. Following complete epidemiological investigation, surveillance requirements, and biosecurity requirements, an SP can be designated as an IP, CP, ARP, or MP if in a CA, as an FP if in an SZ or VZ. Figure 3-10. Suspect Premises Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.2.4 At-Risk Premises An ARP can be located in an IZ or BZ (see Figure 3 -11). An ARP is a premises with susceptible animals, but none have clinical signs compatible with the FAD. An ARP must objectively demonstrate that it is not an IP, CP, or SP. An ARP is subject to movement control requirements, surveillance requirements, and biosecurity procedures established for a CA. An ARP that seeks to move susceptible animals or animal products within a CA will require a permit approved by IC and must use appropriate biosecurity procedures. An ARP that seeks to move susceptible animals or animal products out of a CA will need to meet the requirements to be reclassified as an MP. Designating Zones and Premises October 2015 3-13 Figure 3-11. At-Risk Premises Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.2.5 Monitored Premises An MP is located in a CA (IZ or BZ). An MP objectively demonstrates that it is not an IP, CP, or SP (see Figure 3 -12). Only an ARP is eligible to become an MP. An MP is subject to epidemiological investigation, risk assessments, surveillance requirements, and biosecurity procedures. An MP meets a set of defined criteria in seeking to move susceptible animals or animal products out of a CA by permit. For movement of susceptible animals and animal products out of a CA to the FA, the permit process must take into consideration any international standards or conditions for such movement. In addition, commodity- specific proactive risk assessments, continuity of business plans, and movement and marketability plans will be considered. October 2015 3-14 Figure 3-12. Monitored Premises Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.2.6 Vaccinated Premises A VP may be located in a CVZ, typically inside a CA (IZ and BZ) or in a PVZ, typically outside a CA. A VP is a premises where emergency vaccination has been performed. VP may be a secondary premises designation (see Figure 3 -13). A VP may be subject to the risk assessments, surveillance requirements, and biosecurity procedures established for the primary premises designation as established by IC. Animals receiving emergency vaccination on a VP may be subject to vaccinated animal traceability and DIVA testing. For movement of emergency vaccinated animals, consideration must be given to any national or international standards or conditions for such movement.

The smaller zone on the lower right hand corner of the above figure illustrates an example PVZ , and associated SZ, which is not surrounding a CA. 3.2.7 Free Premises An FP is a premises outside of a CA and not a CP or SP (see Figure 3 -14). An FP can be located within an SZ or elsewhere in the FA. Figure 3-14. Free Premises Note: Figures are not to scale. 3.3 SUMMARY : ZONES , AREAS , PREMISES Table 3 -2 summarizes the premises designations that would be employed in an FAD outbreak response.

October 2015 B-1 Appendix B Example Preparedness and Response Goals for Selected Critical Activities Table B -1 lists example preparedness and response goals for critical activities and tools. These preparedness and response goals help to bolster preparedness planning by providing objectives and improve response efforts by offering general guidelines for implementation of the critical activities and tools. It is important to remember that the goals offered in this section are provided for guidance: each foreign animal d isease ( FAD) response will be unique, with different situations that must be considered by the Federal, State, Tribal and local entities involved in a respon se effort. These examples are compatible with the Core Capabilities List identified in the National Preparedness Goal from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Core Capabilities List is an important additional resource for States , Tribes , and loca lities in developing their own emergency response plans . 1 1 Federal Emergency Management Agency, 201 5. Core Capabilities. http://www.fema.gov/ core- capabilities . Accessed August 14 , 2015. October 2015 B-2 Table B-1. Selected Preparedness and Response Goals Critical activity Preparedness goal s Response goal s Etiology and Ecology Provide etiology and ecology summaries for high priority FAD and foreign animal pest threats. Update these summaries at regular intervals. Unified Command and stakeholders have a common set of etiology and ecology definitions and descriptions. Have proper understanding of the FAD or foreign animal pest threat when establishing or revising goals, objectives, strategies, and procedures. Case Definitions and Laboratory Definitions The Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health, in conjunction with Surveillance, Preparedness, and Response Services, will provide case definitions for foreign animal diseases to Federal, State, Tribal, local, and agricultural stakeholders prior to an incident. Update case definitions at regular intervals and as needed throughout incidents or outbreaks. Surveillance Develop capabilities and relationships to produce surveillance plans within 24- 48 hours of a confirmed outbreak. Develop effective surveillance plans that can achieve desired outcomes by leveraging available resources, satisfying jurisdictional requirements, and implementing continuity of business measures. Implement surveillance plans within 48 hours of the confirmation of an outbreak. Implement a surveillance plan that will (1) define the present extent of FAD and (2) detect unknown Infected Premises (IP) quickly. Have the surveillance plan consider the susceptible wildlife population in the area, and coordinate with APHIS Wildlife Services, the Department of Interior, State wildlife agencies, and State agriculture departments to perform appropriate surveillance in wildlife populations. Provide complete surveil lance data summaries and analyses at intervals as specified by Incident Command (IC). Diagnostics Maintain existing capabilities and develop new capabilities for diagnostic testing for FADs. Establish procedures for surge capacity in an outbreak, and identify gaps in personnel and/or equipment. Maintain a well -trained, proficient staff. Meet the surge requirements for diagnostic testing at specific intervals, starting at time zero and at 24- hour intervals as the response escalates. Report all diagnostic test results to appropriate personnel and/or information management systems within 12 hours of diagnostic test completion. Epidemiological Investigation and Tracing Define expectations for epidemiological investigation and FAD tracing before an incident or outbreak, especially for highly contagious FAD s. Identify individuals who are trained or experienced in epidemiological investigation and tracing activities. Assign a premises designation and pri ority of investigation within 6 hours of identifying a potential Infected Premises ( IP) or Contact Premises (CP) through tracing activities. Identify all CP within 24 hours of identifying the IP or the initial CP. Example Preparedness and Response Goals for Selected Critical Activities October 2015 B-3 Table B-1. Selected Preparedness and Response Goals Critical activity Preparedness goal s Response goal s Identify and pre- position information management resources, and other resources necessary to support epidemiology activities and tracing in an actual incident or outbreak. Establish priorities for contact tracing, and for establishing Infected Zone(s), Buffer Zone(s), and Surveillance Zone(s). Identify the resources needed for different disease agents, and for outbreaks of varying size/scale. Determine within 96 hours of identifying the index case, the nature of the FAD outbreak, identify the risk factors for transmission, and develop mitigation strategies. Information Management Ensure that Federal, State, Tribal, local, and Federal information management systems are compatible for sharing data and information. Identify gaps or weaknesses in current information management systems related to a large- scale FAD outbreak, especially related to communicating incident goals and objectives, status reports, tracing information, premises status information, diagnostic results, epidemiology reports, permits for movement, and resource information. Improve capabilities for information management for a large- scale or complex outbreak. Perform Emergency Management Response System (EMRS) data entry processes or information downloads in 24- hour intervals or less , or as requested by Incident Command. Data entry should be as close to real -time as feasible. Effectively communicate incident goals and objectives, status reports, tracing information, premises status information, diagnostic results, epidemiology reports, permits for movement, and resource information. Communication Establish a network of stakeholders and systems for communication, prior to an incident or outbreak. Test or exercise the systems for communication at regular intervals, before an outbreak. Develop message maps prior to an outbreak. Brief the media, public, industry, Congress, trading partners, and others on the FAD outbreak status and the actions being taken to control and eradicate the disease. Highlight the importance of sound biosecurity practices and steps that producers and other producers and owners can take to protect against infection. Coordinate w ith Federal, State, and local agencies, Tribal entities, producer groups, and land grant university -based cooperative extension services to ensure a consistent messaging regarding animal health, public health, and food safety. Assure consumers that USDA is working on the animal health issues in collaboration with public health agencies on human health issues. October 2015 B-4 Table B-1. Selected Preparedness and Response Goals Critical activity Preparedness goal s Response goal s Health and Safety and PPE Develop Site- Specific Health and Safety Plan templates before the incident or outbreak. Train personnel and/or develop just -in-time training that can be readily available for additional personnel. Provide daily pre- entry safety briefings for all response personnel. Prevent , to every extent possible, adverse human health events related to emergency response efforts. Biosecurity Develop incident biosecurity plans, fixed operation biosecurity plans, and mobile operation biosecurity plans, before the incident or outbreak. Train personnel and/or develop just -in-time training that can be readily available for additional personnel. Ensure that biosecurity procedures to prevent the spread of an FAD agent are implemented within 12-14 hours of identifying the index case. Quarantine and Movement Control Work with stakeholders to develop effective quarantine and movement control plans for affected premises , areas, or regions . Work with stakeholders to develop effective movement control and permit plans for non- infected premises , areas, or regions . Once a Control Area is established, implement quarantine and movement controls as rapidly as possible. Ensure quarantine and movement controls consider competing priorities, weighing the risk of disease transmission against the need for critical movements (e.g., feed trucks) and business continuity. Continuity of Business Work with industry stakeholders and experts to prioritize animal or commodity movements that have the potential to be affected by the disease or the disease response. Establish a transparent and effective system for risk assessments, surveillance requirements, biosecurity procedures, and a permit ting process in order to promote stakeholder acceptance and compliance with regulatory interventions by Federal, State, and Tribal authori ties. Understand the information management requirements and data necessary for permits and movement in an outbreak. Implement an appropriate continuity of business plan for industries or industry segment affected. Work with industry and Incident Command to facilitate and permit movement of non- infected animals and non- contaminated animal products from non- infected premises. Ensure permits and movement are effectively captured in EMRS 2.0 in a timely fashion. Regionalization for International Trade Promote science- based international trade policy and procedures . Develop guidance for regionalization in the United States to respond to an FAD outbreak in the country that facilitates the resumption of international trade involving non-infected animals and unaffected animal products. Initiate the implementation of regionalization plans tailored to the specific agent and epidemiological situation as soon as possible during the outbreak response. Provide trading partners and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) relevant outbreak information to support the regionalization plan, including the measures used to provide evidence of disease- freedom in the region. Example Preparedness and Response Goals for Selected Critical Activities October 2015 B-5 Table B-1. Selected Preparedness and Response Goals Critical activity Preparedness goal s Response goal s Mass Depopulation and Euthanasia Develop contingency plans for mass depopulation and exercise those plans. Develop non- traditional approaches or alternatives to mass depopulation for large scale or catastrophic outbreaks. Train personnel and/or develop just -in-time training that can be readily available for additional personnel. Implement animal -sparing modalities, such as vaccination, where appropriate and permitted by law. Provide humane treatment at all times until animals are euthanized or depopulated. Prioritize depopulation by selecting animals which are expressing elevated clinical s igns or pose a significant risk of spreading infection first. Depopulate the affected animal species as quickly, efficiently, and humanely as possible, but in consideration of the extenuating circumstances that surround an animal health emergency. Depopulation within 24 hours may be an appropriate goal for many health incidents . Minimize, to the extent possible, the emotional and psychological impact on animal owners, caretakers, and their families, and those involved in the actual depopulation activities. Disposal Establish disposal protocols or procedures and options before an outbreak, for consistency and safeguarding, and to meet regulatory requirements. Identify suitable disposal personnel, supplies, materials, and equipment prior to the incident or FAD outbreak. Prevent the spread of the disease agent, with little or no effect on the environment, considering community preferences, and conserving meat or animal protein if logistically supportable from a biosecurity viewpoint. Properly dispose of contaminated and potentially contaminated materials, including animal carcasses, as soon as possible while maximizing pathogen containment, environmental sustainability, stakeholder acceptance, and cost effectiveness. Cleaning and Disinfection Establish cleaning and disinfecting protocols or procedures before an outbreak, for consistency and safeguarding. Identify disinfectants (or pesticides) that are U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved for specific FAD agents. Be able to acquire these disinfectants, both in finite immediate quantities for the start of an FAD incident or outbreak, and in indefini te estimated quantities for surge capacity requirements beyond the initial immediate need. Ensure that cleaning and disinfection is conducted on any premises where a disease agent is presumed or confirmed to exist . This may be within 48 hours of disposal o f depopulated animals , or in a time- frame as indicated by IC. Remove, inactivate, reduce, or destroy pathogens at infected premises. Cleaning and disinfection measures should focus on eliminating the virus in the most cost effective way possible. October 2015 B-6 Table B-1. Selected Preparedness and Response Goals Critical activity Preparedness goal s Response goal s Vaccination Determine if an effective vaccine is available for the FAD agent. Enter into vaccine bank relationships and/or establish logistics contracts (such as those through the National Veterinary Stockpile or other contracting mechanism ) to maximize preparedness potential in a strategically sound approach that is cost effective. Work with stakeholders to identify the situations or scenarios where strategic vaccination for an FAD will be requested. Develop contingency plans for emergency vaccination, and exercise those plans ; identify resources and requirements to effectively implement plans. If a decision is made to use an emergency vaccination strategy, then order the resources to implement the emergency vaccination strategy as rapidly as possible. Engage in a public awareness campaign to provide information and education regarding the use of vaccination for the emergency outbreak. Logistics Develop plans and processes for emergency contracting support for FAD response, for activities including transport, cold- chain storage, depopulation, disposal, and disinfection. Provide extraordinary or rapid transport as required for sample collection and delivery to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories . Deliver the amount of requested vaccine or equipment to respond appropriately within 24 hours of an outbreak. Provide emergency contracting support as needed for activities including equipment transport, cold- chain storage, depopulation, disposal, and disinfection. Wildlife Management and Vector Control Identify risk factors for FAD transmission between wildlife and susceptible livestock for high- priority disease agents. Develop the capabilities, in coordination with agencies with primary jurisdiction over wildlife, to rapidly develop wildlife management plans and procedures in an FAD incident. Conduct an assessment of the risk that wildlife poses for further transmission of the FAD to susceptible livestock within 7 days of confirmation of the FAD. Develop a wildlife management plan rapidly after an assessment has been conducted. Integrate wildlife management and vector control authorities and personnel into the Incident Command as required by the situation. Prevent the spread of an FAD from domestic livestock to wildlife by controlling potential biological and mechanical vectors. Animal Welfare Identify the resources and training necessary to provide humane treatment to animals during FAD outbreaks, particularly from the time they are identified for destruction or vaccination activities until they are depopulated, euthanized, or slaughtered. Provide humane treatment to animals given the outbreak circumstances, especially from the time they are identified for destruction or vaccination activities until they are depopulated, euthanized or slaughtered, as prescribed by veterinary authorities of affected States or Tribal Nations. Example Preparedness and Response Goals for Selected Critical Activities October 2015 B-7 Table B-1. Selected Preparedness and Response Goals Critical activity Preparedness goal s Response goal s Modeling and Assessment Tools Develop, evaluate, and use quantitative tools to prepare for an animal disease incident. These tools can be used for things including contingency planning, training, assessment of threats, evaluating control strategies, designing surveillance programs, prioritizing interventions, and supporting resource allocation. Develop proactive and commodity specific risk assessments that support continuity of business in the event of an outbreak. Provide scientifically supported modeling products and qualitative or quantitative risk assessments to address issues of concern with 72 hours after a request from the Incident Commander. Use models and assessment tools in after action reports and/or lessons learned documents to analyze incident response as needed. Appraisal and Compensation Pre-identify and train compensation specialists before the incident. Provide just -in-time training for compensation specialists as needed. Exercise, evaluate, and improve administrative processes for performing appraisals and compensation functions before an outbreak. Data required for appraisal should be collected before depopulation. Every attempt should be made to provide fair market appraisal prior to depopulation, in some emergency situations, appraisals will not be required to be signed prior to depopulation if there is immediate risk of virus spread or amplification of the virus on a presumptive or confirmed positive premises. Timelines may vary depending on the species and types of animals. Finance Develop templates for cooperative agreements with States and Tribes before FAD outbreaks. Develop templates and processes to rapidly submit contingency fund requests, Commodity Credit Corporation requests, and supplemental appropriation requests. Rapidly request funds through appropriate funding mechanisms. Rapidly provide general and detailed budget information as anticipated and requested. Provide timely finance functions within the Incident Command System (ICS) structure. Incident Management Ensure that there is training available for personnel on the ICS from an introductory to an advanced level. Develop plans and procedures for establishing an Incident Command rapidly in an FAD outbreak. Develop processes to augment Incident Management Teams as indicated by the incident; identify resources, expertise, and/or personnel for this capability. Stand- up an IC and an Inci dent Coordination Group as quickly as possible (within the first 24 hours) after the detection of an FAD or foreign animal pest threat in the United States.
