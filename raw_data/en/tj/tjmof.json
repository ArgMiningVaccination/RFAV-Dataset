Native youth were also encouraged to submit written Town Hall Overview H e a l i n g I n d i g e n o u s L i v e s I n i t i a t i v e Youth to Youth Dialogue The Healing Indigenous Lives Initiative (HILI) is a partnership between United National Indian Tribal Youth (UNITY) and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). HILI recruited a diverse group of Peer Guides, who helped design, plan, and conduct training for Native youth in critical aspects of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention. The Healing Indigenous LivesInitiative (HILI) supports and enhances Native youth engagement,coordination, and action related to juvenile justiceand delinquencyprevention inIndian country. justice issues. The youth reflections are vital to helping decision makers develop informed responses that improve outcomes for Native youth, enhance public safety, promote accountability and empower communities. The Town Halls were open to Native y outh ages 14-24 years old and were facilitated by Peer Guides from each of the four time zones. They included a series of questions that related to questions asked of tribal leaders in OJJDP's tribal consultation. The list of questions can be found on p. 16. | www.unityinc.org/peerguides comments to UNITY after the event via a questionnaire. Over 155 Native youth participated live in the Town Halls, and 234 from across the country responded to an online questionnaire. Peer Guides have studied these responses and compiled them into this report that is meant to amplify Native youth voices, interests and concerns. UNITY's mission is to foster the spiritual, ment al, physical, and social development of American Indian, Hawaiian, and Alaska Native youth. 2 The VISIONARY Peer Guides Angela Noah Collin Church Sonwai Wakayuta Hualapai , KS \"I guarantee that your tribal history includes some resilient, \"It doesnt take a professional or \"Native leaders are emotional strong ancestors who fought to a good speaker to lead.

Native youth in every region expressed the importance of community connectedness and the traditional sense of belonging to feeling safe. Belonging and connectedness One commonality among the Native youth responses in each geographical region alluded to the traditional concept of \"place-based identity\" and community \"connectedness. \" UNITYs national network of Youth Councils is built upon the same cultural connectedness found in community mobilization, youth empowerment, and capacity-building models as a means of developing safety. Native youth expressed how their shared identity made them feel safe and connected to their tribe or urban Native communities. 4 Native Community Safety Elders Native youth expressed how understanding intergenerational relationships and engaging in cultural activities created safety in their communities. The Town Hall discussions show the cultural significance that elders hold in Indigenous cultures as a community asset and core of Native households. It is common for youth to be raised by their grandparents and live in extended family homes in many communities and homes. This can be representative of traditional clan systems and matriarchal societies. It also shows Native Youth may have a perspective of safety that is different than non-native youth. From a non-native perspective, the elderly are not always synonymous with community strength and protection. Elders are the ultimate protective factor. Research also sho ws the vital role elders play in creating community safety for Native youth and tribal communities. One study examined American Indian (AI) elders resilience to support an intervention to build resilience among AI urban youth. The research project revealed how resilience strategies are linked to cultural teachings and values, youth activities, and education (Kahn, Carmella B, et al., 2016) \" My elders help me feel safe, knowing what theyve been through and seeing them be strong makes me feel safe. Also, being familiar with everyone around me helps too. My reservation is a very close community. \" a G\u0000od Relative Swinomish Native Youth \"I think that incorporating more cultural teachings \" Being a good relative makes me feel safe.

For example, in every region, multiple youths gave answers relating to public health guidelines, such as \"obeying quarantine, \" \"social distancing, \" or other tribal governmental policies, such as community \"lockdowns, \" to stop the spread of the pandemic. Multiple people stated that they felt safe when they saw people wearing masks in public places. by the recent pandemic. communities had been disproportionately affected Youth participants discussed how Native American Many related \"feeling safe\" with increased or heightened public health awareness efforts to help protect family members and community members from getting sick or having adequate access to medical and cleaning supplies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a new study that \"specifically examines how COVID-19 is affecting American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) - one of the racial and ethnic minority groups at highest risk from the disease. The CDC found that in 23 selected states, the cumulative incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among AI/AN was 3.5 times that of non-Hispanic whites. \" Police, First Responders, Community Patrols While not all Native youth feel safe around police officers in their communities, there was a c ommon theme across the different regions on how law enforcement and community support agencies made them feel secure. In the written questionnaire, 83 Native youth out of 237 (35%) answered that police (tribal or state) \"law enforcement\" or \"community patrols\" made them feel safe. Many Native youth listed the police as both a challenge and a community strength to public safety in responses submitted from all the Town Halls. Some youth listed \"police violence\" and \"racist police\" as the root cause of them feeling unsafe. Both views are important to validate and acknowledge. This reflects the diversity in tribal communities, on and off Indian reservations, and rural and urban communities. \"Educated police officers that are interested in knowing our c ommunity and what we are going through make me feel safe when they take time to get to know us. \" Pacific Region Native youth \"We only have one cop in my town, so I think it makes the kids f eel as if they can do more things they shouldnt be doing. We need more help. \" Central Region Native youth \"Many things make me feel safe in the community. The AIM (Americ an Indian Movement) patrol has been moving up Lake Street. That's what makes us feel safe in our community - our people looking out for each other. \" Central Region Native youth, Minneapolis Click on the video above to hear from Peer Guide Sonwai Wakayuta, Central region. 6 Community Safety \" What helps me feel safe is that everyone knows everyone, and we are raised to be a very tight-knit community. If something bad happens, we all come together to help those in need. I know my community has my back no matter what happens. \" Eastern Band of Cherokee Native youth \" My primary sense of safety in my community is tied to my surroundings and knowing that I am close by family and neighbors who are concerned about me and my safety. \" Peer Trainer Dr. Leslie Locklear Eastern Region \" I do not feel safe in my community. I don't know when I will again. \" Pacific Region Native youth The Gathering Of Native Americans (GONA) curriculum has shown effectiveness in American Indian and Alaskan Native youth's drug and alcoholprevention/intervention when youthunderstand the traditional teachings behindbelongingness. The GONA concept of\"belonging\" represents infancy andchildhood, when people need to know theybelong, that they are safe and essential. \"I feel Safe at UNITY \" 7 \" I like knowing who I'm with and where I am in the community. If my mom or grandma doesn't know their family background, then my trust is already compromised. It takes constant effort to feel safe and mindful in my community. \" Peer Guide Sonwai Wakayuta Central region \" The fact that I have so much family and familiar r elationships with my neighbors and other members of my community makes me feel safe. \" Central Region Native youth \"What are some challenges with public safety?\" Intergenerational Substance Abuse & Cycles of Violence All of the UNITY Peer Guides have been impacted by substance abuse or community violence. Their courage in the face of adversity and ability to break the intergenerational cycle and overcome personal obstacles is what makes the HILI program successful in its outreach to Native youth. The Peer Guides believe that Native youth empo werment includes redefining leadership to include those who have experiences with the criminal justice system and those impacted by substance abuse. Inclusiveness has allowed them to establish trust and work with Native youth to overcome any community challenge. \"break the cycle \" Top Town Hall Native youth Responses: Violence, trauma & Poverty, unemployment, & substance abuse lack of resources Suicide and School dropouts & self-harm education disparities Police or law enforcement, Poor mental health police brutality and violence Missing and murdered Gener ational impacts of indigenous women & imprisonment & youth girls incarceration Click to Learn More: the National Unity Council's Top Ten Issues Facing Native Youth 8 Community Challenges H e a l i n g f r o m Tra u m a Violence Research shows an urgent need to improve Indian nations federal resources to addr ess safety issues in their communities. While the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (TLOA) and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013) were historic steps forward in restoring safety, more needs to be done to protect Native women, who experience violence at rates 2\u00bd times higher than violence against any other group of women in the United States. Historical trauma can be e xpressed in three ways: Native youth believe that allowing a safe, culturally centered space to acknowledge past trauma is vital in healing and in preparing future leaders. Native youth who share their trauma give themselves permission to be part of the solution instead of carrying crippling shame that can result in risky behaviors. Native Youth Empowerment Speaking out about past traumas can be a sour ce of empowerment for Native youth. Native youth who have been exposed to trauma within their communities have become leaders in their communities and in helping other youth find resources for healing. Historical Trauma Research shows the effects of his torical trauma can be manifested in many ways. Among Native Americans, it has included: A breakdown of traditional Native family values Alcohol & other substance abuse Depression, anxiety, & suicidality Child abuse & domestic violence Posttraumatic stress disorder Internalized oppression, self- hatred, & lateral violence General loss of meaning & sense of hope 1. Historical unresolved grief is the r esult of historical trauma that has not been sufficiently acknowledged, expressed, or otherwise addressed. 2. Disenfranchised grief is the pr oduct of historical trauma when loss cannot be voiced or is not publicly acknowledged. 3. Internalized oppression occurs when \"tr aumatized people ... internalize the views of the oppressor and perpetuate a cycle of self-hatred that manifests itself in negative behaviors. \" 9 Community Challenges \" In all honesty, I think that the lack of safety in my community is due to drug and alcohol use, leading to the neglect of children at times. This then leads to unsafe behavior by the youth, which begins the cycle anew. \" Central Region Native youth \" It's simple, hurt people, hurt people. They are unwell and need help, not punishment. \" Pacific Region Native youth \" There is a lot of gun violence, gang activity and, gentrification where I am located; it impacts the youth greatly especially because they are black and brown youth \" Central Region Native youth American-Indian and Alaskan Native children experience PTSD at the same rate at veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to a Department of Justice advisory committee report, 22% of American-Indian and Alaskan Native juveniles have PTSD\u2014three times higher than the national rate. \"Violence, racial injustice, stereotypes. More Peer Guiders needed! Some youth are raised in rougher environments, while some act out of anger/frustration. With support, I believe all communities can be healed. \" Mountain Region Native youth \" My community is plagued with subst ance and alcohol abuse that often stems from historical trauma, & various mental health issues of which I feel should be addressed as the root cause. \" Peer Guide, Leslie Locklear, East ern Region \"seek out the r\u0000ot cause \" 10 Poverty, needing to work to support the family Community Challenges Native youth Mental Health In July 2020, UNITY Peer Guides participated in a congressional forum led by Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), chair of the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples of the United States. The subject of the hearing was Native Youth Perspectives on Mental Health and Healing. (click to watch) Peer Guides discussed the mental health impacts facing Native youth in the United States, education and safety, and ideas on how policy can reduce trauma and promote healing. \"Mental health is a vitally important topic, p articularly now as the coronavirus pandemic is afflicting our communities, Im proud to see our Native youth speaking before Congress, sharing their insight on what can and should be done to protect Native lives. \" Mary Kim Titla, UNITY Executive Director Click Here for the written transcripts of the Oversight Hearing- Native Youth & Mental Health and watch UNITY youth advocates. High Dropout Rates During the Town Halls, Native youth expressed many Housing crisis contributes to dropouts reasons why education disparities were a community concern. Some of the common concerns brought up include: Transportation to school is difficult in remote areas Lack of resources for students No wifi or Internet for remote schooling Culture Shock in education, when moving schools Native youth being misdiagnosed as special needs Language barriers if not fluent English speaker Educational inequity, switching from reservation schools to public schools Unhealthy relationships in school Lack of Native teachers, professors, counselors The educational history of mistrust Generational Boarding school history: unaddressed trauma Missing school to attend ceremonies, wakes or funerals, etc. Bullying or teasing of Native youth Lack of culture being taught in education systems Inaccurate history being taught in schools Teen pregnancies or extended family responsibilities \"Many Native youth experience Imposter Syndrome because the educational institutions are built upon the assumption that indigenous methodologies are inferior. \" Angela Noah, Pacific Peer Guide 11 Top Town Hall Native youth Responses: \"How can young people contribute to creating a safe environment in your community?\" Host an open mic or town hall Meet with your Tribal Council Organize or attend a demons tration Native youth are taking charge of their personal and community safety across the country. Many have embraced service and activism to confront safety issues. \"One of the most powerful words in the language of my Cherokee tradition is gadugi, a call to bring people together to help one another. In the Pueblos Keres language, the term si-yudze translates as \"everybody's work,\" referring to communal service, where all join to plant crops, prepare for ceremonies, and so forth. The Zuni words, yanse' lihanna, have similar meanings. Underlying this ethic of service, which is common to Native cultures across North America, is the celebration of kinship and mutual interdependence - in the Lakota words mitakuya owasin, \"we are all as relatives.\" Mclellan Hall Attend community organizing or advocacy trainings Gather Native youth to do a comunity service project Create or join a local UNITY y outh council \"Servant Leadership \" 12 Leading by Example UNITY Peer Guide Cheyenne Kippenberger, 23, of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, partnered with the What Can Youth Do? \"The town hall responses were quite remarkable and eye-opening. For \"Young people can contribute by always speaking up and using their voice to Youth Creating Change Starting a National Conversation UNITY Peer Guides created a call to action, by challenging youth councils to raise awareness of the top concerns in their community. They hosted several interactive virtual conversations on what it means to \"be a Good Relative\" and how to identify our community needs. Native youth, young leaders, and youth advocates discussed how to increase community safety using a holistic approach. say enough is enough. I feel that would open peoples' eyes to see that this isnt the way our youth should have to live. Also, being a positive role model and creating a bond that tells other youth that doing drugs, etc. is not cool.

The symposiums focus was to stress the importance of safe and healthy environments for Native people and increase awareness about domestic violence, self-care, elder abuse, and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. Kippenberger teamed up with the Native Learning Center to advocate for cutting-edge womens empowerment programs and services designed to help build positive healthy relationships. example, one participant responded with \"y outh can help create youth councils, \" which everyone overall agreed with pointing out they are or were on a youth council and how supportive they were. Another said \"positive role models\" who show that drinking or narcotics doesnt bring you happiness. We all agreed that living sober is the best way to create change, as it can promote healthy living and wanting to improve yourself. Just listening to my peers helped open my eyes to what we can do as a youth. \" Amiyah Begay, Navajo, 16 | www.unityinc.org 13 Youth Creating Change \"Speaking up, volunteering, training with youth groups or tribal organizations such as UNITY to bring back to their community, & incorporating new ideas to keep peers engaged in positive ways\" Eastern Native Youth \" I think that incorporating more cultural t eachings and practices into our communities with the help of our elders and teachers would build a better and safer environment for our future generations \" Central Native Youth \" Talking to their family and friends about ho w they feel, possibly even starting a community support group for anyone who is struggling \" Pacific Native youth \" Living a drug and alcohol- free lifestyle.

We could have a meeting with our Tribal Council and discuss all the possible environmental changes to make sure they get enforced for the safety of the community \" Peer Guide Sonwai Wakayuta Mount ain Region \"Change Agent\u0000 \" 14 Native Youth Resiliency What does resiliency mean? During the Town Halls, Native youth expressed what resiliency meant to them. While e xploring how youth overcome difficult or traumatic situations in their lives, one common answer centered around inherent resiliency. \"To me, resiliency is a double-edged sword. While I am grateful for how our people have this innate ability to overcome the odds in so many traumatic situations, I also see first-hand the social, emotional, and mental turmoil it takes on our youth. We continue to push this idea of resiliency and overcoming but at times, I feel like we need to impart more grace\" said Peer Trainer Dr. Leslie Locklear. \" Youth can make changes because we are resilient! Youth can increase the use of our voice, UNITY and our youth councils help our young people learn to speak up. Even a small group can cause big changes, and I look forward to helping them. \" Eastern Native youth \"One thing that I like to promote is acknowledging your feelings. Youth may feel anxious, sad, or you may not feel right. It's good to acknowledge it, and it's OK not to be alright all the time. To me, resiliency is that feeling of wanting to get help or wanting to get through something. Knowing that in the future, you will get through it. It helps you persevere, and you'll come through stronger than ever. \" Mountain Region Native youth \" T upac Shakur talks about the rose that gr ows through the concrete. And to me, that's what resiliency is. Like, there's a lot of beautiful people out there. The petals are all kinds of damaged (but it) grew through the concrete. It's more beautiful than even the rose that has all the immaculate, perfect petals, right?\" Pacific Region Native youth \"I know at the heart of resilience is just being able t o sit here and say we're still here, despite everything, I am going to make it. \" Eastern Region Native youth \" Learning that, even though you feel lik e you're alone, you're not alone... that's resilience. There's a lot of youth; when something traumatic happens in my community, we just brush it off, like, dang another one, or what's next? It shouldn't be that type of reaction, but it's the reaction that comes from being resilient for so long. Like Lakota say, resilience is being strong on the inside, having a courageous spirit, even when it's hard. \" Central Region Native youth 15 OJJDP Specific Questions The UNITY Peer Guides started the conversation in each Town Hall by asking Native youth if they were familiar with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). Most attendees had never heard of the department. The Peer Guides explained the mission and purpose of OJJDP before moving into the guided discussion. Of the 237 written Native youth responses in the Questionnaire, 70.1% of Native y outh reported never hearing about OJJDP before now. 29.9% of the youth reported being familiar with OJJDP and their programs. Several OJJDP representatives and Training and Technical Assistance providers were also in attendance at each Town Hall to answer questions the UNITY Peer Guides may not have had answers to. https://unityinc.org/native-youth/healing-indigenous-lives-initiative-hili-native - youth-town-hall-series/> Town Hall Questions What helps you feel safe in your community? What do you see as the challenges with public safety in your community and how ar e young people impacted? How can young people contribute to creating a safe environment in your c ommunity? What does resilience mean to you and what do you think helps youth overcome difficult or tr aumatic situations in their lives? What types of programs could OJJDP support that would enhance public safety and help t o ensure that juvenile offenders are held appropriately accountable to crime victims and tribal communities? What specific assistance can OJJDP provide to help existing programs, support inno vative ideas to expand programs, and provide additional training and technical assistance? How can OJJDP support efforts to engage youth and build leadership skills in Native y outh? 16 Top T own Hall Native youth Responses: \"How can OJJDP ensure that juvenile offenders are held appropriately accountable to crime victims and tribal communities?\" Focus on restorative justice Community service as ac countability Helping others not go do wn the same path Reconnecting to the community Address the root cause of their mistakes to restore balance The creation of safe and r espectful environments \"Shift your focus \" The most common response to this question centered around shifting the focus to helping offenders \"find balance\" and engage in community service. Native youth in every region expressed the importance of encouraging help seeking behaviors instead of western concepts of punishment. \"Holding youth more accountable is not the pr oblem, we are losing generations of our people to life in prison. We need to focus on how our community failed to help them, how did we miss that they were struggling, we need to ask how am I here? how did I make it when my family did not? We all come from the same trauma, we are the same dreamers, it has to be more than luck and bars that separates us. \" Eastern Native youth 17 Restore, Renew & Rebuild Restorative Justice Native youth voiced their concerns about the focus of punishment on juvenile offender s rather than rehabilitation or what is often referred to as a \"healing journey. \" Overall, healing and personal accountability are a community priority, which is seen to help restore wellness to offenders and victims, their families, and clans. UNITY Peer Guides agree that \"in First Nation and Native American justice, healing, along with reintegrating individuals into their community, is paramount. \" Holistic Approach Wellness Courts \"In Alaska, a lot of our communities are not concerned with \"Operate more Juvenile Healing to ensuring offenders are being held more accountable; we are Wellness Courts. I also think there should more worried about losing our youth to suicide, gang violence be more group homes where our juvenile and drugs. It is a slippery slope when you label kids as bad; then, offenders will have a place to stay instead of being held in detention centers. I think the group homes should be located on Tribal land and operated by people who have the compassion and empathy for the client but someone who can also give the client some structure in their lives. \" Eastern Region Native youth Why so many? \"Native youth are incarcerated at higher rat es per capita than other races...

This will ensure that programs are culturally appr opriate and the community is more likely to take ownership of the shared mission. Non-native OJJDP employees who work with Tribal Nations should be required to take an introductory workshop on American Indian Studies or Cultural Sensitivity class to improve relationship building. \"help us help ourselves \" Top Town Hall Native youth Responses: Government to government relationship Increase access to ceremonies in detention centers & prison Expand peer to peer pr ogramming Hire regional tribal liaisons t o develop cultural best practices Program sustainability & recurring funding sources Inclusion of cultural practices into funding solicitations Expand efforts for restorative jus tice in Indian Country Host Tribal youth listening sessions, mor e peer guide town halls, or open mics 20 Ideas to Expand Programs Government to Government Relationship Building One common theme mentioned in more than two Town Halls referenced by Nativ e youth was the lack of trust of the federal government.

Hands on learning is way better than just listening to an adult speak. \" Pacific Region Native youth \" OJJDP can support native youth leadership by pr oviding classes on our native culture and teach valuable skills, like how to write speeches and public speaking. Our culture helps keep us safe and is the only thing we can lean on when things fall apart. \" Mountain Native youth \"Be better at recognizing some of our Nativ e youth are trying to do better, and not all Native Americans are drunks and felons. \" Pacific Region Native youth \"Have fun local conferences like UNITY, be real with them. Use personal experiences to help them. Bring in young adults to do fun but knowledgeable activities, be positive and encourage taking healthy risks. \" Pacific Native youth \"Ask us for soluti\u0000ns \"25 Amplifying Native Youth Voices in the Tribal Consultation Process UNITY Peer Guide Audrianna Mitchell was the youth facilitator for OJJDP's June 2020 trib al consultation with 288 tribal leaders and representatives. The consultation sought f eedback on how OJJDP can assist tribes in implementing the Juvenile Justice Reform Act (JJRA) provisions and increase tribes' access to juvenile justice funding. Because of Audri's involvement in both events, she was able to guide her Cohort through comparisons on the two consultations. The Peer Guides firmly believe in the importance of continuing the inclusion of Native youth voices in the tribal consultation process. Click to Watch: the OJJDP Tribal Consultation Webinar Culture As Prevention and Intervention The Town Halls have shown that keeping native youth involved in their cultur e will impact how they think and act towards the community and broadens their outlook on life. Our culture is synonymous with leadership, which can potentially inspire the way the native youth carry themselves. This is powerful and can help push them to become our future leaders. For many, these cultural programs are a get away place for them, when their home life is troubled. Culture is the key.

Click to read in its entirety UNITY Peer Guide recommendations based on T own Hall feedback Next Steps 1 OJJDP: \"OJJDP will examine the feasibility of incorporating language into certain solicitations that state, in lieu of the standard evidence-based programs that do not include a significant population of AI/AN youth in their studies, tribes may propose indigenous practices that have longevity within tribal communities.\" 2 Native Youth : One of the main things The Peer Guides heard in the Town Halls was the effectiveness of cultural practices in keeping Native youth from getting into trouble or when re-entering into the community. Native youth in the Town Halls repeatedly requested the inclusion of culture into OJJDP tribal prevention and intervention efforts. OJJDP: \"In the spirit of strengthening government-to-government relationships, O JJDP will suggest that states ask tribes to recommend individuals to serve as their tribal representatives on the State Advisory Groups (SAG) and include AI/AN youth.\" 3 Native Youth: Tribal leaders stressed that consultation and inclusion in matters involving tribal youth must be part of the federal trust responsibility. Similarly, Native youth in the Town Halls expressed the need to amplify youth voices in creating local solutions. HILI recommends SAGs consult with Peer Guides and UNITY youth councils within their states. The Peer Guides feel that the SAGs should also create a Youth Tribal Representative position. OJJDP: \"OJJDP will add a consultation or listening session to OJJDPs biennial T ribal Youth Conference to gather input on a variety of juvenile justice-related tribal issues.\" Native Youth: The Native youth involved in the Town Halls also reaffirmed the need for more youth listening sessions. Youth feel that their lived experiences can offer vit al insight, which OJJDP decision-makers could benefit from. Because the UNITY National Conference is the largest Native youth gathering in North America, HILI recommends that OJJDP host annual listening sessions in conjunction with this event to continue the Peer Guides efforts in gathering youth feedback. 27 A Special Thank you to the HILI Support Staff & Trainers The Peer Guides appreciate all those who have invested their time and energy to pour into their lives. UNITY appreciates our mentors who provide training, support, prayers, resources, information, and other assistance for their peers in efforts to creatively prevent and address juvenile delinquency in Indian Country.
