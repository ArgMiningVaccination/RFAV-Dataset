GENERAL INFORMATION 1.1 History, Background and Mission of Campbell University On January 5, 1887, James Archibald Campbell welcomed 16 students to the first day of classes, thus marking the founding of Buies Creek Academy. Over the years, the Academy evolved to become Campbell Junior College (1926), Campbell College (1961), and Campbell Univers ity (1979). The mission of Campbell University is to graduate students with exemplary academic and professional skills who are prepared for purposeful lives and meaningful service. The University is informed and inspired by its Baptist heritage and three basic theological and biblical presuppositions: learning is appointed and conserved by God as essential to the fulfillment of human destiny; in Christ all things consist and find ultimate unity; and the Kingdom of God in this world is rooted and grounded in Christian community. The University embraces the conviction that there is no conflict between the life of faith and the life of inquiry. In 2013, Campbell launched the Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine, North Carolina's first new m edical school in over 35 years. In August 2016, the Catherine W.

Between 2012 and 2019, CUSOM started 18 new residency programs in Family Medicine, Internal Medicin e, Obst etrics-Gynecology, Dermatology, Surgery, Sports Medicin e, Osteopathic Psychiatry. Osteopathic Postdoctoral Training Institution (O PTI) CUSOM is a memb er of the Osteopathic Medical Network of Excellence in Education (OMNE E), which is committed to develop residency programs in North Carolina and the Southe astern United States. North Carolina has the medi cal facilities to provide suf ficient training sites for CUSOM medi cal students and the oppo rtunity to develop n ew GME training sites to ensure graduates will have residency posit ions available to them in No rth Carolina. 1.6 Osteopathic History The history of CUSOM begins with the advent of osteop athy by And rew Taylor Still, a native of Virginia. In 1854, Dr. Still, then a practicing allopathic physician in Kansas, became increasingly dissatisfied with the medi cal practices of his day. He developed a new theo ry of m edicine, whi ch he called osteopathy. He based his n ew approach to he alth care on the concepts of body unity, the body's inherent ability to heal itself given all the opt imum conditions, and on the pro per alignment and function of the musculoskel etal system. CUSOM takes pride in bringing the philosophi es of Dr. Still to North Carolin a. Over the years, the practice of medicine has evolved and so has the practice of osteo pathic medi cine. Today, doctors of osteo pathic medi cine (DOs) serve the public with full medical practice privil eges. Osteopathic physicians are trained in all the mode rn practices science has to of fer in medi cal and surgical care while incorporating the concept of treating the whole p erson thro ughout the training. 15 Osteopathic physicians believe hands-on examination (p alpation) is an essential part of making a physical diagnosis. In addition to pharmacologic treatment and surgery, manipulative medi cine remains an important therapeutic tool ut ilized by osteop athic physicians in alleviating pain and treating illness. The training of osteop athic physicians h as always stressed a prim ary care orientatio n. Four Tenets of Osteopathic Medicine 1. The body is a uni t; the person is a unit of mind, body and spirit 2. The body is capable of self-regulation, self-healing and health maintenance 3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated 4. Rational treatment is based on the above three principles 1.7 Osteopathic Oath I do hereby affirm my loyalty to the profession I am about to enter. I will be mindful always of my great responsibi lity to preserve the health and the life of my patients, to retain their confidence and respect both as a physician and a friend who will guard their secrets with s crupulous honor and fidelity, to perform faithfully my professional dut ies, to employ only those recognized methods of tr eatment consistent with good jud gment and with my skill and ability, keeping in mind always nature's laws and the bo dy's inh erent capacity for recovery. I will be ever vigilant in aiding in the general welfare of the community, sustaining its laws and institutions, not engaging in those practices, which will in any way, bring sh ame or discredit upon my profession or myself. I will give no drugs for deadly purposes to any person, though it be asked of me. I will endeavor to work in accord with my colleagues in a spirit of progressive cooperation and never by word or by act cast imputations upon th em or their rightful pr actices. I will look with respect and esteem upon all those who have taught me my art. To my college I will be loyal and strive always for its best interests and for the interests of the students who will come after me. I will be ever alert to further the application of basic bio logic truths to the h ealing arts and to develop the principles of osteopathy, which were first enunciated by Andrew Taylor St ill. 16 2.

To be consid ered for the Early Decision Admissions Track, the candidate must meet all of the following requirements and agree to apply only to CUSOM until an early decision notification has been made. Please note the Early Decision Admissions Track requirements are in addition to the minimum requirements for admissions lis ted earlier in this se ction. Early Decision Admissions Track Requirements Minimum Science and Overall GPA of 3.50 on a 4.0 scale. Recent M CAT score (by August of the calendar year; thr ee years prior to the date of application) with a minimum score at the 50th percentile. Submit an application, o fficial tr anscript f rom all institutions attended, and MCAT scores to AACOMAS by July 1 of the year preceding matriculation. Submit a letter of intent to the Office of Admissions indicating that CUSOM is your first choice for medi cal schools by July 1 and request review for Early Decision Admissions Track. Submit all secondary application materials including Secondary Application, application fee, letter of recommendation from a premedi cal advisor/s cience faculty memb er (typically a PhD) , and letter of recommendation from an osteop athic or allopathic physician by August 1 5. The letter of intent shou ld indicate all applications to other medi cal schools will be withheld until early decisions are made by CUSOM. Students will be notified no lat er than Septemb er 30. 20 2.6 Guaranteed Interview Process This is only applicable to Campbell Unive rsity undergraduate stud ents wi th: A min and Overall GPA of 3.30 on a 4.0 scale. A minimum MCAT score at the 50th percentile with a preferred score in the 40th percentile or higher in Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems (BBFLS). Applic ation, transcripts from all institution s attended, and MCAT scores submi tted to AACOMAS in June/July of their s enior year. Positive evaluation from the Dean of their undergraduate college. Campbell University undergraduate students meeting the above criteria will be: Guaranteed an interview in Septemb er of their senior year. Guaranteed a decision within two weeks of interviewing. Any offer of a cceptance will be contingent upon maintaining minimum Science and Overall GPA of 3.30 on a 4.0 scale. 2.7 Juris Do ctor and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (JD/DO) Dual Degree Program The Jerry M. Wallac e School of Osteopathic Medicine and the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law of fer a six-year combined program of study (JD/DO Dual Degree Program) leading to awarding of both the Juris Do ctor (JD) degree and the Doctor of Ost eopathic Medicine (DO) d egree upon successful completion of all requirements. One significant benefit of the combined program is the opportunity for students to complete the program in six years, thereby reducing the amount of time it would otherwise take to earn these two d egrees sep arately by one calendar year. Graduates will be poised to obtain significant positions of leadership, administration, and management and will be well equipped to serve as leaders in their professional and civic communities, working to make significant cont ributions at the intersection of law and the medicine. While Campbell JD/DO graduates will most likely practice in just one of the professions, their studies will provide them with exceptional insights in to tod ay's complex medi co-legal issues. This program is rigorous and d emandi ng and enrollm ent will be limited to those students meeting the criteria for both C ampbell Univ ersity School of Law and Campbell Univ ersity School of Osteopathic Medicine Admissions Standards. Students admitted to the JD/DO program complete both degrees in six years typically, beginning their studies in the Campbell Univ ersity School of Law. 21 During the first year, the student would begin law school studies during the Summer Semest er followed by law school classes in fall, spring and summer semest ers. During the secon d year of the combined program, the student would b egin medical studies at Campbell Univ ersity School of Osteopathic Medicine and complete three years in medi cal studies before returning to the law school. As a dual program, it is import ant to note that both the law school and the medi cal school are accredited. North Carolina has six ABA-accredited law schools: 1. Campbell Unive rsity 2. Duke 3. Elon Univ North Ca rolina Central University 5. Univ ersity of North C arolina Chapel Hill 6. Wake Forest Uni versity North Carolina has five LCME- or COC A-accredited medi of North Ca (LCME-accredited) 5. Wake Forest Uni versity (LCME-accredited) CUSOM is the only osteopathic medi cal school in North Carolin a, and the JD/DO program is unique. In North Carolin a, at the time of this Bulletin only Duke Univ ersity has a similar dual-degree program. In the United States, the only other osteop athic medical school with a similar joint d egree program is Rowan Univ ersity in New Jersey. The applicant must apply to both degree programs consecutively and meet all admission requirements outli ned for the CU Juris Doctor (JD) program and the CU Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) program. The applicant will submit a request in writing to both programs to indicate an interest of enrollment in the CU six -year combined JD/DO Dual Degree Program. The applicant will be notified by each admissions office upon acceptance into the dual degree program. 22 Combined JD/DO Degree Curriculum Overview Program Year School School Credits/Year Tally of Hours Earned Summer LAW SCHOOL Law School 5 credits (Law) 5 (Law) 1 LAW SCHOOL First year Law 31 credits (Law) 36 (Law) Summer LAW SCHOOL 8 credits (Law) 44 (Law) 2 LAW SCHOOL ---------- MEDICAL SCHOOL First year CUSOM ---------- 2 credits (Law) 46 (Law) 49.5 (Medicine) Summer LAW SCHOOL 8 credits (Law) 54 (L aw) 49.5 (Medicine) 3 LAW SCHOOL ---------- MEDICAL SCHOOL Second year CUSOM ---------- 2 credits (Law) 56 (Law) 91.5 (Medicine) 4 LAW SCHOOL 30 credits (Law) 86 (Law) 91.5 (Medicine) 5 LAW SCHOOL ---------- MEDICAL SCHOOL Third Year CUSOM ---------- 2 credits (Law) 88 (Law) 211.5 (Medicine) 6 LAW SCHOOL ---------- MEDICAL SCHOOL Fourth Year CUSOM ---------- 2 credits (Law) 90 (Law) 321.5 (Medicine) JD and DO degrees conferred 90 credits (Law) All credits (CUSOM) Additional information concerning the JD/DO Dual Degree Program may be found at: https://law.campbell.edu/learn/academic -program/dual -degree -programs/ 23 2.8 Application Process Step AAC OMAS Application CUSOM participates with other osteop athic colleges in a centralized application processing service called the American Asso ciation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Applic ation Service (AACOMAS). An application may be submitted online at https://aacomas.li aisonc as.com/ or may be obtained by contacting: Watertown, MA 02474 iate the application p appli cants must app ly directly to AACOMAS. AACOMAS is available to the students for the entering class from May throu gh March of the year applying. Detailed instructions can be accessed throu gh: https://aacomas.li aisonc as.com/ Applic ants must r equest all official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended to be mailed directly from the institution(s) to the A ACOMAS office. Students should also ensure all MCAT scores are forwarded dir ectly to AACOMAS from the AAMC. Applic ants who h ave tak en course wo rk and/or have earned a degree from a foreign ins titution must also submit to A ACOM AS an evaluation of their transcripts in a course-by-course fashion from one of the AACOMAS-approved evaluation services. The evaluation service must verify cours e work completed at an institution outside of the US is comparable to a regionally accredited US college or university in a course -by-course fashion. Step 2: CUSOM Secondary Ap plication Process After receipt of the prim ary application, CUSOM performs an initial screening of the application. Applic ants who pass the initial screening may be invited to submit an electronic Secondary Application and supporting documents. Please note CUSOM s creens all prim ary applications and not all applicants will receive the invitation to submit a Secondary Application. 24 Applic ants invited to submit a Secondary Application receive an email notification. This email will contain info rmation and ins tructions on how to complete the Secondary Application and submit the process ing fee. A no n- refundable fee of $50.00 is payable upon submi ssion of the S econdary Application for admission. CUSOM waives this fee if the applicant has an approved AACOMAS f ee waiver documen t. In addition to the Secondary Application and non -refundable processing fee, applicants must submit two required letters of recommendation. Letters of recommendation must be originals on professional or college/university letterhead, and si gned by the evaluator . Letters of r ecommendation may not be written by a relative, including relatives through marriage. CUSOM accepts letters thro ugh AACOM AS, Virtu alEvals, Interfolio and mail. Letters of recommendation which are includ ed as a part of the pre-health committee p acket or letters from an official evaluation collection service (AACOMAS, Interfolio or Virt ualEvals) recognized by CUSOM as a part of their o fficial packet and are accepted without signature or letterhead, as long as the letters are sent directly from the authors to the pre-health committee. If the applicant's school does not utilize a pr e- health committee, a letter must be from a science faculty mem ber (typically a PhD) familiar with the academic work of the applicant. A second letter of recommendation must be from either an osteopathic physician (DO ) or an allopathic physician (MD). Although a letter from an osteopathic physician is not required, it is strongly recommended. While shadowing experience with a DO is not required, applicants who have shadowing experience with an osteopathic physician d emonstrate commitment to the profession and understanding of the practice of osteopathic medicine. CUSOM welcom es additional letters of support or recommendation from those who are acquainted with the student's academic or professional ability. All additional letters of recommendation must be originals on professional or college/university lette rhead, signed by the evaluator and sent directly to the CUSOM Office of Admissions. 2.9 CUSOM Selection Process To be consid ered for an interview, each applicant must meet all the preceding admissions r equirements and Technical Stand ards for admission and have a complete application file, including : the AACOM AS application, a Secondary Application, proof of US Citizenship (Passport or Green Card), a form/letter of recommendation from either an osteop athic or allopathic physician, a recommendation fo rm/letter from a pre-medical or pre-health committee, or science faculty memb er (typically a PhD) and the processing fee. 25 After receipt of all of t hese mat erials, the applicant's file is reviewed by the Office of Admissions to determine eligibility for an interview based on criteria establi shed by the Admissions Com mittee. Each applicant who accepts an invitation to interview is invited to campus where he/she will interview with members of the CUSOM faculty, staff and administration. During the in terview, the applicant's academic history and knowledge may be reviewed as well as the attribut es that demonstr ate the potential to become a caring and compe tent osteop athic physician and fit for CUSOM's Mission. At the conclusion of the interviews, the interviewers submit their recommendation through WebAdMIT for review by the Dir ector of Admission s, and these recommendations are presented and discussed during an Admissions Committee meeting. The Admissions Com mittee reviews each applicant who in terviews with CUSOM and makes a recommendation of either \"accept\" or \"deny\" admission to the Dean. The Dean, a s the Chief Academic Officer, makes all final decisions on candidate status. The Dean decides to grant or de ny acceptance of each candidate. This decision is provid ed to the applicant in a timely mann er, usu ally by email notification within 2-4 weeks of the interview date. A formal letter informing the candidate of the Dean's offer of acceptance is sent at a later date. Intentional misrepresentation or omission of information on any form or records relevant to admissions subjects the applicant to a retraction of an offer for admission, or dismissal of the student in the case the misrepresentation /omission is discov ered after matriculation. CUSOM reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant for any reason it deems suf ficient. Matriculation may be denied to applicants who have failed to maintain a good r ecord of scholastic p erformance or good record of personal conduct between the time of their acceptance and the ir matriculation at CU SOM. Inability to mainta in compliance with educational training technical standards, including required immunizations for healthcare workers, may also r esult in the revocation of acceptance or matriculation. Additionally, applicants found to have screening tests positive for alcohol, prescription me dications withou t a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of No rth Carolina may result in revocation of an offer of acceptance or dismissal in the case that positive tests are discovered after matriculation . Controll ed substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. 26 For example, although the use of m arijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug En forcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of Univ ersity policy. 2.10 Transfer Applicants CUSOM may consid er acceptance of transfer applications. Potential transfer students must submit certified and official transcripts from all post-secondary educational institutions, achieve passing grades in all subjects at the time of transfer, and have an overall 3.2 GPA or hi gher on a 4.0 scale at their current medical school. Transfer stud ents leaving an accredited med ical school must r equest a letter from both the Dean and one Asso ciate Dean from all prior medical schools attend ed. Transfer credit will be dependent on coursework completed by the applicant and will be subj ect to the fin al approval from the D ean based on the recommendation of the CUSOM Admissions Com mittee. Students who have completed two years of course work at another medi cal school will not be consid ered if they have not passed COMLEX-USA Level 1. Credits will only be transferred from COMs accredited by the American Osteopathic Asso ciation's Com mission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or from schools of medi cine accredited by the Liaison Com mittee on Medical Education (LCME). An ad hoc committee appoin ted by the Dean condu cts an evaluation of courses for transfer. Students transferring from another medi cal school to CUSOM will be required to complete at least the last two years at CUSOM prior to graduation. In addition, all transfer students must meet CUSOM's os teopathic manipulative medicine training requirements, including the understanding and knowl edge of osteo pathic philosop hy prior to graduation. Each transfer applicant's materials will be reviewed by the Admissions Committee, and the applicant will be interviewed prior to the approval of a transfer. CUSOM has the right to require additional courses to be taken or clinical rotations added if deemed necessary to ensure the graduates a r e of the highest quality and contributes to CUSOM successful ly meeting its Mission. The Dean determines satisfactory completion of these r equirements. Students must fulfill all requirements for graduation, including p assing COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX -USA and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE licensing examinations, to r eceive the DO degree from CUSO M. 27 2.11 Transfers from Accredited Schools of Medicine Credits are only transferrable from COMs accredited by the American Osteopathic Asso ciation's Com mission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or from schools of medi cine accredited by the Liaison Com mittee on Medical Education (LCME). Students wishing to transfer must have completed all course work with passing grades at the time of the transfer request and have at least a 3.2 or greater GPA on a 4.0 s cale. Each course is evaluated by the O ffice of Academic Affairs as to course content, equival ency, and credit hours prior to any credit being transferred . Transferred credits are only accepted if the student is eligible for readmission to a previous ly attended COCA -accredited COM or LCME -accredited school of medi cine or is currently an osteop athic medical student or allopathic medi cal student with overall good standing at the institution from which they are seeking transfer. Lette rs from the Dean and Asso ciate Dean(s) of the previously attended medi cal school(s ) are required to verify the student is in good standing and is eligible for readmission to their institution. LCME transfer students must complete the CUSOM requirement for osteop athic manipulative medi cine including the demonstration of the requisite knowledge and application of osteop athic phi losop hy prior to graduation. The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, m akes all final decisions on transfer requests. 2.12 International Student Applicants CUSOM may accept students who are US-born citizens, naturalized citizens, green card holde rs, student visa ho lders or are in Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) status. Applic ants need to understand that for in tern and residen cy sites, clearance for the permission to participate in clinical training is determined by the site, not CUS OM. Certain sites h ave more time-consuming clearance processes, such as Veteran s Administration hospitals and other federal facilities. CUSOM cannot guarantee clearance for the permission to participate in clinical training at a specific site, but will work to place students at the necessary sites to complete their educational requi rements. CUSOM policy requires applicants who have completed coursework at foreign institutions be evaluated for U.S. eq uivalence by one of the evaluation se rvices listed on the AACOM w ebsite: http://www.aacom.org The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an institution outside of the US is compa rable to a regional ly-accredited US college or unive rsity in a course -by-course fashion. CUSOM does not a ccept transfer students from international medical schools. 28 2.13 Technical Standards for Admission to CUSOM The requirements to succeed at CUSOM are those necessary to successfully complete the curriculum and to practice osteop athic medi cine with full practice rights. Students must be able to function in a variety of learning and clinical settings, and to quickly, accurately, and consistent ly learn and process data. Osteopathic physicians utilize palpation (clinically appropriate touchi ng) as part of the osteop athic approach to treatment. As p art of the educational process, CUSOM students must be able to tolerate being touched, examined and receive osteopathic manipulation by memb ers of both genders, and to touch, examine and provide osteop athic manipulation to others (of both genders) in order to acquire the ski lls necessary for palpation and examination. This palpation is performed in a professional and appropriate manner. Acquiri ng the skills to palpate and examine patients requires a student to examine partially disrob ed patients of both genders and is mand atory for successful completion of the curriculum at CUSOM. Students are required to p articipate fully as both the examiner and examinee in various clinical laboratory experiences. In Clinical Skills and Osteop athic Manipulative M edicine laboratory experiences, as well as oth er clinical laboratories wh ere ski lls are acquired, students are required to participate in the examination of fellow students of b oth gend ers who may be partially disrob ed. In order to be able to gain appropriate clinical exposure to the regions being examined and osteop athic manipulative techniques to be provid ed, students need to wear attire su ch as shorts and are expected to partially disro be for certain laboratory experiences. Please refer to the Dress Code Policy for additional info rmation. Addit ionally, CUSOM utilizes cadavers in the gross anatomy laboratory. As such, CUSOM students must be able to tolerate working wit h, and touchin g, cadavers. Any de vice capable of capturing still or video images or audio recordings , includi ng cell phones, are not permitted in any laboratory (anatomy , clinical skills, OMM, Simulation), or in any clinical setting, including and not limited to OSCE, standardized patients, Early Clinical Experience, clinical rotations, and the student health clinic. CUSOM students also participate in ultrasound labs and, as such, will be required to perform ultrasound examination of fellow studen ts of both genders who may be partially disrob ed. These are requirements for all students, regardless of cultural or religious beliefs, in order for the student to acquire the skills necessary to practice osteo pathic medicine. Students who have any concern regarding these requirements should discuss them with the Director of Admissions prior to applying. 29 CUSOM will make reasonable accommodations as required by law for students whose disabili ties will not prevent them from successful ly completing the entire CUSOM curriculum and graduating as an ost eopathic physician. Students, however, are required to fun ction with indep endence and perform at all skill levels described below which CUSOM holds as mand atory for the safe and effective practice of os teopathic medicine. CUSOM is committed to p atient sa fety and assuring a safe and effective environment that do es not place patients, students, or others at risk. Each Technical Stand ard has been chosen from stand ards osteop athic physicians deem necessary for the safe and effective practice of osteop athic medi cine. Appl icants who do not meet the Technical Standards should not apply to CUSOM. Students / Applicants must possess the abilities and skills in the following five areas: 1. Observation The student must be able to visual ly obs erve laboratory demonst rations, microscopic t issue with the aid of the m icroscope, and electronic i mages used in classroom presentations and labo ratory demonstr ations. The student must be able to visually and accurately obs erve p hysical signs and symptoms of a patient used in diagnosis and clinical man agement. The use of a trained intermedi ary in such cases would compromise performance, as it would be medi ated by another individual 's power of selection, observation, and experience. Observation requires the fu nctional use of vis ion and somatic sensations and, is oft en enhanced by the sense of smell. 2. Communication The student must be able to commun icate effectively in English, as the curriculum and clinical experiences are offered exclusively in English. Students are encouraged to learn other languages for medical communication; however, the entire curriculum and all assessment exercises are provided in English. CUSOM requires the functional ability to speak, hear, and observe patients in order to elicit accurate medi cal information. The student must be able to both describe changes in mood, activity, postur e, and other p hysical characteristics and to pe rceive non verbal commun ication. The student must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in verbal and w ritten form. The stude nt must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently with patients and with all memb ers of the h ealthcare team in order to successful ly complete the curriculum. 30 3. Motor The student must h ave sufficient motor function to gather info rmation from patients by palpation, percussion, and other diagnostic measures. The student must have suf ficient motor function to carry out maneuvers of general and emergent care and of osteop athic manipulation. Examples of emergent motor functions includ e, but are not limited to, cardiopu lmona ry resuscitation, administration of intravenous fluids cations, management of an obstru cted airway, hemorrhage control, wound closure by suturing , and obstetrical deliveries. In addition, osteop athic manipulation requires the use of extremities in p alpation, posit ioning, and carrying out maneuvers of manipulation. These actions r equire fine and gross motor control, as well as the sense of touch and adequate vision for insp ection. Stud ents must be able to generate suf ficient force, and be able to receive these same forces, to successful ly learn and provide effective osteo pathic manipulative treatments for all techniques which include, but are not limited to, muscle energy, counte rstrain, Still technique, and high-velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) taught in the curriculu m. 4. Intellectual The student must have the ability to reason, calculate, analyze, measure, and synthesi ze information delivered in a variety of formats, including, but not limited to, electroni c/digital sources, EKGs, medi cal images and similar modali ties. The student must be able to compr ehend, learn, synthesi ze, and recall a large amount of information without assistance, to successful ly complete the curriculum. The student must be able to compr ehend and understand/apply three- dimension al and s patial relationships to su ccessful ly complete the curriculum and apply fund ament al concepts to the provision of patient care. The student must be able to acquire and synthesi ze knowl edge through various types of learning mat erials and fo rmats utilized in the CUSO M curriculum. In addition, students must be able to perform pattern recognition, recall information, identify and disc riminate important information, probl em solve, calculate and make decisions in timed situations and in the p resence of noise and dis tractions. The above intellectual abilities are essential, as students and graduates are expected and r equired to perform pattern re cognition, immedi ate re call of learned material, disc rimination to elicit important information, probl em solving, and decision- making in the emergent diagnosis and treatment of patients. Students must be able to recall and apply important information to generate a differential diagnosis and to develop a the rapeutic management for emergent conditions. This type of demonstr ated intellectual ability must be performed in a rapid and time-efficient mann er in order to provide appropriate care to patients with emergent conditions. 31 It is common for emergent situations to occur in the presence of visual ly distracting and noisy environme nts. Such emergent situations includ e, but are not limited to, cardiopulmon ary compromise, cardiopulmon ary resuscitation, obstetrical and n eonatal emergencies, trauma pr esentations, toxic exposures, shock, and hemorrhage. 5. Behavioral a nd Social Attributes The student must possess the emotional health needed for full use of his/her intelle ctual capabilities at all times. The emotional health required for effective communication and for pro fessional, matu re, sensitive, and compassionate patient/physician or patient/student r elationships must be p resent. Students must be able to function effectively under stress and with physically taxing wo rkloads, such as during lectures, labs, written and practical examinations, and clinical rotations. Students must have the emotional stabil ity and motivation to deliver patient care and to make emergent de cisions at all times. The ability to adapt to changing environme nts and stressful situations and to display compassion and integrity, while maintaining the necessary intellectual capacity to care for patients, is one evaluated during the interview process and throughout the student's progress in the medi cal school curriculum. An ability to demonstr ate the emotional health necessary for the delivery of quality and safe medical care is mand atory thro ughout medi cal school. CUSOM consid ers drug and alcohol addiction or abuse a significant risk factor for providing uns afe patient care and poor p atient outcom es. As su ch, CUSOM has developed clear policies re garding alcohol and substance abuse whi ch are described elsewhere in this Bul letin. Applicants must identify to the Office of Admissions all areas where there is any question regarding their ability to meet these Technical Standards. If an applicant has a question about his/her ability to me et the minimal Technical Stand ards, the applicant is required to notify the Office of Admissions in advance of applying. An offer of acceptance may be rescinded should an accepted applicant be found to not be able to me et the Technical Stand ards. For matriculated stude nts, inabil ity to maintain compliance with educational training Te chnical Standards m ay result in dismissal from t he program. 32 If an applicant signs that he/she me ets the minimum health requirements, including required i mmunization standards, and Te chnical Standards for admission, but it is discovered after matriculation that the student signed knowing he/she did not meet these minimum standards, then the student may receive sanctions up to and including dismissal from the program. 2.14 Americans with Disabilities Act CUSOM operates in compliance with the Americans with Dis abilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), both as amend ed, to assure that its facilities, programs and student policies are accessible to ind ividuals with disabili ties. Applicants and students with specific needs should contact the Director of Student Affairs. 2.15 CUSOM Matriculation and Enrollment Policies All accepted stud ents must meet the following requirements pri or to matriculation: Health, Vaccine, and Immunizations Requirements All deposited CUSOM students are required to submit the following to the Office of Clinical Affairs: 1. Compl eted medical history form 2. Proof of all CUSOM immunization requirements 3. Completed controlled substance screen (described below) 4. Completed physical examination condu cted by a licensed physician using the appropriate CUSOM form Students must obtain all CUSOM -required immunizations and corresponding titers, prior to matriculation and remain compliant with all immunization requirements throu gh graduation in order to complete all required supervised clinical practice experiences in the CUSOM curriculum. Students who fail to comply with this requirement by the end of Block 1 will be refer red to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Please refer to the CUSOM Immuni zation Policy for a complete description of all immunization requirements. A copy of this policy is available in the O ffice of Stud ent Affairs. Entering MS -1 (first year) students who have not completed all CUSOM immunization requirements by the end of Block 1 will not be permitted to participate in the White Coat ceremony and will be called to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS ) Committee for review and adjudication as delineated in Section 5.10 of the Academic Bulletin. 33 In addition, non -compliance with CUSOM Immunization Requirements will result in inability to participate in any clinical experiences (including but not limited to standardized patient OSCEs, early clinical experiences, and clinical rotations). This may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course or clinical rotation, academic probation, Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committ ee hearing, delay in graduation, or even dismissal from the program. All students must provide written document ation utilizing the AAMC Standardized Immunization Form (completed and signed by their health care provi der or institutional representative) verifying that all CUSOM -required immunization and titer requirements, as listed b elow, and in accordance with the CDC Guid elines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ adults/rec-vac/hcw.htm l), have ng: Diphthe ria, Pe rtussis and Tetanus o All s tudents must submit document ation (physician signature or vaccination record) of immunization with a *Td ap boost er (Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae) since the year 2005. o Following the Tdap boo ster, proof of a Td routine boost er is required every ten (10) years TB test (prior to matriculation and again prior to each year of clinical rotations) o There are two (2) acceptable methods for TB screening and all students must provide document ation of the results from O NE of the two methods: A two -step tub erculin skin test ( TST) An Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA s) blood test o The TB test mu st be obt ained within six (6) months of m atriculation Hepatitis B virus (quantitative titer) o Studen ts must provide d ates and verification (vaccination r ecord) of completing a Hepatitis B vaccination s eries consist ing of three (3) hepatitis B in jections o In addition, ve rification of quantitative antibody titers demonstr ating immunity to hep atitis B must be provided Students who do not sh ow im munity followi ng the vaccination series should r efer to the Immunization Pol icy for further steps MMR: Measles (Rubeola), Mump s and Rubella o Students must provide d ates and verification (vaccination r ecord) of two (2) MMR vaccinations, o ccurring at least 28 d ays apart If the stud ent is able to p rovide an immunization record or physician si gnature verifying the dates of these two ( 2) vaccinations, no titer will be required 34 o Students un able to p rovide im munization records or physician signature v erifying completion of the MMR series have two ( 2) options: Repeat the MMR series of two ( 2) vaccinations at least 28 days apart and provide document ation verifying completion of the series Obtain titers for measles, mumps, and rubella Varicella (quantitative titer by the time of matriculation) Influenza vaccination every year In some situations, clinical sites m ay have additional immunization requirements above those required by CUS OM. CUSOM do es not w aive immunization or student health requirements for religious, medical or personal preferences. Entering MS -1 (first year) students who have not completed all CUSOM immunization requirements by the end of Block 1 will not be permitted to participate in the White Coat C eremon y and will be called to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review and adjudication as delineated in Section 5.10 of the Academic Bulletin. In addition, non -compliance with CUSOM Immunization Requirements will result in inability to participate in any clinical experiences (including but not limited to standardized patient OSCEs, early clinical experiences, and clinical rotations). This may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course or clinical rotation, academic probation, Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee hearing, delay in graduation, or even dismissal from the program. CUSOM m ay revise the immunization requirements at any time as deemed necessary, and all students wi ll be required to comp ly with any subs equent changes. National Background Checks CUSOM applicants are required to self-disclos e any charges, arrests or convictions including misdemeanors, felonies, deferred adjudications, traffic violations, military non -judicial punishment, courts martial, and general or less- than-honorable disch arge from the m with the understanding that non-disclosur e/falsification of any previous or pending Offenses may result in the revocation of the offer of admission. If a student has any Offenses pending final adjudication at any time during the application process, at the time of matriculation , or following matriculation it is the student's immediately info rm CUSOM. 35 Addit ionally, in respon se to requirements in the professional practice environm ent, and to minimize the risk to patients, a background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation, and on any student whose actions could po tentially be considered a risk to o thers at any time. Should any Offenses, including deferred adjudications occur after matriculation, (1) the student must report the Offenses to the Director of Student Affairs within thirty (30) d ays of the incident, or (2) if Offenses occu rring prior to matriculation are not reported to CUSOM at the time of application but a re subsequently discov ered following matriculation, the Offense will be reviewed pursuant to the Procedures for Non -Academic Misconduct under Section 5.10 . A national background check is done on each student prior to the start of clinical rotations, and all results are shared with the clinical sites. By mat riculating to CUSOM, the student agrees that CUSOM will share background check information in full with the student 's respective clinical site(s). Addit ional national background checks may be performed at the discretion of CUSOM or its pa rtnering institutions before accepting a student into a clinical rotation. National background checks may also be required at any time deemed appropriate by CUSOM. Discovery of any previous ly non-reported Offense(s) may lead to referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committ ee and possible s anctions, up to and including dismissal from the program . CUSOM has no control over the content of third-party background checks. Even expung ed records may appear on these background checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rot ations, acceptance into residen cy pr ograms, future licensing, specialty bo ard certification, and/or employment oppo rtunities. If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inabil ity to pass background check requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements . In addition, and as such, they will be referred to the APPS committee for possible s anctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program . A student with any Offenses is encouraged to contact the licensure boards in the state of in tended practice to ensure the aforementioned Offense will not inhibit the ability to ob tain a m edical license upon g raduation. 36 All current or former students returning f rom an approved extended period away from CUSOM, such as a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, must notify C USOM in writing of any Offenses, includi ng deferred adjudications, at least sixty (60) d ays prior to the anticipated return date. An Offense occurring less than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date must be reported to the Director of Student Affairs wi thin 24 hours of the Offense. Non-disclosure or falsification of any info rmation related to an Offense may result in the revocation of the offer to return to CUSOM, or if already returned to CUSO M, referral to the APPS Com mittee for possible sanctions up to, and includin g, dismissal from the program. CUSOM retains the right to relinquish the seat of any current or former student returni ng from an extended absence if they have been crimin ally charged or convict ed of a misdemeanor, felony, or traffic violation. Students who have already resumed classes following an extended absence, who have been or are criminally charged or convict ed of a misdemeanor, felony, or traffic violation will be referred to the APPS Committee for s anctions up to, and including, dismissal from the pr ogram. As future physicians, students are held to a high standard of professionalism, ethics and hono r, and CUSOM h as a duty to prot ect the public from po tential harm by its students. All current or former students returni ng from an approved period away from CUSO M, such as a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Secondary Applic ation, national background check, and controll ed subst ance screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a psychiatric or medical evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students who do n ot return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will have to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. Driver's Li cense As the clinical campus system of CUSOM is widespread across the states of North and South C arolin a, all applicants must provide evidence of a v alid driver's license to allow for tr avel to clinical rotations. Students may have to drive up to an hour from the pr emier educational partner of t heir respective regional site for an assigned rotation. Therefore, eviden ce of a valid driver's license must be provid ed to the Office of Student A ffairs by the end of the first year of medi cal school. Failure to provide eviden ce of this item by the end of the first year of medical school may prevent the student from being promoted to the second year of medical school. 37 Basic Life Support Skills CUSOM students are required to have Basic Life Suppo rt (BLS) training pri or to mat riculation and must maintain active certification through graduation. Each student must provide a copy of their American Heart Association CPR card, documenting current BLS for Healthcare Provid ers certification, to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to matriculation. CUSOM only accepts BLS for Healthcare Provid er courses authori zed by the American Heart Asso ciation. Failure to provide evidence of appropriate certification m ay result in revocation of an offer of acceptance. Controlled Substance Screening In response to requirements in the pro fessional practice environ ment and to minimize the risk to patients, a controlled substance screening must be completed by all accepted applicants prior to matriculation. This screening must meet CUSOM's stand ards and be condu cted by an agency approved by CUSOM. Controll ed substance screening results are v iewed in l ight of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal or controll ed subs tances. Depending on the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the stud ent's acceptance may be rescinded. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Ag ency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide opti mal care to h is or h er patients. As such, the use of m arijuana in any form is a viol ation of Univ ersity policy. By signing the Attestation confirming that students have read and acknowl edge compliance with the pr ecepts contain ed in the CUSOM Academic Bulletin, each applicant to CUSOM promises he/she is not currently usin g, and that he/she will not use while a CUSOM student, any products or substances in any mann er which are illegal in the st ate of North Carolin a. CUSOM has no control over the content of third-party background checks, which may include charges of driving under the influ ence. Even expung ed records may appear on these checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses, even Offenses which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, acceptance into residen cy programs, future licensing, specialty bo ard certification, and/or employment oppo rtunities. 38 A random controll ed substance screening is required prior to starting clinical rotations, and all results are shared with the clinical sites. Addit ional screenings may be required, at any time, at the discretion of CUSOM or partnering- institutions. By matriculating to CUSOM, the student agrees that CUSOM may share controll ed subs tance screening results as deemed n ecessary. If either of the following events occur, the matter will be referred for review in accordance with the Procedures for Non -Academic Misconduct under Section 5.10: Any substance-related incident which occurs b e f o r e o r after matriculation, includin g, but not l imited to, charges/arrests for Driving Under the Influence, must be reported by the student to the CUSOM Office of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the o ccurrence. If the controlled substance screening test result is posit ive (i.e. eviden ce of a controll ed substance) or shows other abnorm alities includin g, but not limited, to excessively diluted urine. Transcripts All CUSOM students are required to provide official transcripts from all colleges and unive rsities attended if they have course work that was not includ ed or degree(s) not conferred with the transcripts submi tted throu gh AACOMAS. All transcripts are includ ed in the student 's original AAC OMAS application so students are only required to provide CUSOM official transcripts from coursework completed and degree(s) conferred after the AACOMAS application w as sub mitted. All students must submit all required paperwork by the published deadlines. Failure to submit information could result in an offer of admission b eing rescinded. Falsification of any do cument or omission of any pertinent information may result in dis missal from the program if dis covered after matriculation. 39 2.16 Early Acceptance Program for Medicine Campbell Univ ersity's Jerry M.

The CUBIT-SOM will use policies outlined in the Academic Bulletin as a framework for its recomme ndations; however, the team reserves the right to utilize creativity to find the most appropriate solution as long as it falls in line with the policies of Campbell University and the School of Osteopathic Medicine. All discussions and deliberations of the CUBIT-SOM shall be in compliance with the Family Educational Rig hts and Privacy Act. 53 After-Care Process If the CUBIT-SOM decision is upheld or accepted by the student, the following pro cedures will occur: MS-1 and M S-2 students will be followed by the Office of Stud ent Affairs at CUSOM and MS -3 and MS -4 students w ill be followed by the respective Regional Dean or DSME, as appropriate, and consti tuent coordinato rs o Given the CUBIT-SOM recommendations, Student A ffairs will make contact to ascertain if the st udent is in complian ce Depending on the recommendations, if the student is not in compliance (e.g., missing required appoin tments), they are given one warning and attempt to comp ly with the recommendations If the student is found in non-compliance again, the CUBIT-SOM will be not ified and will re-examine the case prior to the end of the Blo ck 4.6 Controlled Substance Screening Protocol Controll ed substance screening of learners and sta ff memb ers is mandatory at most healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care. As such, a controll ed substance screening test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit subst ances, prescription me dications withou t a valid pr escription, or substances, which are illegal in the state of No rth Carolin a, is required before mat riculation into CUSOM, and again before the start of Year Three of the program . Addit ional screening or confirmato ry tests m ay be required as determined by CUSOM or the clinical training sites. CUSOM reserves the right to require controll ed substance testing or a psychiatric evaluation on any student wh en there is an incident of erratic or unusual behavior, or there is a reasonable concern due to a stud ent's b ehavior, appearance or performance. Refusal or failure to submit to testing may result in disciplina ry action up to, and includin g, dis missal from the program. Students found to have screening tests posit ive for alcohol, illicit substances, and controlled substances (defined as a drug or substance that is listed in Schedules I through V of the Federal Control led Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812 )) or prescription medi cations without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplina ry action up to, and includin g, dismissal. Please note this also includ es substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolin a, but which may be legal in other states. For example, although the use of m arijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug En forcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of Un iversity policy. 54 CUSOM will provide clinical rotation sites with a copy of the results of any controll ed subs tance screening performed on students prior to, and for the duration of, their placement at the site. By matriculating at CUSOM, students grant CUSOM the right to share this information as deemed appropriate. Clinical education sites may set their own standards in regards to who they will permit to participate in clinical rotations based on the results of the subst ance abuse screening or require students undergo further testing. CUSOM has no control over the content of third-party background checks, which may include charges of Driving Under the Influence. Even expunged records may appear on these checks. Background checks revealing prior crimin al activity, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rot ations, acceptance into residency programs, future licensing, specialty b oard certification, or employment oppo rtunities. If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inabil ity to pass controlled substance testing requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements . In addition, and as such, they will be referred to the APPS committee for possible s anctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program . Prior to starting Year 3: Students must have the controll ed substance screening sample collected at a facility approved by CUSOM. If the test result is posit ive or shows other abnormalities, such as but not limited to excessively dilute urin e, the Dean will appoint an ad hoc subcommittee, a subset of the CUSOM AP PS Com mittee, to review the information and make a recommendation to the D ean regarding the appropriate action. Depending on the decision, the student's advancement to the third year of the curriculum (clinical rotations) may be delayed based on the results. Results of controll ed substance screenings are ma de available to clinical rotation sites. By matriculating at CUSOM, students grant CUSOM the right to share this information as deemed appropriate. All controll ed substance screening tests are maintain ed in a secure location to ensure confidentiality. Rout ine access to this information is limited to the Director of Student Affairs, the Associ ate D ean for Cl inical Affairs, the CUSOM Dean (or Vi ce Dean as the Dean's designee), and the Campbell Univ ersity General Couns el. Results from posit ive controll ed substance screens are shared with the Director of Behavioral Health in the event the student r equires dru g/alcohol couns eling. The entire cost of any testing is the respons ibility of the student. 55 If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inabil ity to pass controlled substance testing requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements . In addition, and as such, they will be referred to the APPS committee for possible s anctions, up to, and including, dismissal from the program . 4.7 Infection Control Students exposed to infectious diseases should consult the C ampbell Univ ersity's Health Center (910) 893-1560 for information regarding appropriate evaluation, testing or treatment. Students presenting with signs or symptoms of infectious or communicable dise ase should consult with Campbell Univ ersity's Health Center or the infection control of fice at the clinical site to determine if it is safe for them to continue providing care, and if not, wh en it is safe to resume. Standard Precautions The C enters for Dis ease Control (CDC) h as developed p recautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious disease in healthcare settings. These include stand ard precautions for all patient care and transmission-based precautions for situations in which specific inf ections are identif ied or suspe cted. A comprehensive d escription of these precautions are found on the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/index.html Stand ard precautions make use of common-sense pr actices and p ersonal protective equipment to protect healthcare provid ers from infection and pr event the spread of infection from patient to patient; examples includ e, but are not limited to, the followin g: Handwashing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) After touching blood, b ody fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items Immediately after removing gloves Between patient contact Comp rehensive CDC guidelines for hand hygiene in healthcare settings are found at: https:/ /www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/providers/ind ex.html Gloves For contact with blood, body fluids, secretions and contaminated items For contact with mucous membranes and non-intact skin 56 Masks, goggles, face masks Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose and mouth when contact with blood or bo dy fluids is likely Gowns Protect skin from blood or body fluid contact Prevent soiling of clothing during procedures that may involve contact with blood or body fluid Linen Handle soiled linen as to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes Do not pre-rinse soiled linens in patient care areas Patient care equipment Handle soiled equipm ent in a mann er to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes and to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment Clean reusable equipment prior to reuse Environmental cleaning Routinely care, clean and disin fect equipment and furnishi ngs in patient care areas Sharps Avoid recapping used needles Avoid removi ng used needles from disposable syringes Avoid bending, breaking or mani pulating used needles by hand Place used sharps in puncture-resistant containers Addition al information is found at: https:/ /www.cdc.gov/sharpssafety/ Patient resuscitation Use mouthpieces, resuscitation bags or other ventilation devices to avoid mouth- to-mouth resuscitation Patient placement Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms 57 Needle sticks Incidents involving needle sticks and potential exposure to blood -borne pathogens require i mmedi ate action to protect a student's health and safety. CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood -borne infectious dis ease follow ing an exposure are found at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html If a student sus tains a needle stick or is exposed to infectious m aterials s/he shoul d: Immediately w ash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous me mbranes). Immediately notify the clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistance. Call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center or the occupational health clinic or area of the clinical facility designated for treating needle stick exposu res. Time ly consultation concerning appropriate tests, risk- assessment couns eling and chemoprophylaxis decisions are critical. Be evaluated immediately following an exposure event to determine HIV post-exposure prophylaxis is appropriate. HIV post-exposure prophylaxis is most effective when initiated within the first few hours following an exposure so it is critical that students are evaluated in a timely manner . This will ensure that if post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated, then it is started as early as possible in order to increase its effectiveness. Proceed immediately to the Emergency Department for evaluation if exposure has occurred after normal business hours, or are for any other reason unable to be evaluated at one of the above locations. Complete an incident report from the facility in which the incident occurred and have a copy of the report sent to the Campbell University's Health Center (PO Box: 565, 129 T.T. Lanier St., Buies Creek, NC 27506). Send treatment and testing bills to the student's insurance company. Students are responsible for all costs not covered by their insurance. CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood borne infectious dis ease follow ing an exposure are found at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post-Exposu re Prophylaxis Ho tline e, (888) 448-4911, 11am- 8pm Eastern, seven days per week to provide guidance in m anaging exposures. For exposures or questions that occur outside these hours, a PEP Quick Guide for Occupational Exposures is available at their website: http://nccc.ucsf.edu/clinician -consultation/pep -post-exposure -prophylaxis/ 58 pr evention of inf ection transmission in health care settings are found at the following websites and should be reviewed carefully before participating in any patient care activities: https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/outpatient/ guide.pdf https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/b asics/index.html Medical Emergencies The safety of students, faculty, staff and visitors to the Health Science Campus is of utmost concern and the utilization of a standard approach to medical emergencies will ensure the provi sion of the most timely, efficient , and appropriate care in a medical emergency. As a school of osteopathic medicine, CUSOM's focus and expertise is in th e domain of medical education. While many capable and compassionate health care providers are presen t on our campus on any given day, their role in this setting is as educators and administrators rather than as clinicians. While able to render immediate assistance in a life -threatening emergency, they should not be consulted to make treatment or disposi tion recommendations in non -emergent situations. Anyone suffering from a medical emergency must be evaluated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) which is activated by dialing 9 -1-1. If anyone on the Health Science Campus suffers from a medical emergency, the person of first contact with the patient should dial 911 immediately to summon EMS assistance. Following activation of the EMS system, security must be notified of the situation and will also be responsible for contacting EMS to confirm the need for emergency response as well as to provide them with more detailed information regarding the location of the patient and instructions for appropriate access to the building. Security will complete, and maintain, an incident report form for any situation in which EMS is called to provide assistance, even if the patient ultimately refuses treatment and/or transport. Medical Emergency Identified Call 911 Contact CUSOM Security Contact EMS 1. Confirm Request for Assistance 2. Provide Directions to PatientComplete Medical Incident Report Form 59 Incident Reporting If a student suffers an accident resulting in an injury during a CUSOM activity while on campus, the student must complete an incid ent report, and call/go to the C ampbell Univ ersity's Health Center for consultation and assistance. Incident reports can be obtained from Campbell Univ ersity's Health Center (910) 893-1560. If the accident occurs at a clinical training facility, that facility's incident report form should be completed, and the clinical superviso r, Director of Student Medical Edu cation or Dir ector of Medical Education, the R egional Dean and the CUSOM Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs should be contacted for assistance. A copy of the facility's incid ent report must be sent to: Campbell Student Health Services PO Box: 565 129 T.T. Lanier St. Buies Cr eek, NC 27506 4.8 OSHA and HIPAA Training CUSOM is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of all patient h ealth information as required by the Health Insurance Portability and A ccountabil ity Act (HIPAA). As such, all students are required to complete HIPAA training each academic year. To support our commitment to patient confid entiality, CUSOM and its clinic al partners have developed processes to ensures that the appropriate steps are taken to verify the identi ty and authority of individuals and entities requesting prot ected health information, as required under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.514 (h) and other applicable f ederal, state, and/or l ocal laws and re gulation s. Addit ionally, CUSOM ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems containing electronic protected health information by implem enting pol icies to pr event, det ect, mitigate, and correct security violations. CUSOM is in compliance with the US Department of Health and Hum an Services' Privacy Rule as it applies to the creation, collection, use or discl osure of all individual health info rmation ( whether identifiable or not) (\"Information\") in connection with CUSO M. In addition, CUSOM requir es that all students who h ave contact with patients receive OSHA Blood-Borne Pathogens (BBP) training which addresses the prevention of transmission of communicable pathoge ns. Students compl ete OSHA training annually during which time they review OS HA rul es, requirements, appropriate plans and practices. 60 CUSOM h as the following plans in pl ace: Blood-borne Pathogen Exposure Plan Infectious Waste Management Plan Biohazard Waste Management Plan The intent of these plans is to prevent blood borne infections by eliminating or minimizing employees and students exposure to blood, blood products, and other potential ly infectious mat erials. 4.9 Professional Liability Insurance Students are covered by professional liability insurance for incidents involving patients, which occur during participation in their clinical training curriculum. Any incidents that occur in the clinical interaction with patients must be report ed to the clinical supervisor on-site, the R egional Dean, the Asso ciate Dean for ersity General Couns O ffice 27506, (910) 893-1217. 4.10 Exercise and CUSOM students have access to all Campbell Univ ersity recreational facilities, including the Student Fitness Center, Aquatic Center, running and walking track, Keith Hills Golf Cours e, tennis courts, Carter Gym, cross count ry cours e, disc golf course and other recreational facilities.

It is the respons ibility of the student to support the stand ards of student conduct and it is reasonable to expect this of all students attending CUSO M. All CUSOM students have the rights and obligations of other citizens and measure the urg ency of these obligations in the light of respons ibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM students speak or act as private citizens, they must avoid c reating the imp ression of sp eaking or a cting for their School or the Univ ersity. As such, they should not identify themselves as CUSOM students when posting comments or material on websites, social media, or other forms of communication without the express perm ission of the Dean. As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further publ ic understanding of ac ademic freedom. 70 Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM student, I will... Be guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of all human life; Pursue the advancement of knowl edge and recognize the special responsibiliti es placed upon me; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly competence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical standards; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster honest academic condu ct and ensure student evaluations reflect the student's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction between students and faculty, students and administ ration, and students and staff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free inquiry of associates' exchange of ideas and show respect for the opinions of others; Give due regard to the paramoun t responsibiliti es within the institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. Respect for Patients CUSOM takes the utmost care to ensure patient respect and confid entiality. As osteop athic medi cal students, students must demonstr ate respect for patients throu gh appropriate language and behavior, includi ng th at which is non- threatening and non- judgment al. This respect extends to interactions with standardized patients, including simulated patients, during all OSCE, clinical skills, OMM, and simulation experiences/labs. In order to maintain professional relationships with patients and their f amilies, patient priva cy and modes ty will be respected du ring history taking, physical examinations, and any other contact. It is critical for students to be truth ful and not in tentionally mislead or give false information. Students should avoid disclos ing info rmation to a patient that only the patient's physician should reveal. Students should always, or at the request of the patient, consult more experienced mem bers of the medi cal team regarding patient care. Respect for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personnel, and Community Students will respect faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hospital personn el, guests, and memb ers of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by pun ctuality in relationsh ips with patients and peers, prompt 71 execution of reasonable ins tructions, and deference to those with superior know ledge, experience or capabilities. Students should express views in a calm and respectful manner w hen in disa greement with another individual, understanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached. Respect for Self All students should uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and morals in their d aily conduct. Respect for Laws, Policies and Regulations Students must respect and obey the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the Univ ersity and the lo cal commun ity, state and federal government. 4.22 Chaperoned Physical Exam Policy Purpose The purpose of this policy is to define the need for, and usage of, chaperones in patient care, simulation, and teaching environ ments of Campbell Univ ersity and its affiliated sites. Patient/learner trust cannot be maintained without a basic understanding of the limits and respons ibilities of the professional's role. The valued human experience of the p hysician-patient relationship is damaged when there is either confusion re garding professional roles and behavior or clear lack of integrity that allows s exual exploitation and harm. Sexual impropriety may comprise behavior, gestures, or expressions that are seductive, sexually suggestive, disrespectful of patient privacy, or sexually demeaning to a p atient, that may include, but are not limited to: 1. Neglecting to employ appropr iate disrobing or draping practices respecting the patient's privacy, or deliberately watching a patient dress or undress; 2. Subjecting a patient to an intimate examination in the presence of medi cal students or other parties without the p atient's informed consent or in the event such info rmed consent has b een withd rawn; 3. Examination or touching of genital muco sal areas without the use of gloves; 4. Inapp ropriate comments about or to the patient, including but not limited to, making s exual comments about a patient's body or underclothing, making s exualized or sexually demeaning comments to a patient, critici zing the p atient's sexual orientation, or making comments about potential sexual performance during an examination; 72 5. Using the physician-patient relationship to solicit a date or romantic relationship; 6. Initiation by the physician of conversation regarding the sexual probl ems, pr eferences, or fantasi es of the physician; 7. Performi ng an intimate examination or consultation without clinical justification; 8. Performi ng an intimate examination or consultat ion without explaining to the p atient the need for such examination or consultation even when the examination or consultation is pertinent to the issue of sexual function or dysfunction; and/or 9. Requesting details of sexual history or sexual likes or dislikes when not clinically indicated for the type of examination or consultation. Policy Medical students at any level of training are held to the same ethical standards as establi shed by the medi cal profession. Efforts to provide a comfortable and consid erate atmosph ere for the patient and the le arner are part of respecting patients' dignity. These efforts may include, but are not limited to, providing appropriate gowns, priv ate facilities for undressing, sensitive use of draping, and clearly explaining various components of the physical examination. Having chaperones present during the physical exam can also help prevent m isund erstandings between patient and l earner or health care provider. CUSOM students and faculty should: 1. Adhere to a policy that patients are free to request a chaperone during the medi cal encounter and ensure that the policy is clearly communicated to patients. 2. Always honor a patient's request to have a chaperone. 3. Never perform invasive or sensitive exams such as breast, pelvic, rectal, and genitourin ary exams without the p resence of an authori zed chaperone. 4. Have an authori zed memb er of the health care team serve as a chaperone. Physicians should establi sh clear expectations that chaperones will uphold pro fessional standards of privacy and confid entiality. 5. Use a chaperone even when a patient's trusted companion or family memb er is pr esent. 6. Provide oppo rtunity for private conversation with the patient without the chaperone present. Physicians should minimize inquiries or history taking of a sensitive n ature during a chaperoned examination. 7. Have chaperones available regardless of the physician's gender. 73 8. Inform the patient that an appropriate staff member can act as a chaperone if required and where possible this will be a staff member of the same gender as the patient. 9. Respect that the patient has the right, at all times, to decline a particular p erson as chaperone. 10. Utilize the learning or simulation environme nt in a mann er consistent with r especting patient pri vacy. 11. Utilize same gender models for sensitive physical exam demonstr ations wh enever possible (cardiac exam, sa cral exam, et c...). 12. Perform Osteopathic Manual Manipulation (OMM) only on subjects or patients who are adequately clothed to cov er all sensitive areas. 13. Not p erform OMM as an invasive procedure. 14. Respect the right of a patient participating in an educational activity (such as, but not limited to OMM lab, ultrasound lab, clinical skills) to refuse any component of the physical exam. 15. Respect the right of a child volun teer in the OMM or Clinical Skills lab to refuse any component of a physical exam, even if approval to perform the exam has been given by the parent. Children participating in OMM or Clinical Skills labs must never be forcefully subjected to any physical exam, even if the exam is not consid ered sensitive in n ature. Family members or friends of the patient should not be expected to undertake any fo rmal chaperone role. There is a risk of inadvertent breaches of confid entiality and embarrassment if friends or relatives are chaperones, and they are best avoided unless there is no alternative than postponing an immedi ately necessary physical examination. Th ere is also the possibility of collusion between the patient and friend/ relative /caregiver to conspire where any complaint of abuse is made. Medical students must not condu ct any intimate examination unsup ervised even if the patient provi des permission for them to proceed with the examination without a chaperone. Medical students cannot act as a chaperone to their clinical partner (another medi cal student) or another health care provid er for intimate examinations. It is important that students seek verbal consent from patients for any form of examination. For intimate examinations, informed consent is particularly important. Intimate examinations include the followin g: Vaginal examination Rectal examination External genitalia examination Breast examination Any other examination that might embarrass patients throu gh the removal of clothes, particularly those examinations that might expose external genitalia or breasts 74 Procedure Com municate the chaperone protocol to patients by prominent notice through conversation with the patient. Honor all requests for a chaperone. Utilize private facilities for undressing, incorporate sensitive use of draping, and provide clear explanations on the various components of the physical examination to be performed. o The nature of the procedure/examination should be explain ed o The purpose of the procedure/examination should be clearly stated, (e.g. \"it is to help me learn how to...\") o There should be an explanation, where relevant, of what will happen to the information collected (e.g., \"I will record my findin gs in the medi cal notes... \") o The patient's und erstanding and acceptance of the procedure/examination should be assess ed and do cumented Utilize chaperones on a consistent b asis, particularly for intimate examinations and those that may be constr ued as such regardless of physician or learner's gender. When a chaperone is present, keep patient inquiries of a sensitive nature to a minimum. Provide a separate oppo rtunity for a private conversation between the patient and the physician, in order to protect the patient's personal health info rmation (PHI). Provide an authori zed health pro fessional to s erve as the chaperone whenever possibl e. During a rectal/vaginal examination, sur gical gloves mu st be worn. Glov es act as a barrier and thus help to maintain the clinical natu re of the exam. Throughout the examination the healthcare professional must remain alert to verbal and no n-verbal indications of dis tress from the p atient. Any request for the examination to be discontinu ed should be respected and do cument ed in the patients records. Any discussion during the examination should be kept relevant avoiding any unnecessary personal comments regardless of whether a chaperone is present. A person who is feeling embarrassed or vulne rable is more likely to misinterpret a comment. Document in the patient no te or chart the presence of a chaperone with any intimate examination or those that m ay be constr ued as such. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) offers the following additional guidance on the use of chaperones for children and adoles cents. In the medic al office setting, the physical examination of an infant, toddler, or child should always be performed in the presence of a parent or guardian. 75 If a parent or guardian is unavailable or the parent's presence will interfere with the p hysical examination, such as in a possible case of abuse or p arental ment al health issues, a chaperone sho uld be present during the p hysical examination. Cons equences of non-compliance Items of potential non-compliance are of serious concern and will require confirmation via invest igation of any allegation. Due to the sensitive nature of the grievance, CUSOM will require that all real and stand ardized patient interactions involving the accused be immediately suspended at the time of the grievance, pending the inv estigation conclusion. As outlined in the Academic Bulletin, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct, or unp rofessional conduct. The CUS OM Honor Code will guide th is review. Outcomes of an APPS committee intervention may in clude, but are not limited to, any of the following levels of discipline: Disciplinary Probation Suspension Withdrawal Dismissal from the progra m without the option to return Revocation of Degree Violations of patient rights are serious matte rs and may result in crimin al charges. FERPA privacy laws do not prot ect violations of a crimin al natu re. Concl usions regarding fitness to p ractice and treatment if appropriate. According to the recommend ations made by the Federation of State Medical Boards, Campbell Univ ersity suppor ts the loss of enrollm ent into the school, as well as revocation of degree upon confirmed mis condu ct. 4.23 Accommodations Policy Campbell Univ ersity is committed to providing equal educational oppo rtunity for persons with disabili ties in accordance with the nondis crimination policy of the University and in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, with Title II of the Am ericans with Dis abilities Act of 1990, and with the ADA Amendm ents Act of 200 8. 76 The law states that a person with a \"disabil ity\" is: \"Someone with a physical or ment al impairment which substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; or a person with a record of such impairment; or a person who is regarded as having such an impairment.\" (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation A ct of 1973) Equal educational oppo rtunity me ans that a person with a disabili ty who is qualified for admission must have access to the same unive rsity programs, services, and activities as all other students. If necessary to provide equal opportuni ty, Campbell will make reasonable mod ifications to its policies, practices and procedures, unless doing so would fund ament ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial burd en. Under the provisions of Section 504, unive rsities may not discriminate in the recruitm ent, admission, educational process, or treatment of students. Students who have self-identifi ed, provid ed document ation of disabili ty, and requested r easonable accommodations are entitled to receive approved modifications of programs, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educational prog rams and activities. Section 504 specifies that unive rsities may not limit the number of students with disabili ties admitted, make preadmissions inquiries as to wh ether or not an applicant has a disabi lity, use admission tests or criteria that inadequately measure the academic qualifications of students with disabili ties because s pecial provisions were not mad e, exclude a qualified student with a disabili ty from any course of study, or establi sh rul es and policies th at may adversely affect students wi th disabili ties. In support of its commitment to provide equal educational oppo rtunity, Campbell provid es a variety of services and accommodations to students with document ed disabi lities.

Questions or comments about this manual should be directed to: Laura Rich Director of Disability Services Student Services, Room 113 (910) 814-4364 Fax (910) 814-5710 richl@campbell.edu CUSOM Students with Disa bilities Section I - Who to Contact Students with do cument ed disabili ties who d esire mod ifications or accommodations must c ontact the CUSOM Student A ffairs: Jennifer Parrish, MEd, LPCA CUSOM Director of Student Affairs Leon Levine H all of M edical Sciences, Room 115 (910)-893-1846 jparrish@campbell.edu No accommodations will be made without approval through the University's pro cess. A medi cal, psychological or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disabili ty if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A dis ability may be tempor ary or ongoing. Section II: How to Obtain Services General Procedure for Receiving Accommodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are requested to contact the Director of Student A ffairs to request services as soon as possible. The Univ ersity is not responsible for identi fying students with dis abilities and is not required to provide s ervices unless proper pro cedures have been follow ed in making a request. Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Director of Student A ffairs, who consul ts with the Dire ctor of Student Success/ADA/504 Com pliance Officer to provide document ation of the dis ability and to co mplete the appropriate paperwork. Step 3: The Director of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting do cument ation, if needed. The process of review d epends in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions re garding accommodations are made on a case-by- case basis. There is no stand ard accommodation for any particular disabili ty. CUSOM will make r easonable modifi cations to its policies, practices and pro cedures, unless doing so would fundament ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial bu rden. 78 Step 4: If the request for accommodations is approved, the Director of Student Affairs generates a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) documenting the studen t's individual, approved accommodations. The O ffice of Students Affairs coordi nates dissemination of the LOA. Any student whose requested accommodations are not approved is encouraged to meet with the Director of Student Affairs to discuss the reasons for the denial. The Director may discuss the grievance procedure with the student at this time. Additional Information Regarding Accommodations Documentation For any student deemed eligible, CUSOM provid es accommodations or mod ifications to policies and practices in order to ensure t hat all students have equal access to all CUSOM programs, services, and activities. The p urpose of accommodations is not to ensure success, but rather to provide access and equal educational opportuni ty. Accommodations are not provid ed retroactively. Any student approved for accommodations is entitled to services and accommodations only from the date that approval is given. Even if the stude nt can establi sh that he or she h ad a disabili ty at the time of the course in question, CUSOM will not expunge or re- examine coursework completed b efore the stud ent was reviewed and approved for accommodation. No student is required to disclose his or her disabili ty to the Unive rsity. However, as discuss ed above, any student who discloses and receives approved accommodations after he or she has begun study at CUSOM will not receive any retroactive accommodations on work completed before the approval for accommodations w as made. Document ation of a student's disabili ty is only shared with relevant CUSOM f aculty, staff or administration on a need-to-know b asis with a release of info rmation s igned by the studen t. Service Animal Information According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as \"any animal individual ly trained to work or perform tasks for the b enefit of an individual with a disabili ty, includin g, but not limited to, guiding ind ividuals with impaired vision, alerting ind ividuals to an impending seizure or protecting ind ividuals during on e, alerting individuals who are hearing i mpaired to intruders, pulling a wheelchair 79 and fetching drop ped items\". Providing comfo rt or suppo rt does not qualify an animal as a service animal. If the re are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, a determination is made by Director of Student Affairs with consultation with the Dir ector of Student Success/ADA/504 Comp liance Officer. In compliance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all buildings on campus and m ay attend any class, meeting, or other event. Service animals are expected to exhibit reasonable b ehavior while on campus. The owners of disrupt ive and aggressive service animals may be asked to r emove t hem from unive rsity facilities. If the improper behavior h appens repeatedly, the o wner may be told not to bring the service animal into a ny facility until they take si gnificant steps to mitigate the behavior. Emotional support animals are animals that provide comfo rt and relieve symptoms of ment al health disord ers. Emotional support animals are not allowed in other campus buildings, including classrooms and dining facilities unless it is deemed as a reasonable accommodation and will be inclu ded in the student's Letter of Accommodation (LOA) from CUSOM. The CUS OM Director of Student Affairs can provide further information. Cleanliness of any approved service animal on campus is mandatory. Consid eration of othe rs must be ta ken into account when provi ding mainten ance and hygiene of animals. The own er is expected to clean and dispose of all animal waste. Confidentiality of Information Information received from a student is governed under the provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Und er the provisio ns of this la w, students in post-secondary education have the right to inspe ct and review their school records as defined by law. Other than for \"Directory Information\", Campbell Univ ersity will release information only with the student's written consent and will use \"Directory Information\" in the best interests of the studen t. CUSOM is committed to ensuri ng all information compiled concerning a student remains confidential as required by applicable law. Any information mon itored or collected is used for the benefit of t he studen t. 80 Only those faculty and staff memb ers of CUSOM have access to information collected for use in accomplishing n ecessary tasks for the student. Any info rmation gathered is not released to third parties except in accordance with state and federal law. A student must give written authori zation to release info rmation when s on a first -come, first -serve basis /he wish es to share it with others. The student must specify the information to be released, the purp ose of the release, and to whom the info rmation is to be fo rwarded. This release may be handwritten, or a form from CUSOM Office of Student A ffairs may be used. By mat riculating at CUSOM, a student agrees that CUSOM may share their Match data. A student has the right to review his/her own file and as a courtesy to the ind ividual, copies of do cuments and information obtain ed will be provid ed at no cost with l imitation s. Section III: Student Responsibilities General Student Responsibilities 1. Identify him/herself to the Director of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accommodations. CUSOM is not respons ible for identi fying students with disabili ties or for contacting su ch students to begin the accommodation request process. 2. Provide document ation which conforms to the University's guidelines. If the student's document ation is insuf ficient for any reason, the student is respons ible for pursuing whatever additional document ation is required and to p ay any costs thereof. CUSOM reserves the right not to provi de services or accommodations until all of the documen tation specified in the guidelines is provided. 3. Any student approved for accommodations is respons ible for retrieving his or h er Letter of A ccommodation (LOA) and Release of Information Form f rom the Director of Student Affairs or available at: https://cuweb.wu foo.com/forms/cusom-release-of-information/ Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Testing Accommodations Testing accommodations require frequent communication between the student and the Office of Ass essment, Accreditation and Medical Education (Years 1 and 2) or Department of Clinical Affairs (Years 3 and 4). It is very important that testing information be shared with these offices in a ti mely mann er. 81 At the beginning of the semest er, and at least one week prior to the first scheduled test, the student should discuss with the O ffice of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the D epartment of Cl inical Affairs all approved testing accommodations. This discussion should address the qu estions of how, when and where the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and M edical Education or the Department of Clinical Affairs will provide the testing accommodations. The student should make sure to have a calendar and a copy of the LOA with him/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also r emind the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education or the D epartment of Clinical Affairs of their need for accommodations at least one w eek prior to each test/exam. If at any time you feel that the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Edu cation, or the Department of Clinical Affairs is not adequately meeting your accommodations, discuss this with the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and M edical Education or D epartment of Clinical Affairs and the Dire ctor of Student A ffairs immedi ately. Rememb er, the Office of Assessment, A ccreditation and M edical Education or the Department of Clinical Education is only required to provide accommodations spe cifically listed in the Letter of Accommodation. Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Handicapped Parking Students who use handicapped parking on campus must maintain state- issued handicap parking permits. The student is also required to purchase an appropriate parking sticker from the Campbell University Department of Campus Safety. If a student has consistent probl ems finding necessary handicapped parking n ear his/her class buildings, notify the Director of Student Affairs and the Campbell University D epartment of Campus Safety immedi ately. Section IV: Documenting a Disability General Do cumentation Guidelines To ensure that reasonable and appropriate services and accommodations are provid ed to students with disabili ties, students requesting such accommodations and services must provide current document ation of their disabili ty. Such documentation generally must include the followin g: 82 A clear diagnostic statement of the disability prepared by a licensed pro fessional A description of the mann er in which the disab ility limits the student in a specified major life activity and the s everity of the limitation It is the respons ibility of the student requesting the accommodations and services to document the disabili ty. As such, the cost of evaluations required pursu ant to these guidel ines is to be borne by the student. If there is a change in the student's condition, he/she may request modifications to previously approved accommodations. The student will have to provide current suppo rting do cument ation for review at that time. An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan may help to suppl ement documentation, but are generally insuf ficient docum entation wh en presented alone. Guidelines for Documenting a L earning Dis ability Every report should be on letterhead, typed, dated, signed and otherwise legible, and be comprised of the following elements: Eval uator I nformation: The n ame, t itle, and credentials of the qualified pro fessional who condu cted the assessment should begin the r eport. Please note that memb ers of the student's family are not consid ered appropriate evaluato rs. Recent Assessment: The report m ust provide adequate information about the stude nt's current lev el of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or complete assessment. Testing: There should be a discu ssion of all tests that were administ ered, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all of his/her test scores (i.e. domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores and/or percentile ranks. Informal assessment, an Individuali zed Education Plan (IEP), or a 504 plan m ay help to suppl ement a more comprehensive test battery but are generally insuf ficient docum entation wh en presented alone. In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly stated diagnosis are helpful and should be included in the report. The sum mary should integrate the elements of the battery with background info rmation, observations of the client during the testing situation, and the student's current academic situation. This summary should present evid ence of a substantial 83 limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and weakness are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disabili ty diagnosis. It should also demons trate that the evaluator has ruled out alternative explanations for the learning probl em. If social or emotional factors are found to be possible obstacles to learning, they should be discuss ed. This summary may include recommended accommodations, but these are in no way bind ing to the Univ ersity. CUS OM reserves the right to evaluate all document ation and d etermine appropriate accommodations in each case. Section V: Grievance Procedure All requests for accommodations or special services should first be brought to the CUSOM Director of Student Affairs. Problems with approved accomm odations or services should first be reported in writing to the CUSO M Director of Student A ffairs. If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the CUSOM Dire ctor of Student A ffairs, the student and the CUSOM Director of Student A ffairs should forward the complaint to the Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Comp liance Officer for an informal resolution. The Dire ctor of Student Success/ADA/504 Compliance Officer will arrange a meeting with the student and CUSOM Director of Student A ffairs with in ten (10) business days of receiving the complaint. In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file a complaint with the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. The Vi ce President for Student Life and Dean of Students will arrange a meeting with the student and Director of Student Success/ADA/504 Comp liance Officer within ten (10) business d ays of receiving the complaint. In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file a complaint with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost if the is sue involves denial of an academic accommodation. Students are also encouraged to exercise their rights of complaint through the D epartment of Education, Office of Civil Rights and other legal channels if needed. 84 4.24 CUSOM Alumni Student Society for Alumni and Friends The Student Society for Alumni and Friends (SSAF) is a student organization sponsored by the Campbell Medicine Alumni Association ; the Director of Alumni Engagement serves as the club advisor. The mission of SSAF is to connect students, alumni and friends of CUSOM by providing leadership opportunities, educating students about the impact of philanthropic engagement with CUSOM and the University, and inspiring future generation of alumni. SSAF helps students commun icate the goals, purpose and impact of CU Advancement and Alumni Engagement while giving them the opportunity to educate other students about the importance of giving back. SSAF consists of a group of highly motivated students interested in the promotion of philanthropic awareness on campus and are leaders and volunteers for events such as Campbell Medicine Golf Classic, TAG Day, Founders Week, and Campbell Day of Giving. Students who serve as club officers receive training in event planning, project mana gement, fundraising, str ategic planning and marketing. SSAF members serve as ambassadors to students, alumni and friends of CUSOM. Members serve as agents for their respective classes during their tenure as students and throughout their lifetime as alumn i. Membership is free and participation in initiatives and events will be taken into consideration when offering exclusive opportunities. Alumni Engagem ent & Alumni Association The Campbell Medicine Alumni Association was founded by the inaugural Class in 2017 as a dues based organization. The association provides meaningful communication and fosters relationships through opportunities for engagement and service such as scholarships, awards, and mentorship as well as social events to connect with fello w Campbell Physicians, faculty, staff and students. The alumni association has flexible membership options that reflect alumni's advancement in their career: Resident (years 1 -3 total) $25.00; Young Alumni $50.00 annual membership for years 4 -6 post -graduation; Annual Alumni Dues $100.00 Lifetime Membership $750 resident/young alumni ($1,000 6+ years after graduation). 85 The Campbell Medicine Alumni Association Board is comprised of four Class Representatives per class. The Campbell Medicine Alumni Associ ation may nominate two members to serve on the University Alumni Board of Directors. The Medicine Alumni Board will establish the bylaws, mission, vision and goals for the Campbell Medicine Alumni Association and work with the Alumni Office to add benefit s for the Association and plan special events. They are the Alumni v oice for Campbell Medicine in the Medical School and University communities. 86 5. ACADEMIC INFORMATION AND POLICIES 5.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM believes strong academic counsel ing should provide students with excellent longitudinal guidance and support starting during the pre -matriculation phase and continuing through graduation. CUSOM's comprehensive academic counseling process includes a series of academic transition support activities, long-term, consistent mentorship from academic advisors, board and residency preparation support, the training and allocation of peer -tutors, learning enrichment programs, and targeted individual and group workshops through its Academic Center of Excellence ( CUSOM ACE). Organizational Structure of the ACE CUSOM ACE, under the directorship of the two Assistant Deans of Academic Success and the support of an Executive Assistant , is responsible for the overall success of CUSOM students . CUSOM ACE manages academic support programs and learning services including, but not limited to: peer-tutor program, study skill development workshops, behavioral counseling, individual academic coaching, faculty advising support, and an on-line student forum. CUSOM ACE also hosts a collection of learning and Board preparation resources accessible to the CUSOM community through its computers or mini library. The CUSOM ACE Blackboard community and Facebook group pages provide additional platforms for disseminating information as well as promoting collaborative academic interactions. Academic Transition Activities CUSOM ACE is responsible for designing and leading activities and programs designed to assist matriculating students develop study skills and techniques , which will assist them in achieving academic success. Two weeks prior to Orientation of the new inc oming class, ACE distributes a pre-matriculation reading assignment on the topic of \"The Science and Strategies for Successful Learning and Study.\" This material, prepared by CUSOM ACE, is a collection of highlights and excerpts from the literature pertaining to critical skills essential for academic success in a high -volume, high -paced learning environment. This material provides students with foundation al knowledge in areas such as growth mindset, metacognition, spaced practice, interleaving, etc., which is expanded upon during Orientation. During Block 1, two study skill workshops further discuss and expand on these topics. The last installment of thi s series focuses on test-taking skill development and utilizes an exam \"autopsy\" to provide feedback on refining study skills. 87 Long -term, Consistent Mentorship from Academic Advisors The academic Advisor -Advisee relationship is one of an institutional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, professional, scholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or even teach. The CUSOM advising pr ocess ensures both biomedical science and clinical faculty are involved in student at advising and establishing relationships that create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. The Advisor/Advisee relationship will ensure consistent feedback rega rding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution as needed. All advisors play an important role in identifying students experiencing academic, personal or behavioral health problems and providing them with referrals to CUSOM ACE for individual study skill coaching or to Behavioral Health Services for assessment and appropriate treatment. The Director of Student Affairs and the Assistant Dean for Faculty assign academic advisors , with input and approval by th e Dean , to each incoming CUSOM student. Such mentorship is typically carried out through both mandatory group and individual meetings. In the first two years, this is facilitated through designated time on the academic calendar for the advisors to meet w ith their advisees. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors during years 1 and 2 is as follows: During Blocks 1 and 2, students meet with their academic advisors at least once individually each Block, and once in a group setting ea ch Block (4 meetings total). The purpose of these meetings is to provide the academic support to the students during this transitional period. During the remaining academic Blocks in the first and second years, students will meet with their advisors at le ast once a semester in an individual or group setting. In addition to their role as specifically assigned academic advisors, faculty also meet with non -assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty offer office hours individually and are available to students for any additional assistance. Scheduling may be done either directly with faculty, or through the appropriate administrative assistant. By mat riculating at CUSOM, students agree that their grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate advising effectiveness. 88 Board and Residency Preparation Support To help guide CUSOM students in preparation and planning for national licensing exams through the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), the CUSOM Vice Dean for Academic Affairs and Executive Director of Assessment, Accreditation, and Medical Education provide presentations to MS -1 and MS -2 students, and also offer individualized a dvisement. These sessions and meetings offer insights, data, and guidance for studying and scheduling COMLEX -USA Level 1 exams. As students enter third year, additional advising relationships are developed to support clinical rotation needs and residency specialty selection and application processes. Students are provided a list of clinical advisors/mentors classified by their areas of clinical expertise and may choose additional mentors according to their interest in a specific clinical discipline. Cli nical advisors provide guidance to the students with a focus on the clinical path they are interested in pursuing. CUSOM Clinical Department Chairs provide guidance regarding clinical rotations, addressing any issues with rotation performance and meeting curricular requirements. The Clinical Department Chairs also provide support to students applying to residency programs in their specific or related fields by meeting with students to offer residency planning advice and providing letters of recommendation s for student residency applications. In the first month of their fourth -year, medical students complete the Residency Development course. This course includes OSCEs to prepare students for their COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE Exam. In addition, there are a se ries of lectures designed to prepare students for their transition into residency with topics including Deciding on a Specialty and Advising Offered Through CUSOM, Applying for Residency Programs, Interviewing for Residency Programs, The Match and What Hap pens if I Don't, and What I Need to be Able to Do on Day One of Residency? Additional information and resources are also provided including match results, resources available through the AAMC, templates and Curriculum Vitae writing support, and a FAQs boo k developed by CUSOM. Fourth -year students also participate in mock residency interviews during which they receive immediate feedback on their performance and specific advising regarding targeted areas for improvement in their interviewing skills. In addi tion to individually scheduled meetings, email, and telephone interactions with faculty advisors, students have advising opportunities with CUSOM faculty during Call Back Fridays of their third - and fourth -years. Call Back Fridays are the last Friday of c ore clinical rotations when students are required to return to CUSOM to participate in end -of-rotation exams, didactic presentations, Osteopathic Principles & Practices sessions, professional seminars, and clinical faculty advising sessions. 89 Rising fourth -year students also participate in CUSOM's annual Residency Fair which is designed to help students narrow down their specialty selection and prepare for the process of applying to residency programs. The event includes a presentation on criteria to consid er when selecting a specialty and a panel discussion including residency program directors, current residents from Campbell co -sponsored postgraduate training programs, and fourth -year students in the application process. Participating students have the o pportunity to attend breakout sessions for two different specialties, presented by that discipline's Chair, where they are provided valuable information regarding the specialty (training, job opportunities/outlook, lifestyle etc.), evaluating their competi tiveness for applying to that specialty, and key information and advice for that specialty's residency application process. Students also have the chance to talk directly with Program Directors and staff from residency programs. Enrichment and Interventi on Support from the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE) Through collaboration with the Depar tment of Behavioral Health, CUSOM ACE assists students, directly and indirectly, to achieve academic excellence. The two Assistant Dean s for Academic Success lead CUSOM ACE and provide counseling services for study skills, time management, test -taking skills, etc. directly to students in group settings or during one -on-one meetings. Individual meetings are scheduled based on need or according to the recommendation of Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee or the Dean's office. Students who receive a grade of 75% or less on any integrated exam are recommended to con tact their academic advisor or CUSOM ACE for an individual meeting. Meeting frequency is tailored to individual student needs based on academic performance, student requests, and/or recommendations of the ACE, faculty advisors, or the APPS Committee. Students who desire individual advising sessions can schedule additional meetin gs with their academic advisor or the Academic Center for Excellence at any time regardless of their academic performance. These meetings can be one -time only, weekly, or bi -weekly, whichever the students and CUSOM ACE directors deem appropriate. Recomme ndation to seek additional support from Behavioral Health when necessary is also an integral part of this process. To maximize the effectiveness of faculty academic advisors, CUSOM ACE also organizes and/or participates in faculty development sessions to facilitate discussion, share best practices, and offer useful tools for mentoring students. Beyond fostering MS -1 and MS -2 students' academic success w ithin the CUSOM curriculum, CUSOM ACE also provides guidance and helpful resources for their Board prepa ration. Computers available through CUSOM ACE provide students protected, full access to many common Board study 90 programs and question banks. CUSOM ACE also has a private Facebook page, utilizing social media to deliver up -to-date information or daily pr actice questions to the CUSOM stude nt community. In addition, CUSOM ACE, in collaboration with Behavioral Health, has facilitated a student forum on Board Preparation, organizing MS -3 students to offer support to MS2 students. 5.2 CUSOM Peer -Tutor Program CUSOM ACE also develops and manages additional academic support services through the CUSOM Peer -Tutor program and faculty development programs designed to enhance faculty advising skills. The CUSOM Peer -Tutor p rogram is designed to assist students requ esting tutoring service to become more proficient in subject -specific materials and more efficient and effective independent learners across a broad range of courses. Peer tutoring is intended to enhance, not replace, lecture attendance and personal study time. Tutors also act as facilitators for student learning, assisting with clarification of lecture and lab objectives, discussions, readings, or other assignments. CUSOM ACE identifies, trains, and appoints course -specific tutors. To become a certifie d tutor, students must meet the minimal academic requirements (ranking the top 25% of a specific course and maintaining a cumulative GPA 3.3), complete a Tutor Training Workshop provided by the ACE, and be approved by the Course Director(s). CUSOM MS -1 and MS -2 students who wish to receive peer -tutoring support place their requests by logging onto the Blackboard Class Community and complet e a request form provided via a Wufoo link. The Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) will identify available certified peer-tutors who will then contact the tutees directly to arrange session(s) on a short - or long -term basis. The goal of tutoring sessio ns is to clarify and review concepts, explain processes, and assist in problem solving. The interactions between tutor and tutee are required to adhere to the rules of academic professionalism, confidentiality, and honesty according to the CUSOM Honor Cod e. The most updated CUSOM Peer-Tutor Program manual is published on the ACE Blackboard Community page. As a student -centered institution, all CUSOM administrators are accessible to students when needed and based on availability. Administrative leadershi p also strives to conduct informal meetings with students on a regular basis, such as \"Breakfast/Lunch with the Dean\", a twice -monthly meeting of small student groups with the Dean and Associate Deans. In summary, academic advisors, CUSOM Behavioral Healt h, the Academic Center for Excellence, faculty, Deans, and staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise throughout the four years of medical school, and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. 91 5.3 Attendance Attendance Policy Attendance of first- and second -year students is expected at all lectures, and required at all labs and other scheduled curricular activities. Attendance will be monitored by the Office of Assessment, Accr editation and Medical Education (Med Ed) using the lecture hall cameras, and electronic attendance records are m aintained. Absences for emergencies are consid ered on a case- by-case basis through Med Ed. Any falsification of attendance records is viewed as an Honor Code violation. Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the first two years of the curriculum may result in corrective action through the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Attendance of third - and fourth -year students is required for all requisit e clinical duties of the particular rotation on a daily basis with a n y structured time away from the rotation approved at t h e discretion of the clinical site dir ector. Students on clinical rotations are expected to be on time for all assigned activities associated with that particular rotation. Activities may include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital comm ittee meetings, on-call assignments, case presentations, etc... Students must abide by attendance requirements as described in the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Manual. Violations o f t h e a t t e n d a n c e r e q u i r e m e n t p o l i c y may result in disciplinary action by the APPS Committee including, but not limited to, removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office, and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism issues in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE ). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. MS-1 and MS-2 Years It is recognized there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; how ever, a student who m isses a lecture, laboratory or workshop is not excused from the subject materials or duties of that p articular period. The student may be required to make-up the missed educational session(s) during off-hours. Makeup lab oratories are conducted only in extreme situations and at the discretion of the Course Director i n consultation with the Block Leaders, Med Ed and Vice Dean for Academic Affairs when necessary. 92 The total number of absences must not exceed 20% of a course. No excused absences are granted while the 20% threshold has not been reached. Once a student h as met or exceeded the 20% mark, the student may be eligible to request an excused absence through Med Ed by meeting one of the following qualifying criteria: For medical condition/illness, the student must provide Med Ed with a note from the examining physician (who is NOT a family member) indicating the medical visit, t h e a m o u n t o f recommended time-off, and the student's r eturn-to-class d ate. For personal leave, unless it is emergent in nature, the absence request must be submitt ed at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. Personal leave does not include vacat ions, weddings, graduations or other similar activities or events. Examples include: o Death in immediate family o Critical status secondary to accident/acute illness involvi ng an immediate family member Note: \"Immediate member\" is defined as a student's parent, stepparent , grandparent, spouse, spous e's parent, child or siblin g. For Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. For attending CUSOM-related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations, an excused absence request must be subm itted, in writing, to Med Ed at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence(s). To be consid ered for such request, students must have a cumu lative GPA 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, no prior course failures, and be in good academic standing. S t u d e n t s a r e a l l o w e d a m a x i m u m of two (2) excused absences per semester for voluntary attendance at conferences if all other excused absence criteria has been met. No tr avel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted by Med Ed . CUSOM accepts no responsibili ty or liability for any losses as a consequence of any cancelled or delayed travel plans. Approved absences for students required to attend n ational conferences will not be subject the 20% rule; however, formal requests must be submitted for approval. Students may request an excused absence for religious holid ays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. Appropriate documentation to support the request is required, and must be submitt ed for approval to Med Ed. 93 As there is no 20% allowance for mandatory laboratory (OMM, Anatomy) Clinical Skills activity, or Interprofessional Education (IPE) activity a separate laboratory excused absence request must be completed and submitted to the Course Director and Med Ed. The same aforementioned criteria outlined above apply. Med Ed will notify the Course Director of the decision if approved . Approval must be granted and obtained in order to arrange a make-up with the Course Director. An unexcused absence from one of these activities may result in a grade of zero (0) or an overall grade deduction (refer to each specific course syllabus). In the event of any absence from an examination or quiz, approval must be obtained from Med Ed to arrange a make-up (approvals based upon the qualifying criteria detailed above) . It is essential each student make every effort not to miss any examination or quiz. Requests for make-up examinations or quizzes must be made in a timely manner with Med Ed. An un excused absence from an examination or quiz, may result in a grade of zero (0) for that assessment . For an absence to be considered excused, students must notify Med Ed and complete the appropr iate lecture or lab \"Excused Absence Request Form\" online. Med Ed will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the stude nt will be notified of the d ecision in a timely mann er. If a student is failing any course or has been placed on A cademic Probation, they may not be approved for an excused absence unless for an extraneous situation determined o n a case-by-case basis. The Vi ce Dean for Academic Affairs will resolve any disagreement concerning an attendance decision. Once an absence request is approved, it is the student's respons ibility to contact Course Dir ectors and Med Ed to arrange a mak eup for m issed laboratories and an examination /quiz where applicable. It is important to note that, although the Course Dir ectors will do their best to accommodate the mak eup requests, some missed experiences may not be replicable, and the arrangement is at the Course Directors' disc retion. In the case in which a missed experience is not replicable, and therefore unable to be made up, the studen t may receive a zero (0) for that assessment, which may lead to an overall failing course grade . Official Holidays CUSOM o bserves the following Univ ersity holidays. New Year's Day Martin Luther King Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor D ay Thanksgiving (2 Days) Christmas ( Varies) 94 Holid ays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Mond ay after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell Univ ersity. Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM student is called to s erve on a jury, or if a CUSOM student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, he or she should submit the appropriate lecture and/or lab excused absence request as outlined above , and advise the Associate Dean for Biomedical A ffairs as soon as possible. As noted above, i n t h e c a s e s o f Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted to Med Ed at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. Cons equences of Non-compliance As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. The A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) C ommittee may consider non-compliance with the Attendance Policy by MS-1 and MS-2 stu dents as a vio lation of CUSOM policy which may result in disciplinary action. APPS Committee actions include, but are not limited to, loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any stu dent club, organization, or student government office; and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism in the Medical Student Performance Eval uation (MSPE). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. MS-3 and MS-4 Years Students in third- and fourth-year clinical rotations must abide by the additional attendance requirements described in the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Manual. One hund red percent (100%) attendance on all clinical rotations is expected. Failure to notify the clinical site/precept or, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any abs ence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a pro fessionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promo tion and Standards (APPS) Committee. An unexcused absence will r esult in either a failing or an incomplete grade and result in referral to the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. 95 Students are required to be at their assigned supervised clinical education experience sites for a minimum of forty (40) hours p er week, unless the clinical site is open less than forty (40) hours per week . The days and times a student is expected to report is determined by the preceptor and students may be assign ed to day, evening, night, w eekend or holiday wo rk hours. Pre ceptors may ask students to rotate their s cheduled work hours in order to g ain the most clinical experience during times of p eak patient flow. Du ring certain clinical rotat ions, students may be assign ed to Saturday and Sunday hours as well. The Campbell Univ ersity holiday schedule is independent of the clinical rotation schedule. Third- and fou rth-year students must follow the schedule as outlined by their preceptor for the mon th. Students are expected to work forty (40) hours per week for four (4) weeks, for a total of 160 contact hours per each four (4) week clinical rotation . Attendance Attendance at all scheduled workdays is mandatory. Students are expected to arrive at least fifteen (1 5) minu tes early for each of their scheduled workdays. Any length of absence (an hour, half day , full day, etc... ) must be immedi ately reported to the Regional Site Coor dinator, Regional Dean, Director of Student Medical Education ( DSME ) as appropriate and the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Extracurr icular activities, vacations, or lack of childcare are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. CUSOM E -mail is the prim ary method of communication between the Department of Clinical Affairs and students and thus students must check their CUSOM email regularly. The student must main tain communi cation betwee n him/h erself, the rotation site and the Office of Clinical Affairs. This communication can include contact with the clerkship director, administrator, site director, and staff in the Office of Clinical Af fairs. 96 1. Discretionary Days Students are allowed three (3) discretionary days total annually. No more than one (1) day may be taken in any given clinical rotation, and discretionary days may NOT be used on a Call Back Friday (last Friday of the rotation). Discretionary days MUST be approved by both the preceptor and Office of Clinical Affairs in writing at least one (1) week in advance to the requested t ime off. Requests are to be submi tted electroni cally via the CUSOM Absence identifi ed below) to the correspondi ng Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator . 2. Sick D ays Students are allowed five (5) sick days annually. If more than five (5) sick days total are taken by a student, the student may be r eferred to the Office of Clinical Affairs and the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for review. 3. Family Emergencies / D eath in Family Due to the variability of circumstances, time-off requested for family emergencies or a death in the family will be reviewed by the Office of Clinical Affairs on a case-by-case basis. 4. Time off for Residency Interviews Interviews at any CUSO M-sponsored residen cy pro gram do not count against recorded absences. Students may request no more than four (4) days off for interviews during any four -week rotation, and no more than two (2) days over any two-week rotation. This includes partial day absences of greater than four (4) hours. Students will be required to make up missed time at the rotation director's discretion. All requests for time-off must include written verification of the interview loc ation and date and be provid ed to the Office of Clinical Affairs at least one (1) w eek prior to the requested date of absence. 5. Conferences Additional excused time off may be granted only if the student is presenting, is a national officer, or by special permission. All requests for conferences need prior approval by the Associate Dean for C linical Affairs as noted above. Students are required to make up time off for conferences. 97 Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor , Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a pro fessionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promo tion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Extracurricular activities, vacations, or la ck of childcar e are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. Email is the prim ary method of communication between the Department of Clinical Affairs and students, and, thus, students must check their CUSOM email regularly. Students are required to attend all onsite meetings designated by the R egional Site Coordinator or Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate). Students must contact their clinical site/preceptor as well as the Regional Site Coordin ator, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate), and either the Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator immedi ately if they are missing any clinical time due to illness (l eaving early, arriving late, or missing a full day). If 2-4 hours of clinical time is missed, a half day will be documented. More than four (4) hours of missed clinical time equals a full d ay of sick le ave. If an absence of greater than one (1) working day is necessary due to illness, that time must be made up. Arrangements for missed time will be coordinated with the Office of Clinical Affairs through the Regional Site Coordinator. If the student is absent from a single rotation for two (2) days or more due to illness, the student is required to submit a note f rom a licensed healthcare provid er to the Office of Clinical Affairs defining the number of days absent and the expected d ate of return. If extraordin ary circumstances require a prolonged absence (more than three (3) days in one rotation), the student may be encouraged to consider a M edical Leave of Absence which can be requested through the Office of Clinical Affairs. A Medical Leave of Absence may be required for students who miss more than three (3) days due to medi cal reasons and are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation. A Medical Leave of Absence may delay the student's graduation. Each case is evaluated on a case-by- case basis. 98 Students who require a Medical Leave of Absence will meet with the As sociate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Dean, and may be referred to the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. A Mo dified Course of Study will be developed in discussion with the As sociate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Permission for an absence must be obtained in ad vance with all of the following: CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs, Clinical preceptor to wh om student is assigned, and Regional Dean/DSME of the affiliated hos pital. Student absence reque sts must be made utilizi ng the official CUSOM Absence Request / Submission form and may be obtained from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found online at: https://cuw eb.wufoo.com/forms/m63yfw91siq e3g/ All absences, whether a current illness or a request for a future absence, must be completed using this form. There are no exceptions for th is procedure and failure to follow the procedure will result in the student being assigned an unexcused absence. Students who miss more than a total of four (4) d ays of a 4-week rotation, or two (2) days of a 2-week rotation, regardless of the reason, and who are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation, may not receive credit for the rotation and will be required to app ear before the APPS Committee. Failure to notify the cl inical site/preceptor , Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any abs ence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a pro fessionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promo tion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If a student desires to participate in an activity that will take him/her away from an assigned clinical setting, the student must submit a written request fully explaining the nature of the activity identified in the requ est and d etailing the time away f rom assign ed duty. This requ est must be submitted to the O ffice of the Asso ciate D ean for Cl inical A ffairs at least two (2) working days (w eekdays), b efore the requ ested absence. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor , Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours 99 absent, may result in completion of a pro fessionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promo tion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Students wishing to attend educational seminars or conferences, etc. must have approval from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Only students in good st anding and with an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale at the end of the M S-2 training will be considered. In addition, in order for students to be considered for an absence to attend a conference, they m ust have up- to- date submissions of all clinical rotation evaluations, site evaluations , and clinical experience database logs. Approved time away from the rotation may be required to be made up. Educational presentations, such as posters or research, may be considered toward meeting the required contact hours at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. As noted above, permission for time off for internship/r esiden cy interviews must be granted in advance with the aforementioned offices. Training Hours Clear communication of the expectations between students, the Office of Clinical Affairs, and the training sites will permit flexibility within reasonable limits in a way that does not impact either clinical education or reflect poorly o n a student's pro fessionalism. Four ( 4 ) weeks of vacation time is included in both the third - and fourth- years as a scheduled rotation block. Students are generally expected to work five (5) full d ays per week, averaging forty (40) ho urs weekly, but the length (hours) of some required \" shift\" schedules may be different for surgical, sub-internship, and emergency medicine rotations. Working hours in each of the s ervices will be indicated and determined by the training site and the physician in charge of that service, in cooperation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Vice-President of Medical Education/Regional Dean/DSME of the CUSOM-affiliated training site. If call, night duty, or weekend duties are required, this will be in dicated by the ind ividual rotation. The student may not substitute workday hours f rom one service to another and are required to remain on the clinical rotation to which s/he is assigned. A student m ay spend time in another department only if it is part of the assigned clinical rotation's curriculum and only with approval of their attending physician/clerkship director. 100 For example, it is acceptable for a student in general surgery to spend time in pathology seeking tissue and biopsy results to ensure proper follow- up and continuity of care. It is not acceptable, however, for a student to make-up missed hours of an Obstetrics/Gynecology rotation in the Emergency Department. Any qu estions regarding these training hour requirements should be directed to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. If a student w o r k s a n o n -call night weekend shift , he/she may be given compens atory time off at the discretion of the preceptor . Compensatory time off greater than two (2) days must be approved by the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students are not permitted to rearrange their no rmal working schedule to allow for time off during any rotation. The only exception may be the Emergency Medicine and inpatient Hospitalist rotations in order to accommodate shift schedules, provided it has been approved by the appropriate s upervising physician. Professionalism in p atient care requires reliable attendance. The Office of Clinical Affairs will centrally track the number of days off for each student. No un excused absences can be permitted from patient care activities. As noted above, students will be given a total of three (3) discretionary days and five (5) Sick Days (approved absences) per academic year. Any student in violation of attendance policies with more than two (2) days per rotation or a total of five (5) days per academic year of time off (not made up) will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for further review. Student absence requests must be made ut ilizing the official CUS OM Absence Request / Submission form which may be obtained from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found online at: https://cuw eb.wufoo.com/forms/m63yfw91siq e3g/ All absences, whether a current illness or a request for a future absence, must be completed usi ng this form. Make Up Time Students m u s t be available to make up anticipated time off at the discretion of the rotation preceptor in order to main tain compliance with the CUSOM attendance policy. If a student's absence results in missing an examination, the student will retake the exam at the disc retion of the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students who miss more than a total of four (4) d ays of a four-week rotation, or two (2) days of a two-week rotation, regardless of the reason, 101 and who are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation will be called to the APPS Committee. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor , Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affa irs of any abs ence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a pro fessionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promo tion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Tardiness Promptness is a trait healthcare professionals must display and is expected of all CUSOM students. Tardiness is disruptiv e to the preceptor, patients and fellow students and is, thus, inconsiderate and disrespectful. Repeated violations are considered improper professional behavior and may result in disciplinary action. Students on clinical rotations are expected to be on time for all assigned activities associated with that particular rotation. Activities may include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital committee meetings, on-call assignments, case presentations, etc. Violations related to tardiness may result in disciplina ry action by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee including, but not limited to: loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office; and possible notation in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. Call Ba ck Fridays Students are required to return to Campbell University on the last Friday of the following core clinical rotations: Family Medicin e, Internal Medicine II, Obstetri cs/Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Em ergency Medicine. During these sessions, end-of-rotation exams are tak en, and rotation specific pr e-preparation activities occur includi ng, but OSCEs; simulatio workshops; seminars; OMM practice, review and practical app lication; and interprofessional events. Full attendance and participation in the entire day is MANDATORY. These sessions typically are scheduled from 8am-5pm; therefore, students should NOT make any travel plans prior to 5p m. These times m ay be subject to change. 102 In the event of illness, BOTH the end-of-rotation exam and the rotation specific pre-preparation activities must be completed in order to receive credit for completion of the rotation. Any emergency requiring absence from a Call Back Friday must be communicated to the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs immediately . Fourth Year Call Back Requirements Attend ance and active participation in a minimum of two (2) on-campus Call Back Friday OMM workshops is required during the fourth year. The first will o ccur during Residen cy Development Month, where the students are required to perform an OMM specific OSCE in a simulated outpatient setting. The second will o ccur when studen ts return to campus to take their core emergency med icine end-of-rotation exam, and the students are required to attend an OMM workshop stru ctured to help them develop strategies for integrating OMM into their pos t- graduate education. Students are always encouraged to attend additional Call Back Friday activities as space allows. Holidays While on clinical rotations, students are excused only for holidays that are observed by their respective clinical site. If a student is assigned by a preceptor to work on a holiday, the student m ay NOT r equest the use of a discretionary day on that hol iday. Third - and fourth-year students are required to follow the training site (e.g., hospital, clinic, office, health center) policies and procedures regarding holidays. All major hol idays are observed at the discretion of the affiliated training site and must be reported to the Office of C linical Affairs. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. If a student is required to work on a major holiday, the student may be given a compensatory day off during the holiday week at the discretion of the Vice President of M edical Education/ Regional Dean/ DSME . 103 Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM student is called to s erve on a jury, or if a CUSOM student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, he /she should advise the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and respective Regional Assistant Dean (or DSME as appropriate) as soon as poss ible. As noted above, i n t h e c a s e s o f Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted to Clinical Education at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. Consequences of Non-compliance As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. For third - or fourth -year students any unexcused absence while on clinical rotation will automatically result in a failure for that rotation and the st udent w i l l b e r e f e r r e d t o t h e Academic Performance, Promotion a nd Standards (APPS) Co mmittee. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. Severe Weather Policy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules or dining option changes, a mess age will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and Facebook, Twitter, and through our inclement w eather line: On campus: dial 5700 Local, on d ial 910-814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 In the case of severe weather while on clinical rotations, students should follow the s evere weather protocol of their specific clinical site. If the preceptor is present, the student should make every attempt to be present. If the student is un able to get to the clinical site due to unsafe road conditions, the student must communicate this to their preceptor, their Regional Site Coor dinator and the Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clini cal Coordinator immediately. Any time missed due to severe weather must be made up at the discretion of the preceptor, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate), and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, keeping in mind that students must complete t h e r e q u i r e m e n t s f o r a four-week rotation block in order to receive credit for their rotation. 104 Emergency Preparedness Plan Section O ne - Assessment of Risk The guiding principle b ehind the assessment of risk for the Campbell Univ ersity Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) shall be the protection of life and safety of our students, faculty, and staff. C ommunication and coordination between the CUSOM Clinical Affairs Department and Regional Deans (or DSME's, as appropriate) will be crucial to assessing risks within our r espective clinical campus regions. CUS OM recognizes that, due to the geographic dispersion of the clinical campuses, events affecting one region might not affect all regions. For events that are anticipated such as ice s torms, hurricanes, or other known events, a meeting will be scheduled 4-5 days in advance of the event to include the Dean of CUSOM, Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Director and Assistant Director of Clinical Affairs, and Regional Deans (or DSME's, as approp riate) to discuss the pr ojected events and the plan for response by each Regional Dean (or DSME's, as appropriate) . Regional Deans (or DSME's, as appropriate) shall be prepared to discuss their response if the event is \"Green\" which would indicate minimal impact, \"Yellow\" which would indicate a medium lev el impact, and \"Red\" which would indicate a catastrophic event. Event Category Description Green Event Minimal impact to life and property in the region with expected loss of utilities to last no longer than 1-2 days. Yellow Ev ent Mod erate impact to life and property in the region with potential loss of life and moderate damage to local structures. Uti lity failure projections of at least 3-7 days. Red Event Severe impact to life and property in the region with loss of life and severe damage to loc al structures. Parts of the area are uninhabitable for weeks. Water and sewer system failure with power loss projections of greater than 7 days. Regional Deans (or DSME's, as appropriate) will be the key point of contact for CUSOM and for its students in the respective regions and should print student contact information to keep with them until the event is over. The Regional Deans (or DSME's, as appropriate) , or their r epresentative, will be responsible for contacting each student in their region to make them aware of plans for respon se to the event at least two (2) days in advance (if known in advance). 105 Pre-Event Communication with I nstruct ions During Event Email, Text Messagi ng, Website and Phone Communications In an unanticipated event, Regional Deans (or DSME's, as appropriate) will have the authori ty to assess the risk and communicate their plans with students and CUSOM Administration their plans. Section T wo - Communication of Risk and Protection of Life Safety CUSOM will s end disaster assessment information to students providing instructions on what to do, supp lies they should have on hand, and k ey sources of credible information during the event. The Regional Dean (or DSME's, as appropriate) will serve as the prim ary point of contact for students and communicate with them directly duri ng a disaster by email, telephone, or text message. Section T hree - Identification of Student Whe reabouts and Status Each clinical campus will keep a current list of student cell phone numbe rs and addresses in a print able format that can be taken home for reference by the R egional Dean (or DSME's, as appropriate) in an adverse event. If electronic communication is available, a survey may be condu cted online requesting student response with their condition, location where sheltering, and any needs they may have. Section Four - Returning to Clinic al Rotations Regional Deans (or DSME's, as appropriate) will communicate in advance of an adverse event with students in the region to provi de specific instructions regarding when students may return to the facility. In addition, Regional Deans (or DSME's, as appropriate) will provide students in the region information regarding any need for volunteers to assist in disaster response operations. Section Five - Educational Program Conti nuity Regional Deans (or DSME's, as appropriate) in affected regions, along with the Clinical Affairs Department, will be in frequent contact to discuss 106 relocation of affected students, when necessary, in order to ensure educational program continuity. End-of-rotation exams a nd C all Bac k Fr i d a ys may be rescheduled or alternate days may be offered depending on the impact of the event on stud ents. Section Six - Resources for Displaced Students In the event of a catastrophic event, CUSOM may explore arranging temp orary hou sing and assist with other needs to the extent poss ible. 5.4 Dress Code Policy Students must maintain a pro fessional appearance and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell Univ ersity and on all clinical experiences or rotations. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes, and workshops. Men must wear dress trousers, appropriate shoes and socks, dress shirt and necktie. Women are required to wear appropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length (no higher than 2\" above the knee when sitting ) or slacks with appropriate blous es. Ch anging areas and lockers are provi ded for students to change into appropriate dress for OMM, Clinical Skills, and Anatomy labs. Students m a y wear appropriate casual attire after the normal end of the school day, Monday throu gh Friday, or on weekends, except when notified by the school administ ration. In addition, casual attire may be permitted during written exams during finals week at the discreti on of the Director of Student Affairs. All students must have at least one short, white consult ation jacket maintained in a clean and presentable condition. A clean and well-cared-for appearance shoul d be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well groom ed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, or students. Hairstyles should be c lean and neat, avoiding extreme length, styles, or colors. Revealing or tight, form fitting clothing is unacceptable. Beards and must aches must be neat and trimmed at all times. Excessive body pie rcings are not acceptable. Shorts , jeans , sweatpants, and T-shirts are not permit ted except in the OMM and Clinical Skill s labs wh en appropriate. Hats (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be wo rn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a hat (unless for r eligious reason s), cap, hoodie , or sunglasses will be asked to remov e it. Students who have tattoos must be aware that clinical rotation sites may require they be covered at all times while on the clinica l service. As such CUSOM encourages all students to cover their tattoos starting e arly on in their medical career while on -campus, and during clinical rotations, except when exposure is required during OMM or Clinical Skills labs. 107 Students inappropriately dressed or groom ed may be required to leave the campus or their clinical rotation a nd not return until appropriately attired. Any class, lab, or clinical rotation missed during this time will be considered an unexcu sed absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Office of Studen t Affairs or D epartment of Clinical Affairs, whose decision will be final. Repeated infraction s may be consid ered a professionalism issue resulting in referral to the Academi c Performanc e, Promotion, and Standards (APPS ) Committee . Additional Dress Code Requirements: Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. These include the laboratory classes of OMM, Anatomy, and Clinical Skills. OMM Laboratory Dress Code The dress requirement in the OMM lab sessions is designed to promote learning by providing optimal access to diagnostic observation and palpato ry experience. Wearing inapp ropriate clothing in terferes with a partner's experience of diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate attire must be clean and includ es any clothing that allows for easy visuali zation, examination, palpation, and treatment of the body areas being addressed. Avoid any heavy or thick-seamed clothing, clothing that restricts movem ent or visu alization of the area under examination, and any inapp ropriately revealing clothing. Students may need to remove their shirts to reveal the back, rib cage and abdome n. Women may wear sports bras or b athing suit tops beneath their shirts or scrubs during these lab sessions. Student may wear scrubs, or other apparel approved by the Course Director, over laboratory attire when not in the role of the patient. Students must r emove their sho es wh en serving in the role of a patient (no shoes are permitted on t he tables). Hats or oth er head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in the OMM lab. Religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obs cure the immedi ate area to be examined or treated (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immediately replaced after this portion of OMM tr aining. 108 Anatomy Laboratory Dress Code Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. CUSOM provides, and launders lab coats and disposable latex -free gloves. It is recommended that the student wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes that can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum is over. Wear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. The lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended. Close -toed shoes and long pants ar e required. Flip-flops, open -toed shoes, shorts and spaghetti -strap tops are not permitted. For ul trasound laboratories, appropriate attire must be clean and inclu des any clothing that allows for easy visuali zation, examination, and palpation of the body areas being addressed, which requires partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\"). Avoid any heavy or thick -seamed clothing; clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination; and any inappropriately revealing clothing. Students may need to remove tops their shirts to reveal the back, rib cage and abdomen. Women may wear sports bras or bathing suit tops beneath their shirts or scrubs during these lab sessions. Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in anatomy or ultrasound labs. In ultrasound labs, religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immedi ate area to be examined (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immedi ately replaced after this portion of ultrasound tr aining. Lockers are available in the locker rooms adjacent to the lab where stu dents may store their gross anatomy lab clothes. Students must provide their own locks and leave all their personal belongings in a locker instead of stacking them in the 4th floor lobby outs ide the l aboratory. Protective eyewear is suggested but not required (stud ents provide own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab (they may absorb the chemicals used in the laboratory). Clinical Skills Laboratory Dress Code Students are expected to dress appropriately for Clinical Skills laboratory exercises. App ropriate dress varies based on the activity of the day and will be clearly stated in the course syllabi. Unless otherwise stated, students will adhere to the standard \"CUSOM dress code\" as outlined in this Academic Bulletin. White consultation coats are required for all Clinical 109 Skills sessions. The laboratory sessions during Clinical Skills involve physical examination of classmat es, models, and stand ardized patients and students are expected to demonstr ate professionalism when examining p atients and classmat es. The development of a pro fessional approach is crucial. Students are required to fully participate in Clinical Skills labs which require physical examination. Random ly selected student lab partners allow for a broad range of exposure and experience diagnosing and treating patients with different body types, both male and female. No student will be required to examine, or be examined by, a classmate or faculty memb er for bre ast, genital, or rectal exams. However, the re will be sessions, such as when practicing examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, or extremities, which will require partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dr ess in a fashion that will allow examination of th ese areas (denoted as \"OMM D ress Code\"). Ladies should wear sports bras or bathing suit tops when exposure of the thorax is needed. No short shorts, tight garments, or attire with inappropriate slo gans, are allowed in Clinical Skills Lab sessions. Lab sessions requiri ng \"scrubs\" are annou nced in advance. For all encounters with Standardized Patients, formative and evaluated sessions, white coats are required to be worn. Professional dress and a white coat are required for ALL Final OSCE Examinatio ns. Faculty and sta ff reserve the right to refuse admission to students not compliant with dress code as set forth in this do cument. Students who are not permitted to participate in a clinical skills, simulation or OSCE lab or exam due to non -adherence to the dress code will receive an unexcused absence and may be issued a grade of zero (0) for any graded exercise. NO open-toed sho es are permitted at any time du ring Clinical Skills sessions. You are permitted to wear neat, clean athletic shoes or clogs when wearing \"scrubs\" or \"OMM d ress co de\". The course syllabi may provide additional requirements. 5.5 Global Assessment Throughout the CUSOM curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administ ered to assess student knowledge and performance. Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress on the basis of performance on written and practical examinations, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), in the clinical setting, and performance on n ational osteopathic board examinations . 110 The E xecutive Director of Ass essment, Accreditation and Medical Education, the Office of Clinical Affairs, the Office of Academic Affairs (including the R egistrar), as well as the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively with the Academic Performance, Promotion , and Standards Committ ee (APPS) Committee to determine each individual student's eligibility for prom otion or graduation, consider the results of the s tudent assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor condu ct and potential pro fessionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through t h e processes described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion , and Standards Committ ee (APPS) Committee for d isciplinary action or academic review, with recomm endations made to the Dean for final adjudication. 5.6 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The O ffice of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculu m, including clinical rotations, based on contact hours. Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Ost eopathic CUSOM (IRC, a subcommittee of the CUSOM Curriculum C ommittee), the CU SOM Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell Univ ersity Cur riculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM curriculum as part of the i nstitutional accreditation process. Campbell University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, masters, an d doctorate degrees. Contact the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033 -4097 or call 404 -679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Campbell University. Campbell Univ ersity was awarded Level VI accreditation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, at which time SACSCOC approved the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The SACSCOC approval reads: \"The Board of Trustees of the Southern Asso ciation of Colleg es and Schools C ommission on Colleg es reviewed the materials seeking approval of the Do ctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree 111 program. It was the decision of the Boa rd to approve the program and include it in the s cope of the current accreditation and to advance the institution to Level VI.\" Campbell Univ ersity is one of only four private unive rsities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accreditation status by SACSCOC . CUSOM's integrated curricular approach utilizes biomedical science and clinical faculty to explain concepts and prepare students in a logical sequence to become more clinically adept as they progress towards clinical rotations. The third and fourth year clinical rot ations provide opportunities for in-depth clinical exposure in a variety of core and elective rotations. CUSOM C redit Cal culation The CUSOM curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per Block of study with a designated number of weeks per Block. For the first two years of the curriculum, there are eight Blocks of study ranging from nine ( 9) weeks to eleven ( 11) weeks dur ation. For the third and fourth years, clinical rotations represent four-week (4) Blocks of time. Some clinical rotations may be div ided into shorter time i ntervals, such as two (2) weeks, as described in the Clinical Rotation Manual, and as approved by the As sociate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM assigns grades to all credit-bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined based on contact hours utilizing 0.5 credit increments. A minimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the r equirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next low er credit value. For example, a 1. 0 cr e dit course requires 16 cont act hours so a course of 10 contact hours would be assigned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour calculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards. Credit Review Process CUSOM assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in th is process conform to commonly accepted pr actices of higher education. CUS OM awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, u tilizing standards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admission Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid re gulations. Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM Curriculum Com mittee, as well as the Campbell Univ ersity Cur riculum Coun cil (UCC), as necessary. 112 To ensure appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM reviews credit assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The pro cess includes, but is not limited to, review of current standards of higher education, precedent established by other Colleges/Schools of Osteopathic Medicine, and consisten cy with the CUSOM Mission. The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review are maintain ed in the O ffice of Academic Affairs. All pro posed curricular changes, including minor and substantive changes, are brought to the Initial Review Committee (IRC), a subset of the Curriculum Commi ttee, and also the full Curriculum Committee for review, consideration and approval. Minor changes include such matters as the addition/elimination of a course, modifications to an e xisting course, or minor changes to existing program requirements. Substantive changes are those that involve extensive new patterns of requirements for existing students, or those that have a significant impact on other programs within the University. For proposed non-substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Block Leaders and Course Directors, in consultation with the Assistant Dean for Cur riculum, Associate D ean for Biomedical Affairs, Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, and finally by the Cur riculum Committee. For proposed non-substantive curricular changes in years 3 and 4, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the C linical Department Chairs, in consultation with the Associate Dean for C linical Affairs, Associate Dean for Cl inical Integration, or the Vice Dean for A cademic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, and finally by the Curriculum Committee. Upon approval at all levels, the proposed changes are then presented to the Dean for review and final approval. Any proposed substantive changes, as defined by the Com mission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA ), would follow procedures and deadlines as outlined in the COCA Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine A ccreditation Standards and Procedures document: The COCA must be notified of all substantive change requests, which the COM wishes to have reviewed at the n ext regularly scheduled meeting. The COM must notify the COCA of its substantive change request at least six ty (60) days prior to the next regularly scheduled me eting. 113 The COM must submit to the COCA all material that supports their substantive change request at least thirty (30) days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting. Documentation required for the substantive change submis sion would be submi tted as required. COCA Substantive Change Policies and Procedures are found at: https://osteopathic.org/wp Co lleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SAC SCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree-granting higher education institutions in the Southe rn states. As such, any proposed CUSOM su bstantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requirements and in a t imely manner. Grading CUSOM h as developed and publicized a grading system, in k eeping with the CUSOM Mission, to assess the progress of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential to effective performance as an osteopathic physician. Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum , students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in the Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for review. Addition ally, CUSOM maintains longitudin al records ma rking the career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. This assessment includ es: COMLEX-USA Level 1, COM LEX-USA Level 2- CE, Level 2-PE, and COMLEX-USA 3 passage rates; licensure; geographic area of practice; obtainment and completion of a postg raduate t r a i n i n g program; and AOA or ABMS board certification. CUSOM pu blishes outcomes of student performance in annual reports to the faculty and Board of Trustees. 114 CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades and clinical grades: Grading Scale MS-1 and and MS-4 Rotations Preceptor - Exam Grades Overall Final Grade Quality Points Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 H-H Hono rs rs 4.0 W Withdrew C 70-79 2.0 HP-HP High Pass 3.5 C*b 70 2.0 H-P High Pass 3.5 F < 70 0.0 HP-P High Pass 3.5 P 70 4.0 P-P Pass Clinical 3.0 P*b 70 2.0 PC*b Pass Clinical 2.0 FC Fail Clinical 0.0 FMP and PCC are P/F P = 4.0 QP F = 0.0 QP P* = 2 .0 QP PC = Pass Clinical FC = Fail Clinical a The maximum percentage cannot e xceed 100. Percentage grades are rounded to the tenth from 0.50 upwards, th erefore 82.50-82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful r emediation of an initial failing grade. Incomplete (IC) and Withdrew (W) do not carry any quality points. Remediation Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in this A cademic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for review and poss ible disciplina ry action. The APPS Committee may offer studen ts who fail any part of the curriculum an opportunity for r emediatio n. A student in the first (MS-1) or second (MS-2) year of studies, who fails any course, will appear before the APPS Com mittee. If the Com mittee gr ants the student the oppo rtunity to remediate, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remedi ation is complete. The student will receive a grade of C* for a graded course or P* for a Pass/Fail course after the successful remedi ation of the failed course. The C* or P* will remain on the transcript with the notation that the student passed after remedi ation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remedi ation or if the student fails the remedi ation. 115 A student in the th ird (MS-3) or fourth (MS-4) year of stud ies who f ails a clinical rotation will appear before the APPS Com mittee. If the Com mittee grants the student the oppo rtunity to remediate the rotation, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remedi ation is compl ete. The student will receive a PC* after the successful remediation of the failed rotation, and the PC* w ill appear on the transcript with the notation that the student passed the rotation after remedi ation. A student will earn a grade of FC if not allow ed remedi ation or if the student fails the remediation. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTU NITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND IS A DECI SION MADE BY THE APPS COMM ITTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASI S. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME THEY WILL BE GRANTED REMEDIATION. Grade Point Average (GPA) , Quality Points and Class Rank A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by div iding the total number of qu ality points earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purp oses of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not includ ed in \"graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 graded hours attempted, the grade point average would be 227/61 = 3.72 1. In the first two years of the CUSOM curriculum, most courses use a traditional letter grade system (A, B, C or F) and are calculated into the GPA. In the third and fourth years of the CUSOM curriculum, all rotations have a clinical rotation grade as determined through the student's rotation evaluation, and all core rotations have clinical modu les and end -of-rotation e xam grades. Both the clinical rotation grade and the /module portions of the rot ation grade u se an Hono rs, High Pass, Pass Clinical (PC*) Fail Clinical (FC) system. Successful completion of the rot ation requires students to pass both the clinical rotation (preceptor evaluation) and the end-of-rotation exam and/or module portions of the course. Students failing a post-rotation exam have a second oppo rtunity to pass the exam within thirty (30) days of notification. If the student fails the second attempt at the post-rotation exam, an F is recorded on the modu le/exam grade. Students who fail a clinical rotation either due to failure of the post-rotation exam or the preceptor evaluation will be reviewed and acted upon by the Academic Pe rformance, Promo tion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. If the APPS Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the failed rotation, the entire rotation and post-rotation exam must be repeated in order to successfully remediate the rotation . 116 No course or clin ical rotation grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affairs or the Office of Cl inical Affairs certifies to the Registrar, in writing, that an error occurred or that r emedi ation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for consid eration of a grade change only after the APPS Com mittee has convened and rendered their recommendation. NOTE: \"F\" grades. A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remedi ate the course w ill have the grade reported as Incomplete (IC) on his/her transcript until the prescribed remedi ation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The R egistrar will report current IC grades to the appropriate Asso ciate Dean at the time the IC is assigned. Once an IC grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. Students who fail to successful ly remedi ate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The hi ghest grade that can be earned for a remedi ated course is 70%. The new grade, if remedi ated successful ly, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the course to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The gr ade of C* represents a remedi ated, passed Graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pas s- Fail course. A successful ly remedi ated clinical rotation will be represented on the t ranscript as PC*, with the asterisk denoti ng a remedi ated clinical rotation. Quality Points Quality points are points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. CUSOM is on a four-point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"P\" is wo rth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) points per hour, a \"C\" is wo rth two (2.0) points per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, and zero ( 0) points a warded for \"F\" or failing grades. A student who earns an \"A\" in a three-hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hou rs = 12 total quali ty points. Incomplete (IC), Withdraw (W), and 3rd and 4th Year Clinical Rotation grades do not carry any quality points. Class Rank Students will be provid ed their class rank at the end of the first and second academic year. Class ranks are calculated after all final grades have been submitted at the end of each academic Block, from Block 1 throu gh Block 8, in Years One and Two. Class ranks are no lon ger calculated once a student starts clinical rotations beginning in Year Three. Class r anks are provid ed for informational purposes only, and are only released to the student. Students who do not wish to receive information regarding their class rank may opt out of this notification by contacting the Registrar. 117 The class rank has no di rect correlation to the stud ent's cumulative GPA. Final grades in all cou rses and rotations are calculated into the cumulative GPA throu ghout all four years. Class ranks are based solely upon the numerical grades earned in each course across Blocks 1 throu gh 8. For example, two students could have a 4.00 GPA but one could be ranked number 1 and the other ranked number 6. The student ranked first achieved higher nume rical grades in some courses (e.g., Student 1 earned a grade of 99% in An atomy while S tudent 6 earned a grade of 93% in An atomy). Class ranks are not reported on student transcripts, however higher ranks may be identifi ed on the M edical Student Performance Evaluatio n. Assessment Outcome objectives have been mapp ed to the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that all CUSOM graduates achieve the in tended learning out comes. The CUSOM Compr ehensive Assessment Plan sum marizes additional methods and metrics that are tracked for continual program evaluation and improvement. Assessment of knowl edge is conducted by multiple-choice examinations and quizzes administered at scheduled and random intervals. Laboratory, including anatomy, OMM, clinical skills, simulation and OSCE assessments are in written or verbal exam format. Assessment of performance on clinical rotations is by end-of-rotation examinations, pr eceptor evaluations and related method s. Assessment of performance compared to national cohorts occurs through the end-of-rotation COM AT exam and the Compr ehensive Ost eopathic Medical Licensing Examinations (COM LEX-USA Levels 1, 2 -CE, 2-PE and 3). Grading for Years One and Two Eval uation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUS OM recognizes four categories of evaluation modalities, includin g, but not limited to: 1. Integrated written examinations 2. Laboratory practical examinations 3. Quizzes 4. Other (e.g., SIM performance, Early Clinical Experiences, Projects) Each category is represented within the CUSOM curriculum. A course gra d e can be determined by any combination of the components listed above as determin ed by the Course Director and approved by the Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration. 118 Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the four categories identifi ed previous ly, yet also provide consisten cy across courses, CUSOM recognizes the followi ng approach to testing and grading: Integrated exams typically occur three times in each Block in years 1 & 2. FMP, PCC, OMM and Clinical Skills course questions are not inclu ded on the integra ted exams except where they are consistent with discip line content in other courses. All other courses may have questions on integrated exams. OMM and Clinical Skills have separate didactic exams, as well as their Pr actical and Lab exams, as required. Quizzes are typically administered each Friday morning of the MS-1 and MS-2 curriculum. These are integra ted and inclu de questions f rom lectures given in the sp ecified preceding 3-4 ins truction days. Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty. Course grades are typically determined based on percentage of total points earned out of total points poss ible. Grades are defined by the course-grading plan approved prior to start of the course and delineated in the course syllabi . As su ch, bonus points are not pe rmitted. In rare instance s, there may be exceptions to the establish ed Grading Policy, whi ch require jus tification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the students at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive their course grades. Grading for Years Three and Four The prim ary basis for the core clinical rotation grade is the \"CUSOM Student Evaluation Form\" and the end-of-rotation exam. The end-of-rotation exam is given at the end of the four-week block for select core rotations. The CUSOM Student Ev aluation Form is completed by the student 's clinical faculty preceptor or that clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) following completion of the rotation and should be discus sed with the student before submis sion. For rot ations without an end-of-rotation exam, the student's grade is based solely on the clinical faculty's evaluation of the studen t. 1. Some selective and elective four-week rotations may be divided into two (2) dif ferent two-week experiences. In such cases, students will receive a grade as determined by the preceptor for each two-week experience. The overall grade for the four-week rotation will be the combination of the two (2) two-week experience grades. Students who fail either two-week 119 rotation, even if the average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotation block and will be called to the APPS Committee for r eview. 2. End-of-rotation Examination End-of-rotation exams are administered after the following third- and fourth- year rotations: Internal Medicine II, Surgery, Obst etrics/Gynecology, Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Em ergency Medicine. Students must pass the end-of-rotation exam to pass the rotation. Students who do not pass an end-of-rotation exam are allowed one chance to retake the exam. If the student passes the exam retake, the highest grade possible is a Pass Clinical (PC*) and they are not eligible for High Pass (HP) or Hono rs (H) for that clinical rotation. If the end-of-rotation exam is failed twice, the student will receive a failing grade for the rot ation (Fail Clinical, FC) and be re ferred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. If the APPS Committee grants the student the opportunity to reme diate the failed rotation, the entire rotation and post-rotation exam must be repeated in order to successfully remediate the rotation . If the student passes the remediation, a grade of PC* is assigned. If remedi ation is failed, a grade of FC is assigned. 3. Completion of Learning Modules on Clinical Rotation Various clinical rot ations, such as Pediatrics, Internal Medicin e, Family Medicin e, General Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Psychiatry utilize eviden ce-based, medi cal education online modu les to supplement learning in an effort to uni fy the CUSOM curriculum across all of the Regional Sites. They are mand atory/required as described in the syllabi and are mon itored by the r espective CUSOM Clinical Chairs. CUSOM Clinical Chairs select high-yield educational modu les for the student to complete du ring the Clin ical Rotation. Comp letion of these modules will be required in order to pass the rotation and advance to the next Clinical Rotation. The student must complete all educational modu les to the required level of engagement which is verified by the respective Clinical Chair . Comp letion of learning modu les are due on the last Friday of the rotation. In extenuating circumstances, CUSOM Clinical Chairs may grant a limited time extension to complete the modules . 120 If the learning modu les are not completed in the defined timeframe, the student will receive a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC) and will be r eferred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. 4. Preceptor Evaluation of the Student and Student Evaluation of the Preceptor All evaluations must be completed and submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. Courses of eight (8) weeks duration (example: Internal Medicine) require an evaluation to be completed at the end of each four -week block. If a student has an approved rotation of two (2) weeks duration, the evaluation is to be completed at the end of the 2-week period. If a student does not receive a passing grade on the end - of-rotation evaluation from the preceptor, the student will fail the rotation and receive an FC grade on their transcript. Rotation grades for students who are permitted to split a four (4) week selective or elective rotation into two different t wo-week experiences will be the combination of the two 2 -week experience grades. Students who fail either two -week rotation, even if the average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotati on block and will be called to the APPS Committee for review. Competency -based rating forms with Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) behavioral anchors are used by preceptors to evaluate each student's clinical skills and the application of medical kn owledge in the clinical setting. A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Students failing a rotation may be required to repeat the failed rotation and be placed on a Mo dified Course of Study, which may delay the student's date of graduation. The CUSOM compet ency-based evaluation is based on the following core compet encies in each area: Osteopathic Philosop hy and Osteopathic Manipulative edicine Medical Patient Care Interpersonal and Comm unication Skills Professionalism Practice-Based Learning and Improv ement System s-Based Practice In order to receive a grade for each rotation, the student must ensure the Student Evaluation Form, Site Ev aluation Form, end-of-rotation examination, rot ation learning modu les, and the clinical experience database (logs) are complete and received by the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Failure to complete any rotation requirement or submit any required rotation document ation may result in a grade of Incomplete (IC) and referral to the APPS committee. 121 Items wh ich may also be used to det ermine grades on clinical rot ations include but are not limited to : 1. Educational modules - Lectures, cases, reading assignments and other forms of d elivery that may be utiliz ed in the third and fou rth ye ar curriculum. 2. Students Logs (Procedure Logs) - Students must submit rot ation clinical patient logs and proc edure logs. 3. Question Bank Review - Students are r equired to compl ete COMBA NK qu estions during each clinical rotation in order to re ceive credit for the rot ation. 4. Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine - Compl etion of OMM spe cial assignments and participation in lab during C all Back Fridays for core rotations are required. 5. Objective Structured Clinical Performance Examination (OSCE) and Standardized Patient (SP) Exercises - OSCE and SP exercises demonstr ate the student's ability to p erform clinical skills and to evaluate p atient pres entations for the most common disord ers fou nd in adult and pediatric patients. Multi -station OSCEs will be given at end of fi rst, second, and third years of the CUSOM curriculum. These include taking a medi cal history, evaluating signs and symptoms to fo rmulate a dif ferential diagnosis, p erforming a physic al examination, assessing the results of diagnostic ex ams to evaluate and n arrow a differ ential diagnosis, demonstr ating the ability to manage common medi cal scenarios, and providing appropriate documentation of the patient encounter in the form o f a SOAP note. OSCE, Simulation and Clinic al Skills may also be in corpor ated into C all Back Fridays. Preceptor Eval uation of Student Performance A clinical facult y preceptor or a clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) will evaluate a student's performance during the respective rot ation. The Student Evaluation Form will be completed by supervising physicians with input from appropriate hospital staff with direct knowledge of the student's p erformance. Based on the grading rubric, a grade of Honors, High Pass, Pass, or Fail Clinical for the preceptor evaluation will be submi tted to the Registrar's Office. Students will have access to the electronic Student Evaluation Form (grade form), Site Evaluation Form, and procedure l ogs via the CUSOM web -based evaluation system. During the last week of each rotation the student must me et with the preceptor to review their performance and end of rotation evaluatio n. 122 Comp leted Student Evaluation Forms are due in the O ffice of Cl inical Affairs with in seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. If the stu dent worked with s everal physicians, the student should have the prin cipal evaluator or the clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) submit a composi te evaluation based on the input of tho se physicians the student worked with. Evaluations of student performance must be completed by the princip al evaluator who must be an attending physician. While resident physicians may provide input to aid the attending physician in completing the evaluation, residents are not permitted to serve as the prim ary evaluator. Students are not permitted to self-complete the evaluation and submit to the evaluator for a signature. Violation of this rule or falsification of any component of the Student Evaluation Form will be considered an Honor Code violation. Violation of this policy will be subject to review by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) committee and m ay result in a rotation f ailure or Incomplete (IC) grade. Any Incomplete (IC) grade will jeopardize student eligibility for financial aid and m ay also alt er/delay their graduation date. It is the studen t's respons ibility to ensure that all clinical evaluation forms are either completed online or submitted to the Clinical Affairs Office within seven (7) d ays of completion of each rotation. It is the studen t's respons ibility to expedient ly info rm the Office of Clinical Affairs of any difficulty in obtaini ng an evaluation from the p receptor at the end of that rotation. Only one Student Evaluation Form from the clinical faculty preceptor (preceptor of record), principal evaluator, rotation clerkship director (or designee) will be accepted. Students will not be permitted to add additional evaluati on forms from other clinical faculty from the rotation i nto the final evaluation form. All submitted Student Evaluation Forms are final. Any factual or typographical errors should be reported to the Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinica l Coordinator, as appropriate. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will review and approve any requested changes. Composite Evaluations As men tioned in other sections of this bulletin, it is possible to have a Student Evaluation Form filled out by a clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee). If such a composite evaluation is completed, it is expected the author of the evaluation form will consult with 123 other clinical faculty, nursing staff, and members of the healthcare team who interacted with the student during the clinical rotation to provide accurate and constructive feedback of the student's overall rotation performance. Only one Student Evaluation Form from the rotation clerkship director (or designee) will be acc epted. Students are not permitted to solicit additional evaluation forms from other clinical faculty on the rotation into the final evaluation form. Students who solicit additional evaluations may be brought before the APPS Committee. All submitted Stud ent Evaluation Forms are final. Any factual or typographical errors should be reported to the Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator, as appropriate. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will review and approve any reques ted changes. The overall respons ibility to ensure that evaluations have been completed and returned to the Office of Clinical Affairs (or site coordinator if indicated) remains with the student. For this reason, stude nts are respons ible for setting up a time to review their final evaluation with their preceptor during the last week of the rotation to discuss their overall performance and obtain their preceptor si gnature on the evaluation. While the summative Student Rotation Evaluation must be completed and submi tted at the end of the rotation, students are to regularly, includi ng the end of the first and every week of each clinical rotation, r equest feedback from the pr eceptor, (e.g., \"How am I doi ng?\", \"Are there things I should improve?\") on a regular basis, in ord er to continually address areas that need improvement. This provid es students an oppo rtunity to improve any deficient areas while on the rotation, and prevents an unexpected poor evaluation at the end of the rot ation. Students bear total respons ibility to seek this ongoing feedback. Students should check with the O ffice of Cl inical Affairs (or site coordin ators if dir ected), regularly to confirm they have received the Student Rotation Evaluation. Clinical Affairs sta ff may ass ist the studen t in obtaining an evaluation if a preceptor fails to complete the evaluation form or to turn it in to the Office of Clinical Affairs or site coordin ator in the required timeframe. Preceptor com ments from the Student Rotation E valuations will be includ ed on the M edical Student Performance Evaluation (MS PE). 124 Delinquent Evaluations During the second week of the rotation, the CUSOM Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator will enter the info rmation provid ed by the R egional Site coordi nators in to CUSOM's w eb-based evaluation system. It is CUSOM's expectation the Clinical Faculty preceptor will complete the Student Rotation Evaluation at the end of the fourth week of the rotation and review it with the stud ent to provide constru ctive criticism and feedback. Obtaining a Student Ro tation Ev aluation in a timely fashion is c ritical to ensure an up-to-date and accurate student academic record and transcript. At the end of the fi rst week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator run a report in CUSOM's web-based evaluation system to see identify any incomplete Student Rotation Evaluations. They report these findin gs to the correspondi ng student, Regional , and Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate) . The Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate) directly contacts the Cl inical Faculty preceptor to remind him/her of the pending Rotation Evaluation. At the end of the second week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator run another report in CUSOM's w eb-based evaluation system to identify any remaini ng incomplete Student Rotation Evaluations. These are communicated to the corresponding student, Regional Site Coordin ator, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate) , and Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs. The Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs, in collaboration with the Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate) , directly contacts the Clinical Faculty preceptor to obt ain the pending Rotation Evaluatio n. If the Clinical Rotation Evaluation is not completed by the third week following a Clinical Rotation, the R egional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate) or a designee student's evaluation. 125 Duri ng Ro tation Site Student Education Coo rdinator (RSC) obtain updated Clinical Faculty preceptor contact information from students. WEEK 2 Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator (RSC) input information provided by Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinators into CUSOM's we b-based evaluation system. WEEK 3 Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator (RSC) match student to Clinical Faculty preceptor & email is sent at end of week notifying of rotation evaluation. WEEK 4 (Week 2 if a two-week rot ation) Student Rotati on Evaluation is completed at end of week and reviewed with student. WEEK 2 CUSOM Co ordinators re-run web-based evaluati on system and sends to the student, RSC, RD/DSME and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs RD/DSME conta ct Clinical Faculty preceptor di rectly. WEEK 3 If Student Rotation Evaluation not complete, RD/DSME or designee will complete student's evaluation WEEK 1 CUSOM CUSOM's web-based evaluation system report of incomp lete Student Rotation Evaluations and sends to the student, RSC and Regional Dean (RD) or DSME . RD/DSME contacts Clinical Faculty preceptor directly 126 Rotations, Course Remediation and Academic Probation Failure of a clinical rotation occurs if the st udent fails either the preceptor evaluation of the student or the end-of-rotation exam after his/her second attempt. Failure of a clinical rotation (grade of Fail Clinical, FC) for either reason will result in a referral to the APPS committee for review. If the student is permitted to remedi ate, they will be requir ed to repeat the entire rotation, including any associated modu les and end-of-rotation exam, and may be placed on Academic Probation. Mandatory repeating of a clinical rotation will result in the institution of a Modifi ed Course of Study, which may result in a delay of graduation. The student will incur additional tuition costs for the repeated rotation. Failure of a second clinical rotation is eviden ce that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice and may result in dismissal f rom the program. Students who fail a clinical rotation for any reason will come b efore the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards ( APPS) Committee. In addition, repeated p erformance evaluations in whi ch items pe rformed in a specific category or across categories are rated as \"1's\" or \"2's\", e ven if the student achieves a passing rot ation grade, will be reason for remediation at the discretion of the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs in consultation with the Clinical Chair, the clinical faculty preceptor, o r the APPS Committee. The Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs will investi gate any evaluation rating of \"2's\" or less on any compe tency regardless of an overall passing grade. The findin gs of this investigation may lead to a follo w-up meeting with the As sociate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate) , or Clinical Chair, or result in referral to the APPS Com mittee. Students a r e e x p e c t e d show a progression of improvement in performance during the course of clinical rotations. Students who fail to perform satisfactorily on clinical rot ations as described above, will be referred to the APPS Com mittee and may result in additional required curriculum, repeat of an academic year, or d ismissal f rom the p rogram. Poor r atings or precept or comments on the clinical evaluation in the professional and ethical areas of the assessment of a student are addressed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and may result in a remediation appropriate to correct the deficient area. The Associate D ean of Clinical Affairs m ay refer the student for an APPS Com mittee hearing which will act upon this referral depending on the severity and the area of the performance measure. Poor ratings related to professional and ethical behavior area must be accompanied by comments as to the exact nature of the rating. 127 Academic Probation MS-3 or MS -4 students may be placed on academic probation for: Failing to successful ly remedi ate an end-of-rotation examination failure Failing a clinical rotation Failing a preceptor evaluation f or any rotation Failing two end-of-rotation examination s for any two rotations. 5.7 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standi ng is defined as a student's status at any time within a given academic Block or clinical rotation of the CUSOM curriculum. A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all courses or rotations at any given point in time. This information is used in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM approved activities, such as confer ences, student organizations, etc... Students wishing to s erve as officers in clubs/organizations or participate in events, travel to meetings or ot her related activities must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 s cale to be considered. Academic Progress for students in years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all Blocks, successful ly completing all curricular requirements in the Blocks, p assing all components of the end-of-year testin g, and meeting the requirements as set forth by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for students, including those in a Modifi ed Course of Study. Students must also demonstr ate adequate development in pro fessionalism as determined by the faculty and administration. In order to be permitted to sit for COM LEX-USA Level 1, students must achieve a passing s core, as determined by CUSOM, on a CUSO M-identifi ed Qualifying Exam. Each student must pass COMLEX-USA Level 1 in order to be promoted to full third-year status. Successful academic progress for students in Years 3 and 4 of the curriculum includ es successful completion of all rotations, end-of-rotation exams, and any other requirements, including but not limited to, clinical modu les, procedure and patient logs, Call Back Fridays, and their evaluations of the site and their preceptor. In addition, students who h ave been placed in a Modified Course of Study must meet any requirements set forth by the APPS Com mittee. Each student must pass the COMLEX-USA Level 2 Cognitive Evaluation (CE) as well as the CO MLEX-USA Level 2 Physical Examination (PE) prior to graduation. In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE, the student must achieve a passing score on a CUSOM -identified Qualifying Exam. 128 If a student fails to attain the passing score after three (3) attempts at the Qualifying Exam, the student will be required to successful ly complete a board preparation program pr escribed by CUSOM, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbo otcamp.co m), at the student's expense and not to exceed twelve (12) weeks duration, or as approved by the AP PS Committee. In order to be permitted to take COM LEX-USA Level 2-PE, the student must successful ly pass an Obje ctive Structural Clinical Examination (OSCE) administered during R esiden cy Development month. If the student fails to pass this OSCE, they will undergo a remediation program at the direction of the Chair of Simulation Medicine or designee. Students are not r eleased to take the COMLEX- USA Level 2-PE exam until approved by the Chair of Simulation Medi cine or designee. Students who experience difficulty su ccessful ly completing elements of the CUSOM curriculum or any level of the COMLEX examination series in a timely manner according to the academic calendar may be required to complete a board preparation program or be pla ced in to a combination curriculum /remediation program (Modifi ed Course of Stu dy). Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must agree to comply with the plan as determined by the APPS Com mittee. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress in the Modifi ed Course of Stu dy, they will remain in ful l-time status. Students who do not follow the Modifi ed Course of Study, or who do not make satisfactory academic progress while in a Modifi ed Course of Study, may be referred to the APPS Com mittee for additional required remediation, or additional sanctions up to, and including, dis missal from the program . Fourth -year students should refer to the Graduation Requirements section for fu rther information regarding graduation requirements. Students not making satisfactory academic progress towards graduation will be r eferred to the APPS Com mittee for review and further recommendations, which may include but is not limited to, placement on a Modifi ed Course of Study, Academic Probation or Dismis sal from the program . 129 5.8 National Board (Licensing) Exams Students are required to pass the COMLEX-USA Level 1, COMLEX-USA Level 2- CE, and the COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE prior to graduation as outlined in the table of mileston es below. Milestones for Each CUSOM Student Successful Completion of All Courses During Blocks 1 -8 Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Exam for COMLEX -USA Level 1 Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 1 Successful Completion of COM AT or Equivalent Subject Examinations for Core Rotations Satisfactory Evaluation by Clinical Faculty for Each Clinical Rotation Successful Completion of Third-Year OSCEs that Assesses Student Preparedness for the CO MLEX-USA Level 2-PE Exam, and Core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) for Entering Residency Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Exam for COMLEX Level 2-CE Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 2-CE Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 2-PE Accommodations on COMLEX-USA Exams Students who want to request accommodations for any CO MLEX-USA examination must submit their applications directly to the NBOME within the timeframe designated by the NBOME. Please contact the NBOME directly for more information. CUSOM is not respons ible for the request or approval for COMLEX testing accommodations. 130 COMLEX-USA Level 1 CUSOM s tudents compl ete the Clinical Applic ations of Biomedical Sciences (CABS) I and II courses in Blocks 5 and 8, respectively, and MUST sit for COMLEX-USA Level 1 prior to July 1 in the period between the second and third academic year. Prior to receiving their COM LEX-USA Level 1 scores, all studen ts, including tho se on appeal for failure to complete any required coursework, may be consid ered \"provisional\" th ird year students and allowed to participate in clinical rotations. Full th ird-year status is not g ranted until a student p asses CO MLEX-USA Level 1. Students are provid ed a course of study with in Block 8 which serves as a capstone to the first two years of the curriculum, and also should assist in final preparation for n ational licensing exams. This course of study is credit- bearing and is provided by CUSOM. In order to be permitted to sit for COM LEX-USA Level 1, the student must achieve a pre-identifi ed \"passing\" score on a Qualifying Exam. CUSOM identifi es the passing parameters by the end of Block 5 each year. CUSOM pays for the first Qualifying Exam, however students may be respons ible for the cost of subsequent exams or programs. Students are allowed thr ee (3) attempts to achieve a minimum pr e-identifi ed score on the Qualifying Exam. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX-USA Level 1 prior to passing the qu alifying exam; however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre-ident ified score are not permitted to take COMLEX-USA Level 1. Students who do not pass the Qualifying Exam after three (3) consecutive attempts are referred to the APPS committee and placed in a Modifi ed Course of Study, during whi ch they will be required to complete a Boards preparation program, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsboot camp.co m), at the student's expense and not to exceed a timeframe established by the APPS Committee . A Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as mandated board preparation, required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withdrawals. Students on a Modified Course of Study must agree to and comply with the conditions and schedule of the Modified Course of Study. Students not following the individualized plan may be placed on Suspension (thus ineligible for financial aid and not considered an active student) at any time 131 Upon successful completion of the designated bo ard pr eparation course of the Modifi ed Course of Study, the student is required to take COMLEX-USA Level 1 within a time frame as approved by the APPS Com mittee. Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible sanctions imposed for non -adherence to the agreed process. Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 1 Any student who fails COMLEX-USA Level 1 must meet with the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. The student will be placed on Academic Probation and subject to sanctions as described below. Students who fail COM LEX-USA Level 1 are required to complete a Boards preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsboot camp.co m), at the student's expense and within a time frame as approved by the APPS Committee. This requires the student to enter a Modif ied Course of Stu dy. A student who fails COMLEX-USA Level 1 on their fi rst attempt, but has already completed a CUSOM approved or designated Boards pr eparation program prior to taking CO MLEX-USA Level 1, may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not an active stud ent) or be r equired to complete a dif ferent preparation prog ram prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to the PASS Program (https://www.pass-program.com /). Participation in the requi red preparation program will be a t the student's expense and within a timeframe as approved by the APPS Committee. This requires the student to enter a Modifi ed Course of Study. If the student is already on a Modified Course of Study, adjustments to th e MCOS may be required. In either case, a Modified Course of Study may result in a delay in the completion of program requirements and graduation, which may in turn affect their ability to participate in the residency match process . Upon successful completion of the remedi al program, the student is required to retake COMLEX-USA Level 1 for the second attempt with in a time frame as approved by the APPS Com mittee. Any student who fails COMLEX-USA Level 1 a second time must again meet with the APPS Com mittee. The student may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for fin ancial aid and not an active studen t) or be required to complete a boards pr eparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, the PASS Program (https://www.pass-program.com /) at the student's expense and within a time frame as approved by the APPS Com mittee. This 132 requires the student to enter a Modif ied Course of Study. If the student is already on a Modified Course of Study, adjustments to the MC OS may be required. In either case, a Modified Course of Study may result in a delay in the completion of program requirements and graduation, which may in turn affect their ability to participat e in the residency match process . Upon successful completion of the remedi al program, the student is required to retake COMLEX-USA Level 1 for the th ird, and final, time within a timeline designated by the APPS Com mittee. A student is permitted only th ree (3) attempts to pass COMLEX-USA Level 1, after whi ch they will be dismissed from the program. Students who have been removed from clinical rotations for a COMLEX-USA Level 1 failure may be permitted to return to clinical rotations following their retaking of the exam, while waiting f or release of their COMLEX-USA Level 1 score. COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE Third year students must take and pass an end-of-rotation exam after each core rotation. In addition to demonstr ating the studen t has learned the appropriate material on the rot ation, the exams function to prepare students for COMLEX- USA Level 2-CE. In addition, at the end of the third year students must take and pass Standardized Patient (S P) Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) exams. These exams are administered to assure the student has compet ently achieved the clinical skills expected in the third year and to p repare the student for COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE testing. Students must schedule their COML EX-USA Level 2-CE no lat er than March 15 of the MS-3 year and take the exam no later than November 1 of the MS-4 year unless o therwise ap proved. In order to sit for COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE, the student must achieve a passing score as determined by CUS OM on a Qualifying Exam, such as a CUSO M- proctored College of Ost eopathic Medicine Self-Assessment Exam (COMSAE) or a similar exam. CUSOM identifi es the p assing parameters for this exam and pays for the first Qualifying Exam, with students respons ible for the cost of subseq uent exams. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE prior to passing the Qu alifying Exam; however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre-identifi ed score on three (3) consecutive attempts are not permitted to take COM LEX-USA Level 2-CE. 133 If the student fails to attain the passing score on the designated qualifying exam after three attempts, the student is required to successful ly complete a Boards preparation program pr escribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com). Participation in the required preparation program will be at the stu dent's expense and within a time frame as approved by the APPS Committee. The APPS Comm ittee may recommen d that a student be removed from clinical rotations while comp leting a Boards preparation program. Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelin es related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible sanctions imposed for non -adherence to the agreed process . In order to sit for COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE, the student must successfully pass the Obje ctive Structural Clinical Examinations ( OSCE) that are administered during R esiden cy Development month, which generally corresponds to the first rotation of the fou rth year. If the student fails to pass the OSCE, they will undergo a remedi ation prog ram at the d irection of the Simulation Medicine D epartment, Chair of Simulation Medicine or other d esignee. Students are not released to take the COMLEX- USA Level 2-PE exam until approved by the Chair of Simulation Medicine or other designee. Students who fail the OSCE exam are required to successfully complete the designated remedi ation program a minimum of fou rteen (14) days prior to taking CO MLEX-USA Level 2-PE. Students who do not successful ly remedi ate will have their COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE release withdr awn. Students are required to take COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE by October 1 in their fourth year. As it takes a minimum of ninety (90) days to receive scores for COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE, it may be to the student's advantage to take this exam earlier in order to provide them with ample time to retake the exam prior to graduation in the case that th ey do not pass the exam. Passing both COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE and COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE is required to graduate. In addition, most residen cy programs require students to pass COMLEX- USA Level 2-CE to match with their program. Some residency programs also require pro of of passing COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE prior to interviewing with their program. 134 Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 2-CE or COMLEX-USA Level Level 2-CE and COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE is required to graduate. Students who do not pass both CE and PE by graduation within the maximum number of three (3) attempts each will be placed on Suspension. Students on Suspension do not q ualify for financial aid and are not active student s. Students are not removed from Suspension until they demonstr ate a passing score on the deficient exam(s). Students on Suspension for a period exceeding six (6) mon ths will be reviewed by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee and are subject to dis missal from the p rogram. Any stu dent who fails their initial attempt on COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE will be immedi ately placed on Academic Probation and, as determined by the APPS Com mittee, will be withdr awn from clinical rotations until they successfully pass the exam. Any student who fails COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE must meet with the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the APPS Com mittee within seven (7) days of receiving a failing score. Students who f ail COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE will be required to complete a remedi al prog ram prescribed by CUSO M, such as, but not limited to, Boards Boot Camp (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com), at the student's expense and within a time frame as approved by the APPS Committee. Upon successful completion of the remedi al program, the student will be required to retake COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE within a time frame as approved by the APPS Committee. Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure t o do so will result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible sanctions imposed for non -adherence to the agreed process. Students who h ave been removed f rom clinical rotations due to a CO MLEX- USA Level 2-CE failure are placed in a Modifi ed Cour se of Study and may be permitted to return to clinical rotations following their retaking of the exam while waiting for release of their COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE score by the NBOME . Students who are uns uccessful on the second attempt of the COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE will be referred to the APPS Com mittee and may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid). Students on Suspension for a period exceeding six (6) months will be reviewed by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and may be dismissed from the program. A student is permitted only three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX- USA Level 2-CE, after which th ey will be dismissed from the program. 135 A Modifi ed Course of Study (MCOS) is individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the respective Asso ciate Dean and approved by the APPS Com mittee. Students in a Modifi ed Course of Study must agree to and comply with the conditions and schedule of the Modifi ed Course of Study. Students not follo wing the MCOS m ay be placed on Suspension (thus in eligible for financial aid and not consid ered an active student) at any time. Students must p ass COMLEX-USA Level 1, COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE and COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE in order to meet graduation requirements. Students are allowed a maximum of three (3) attempts to pass each of these exams. Failure to p ass any of these exams during the required timeframe will result in a referral to the APPS Com mittee and will r esult in dismissal from the program. 5.9 Modified Courses of Study A Modified Cour se of Study (MCOS) is a credit-bearing, individuali zed study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as mandated board pr eparation, required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withd rawals. The Modifi ed Course of Study will be individual ly designed based upon the student's performance and n eeds by the respective Asso ciate Dean and approved by the APPS Com mittee. Students in a Modifi ed Course of Study must agree to, and comply with, the conditions and schedule of the Modifi ed Course of Study. Students not follo wing the MCOS may be pla ced on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not consid ered an active studen t) at any time. During clinical rotations, students following a Modi fied Course of Study should be aware that they must complete all program requirements to graduate, enter ERAS (Electronic Residency Ap plication Service) and participate in the Match. Students who fail COMLEX Level 2-PE or COM LEX Level 2-CE after the Match may lose their matched position . In addition, students who fail to meet their graduation requirements in adequate time to st art their residency program may also lose their matched position. These decisions are made by the Residency Program Director or Director of Medical Education at the respective hospital. A student in a Modifi ed Course of Study who does not adhere to the requir ements and parameters of the MCOS, including but not limited to, not following directions of an assigned program such as Boards Boot Camp or the PA SS Program, may be placed on Suspension. 5.10 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Committee, in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs, monitors the academic progress achieved by all students throu ghout the entire CUSOM academic prog ram. 136 The APPS Com mittee meets at the end of any Block or clinical rotation to review students who h ave achieved a failing course or clinical rotation grade, failed to successfully remedi ate a failed course, when a delay in a studen t's academic progress is identified, or when deemed n ecessary. The Chair of the APPS Com mittee or the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved may also call a meeting of the APPS Com mittee in cases where the academic progress of a student is affected by a leave of absence or other factors. Addit ionally, the APPS Com mittee is respons ible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic miscondu ct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism), violations of the Honor Code or Code of Mis condu ct, or u nprofessional condu ct.

All current or former students returni ng from an approved period away from CUSO M, such as, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Secondary Appli cation, Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. A subs et of the Adm issions Committee, consist ing of the Vice Dean for A cademic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration and Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. Students who do n ot return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. In order to return from any approved separation, the student must provide the Dean with do cumen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved separation. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will deter mine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on board exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. 146 Leave of Absence A Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. A leave of absence is a temporary separation from CUSOM which m ay not last longer than 180 calendar days. Reasons for a leave include, but are not limited to, academic, personal, medical, and maternity. If a leave exceeds beyond 180 calendar days, it will become a Withdr awal. A Leave of Absence is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Director of Student Affairs, who then provides it to the Dean. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Leave of Absence request. A Leave of Absence request requires completion of a Leave of Absence form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM issued items depending upon the specific circumstances of the Leave of Absence. The date for a Leave of Absence is the d ate of the Dean's approval of the L eave of Absence request. Academic Leave of Absence An Academic Leave of Absence is a unique situation, usually o f a one -year duration, which may be granted to students wishing to pursue additional educational, experiential activities or scholarly pursuits that interrupt a student 's medical education. Upon completion of this additional educational, experiential activity or scholarly pursuit, the student minimally must submit a completed Secondary Appli cation, Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. In order to return from any approved Academic Leave of Absence , the student must provide do cumen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Academic Leave of Absence .

In order to return from any approved Personal Leave of Absence, the student must provide the Dean with do cumen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Personal Leave of Absence. Once approved for re turn, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Re commendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on board exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Students who do n ot return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. Medical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standin g, who provide acceptable supporti ng document ation indicating a valid medi cal reason requiri ng a leave of less than 180 calendar days. Decisions regarding the granting of a medi cal leave are determined by the Dean. A Medical Leave of Absence may last no longer than 180 calendar days, if it extends beyond 180 calendar days it will become a Medi cal Withdr awal. In order to return from an approved medi cal leave, the student must provide the Dean with do cumen tation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full time student in the curriculum. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved medical leave to determine where the student 148 will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required . Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on board exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Students who do n ot return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission.

O n c e a p p r o v e d f o r r e t u r n , the APPS Com mittee will determine placement of a student who h as taken an approved medical lea ve to determine where the stude nt will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on board exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Students who do n ot return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. 149 Student Maternity Leave of Absence CUSOM adheres to, and follows, federal guidelines for granting leave for students who give birth while enrolled in the curriculum. A Maternity Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standin g, who provide acceptable supporti ng document ation indicating the date of birth, a clearance from her treating physician and an expected date of return to CUSOM on a full -time, unrestricted basis. Decisions regarding the granting of a maternity leave are determined by the Dean. A Maternity Leave of Absence extending mo re than 180 calendar days will require the student to file for a Medical Withdrawal. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS-1 & MS -2), or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 & MS -4), and the Director of Stude nt Affairs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated maternity leave. The student will provide the Director of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of requested leave. Once the student delivers, the student will provide a medical note from her medical provider with an anticipated return -to-school date. This date should be the date when the student is medically cleared to resume all activities of the curriculum as a full -time student, with no restrictions. If the treating physician places an activity or time restriction on the student, the nature of the restriction(s) and the time frame for these restrictions must be well defined. Based on the date or return to full -time status, either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs for MS -1 & M S-2 students, or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs for MS -3 & MS -4 students will develop a proposed Modified Schedule. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs will work with the Course Directors, Medical Education, Registrar, and Student Affairs t o develop the Modified Schedule for MS -1 and MS -2 students. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will work with the student's Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education, clerkship coordinator, Registrar and Student Affairs to develop the Modif ied Schedule for MS -3 and MS -4 students. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS-1 & MS -2), or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 & MS -4) and the Director of Student Affairs to review and discuss the proposed Modified Schedule. The student will sign the Attestation section after any additional changes are made and agreed upon by all parties. 150 The student will provide medical documentation to the Director of Student Affairs from their medical provider document ing full medical clearance for return, including a definitive date of return. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 & MS -2), will contact and inform the Course Directors and the Assistant Director of Medical Education for the affected courses of the Modified Schedule, and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 & MS -4) will contact and inform the appropriate Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education, clerkship coordinator and Registrar of the Modified Schedule. The Director of St udent Affairs will notify the Chief of Operations of the Modified Schedule. Withdrawal Withdrawal from CUSOM is granted by the Dean. A Withdrawal may be a temporary separation from CUSOM which m ay last longer than 180 calendar days or permanent separati on from CUSOM. Reasons for a withdrawal i nclude, but are not limited to, persona l and medical. A Withdr awal is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Director of Student Affairs, who then provides it to the Dean. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Withdrawal request. The student must complete a Withdrawal Form and return the form and any designated CUSOM issued items to the Office of Student Affairs b efore the student wi ll be consid ered Withdrawn in Good S tanding. The date for a Withdr awal is the d ate of the Dean's approval of the withdrawal request. The Dean makes the final decision regarding Withdrawals. Students who disconti nue their education at C USOM, for a ny reason, are required to complete a With drawal Form. Upon receipt of the completed Withdrawal Form and CUSOM issued items, the student is Withdrawn in Good Standing f rom CUSOM and entitled to certain benefits, i.e., application for readmission or issuance of an official transcript if requested. Students on Suspension may not withdraw. Withdrawal must be completed prior to the beginning of the final course or clinical rotation assessment. Failure to withdraw by this date may result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Block, or for that rotation, which will be recorded on the student's transcript and adversely affect the student's GPA. 151 A student may not withdraw if a grade h as been assigned or if a final examination or assessment event has been started. Withdrawal from a course or clinical rotation after an examination has been administered and/or a clinical rotation completed, will result in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdrawal cannot remove a grade of F. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal from CUSO M, minimally must submit a completed Secondary Appli cation, Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with do cumen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Withdrawal. A subs et of the Adm issions Committee, consist ing of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration and Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the st udent is offered acceptance. O n c e a p p r o v e d f o r r e t u r n , the APPS Com mittee will determine placement of the student in the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. Recommendations will be bas ed on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on board exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Personal Wit hdrawal A Personal Withdrawal will be granted to students who wish to volun tarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdr awing from CUSOM for personal reasons are not guaranteed re-admission. To be deemed Withdrawn in Good Standin g, the student must h ave passed all classes and be in good academic standin g, complete all required paperwork and follow all CUSOM pro cedures during the withdraw al process. Students eligib le to return from a Personal Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with do cumen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved withdrawal. 152 A subs et of the Adm issions Committee, consist ing of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration and Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. Once approved for return, the APPS Com mittee will determine pla cement of the student in the curriculum and to d etermine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupl ed with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on board exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Medical Withdrawal (Absence Greater than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Withdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standi ng and who have an approved medi cal reason for a medi cal leave of absence that exceeds 180 calendar days. A st udent returni ng from an approved Medical Withdr awal minimally must submit a completed Secondary Appli cation, Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. In order to return from an approved Medi cal Withdrawal, the student must also provide the Dean with do cumen tation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full time student in the curriculum. Once approved for return, the APPS Com mittee will determine pla cement of a student who h as taken an approved medical leave to determine wh ere the stude nt will resume the curriculum and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on board exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Students who do n ot return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. 153 Suspension Suspension is defined as a tempo rary separation from the institution and during this period students are enrolled, not registered and are not eligible for finan cial aid. The duration of the Suspension will be determined by the Dean and may inclu de recommendations from the APPS Com mittee. While on Suspension, stud ents must not represent thems elves as CUSOM students. In addition, they may not be on the University campus or affiliated clinical campuses, p articipate in any clinical activities or w ear their CU SOM white coat. Students on Suspension are not eligible to Withdraw. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfil led, or the p eriod of Suspension is greater than 180 calendar days, the student will be dismissed from CUSOM. Dismissal Dismis sal from CUSOM is based upon recommendations made by the APPS Com mittee, with fin al app roval for dismissal by the Dean. NOT E: Although different c ategories of Withdraw al are identified, the st udent transcript will reflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal. 5.12 Graduation Requirements The d egree of Do ctor of Ost eopathic Medicine is granted t o, and conferred upon, candidat es who: Have satisfied all academic requirements, and completed the total number of credits required for their class as calculated at the time of graduation; Have passed COMLEX-USA Level 1, COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE, and COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE; Have demonst rated good moral, pro fessional, and ethical character; Comp leted all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM, Campbell University and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during the academic prog ram. To b ecome eligible for graduation, each fourth-year student must su ccessful ly complete all the above requirements within six (6) years of matriculation. The six (6) years allow for the completion of a Modifi ed Course of Study due to medical, academic, behavioral or ot her leaves of absence. The Dean may, in exceptional circumstances, grant an extension to this 6 -year rule. 154 Professional and ethical compet ence is required for graduation. Students must demonstr ate the ethical and professional qualities deemed necessary for success and continued study and practice of osteo pathic medi cine; the suitability for the practice of medicine by dutiful and respons ible acceptance for patient care; and integrity in the conduct of clinical duties. Students m ay be dismissed from CUSOM if any of these compe tencies are not met. In addition, the revocation of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree may occur following graduation for discov ered misconduct of prior students. Alleg ations of miscondu ct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are conside red by the D ean. A student must complete all curricular requir ements at CUSOM, or a minimum of two (2) years at CUSOM and another institution accredited by the Com mission on Osteopathic Col lege Accreditation (COCA) or Liaison Com mittee on Medical Education (LCME), between the date of matriculation and graduation. In addition to this requirement, the student must have been enroll ed full-time at CUSOM during their third and fourth academic years. A CUSOM student must complete to the satisfaction of the faculty, as determin ed by the ind ividual course di rectors, clinical rotation preceptors and through the AP PS Com mittee, all prescribed courses and clinical experiences to graduate. The D ean makes the determination on any student appeals of APPS Committee or Vice Dean recommendations, based sole ly upon new and meaningful information not available to the APPS Com mittee or Vice Dean at the t ime of the initial hearing and deliberation. Students must meet with the Assis tant Director of Financial Aid and Registrar to complete all required exit documentation in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM students must also attend the exit pro cess and commencement prog ram in order to receive a diploma. Upon passage of COMLEX-USA Level 1, Level 2-CE, Level 2-PE, and all other requirements as delineated in this Academic Bulletin, the Faculty of CUSOM, throu gh the Dean and President, recommends degree candidat es to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the r ecommendation, the Board of T rustees confers the Doctor of Ost eopathic Medicine degree on students successful ly completing all requirements for graduation. 155 5.13 Delayed Graduation Policy If a student is suspended, takes a Leave of Ab sence, or is required to r etake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course or clinical rotation failures or a deficiency in overall academic performance, they will be placed in a Modifi ed Course of Study (MCO S). As discussed in Section 5.9 of the Academic Bulletin, a Modified Cour se of Study (MCOS) is a credit-bearing, individuali zed study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as board preparation, required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withd rawals. The institution of a MCOS will result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's clinical rotations and graduation date. Voluntary course withdr awals, tempo rary leaves of absence, suspensions secondary to academic or non -academic matters , or failure to pass Board exams consistent with CUSOM policy may also result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's clinical rotations and graduation date . For students to be eligible to participate in , but will not receive a diploma at, the May graduation ceremony, they must have taken COMLEX USA Level 2 -CE and Level 2 -PE prior to graduation with the results available no later than six (6) weeks following graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a studen t's financial aid status or qu alification for education-based financial aid. In addition, placement in a Modifi ed Course of Study may impact the studen t's ability to participate in the residen cy mat ch process. Specific couns eling and advice should be sought from the CUSOM Office of A cademic Affairs and the Univ ersity's Office of Financial Aid for these or other ind icated situ ations. 5.14 Clinical Policies and Procedures Students should refer to the CUSOM Clinical Rotation Manual for a comprehensive review of all student polici es relating to all c linical rotations. CUSOM Medical Student Shadowing Many students choose to engage in clinical shadowing experiences during breaks in the fo rmal CUSOM curriculum such as during Block breaks, summer break or weekends. Shadowing experiences can be extremely valuable and students may choose to include these experiences in their Curriculum Vitae, personal statement or Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). Shadowing experiences can occur with CUSO M-appoin ted clinical faculty memb ers or physicians not affiliat ed with CUSO M. 156 It is essential that stude nts choosing to engage in shadowi ng experiences understand the differences between shadowing and the requir ed clinical rotations students p articipate in as part of the CUSOM curriculum. Clinical rotations that occur in conjunction with the CUSOM clinical curriculum (Early Clinical Experiences, Outr each, International Medical Missions and MS-3 and MS-4 scheduled rotations) are completed under the supervision of CUSO M- appoin ted clinical faculty and follow very sp ecific guidelines in regards to student's roles, respons ibilities, sup ervision r equirements, and feedback and evaluation pro cesses. In contrast to clinical curriculum experiences, shadowing experiences do not occur as part of the stud ent's required CUSOM curriculum, and m ay lack the defined stru cture, sup ervision, feedback mechanisms and medi cal-legal protections provid ed by formal clinical rotations. Students choosing to engage in a shadowi ng experience acknowledge they will do so while adhering to the following principles: 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands-on activity occurs with patients, this should be limited to patient examination on ly, approved by the patient and supervising physician, and MUST be r epeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students are not to p erform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences, including but not limited to suturing, endotracheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or central lines or perform exams of the pelvic, breast, r ectal and genitourinary system s. Students should not p erform any ost eopathic manipulation while on sh adowing experiences. 2. Students are not protected by malp ractice insurance provided by Campbe ll Un iversity, Incorporated while engaged in physician shadowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM- appointed faculty memb er. Students are required to let non -CUSOM appointed physicians they are shadowing know that th ey are not covered by malp ractice insurance provid ed by Campbell University, Incorporated. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, and ambulatory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or health care system pol icies so it is the student's respons ibility to make sure they review and comply with a ny applicable policies. 4. Individual physicians may not know the student's level of training and it is therefore the student's ethical and professional duty to ful ly explain their lev el of tr aining. 157 Shadowing with CUSOM Cl inical Faculty Members 1. Students who desire to shadow CUS OM clinical faculty must arrange the experience on their own. 2. Shadowing experiences with CUSOM clinical faculty memb ers may be approved as Early Clinical Experiences (ECE). 3. Students shadowing with CUSOM clinical faculty memb ers should wear their CUSOM n ame badge and white coat unless dir ected otherwise by their preceptor. 4. Students wish ing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty memb er must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form, ( a v a i l a b l e f r o m t h e O f f i c e o f C l i n i c a l A f f a i r s ) completed in its entirety, to the Office of Clinical Affairs. 5. Shadowing experiences should be arranged in conjunction with the preceptor and Regional Dean (when applicable), both of whom must sign the agreement form to indicate their approval. 6. Students must sign the form and initial all required attestations. 7. The completed form must be submi tted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing experience. Shadowing with non-CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow non-CUS OM clinicians must arrange the experience on their own. 2. Shadowing experiences with non-CUSOM clinical faculty memb ers will not be approved as Early Clinical Experiences (ECE). 3. These are non-CUSOM sanctioned experiences thus: a. CUSOM will not obta in affiliation agreements with the si tes in order to provide shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will n ot provide the clinician or si te with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and background checks, immunization records, academic performance information or letters of recommendation. c. Students may not wear their CUSOM white coat or name tag. d. Students or the physician they are shadowi ng are not protected by malpractice insurance through Campbell University, Incorporated . e. Students acknowl edge th at Campbell Univ ersity, Incorpo rated will not be li able for any medi cal care or expenses if they are to be injured or become ill during the clinical shadowing experience. They also release C ampbell Univ ersity, In corpor ated f rom any li ability from any injury or illness that o ccurs during th e shadowing experience. 4. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non-CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previous ly in this document. 158 Violation of any conditions of this Sh adowing Policy is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion a nd Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.15 Academic Freedom Policy Faculty are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his/her other academic dut ies; but research for p ecuniary return must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution in adv ance of the acceptance of employment. Faculty are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing his/her subject, but he/she should be careful not to introduce into his teaching controv ersial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in w riting at the time of the appointment. The University faculty is a citizen, a memb er of a learned profession, and an officer of an educational institution. His/h er prim ary loyalty is to his/her institution, his /her profession, and his/her growth and development as a scholar, a person, and a teacher. S/he possess es the right, as a citizen, to speak and write, subject to special obligations arising from his/her posit ion as an employee of the Univ ersity; to be accurate, to exercise prop er restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make every effort to ind icate that in his/her role as a citizen s/he is not an institutional spok esman. Moreover, s/he should allow for the fact that many members of the general public will find it difficult to disasso ciate his /her utterances as a citizen from his/her ins titutional identifi cation. S/he should not use official university station logos, watermarks or his /her inst itutional t itle in issuing public statements whi ch s/he makes purely in his/her role as a citizen. Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University and/or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University or CUSOM without the expre ss written permission of the Dean. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 159 6. OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE CURRICULUM Academic Calendar Academic calendars are made available to all students. Weekly schedules vary based on course content and space needs but are generally stru ctured so that lectures prim arily take place in the morn ing, with labs and clinical skills typically taking place in the afternoons. Morning lecture-discuss ions are complement ed by afternoon labs and skil ls sessions, with embedd ed study time. OMM and other clinical skills are taught longitudinal ly throughout the fi rst two years in a progression designed to integrate with, and provide a seamless transition to the third and fourth years. Content is presented by physicians and biomedical faculty using concepts of team-teaching and small group learning. For years three and fou r, clinical rotations are typically four (4) weeks in duration at the Regional Clinical sites. Evaluation of performance during the first 8 Blocks includ es integrated exams, quizzes, OSCE, clinical skills, anatomy, and OMM practical exams, and end-of-year evaluations. Weekly clinical case exercises, help students integrate and apply mat erial presented during the week, and provide faculty with an assessment of stude nt progress. For years three and four, student evaluation is performed by clinical preceptors at the end of each clinical rotation, and similarly students evaluate each clinical rotation to promote curricular improv ement. Programmatic Level Educational Outcome Objectives CUSOM has adopted the 2012 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM ) Osteopathic Core Competencies for Medical Students as the programmatic level educational outcome objectives for graduates, since these also align with the mission of the university and medical school. These Osteopathic Core Compe tencies measure specific objectives along the following 14 competency domains: 1. Osteopathic Principles and Practices 2. Medical Knowledge 3. Patient Care 4. Interpersonal and Communication Skills 5. Professionalism 6. Practice -Based Learning and I mprovement 7. Systems -Based Practice 8. Counseling for Health Promotion/Disease Prevention 9. Cultural Competencies 10. Evaluation of Health Sciences Literature 160 11. Environmental and Occupational Medicine (OEM) 12. Public Health Systems 13. Global Health 14. Interprofessional Collaboration The four -year Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine curriculum, which embodies the mind, body, spirit philosophy of the osteopathic profession and mission of Campbell University, is a traditional systems -based curriculum consi stent with many medical schools in the United States. The four -year course of study begins with integrated biomedical and clinical didactic and laboratory activities leading up to the third - and fourth -year clinical rotations, which provide the necessary clinical training for transition to and success in subsequent residency programs. For the full description and detailed listing of objectives, please refer to the official 2012 document published by AACOM linked here. 6.1 Years 1 and 2 Curriculum The first two years of the CUSOM curriculum focus on teaching studen ts fundament al prin ciples of biomedical science with significant empha sis on clinical science, elements of clinical practice, and professionalism. Histori cally, the fi rst two years of medi cal school ins truction have been viewed as \"pre-clinical\" with the remaini ng two years being viewed as \"clinical\". At CUS OM, the curriculum is integrated to provide a core of strong bio medical principles in addition to a robust foundation in clinical sciences and osteop athic prin ciples, prin ciples of clinical practice, and professionalism. Curricular Content Overview All semest ers of the first and second year are partitioned into two 9-week Blocks, with the exception of ten (10) weeks for Block 4 and eleven (11) weeks for Block 8. Within the first two Blocks, students are in troduced to the biomedical found ational concepts of A natomy, Biochemistry/Cell Biology, Microbiology/Immunolog y, Pathology, Pharmacology, and Physiology. Anatomy continues throughout the first year, integrating wh erever possible with the systems approach of the remaining thr ee semest ers of the first two years. In Blocks 3 throu gh 8, the CUSOM curriculum follows an or gan-system approach to medi cal education. Faculty utilize instructional materials that go beyond the basic bio medical principles mastered during the first semest er. Biomedical faculty, prim ary care physicians, and sub-specialty physicians collaborate to deliver integrated content relating to the particular organ system. 161 The Clinical Skills and Ost eopathic Manipulative Medicine courses address content that will allow CUSOM students to learn integrate and apply the basic philosop hy, principles, and practice of osteo pathic medi cine. of osteop athic whol e-person health labs incorporate stat e-of-the-art instruction. Addit ionally, Simulation and Standardized Patient experiences, allow stud ents to enhance their clinical skills such as physical exam techniques, interviewing, couns eling, and medical reporting skills necessary to prog ress to the third and fourth years. The Foundations in Medical Practice (FMP) courses provide CUSOM students a broad ov erview of r esearch methodo logy, and experimental design. The students are exposed to the calculations and strategies required to appropriately locate, interpret, design and complete a research/schol arly paper with clinically relevant knowl edge related to compet ent medi cal practice. The Professional Core Compet encies (PCC) courses are presented through all semest ers of the first- and second-year curriculum, and are designed to teach the core compet encies necessary for caring, compassionat e, effective and holistic practice of osteopathic medicine throu ghout the physician's career. The use of lecture, discussion, and other uniqu e activities, in troduces students to medi cal human ities, bio medical ethics, medi cal law and jurisprud ence, quality improvement and patient safety, global health issues, and pro fessionalism. 6.2 Years 3 and 4 Rotation Structure Students are expected to wo rk forty (40) hours per week for four (4) weeks, for a total of 160 contact hours per each four (4) week clinical rotation. The clinical campus student medical education coordinator in collaboration with the Office of Clinical Affairs schedules rotations according to the availability of rotation sites and numbers of requests. There is oppo rtunity to participate in approved two - week elective and selective rotations. CUSOM selective rotations are chosen from the CUSOM selective lists and are based on educational stand ards and requirements, the student 's self-assessment of areas where they would benefit most from further education and patient exposur e, along with input from the Asso ciate Dean for Cl inical Affairs and the respective Clinical Chairs. The Primary Care, Medical, and Surgical Selective rotations are completed at CUSOM core si tes where CUS OM has establi shed rotations, affiliation agreements, and faculty. Specific in formation regarding scheduling of third- and fourth-year selective rotations may be found in the C USOM Clinical Rotation Manual. 162 Electives may also be scheduled outside CUSOM regional hospital sites; however, each elective si te and rotation for electives scheduled outside CUSOM regional hospital sites must be requested, and all requir ed documentation submitted, at least sixty (60) days in advance of the rotation start date and must be approved through the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Third Year Clinical Rotations CUSOM's third-year osteop athic medi cal students are required to complete twelve rot ations. Each rotation consis ts of approximately 160 contact hours. The required rot ations for third year are listed below; all core rotations are clinical rotations involving patient care, which must be completed at the student's resp ective clinical campus with CUSOM -appoin ted faculty. rotations are clinical rotations involving p atient care wh ich are required to be completed at a CUSOM clinical site with CUSOM f aculty. The third-year core rotations are Family Medicin e, Internal Medicine I and II, Medical Selective, Obst etrics & Gynecology, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, and M edical/Surgical Selective. All third year rotations must be successful ly completed prior to progressing to the fourth year and must be completed at the studen t's Regional Clinical Training Site. Clinical Academic Assessment (CAA)/Simulation Medicine (SIM) (8 weeks) Internal Medicine I & II (IM) (8 weeks) Medical Selective (MS) (4 weeks) Surgery (SUR) (4 weeks) Obstetrics/Gynecology (OBG) (4 weeks) Family Medicine (FM) (4 weeks) Pediatrics (PED) (4 weeks) Psychiatry/Behavioral Medicine (PSY) (4 weeks) Rural/Underserved/International (R/U/I) (4 weeks) Medical/Surgical Selective (4 weeks) Fourth Year Clinical Rotations CUSOM's fourth-year osteop athic medi cal students are required to successful ly complete all fourth-year rotations to be eligible for graduation. Addit ionally, to become eligible for graduation, each fourth-year student must pass COMLEX- USA Level 2-CE and CO MLEX-USA Level 2-PE. The r equired clinical rotations for fourth year are listed b elow. The fourth-year core rotations are Emergency Medicine, Geriatrics, Medical Selective, Primary Care Selective, and Surgical Selective. 163 Students are also provi ded the oppo rtunity to participate in twenty (20) weeks of elective rotations which may be done at non-core sites. These elective rotation s are often utilized by students for audition rotations at sites with residency programs or to obtain additional experience in the studen t's areas of interest. CUSOM's fourth-year osteop athic medi cal students will be required to complete the following clinical rotations: Electives* I, II, III, IV, V (20 weeks) Emergency Medicine (4 weeks) Geriatrics (4 weeks) Medical Selective (4 weeks) Primary Care Selective (4 weeks) Residen cy Development (4 weeks) Surgical Selective (4 weeks) Students are required to comp lete a Sub-Internship (Sub-I) during one of their selective, elective, or Em ergency Medicine rotations . In an effort to provi de fourth -year students with increased flexibility and a greater oppo rtunity to audition or rotate at sites they may be interested in for residency training, CUSOM allows students to do one (1) of the following three (3) required fourth-year rotations at a site with an ACGME -approved residency training program. Medical Selective* (4 weeks) Primary Care Selective* (4 weeks) Surgical Selective* (4 weeks) This flexibility provi des students the oppo rtunity to participate in up to six (6) rotations (five (5) electives plus one (1) of the above listed selectives) at sites outside CUSOM's core clinical training sites. In addition, the remaining two (2) fourth -year selectives may be completed at another CUSOM clinical campus as the rotation capacity provide s. Students are required to complete their Geriatrics and Emergency Medicine rotations at their respective CUSOM clinical campus . *All elective and selective rotations scheduled outside CUSOM regional affiliated sites mu st be approved in advance by the Associ ate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Most rotations are scheduled on a four-week basis; however, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs may approve students to participate in two- week elective and selective rotations. 164 Selective and Elective Rotations CUSOM selective rotations are chosen from the CUSOM surgical and medi cal selective lists and are based on educational standards and requirements, the student 's self-assessment of areas where they would benefit most from further education and patient exposur e, along with input from the Asso ciate D ean for Clinical Affairs and respective Clinical Chairs. Ele ctives may be scheduled outside CUSOM r egional clinical training s ites; how ever, each elective site and rotation requests must be submi tted to the Department of Clinical Affairs at least sixty (60) days in advance of the rotation start date and approved by the Associ ate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM does not arrange student electives or selectives outside CUSOM's regional clinical training si tes. If a student chooses to do electives or selectives at hospitals with ACGME -accredited post-graduate programs or at a military facility (Health Professions Scholarship Program, HPSP students only), they must arrange those rot ations thems elves with appropriate notification to the respective clinical campus student medical education coordinator. All required documentation for electives and selectives must be completed and submi tted during the approv ed selection time period as noted by the Office of Clinical Affairs. All requests for s electives and elective rotations must be submi tted to the Department of Clinical Affairs not less than sixty (60) days before the start of the rotation in order to be approved. CUSOM does not approve selectives or electives taken outside of CUSOM core clinical training regions without appropriate prior notification or completion of the required documentation; no exceptions are granted. Student requests for outside electives or selectives must include all required information, including , but not limited to, rotation date, specialty, facility/practice, and preceptor. Please note if an affiliation agreement with the requested clinical training site is not executed within thirty (30) days of the start of the clinical rotation despite meeting the aforementioned timelines, the student is required to select an alternate rotation at a site with an executed affiliation agreement . Specific fo urth-year scheduling guidelines are found in the CUSOM Clinical Rotation M anual. Students are respons ible for knowi ng, and followi ng, all guidelines and requirements in the M anual. 165 Medical Selective Rotations Medical Selectives in the th ird and fourth year should be hospita l-based.

Course Overview and Philosophy of Clinical Training: The philosophi cal framework of clinical education and training at CUSOM is to prepare students to become osteop athic physicians possessing the highest compet encies in the profession. The prog ram educates students to be compet ent osteop athic physicians who clearly recognize their roles as professionals and provide rs of compr ehensive healthcare to the individual and the family as a unit, and to the communities th ey serve. Osteopathic physicians must be able to function in the role of the le ader of a healthcare team to bring about needed change from the level of the individual to the level of the community. The ultimate intent of the program is to pr epare patient-centered physicians who will posit ively impact the equality of healthcare and healthcare delivery systems, and will impro ve healthcare access for individuals and th eir families. CUSOM believes the physician must assume a leadership role not only in the medi cal community, but also in the broader community in which he/she serves. Com munity leadership is an integral part of improvi ng the healthcare of the community as-a-whol e; thus, physicians must be committed to the prevention of illness and the upgrading of the delivery of healthcare services at extended levels. 169 In pursuit of excellence, the CUSOM clinical curriculum is a challenging blend of the tr aditional and innovative com ponents, d esigned to: Foster the analytic and problem-solving skills requisite for physicians involved in disease pr evention, diagnosis, and treatment in individual patients, families, communities, and populations at-large; Ensu re the acquisition and application of basic clinical knowl edge and essential clinical skills; Develop an un derstanding of contempo rary healthcare delivery issues; Cultivate effective physician-patient relationships based upon integrity, respect, and compassio n; Develop h igh ethical standards; and Promote a lifelong commitment to learning. Following clinical training, students will be knowl edgeable about the important roles of the prim ary care physician in cluding, but not limited to, the ability to: Demonstr ate clinical excellence, using current eviden ce-based medi cine and bio medical knowl edge to identi fying and manage their patients' medical conditions. Provide continuing and compr ehensive care to individuals and families. Integrate the behavioral, emotional, so cial, and envi ronment al factors of individuals and families in promoting health and man aging disease. Develop and maintain t he knowl edge, skills, and attitudes required for the delivery of best care and outcom es in modern m edical practice in a rapidly chang ing world. Pursue a regular and systematic p rogram of lif elong learning. Recognize ind ications for, and initiate, consu ltation with other medical specialists while maintaining continuity of care. Share tasks and respons ibilities with other healthcare professionals. Be aware of the findi ngs of relevant research; understand and critically evaluate th is bo dy of research; and apply the results of research to medical practice. Manage his/her practice in a busin ess-like, cost-efficient mann er that will provide professional sati sfaction and time for a rewarding personal life. Serve as an advocate for the p atient wi thin the healthcare system. Assess the quality of care that s /he p rovides and actively pursue measures to continually improve. Use current medi cal knowl edge to identi fy, evaluate, and minimize risks for p atients and families. Recognize community resour ces as an integral part of the healthcare system; participate in improving the health of the community. Inform and couns el pati ents con cerning their health pr oblems, and recognizing and valuing dif ferences in patient and physician backgrounds, beliefs, and expectation s. 170 Develop p hysician-patient relationsh and problem-solving. Balance potential benefits, costs, and resources in determining appropriate in terventions. Integrate and effectively utilize osteop athic principles and practices in the d elivery of optimal p atient care. The general expectations for all clinical rotations are designed to help students develop the fundament al skills of medi cal probl em solving, case management, procedural expertise, and professional demeanor. Some clinical rotations focus on data acquisition (medical history, physical examination, laboratory data, or literature review), while others emphasi ze psychomo tor skil ls or attitudes and feelings. Clinical rotations are und er the direct supervision of the CUSOM Office for Clinical Affairs, led by the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM has establi shed affiliations with a wide range of hospitals, clinics, and physicians offering di verse training oppo rtunities. The clinical program has been organized to permit the greatest degree of educational exposure in a practical, clinical environme nt and to develop expertise in the areas of p atient diagnosis and management. The clinical rot ations provid ed at each affiliated site, and the number of CUS OM students assigned to each affiliat ed site, are determined by mutual agreement with CUSOM, the Asso ciate Dean for Cl inical Affairs, the Hospit al Admin istrator(s), Regional Dean, Vi ce-President for M edical Education (VPME) / Director of Medical Education (DME), Clinical Faculty and the Office for Clinical Affairs. Whenever possible, CUSOM utilizes hospit als with accredited postdoctoral programs approved by the A ccreditation Coun cil for Graduate M edical Education (ACGME) for postdo ctoral training to provide assurance of adequate teaching material and faculty. Clinical Modules Clinical Modul es includ ing videos, lectures and other educational materials are utilized to suppl ement knowledge and skill acquisition during clinical rotations. These modu les are appropriate for bo th third- and fou rth-year students and offer the le arner flexibility. Modules and ot her educational materials suppl ement topics covered on clinical rotations and function as study guides for both the end-of-rotation exams, CO MLEX-USA Level 2-CE and CO MLEX-USA Level 2-PE. Clinical Modul es are an important suppl ement to a studen t's education, but do not r eplace the extensive re ading, studying, patient contact, etc. students must achieve on clinical rotations. 171 Students are provid ed with required curricula during the third year and fourth year. Learning obj ectives and correspondi ng reading assignments are provid ed for the core discipline rotation s. Graduate Medical Education CUSOM strives to develop a sufficient number of residen cy training posit ions for our graduates. Asso ciate Dean for Postgraduate Affairs is respons ible residency prog ram velopment ng the pl acement of CUSOM gr aduates into graduate medi cal education programs. Regional Deans, who supervise th ird- and fourth-year student rotations at their site, also assist in the development of residency training prog rams. CUSOM's goal is to d evelop the same or greater numb er of GME posi tions as our number of graduates. These programs provide CUSOM graduating students post graduate training opportunities and help meet the need for future physicians to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolin a, the Southe astern United S tates and the n ation. 6.3 Schedule of Course Offerings OMM = Osteopathic Manipul ative Medicine FMP = Foundations of Medical Practic e PCC = Professional Core Competencies FIRST YEAR SEMESTER 1 (FALL) SEMESTER 2 (SPRING) Bloc k 1 Integrated Basic Science & Clinical Courses Bloc k 2 Integrated Basic Science & Clinical Courses Bloc k 3 Musculoskeletal System Bloc k 4 Neuroscience & Human Behavio r OMM = Osteopathic Manipul ative Medicine FMP = Foundations of Medical Practice PCC = Professional Core Competencies CABS I = C linical Applications of Biomedical Sciences I CABS II = C linical Applications of Biomedical Sciences II SECOND YEAR SEMESTER 3 (FALL) SEMESTER 4 (SPRING) Bloc k 5 Cardiovascular & Respiratory Systems Bloc k 6 Hematology , Dermatology & Renal System Bloc k 7 Endocrine & Gastrointestinal Systems Bloc k 8 Reproductive System & Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences II OMED 610 Cardiovascular System OMED 611 CABS I OMED 620 Respiratory System OMED Dermatol ogy OMED OMED P OMED Reproductive System OMED OMM OMED Skills OMED 618 FMP OMED 619 P CC THIRD YEAR FOURTH YEAR OMED 710 Internal Medicine I OMED 712 Internal Medicine II OMED 714 Medical Selective OMED 720 Surgery OMED 730 Family Medicine OMED 740 Pediatrics OMED 750 Obstetrics and Gynecology OMED 760 Psychiatry OMED 770 Medicine OMED 780 790 Medical/Surgical OMED 810 Medical Selective OMED 820 Surgery Selective OMED 830 Primary Care Selective OMED 840 Geriatrics OMED 850 Emergency Medicine OME D 860 Elective I OMED 862 Elective II OMED 864 Elective III OMED 866 Elective IV OMED 868 Elective V OMED 870 Residency Development OMED 880 International/Underserved Rotation OMED 890 Elective Sub Internship 173 6.4 Course Descriptions The curriculum in Blocks 1 and 2 of the first year introduces students to the foundational biomedical concepts of Cell and Molecular Biolog y, Genetics, also consists of introductory clinical training in osteop athic principles and practice in addition to basic clinical skills.

The A cceptable Use Policy is posted on the University's poli cy web page, and information concerning the University's Information Technology Services can be accessed at: https://www.campbell.edu/information-technology-services/ Informational Technology assis tance may be accessed through the CUS OM IT Department, or through the Acce ss and User Privacy Private Machines Connected to the University Network Electronic mail (email) and other information passing over the Univ ersity network, including info rmation stored in user accounts and compu ters, are considered to be priv ate and confid ential. Althou gh this type of information must be accessed by system p ersonn el for the purpose of b ackups, network management, etc., the content of us er files and network transmissions will not be vie wed, monitored, or altered without the express pe rmission of the us er except in the following circumstances: The Univ ersity has reason to believe that an account or system has been breached and is b eing used by someone other than the authori zed user. The Univ ersity has received a complaint that an account or system is being used to gain unauthori zed access or to attempt to gain unauthori zed access to another network site. The Univ ersity has reason to believe than an account or system is being used in violation of Univ ersity policy or federal or st ate law. Under the se circumstances the university m ay authori ze system supp ort personn el to monitor the activities of a specified account or compu ter system and to search electronic i nformation stored in that account. The authori ty for this search must be requested on an account-by-account basis, and mon itoring will be restrict ed to the specified account. If this search provi des eviden ce of violation, the account will be disabl ed and action taken with appropriate authoritie s. It will become increasingly possible for compu ter systems owned by stude nts, staff, or faculty to be attached directly to the Campbell network via on-campus attachment or of f- campus VPN services. The owner of a personal machine or 219 device may use that machine at his or her discretion; however, the use of the Univ ersity network is subject to all of the pol icies stat ed in this do cumen t. The owner of any device or machine connected to the Campbell network is respons ible for the b ehavior of all users of th at machine and for all network traffic to and f rom the machine. Campbell maintains no respons ibility or liability for loss of data or h ardware corruption on personal computer systems. A private machine o r d e vi c e connected to the Univ ersity network may not be used to provide n etwork access to individuals who would not otherwise h ave access throu gh official Campbell channels. The private machine may not be used to redirect data to other networks, nor may it serve in any way as an electronic gateway to no n-Univ ersity affiliated system s. Private machines or devices may not use the Univ ersity network for commercial gain or pro fit. Neither Campbell owned nor private compu ters o r e l e c t r o n i c d e v i c e s may be used to serve files throu gh any protocol (http, ftp, email, file sharing, IM, etc.) without application to Information Technology Services for an exception f or scholarly use unless the compu ters are designated servers by Information Technology Services. Unless otherwise approved in w riting, provisions for interactive login services for non-Univ ersity affiliat ed users are prohibited. Should the Univ ersity have reason to believe that a privately owned system is using the n etwork in appropriately, network traffic to and from that system will be monitored and, if justified, the system will be disconn ected, and appropriate puni tive action will be taken. Technology Usage Compu ter systems and networks allow for a free exchange of scholarly ideas and info rmation. This exchange serves to enh ance learning, teaching, critical thinking, and research, as well as to promote the sharing of moral stand ards. While the constitutional ri ght of free speech applies to communication in all forms, the Christ ian atmosph ere of C ampbell Unive rsity prescribes only civil and respectful dis course. Campbell Univ ersity computer and network services are available as a privilege to all full - time and adjunct faculty, staff, and students at the main and extended campus es. The number of people in the Campbell community dependent upon the Univ ersity's compu ter and network services is sizable. T herefore, a respect for the needs of othe rs is expected among us ers.

RESEARCH AND SCHOLARLY ACTIVITY 9.1 Research at CUSOM Research is fundamental to, consistent with, and a prerequisite for excellence in teaching and the creation of a scholarly atmosphere for learning. CUSOM recognizes the critical role for developing its research capacity in order to continue to attract and retain top -tier faculty and students, thereby training students for productive careers in osteopathic medicine, biomedical research, and in making valuable contribut ions to society. Research and scholarly activity at CUSOM may take different forms, which may include basic biomedical research, translational research, clinical research, and medical educational research. 9.2 Policy Statement on Student Research and Sch olarly Activity CUSOM strives to advance scientific and medical knowledge and to promote the distinctive philosophy and practice of osteopathic medicine. Whereas CUSOM specifically supports the academic and scholarly pursuits of students and faculty, this policy specifically addresses student research and scholarly activities. CUSOM does not require students to complete an independent research project or scholarly activity as a requirement for graduation. However, CUSOM is committed to supporting studen ts in pursuing research and extracurricular scholarly opportunities. Whereas students are encouraged to participate in research, students are not permitted to act as a principal investigator (PI). Rather, they must partner with a faculty member or precep tor who takes on the role of PI. Furthermore, CUSOM requires all students who are interested in engaging in research to notify the Associate Dean for Research of their intent. As such, student -researchers are provide with an additional layer of oversight and support in addition to their faculty or preceptor mentor. 9.3 Education in Research Principles Principles of responsible conduct in research (RCR) are presented in the Foundations in Medical Practice (FMP) course throughout Years One and Two. Topic s include general principles of research ethics, human subject protections and the responsibilities of CUSOM students in basic science and clinical research. Additional education opportunities in research, scientific method, statistics, and scholarly acti vities are presented throughout the curriculum and through workshops associated with extracurricular research activities. As active members of a research team, students may be required to complete the associated CITI training, if appropriate. If such tra ining is required, the student must provide the Associate Dean of Research with documentation of completion prior to beginning work on the project. Additional training specific to the research project will be provided by the research mentors. 224 9.4 Student Presentation Processes Students are encouraged to present the results of their research through publication and presentation of their projects. The Associate Dean for Research oversees research publications and scholarly activities of students. Students are required to receive approval from the Associate Dean for Research prior to presentation or publication of any research project conducted while a CUSOM student. For meeting submissions, the final version of the abstract must be submitted and approved by the faculty mentor and the Associate Dean for Research. The Associate Dean for Research must review and approve all compliance requirements before submission of the abstract for any meeting. For manuscript submissions (case report, original research, or any other publication), the final manuscript draft must be submitted and approved by the Associate Dean for Research prior to submission to any journals for consideration of publication. The final poster, presentation or manuscript must be reviewed and approved by the faculty mentor and all listed co -authors. The author(s) and mentor should be up to date on research compliance processes. Failure to adhere to any of these requirements will be considered professional misconduct and will be reported through the appropriate channels for consideration by the APPS committee as described elsewhere in this publication. 9.5 Research Opportunities CUSOM students may pursue research and scholarly activities in many areas of individual interest. Faculty mentors in areas of biomedical and clinical research are available to provide guidance for student scholarly work. The faculty mentor has overall responsibility for the conduct of research or scholarly activity, and is ultimately responsible for obtaining approv al from regulatory committees as needed. As such, CUSOM requires that a faculty member approve all scholarly activity undertaken by students; however, student and faculty investigators may share the responsibility for complying with policies related to re search ethics. For a student - initiated project, the student must have a faculty or preceptor sponsor, who will serve as the project PI and student mentor. The student may prepare the relevant proposals and applications in close cooperation with the mento r. Mentors and students are responsible for conducting their research in accordance within University and institutional affiliates' research policies. Students wishing to earn credit for biomedical research, clinical research or other scholarly activitie s may enroll in the Research (Independent Study) clerkship elective during the fourth year. Description of the course requirements are available in the syllabus and elsewhere in this academic bulletin. Students participating in the research clerkship ele ctive must comply with all appropriate regulatory requirements, which may include Institution Review Board approval prior to 225 initiation of the project. Students and their faculty mentors are responsible for knowing which compliance requirements are appropr iate. 9.6 Medical Student Summer Research Scholars Program Each year a limited number of 7 -week paid research fellowships are available to CUSOM medical students during the summer between their MS -1 and MS -2 years. These opportunities are designed to ex pose students to cutting -edge basic science, clinical or simulation medicine research to gain valuable experience in research and explor e various clinical disciplines. Students are incorporated in to the laboratories to work with fulltime CUSOM faculty or are placed in CUSOM clinical sites to work with practicing physicians. The scholars programs are designed to help medical students acquire a greater understanding of and application of methodologies that support healthcare innovation and to envision them selves as physician scientists. The program is competitive. Students accepted into the program will attend an RCR training workshop, work on a full -time basis during the summer months and receive a stipend at the conclusion of the summer. 9.7 Research S ymposium Campbell University and CUSOM has a tradition of highlighting and showcasing student research interests. Annually, Campbell University hosts the Campbell University Interprofessional Education (IPE) Symposium, which is an adjudicated competition open to students, residents and faculty. The IPE research symposium is an opportunity for students to see other projects from their fellow students, as well as projects from other healthcare fields. CUSOM students also present posters and oral presentat ions at other local, regional and national events. 226 10. HONOR C ODE, CODE OF MIS CONDUCT, AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES 10.1 Honor Code The Campbell Univ ersity Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code of Condu ct (CUSOM Honor Cod e) embod ies a spirit of mu tual trust, intellectual honesty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Campbell Univ ersity communities. The CUSOM Honor Code is based on the fundamental belief that every student is worthy of trust and it is maintain ed to protect the ri ght to participate in an academic enviro nment free from in justice caused by dishonesty. Further, CUSOM s t u d e n t s are expected to conduct thems elves in a professional and ethical mann er befitting the hono rable profession they are entering. Students have an obl igation to maintain the highest standards of honesty and integrity. It is not poss ible to enume rate all examples of expected academic and professional behavior, no r is it possible to enume rate all behaviors considered inapp ropriate, unprofessional, unethical, or not in keeping with the st andards of a CUSOM s tudent. The following se rves only as a guideline to students. In general, the founding principles of the CUS OM Honor Co de are the establi shed rules and regulations of the CUSOM community. The CUSOM community includes CUSOM, affiliated hospitals, and any ins titution where CUSOM students pursue activities for academic credit. Violation of these rules and regulations may consti tute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code. In addition, specific examples of behavior that may consti tute a vio lation of the CUSOM Honor Code includ e, but are not limited to the followin g: 1. Cheating: Providin g, acquiring or receiving any unauthori zed assistance or unfair advantage on any form of academic work, or attempt thereof. Sharing information from testing/exams is also conside red a form of cheating. 2. Plagiarism: Copying the language, structure, ideas, algorithms, or compu ter code of another and representing it as one's own work on any form of academic work or attempt thereof. 3. Falsification: Fabrication of in formation on any form of academic work or attempt the reof; including but not limited to, the followin g: a. Clinical requirements b.

Disruptive Behavior: Any inapp ropriate etiquette or inapp ropriate disturbance either solely or repeated often enough oft en enough to establi sh a disrespectful trend. Inappropriate disturbances include but a re not limited to the following: a. Arriving late for class, lab, or clinical rotations, or b. Disrupting class with p agers or cellular phon es c. Disrupting class with c omputers or compu ter games d. Disrupting class with loud talking or other activities that create a distraction e. Leaving trash in classrooms or academic areas, including student small group study room s f. Bringing food into unauthori zed areas or hosting food functions without p ermissio n g. Posting un approved materials or posting approved mat erials in inapp ropriate areas h. Parking in inappropriate or reserved spaces 5. Unacceptable use of technology: Any violation of the acceptable use guidelines as publ ished by the CU SOM IT department or as noted in the Campbell University Technology Usage Policy: https://www.campbell.edu/information -technology -services/acceptable - use-policy/ In addition, unacceptable uses of te chnology include but are not limited to the following: a. Using compu ters for purposes that are consid ered unprofessional or immoral b. Accessing pornographic material at any time while on any campus of the CUSOM community or using any equipment of the CUSOM community to access such m aterial c. Distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those outside CUSOM is an Honor Code violation. Lecture materials, includi ng PowerPoint presentations, and videos contain confid ential and proprietary info rmation and material protected by in tellectual property laws. Students do not h ave permission to share them. 6. Unprofessional or unethical behavior: Behavior on or off the CUSOM campus that would or could cause a loss of respect or confidence in the offending stu dent or in the CUSOM community by the public, faculty, staff, colleagues, or the-community- at-large. 228 Section 5.10 of the Academic Bulletin, \"Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Comm ittee\", describes the process for addressing cases related to allegations of misconduct or professionalism and/or Honor Code violations. In such cases, the Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean, notifies the Associate Dean for Clinical Integration of the suspected violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate th e suspected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. A complete description of the process may be fou nd in section 5.10 of the Academic Bulletin. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may includ e, but is not limited to, the followin g: a. Entering or using the facilities of the CUS OM community without appropriate authori zation or during inappropriate times. b. Knowingly and purposely disrupt ing teaching, research, administrative, or student fun ctions of the CUSOM community. c. Abusive or disrespectful condu ct toward members of the faculty, administrative or pro fessional staff, employees, students, patients, or vis itors of the CUSOM commun ity. Medical simulators should be treated with the same level of respect and professionalism as standardized or actual patients d. Disclosure of privil eged information from campus activities or patient care. e. Taking pictures or recordi ng video in the anatomy lab, clinical lab, OSCE rooms, or in any rooms housing clinical simulators. f. Impro per relationships or activities involving persons entrusted to a student as part of educational requirements, which extend beyond those educational requirements. Entrusted persons may inclu de, but are not limited to, patients or oth er stud ents und er supervisio n. g. Controll ed substance screening tests which show abnorm alities includin g, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine, o r s c r e e n i n g t e s t s w h i c h a r e p o s i t i v e (i.e., evidence of the substance or showing presence) for alcohol, prescription medications withou t a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolin a. Controll ed substance screening results are viewed in l ight of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug En forcement Ag ency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University pol icy. Anoth er example is a breathalyzer result or a blood alcohol concentration sample identi fying levels of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Und er the Influence charge. The presence of these subs tances, 229 regardless of any legal consid erations or adjudication by the courts, is consid ered unprofessional or u nethical behavior by CUSOM. h. Breach of Integrity: Any behavior at any time that is consid ered a severe lapse in judgment and has the potential to damage the pro fessional, ethical or moral integrity of the CUSOM community i. A violation of any policy of the Univ ersity or CUSOM, including but not limited to the American Osteopathic Asso ciation Code of Ethics. 10.2 Code of Miscon duct Violations may includ e, but are not limited to: Harassment (other than a violation of the Title IX Policy), harm, abuse, or damage to any person or property in the CUSOM community. This includ es know ingly or purp osely causing damage to or v andalizing CUSOM community proper ty. Arrest for a crimin al offense other than a minor traffic offense. Participating in academic or clinical endeavors in the CUSOM community while und er the influ ence of alcohol, or controll ed subs tances. Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, illicit subst ances, prescription medications withou t a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismiss al. Controll ed substances will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. Please note this includ es substances which are illegal in the state of North Ca rolina, but which m ay be legal in other states. Com municating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including w ritten or electroni c/Internet communications, which could result in a loss of respect by patients or other memb ers of the public toward the offending student or tow ard CUSO M. Release of Information All documents and other information concerning student discipline, inclu ding written reprim ands, are securely maintain ed in a confid ential file. Such actions become a part of the student 's permanent education record but are only released at the written disc retion of the D ean. However, all disciplinary actions, with the exception of admonitions, are required to be reported on the M edical Student Performance Evaluation (M SPE). 230 10.3 Grievance Processes Resolution and Grievance Proced ure CUSOM recognizes the need for students to voice grievances and to seek resolution to probl ems, disag reements with faculty/administrators, or interpretations of ins pol icy. CUSOM also r ecognizes the respons ibility of the student to express their concerns in a professional and ethical mann er. Concerns may invo lve course grades other than a grade reviewed by the APPS Com mittee, promotion, b ehavioral issues, financial concerns or is sues related to external (e.g. COCA, SACSCOC) accreditation stand ards and pro cedures. This grievance process shall not be used to appeal or review violations of the Honor Code or an appeal from the APPS Com mittee final decision by the Dean or the AP PS Committee. All grievances must be filed in writing to the CUSOM Office of the Dean. All grievance mat erial is securely maintained in the Dean's Office in a specific student/ employee/faculty file as appropriate to the grievance. Each step of the Resolution and Grievance Procedure generally take two (2) weeks to complete, unless otherwise noted. Extensions or waivers to this timeframe may be granted on a case-by-case basis. Notice of a request for an extension from a student must be submi tted in w riting to the Dean within ten (10) c alendar days prior to the deadline. Decisions regarding the request for an extension shall be communicated to the stude nt via letter with in two (2) bus iness days of receipt of the request for an extension. Likewise, if CUSOM needs to extend a deadline, the Office of the Dean shall provide said notice ten (10) days before the due date. Grievance for Academic Resolutions and Appeals An ind ividual concern that is academic in nature should be fi rst discuss ed with the i mmedi ate instructor or preceptor and must be done in a professional manner. This concern generally includ es those that arise from personal confli cts or actions taken against a student individual ly. For individual concerns, if resolution cannot be reached, the student may, within two (2) weeks of the failed resolution, appeal, in writing to the appropriate Asso ciate Dean for the academic year involved. If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the student m ay, with in two (2) w eeks of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the D ean whose decision will consti tute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with a student if the appeal has not b een presented in w riting, in adv ance of the meeting. 231 A concern over general course proc edures or grading pol icies should be addressed throu gh the Class President throu gh the Curriculum Com mittee. If a resolution cannot be reached through the n ormal processes for an acceptable and reasonable request, the Class President may, within two (2) weeks of the failed resolution, appeal in w riting to the appropriate Associ ate Dean for the academic year involve d. If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the Class President m ay, within two (2) w eeks of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will consti tute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the Class President if the appeal has not b een presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. A concern over CUSOM policies and procedures should be addressed through the SGA President and the Director of Student Affairs. If throu gh the normal processes for an acceptable and reasonable r equest, a resolution cannot be reached, the Class President m ay, within two (2) weeks of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will consti tute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the Class President if the appeal has not be en presented in w riting, in adv ance of the meeting. If the concern is financial, or with other areas of CUSOM, the student should follow the appropriate chain of command as defined by the CUSOM Organizational Chart. Reminder: Course Ass essment policies and test question challenges are not covered und er student grievances. See course-specific syllabi for information regarding t hese is sues. Grievance Procedure for Harassment* or Discrimination Students who feel they are being discriminated against have the right to exercise the G rievance Procedure. Retaliation against any individual who files a grievance or participates in the grievance pro cess is strict ly prohib ited.
