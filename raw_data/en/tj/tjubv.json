It is thought to affect more than 1 in 10 women, typically within the first year of giving birth. It can also affect fathers and partners. Many women can feel a bit down, anxious, or emotional in the first days following the birth of their child. This is perfectly normal and is commonly known as the 'baby blues'. These feelings typically pass within a couple of weeks. If the symptoms persist it could be that you're suffering from postnatal depression (PND). This can be much more serious and have a significant impact on you, your baby and family, so it is important to seek help as soon as possible. Symptoms of postnatal depression Postnatal depression can be mild, moderate, or severe and can appear suddenly or gradually over a period of time. It normally starts within 6 weeks of birth but can emerge up to a year after. Symptoms can sometimes be tricky to spot but may include: - Persistent low mood, feeling sad or even angry - Loss of interest in life and lack of enjoyment - Feeling like a failure - Feeling tired in the day, but difficulties in sleeping at night - Problems bonding with your new baby - Not wanting to be around other people - Inability to concentrate or make decisions - Overeating - Frightening thoughts - e.g. thoughts about harming yourself or baby While the symptoms normally disappear within the first few months, it is thought that up to 30% of sufferers may still be ill after the first year. If you're suffering from PND, acknowledging the fact that help is required is half the battle, and a sign of strength not weakness. Nutrition and natural holistic therapies can have a profound effect on helping improve the situation, and informing your GP is also important, so an effective support system can be brought together. With the right support, most women make a full recovery. Ways of helping postnatal depression It is thought that breastfeeding can help to protect against postnatal depression. Several studies suggest that breastfeeding leads to improved sleep and lower levels of stress hormones. Other studies suggest that women who want to breastfeed, but can't for some reason, or those who experience difficulties in feeding, are at greater risk of PND. As with most things, nutrition can play a vital role in both helping to prevent PND and helping to alleviate it if it occurs. I always recommend Bio-Care who can offer free advice on whether you require supplements and what is safe to take during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. A balanced diet, high in fresh fruit and vegetables is even more vital at these times. Helping ensure that your intake of \"mood foods\" is high can be a great help. A variety of nutrients feed the brain and have a huge influence on mood, behaviour and mental processing. Vitamins B3, B6, Folic Acid, B12, C, Zinc, Magnesium and Essential Fatty Acids are all really important. High intake of refined sugars, caffeine and refined carbohydrates can create emotional highs and lows, and leave you full of nutrient poor foods, which can exacerbate the problem. Some mums may also be reacting to food allergies or intolerances, which can make matters worse. Levels of serotonin - a \"mood neuro-transmitter\" - often fluctuate in women, which can also play a part in PND. It comes from the essential amino-acid tryptophan, which is found in protein rich foods such as fish, poultry, cottage cheese, avocados, bananas and wheatgerm. Other than nutritional help, Bach Flower Remedies can be a useful addition. Remedies such as Rescue Remedy for shock (especially if the birth was traumatic), Walnut for the transition into a new phase in your life and Red Chestnut for over care and concern for others. Take a look at Bach's full range and see which remedies best describe how you feel. Thought Field Therapy can lift emotions and alter moods and emotional states very quickly and effectively, and Clinical Hypnotherapy can also be useful - especially if you are unable to relax or reconnect with your baby. Reiki, a gentle yet profound, non-invasive therapy, can help ease many aspects of the situation, helping to relieve stress and anxiety. Aromatherapy for postnatal depression Aromatherapy can be a powerful therapeutic tool in relation to most forms of stress, anxiety, or depression. In relation to PND the most effective essential oils to use are those that have mood enhancing or hormone regulating properties. In her book 'Aromatherapy in Midwifery Practice', Denise Tiran particularly recommends [Clary Sage](https://www.baseformula.com/clary-sage-essential-oil), Rose and Jasmine essential oils for depression and postnatal blues*. [Geranium](https://www.baseformula.com/geranium-bourbon-essential-oil) for mood swings. Frankincense to calm. Lavender to relax and Bergamot, Grapefruit, Mandarin, Neroli, Orange Sweet and [Tangerine](https://www.baseformula.com/tangerine-essential-oil) to lift the emotions. Although Ylang Ylang is often recommended for depression, Denise states that it should be avoided with PND as it can cause the Mum to become too introspective. The oils can be used at home in the bath or in a diffuser or for self-massage, however booking an aromatherapy massage with a professional therapist is highly recommended. There can be few more stress-relieving and reassuring therapeutic experiences than a professional aromatherapy massage, with carefully selected oils, and a kindly sympathetic ear. At a time when you are giving out such a lot of energy and may be worn out and worried, aromatherapy can present a powerful tool in helping to redress the balance, bringing a calming, reassuring and relaxing adjunct in the overall support system. A professional therapist can also make up an appropriate blend of essential oils for you to take home and use regularly to reinforce your treatment plan. * Clary Sage and Jasmine should not be used during pregnancy before 37 weeks.
