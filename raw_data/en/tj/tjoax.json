Known locally as Melukat, a Balinese water purification ritual uses holy water from natural springs, which typically takes place within the grounds of certain temples (like Tirta Empul Temple in Gianyar). It is believed that washing the body with holy water can rid you of negative thoughts, nightmares and even illness. Taking a dip in sacred natural hot springs is also great for any skin concerns, and it's an experience in itself - one that we highly recommend trying. Happy "}
