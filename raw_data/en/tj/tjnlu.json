Much of the mainstreaming ofCAM within academic medicine can be attributed to the estab-lishment and growth of the National Center for Complemen-tary and Alternative Medicine at the U.S. National Institutes ofHealth. But, just as likely, the existence and success of the centeralso reflect a steady elevation in the status of alternative medicalpractices and practitioners, which began in the 1970s. An ob-servable consequence of the professionalization of CAM and itssanctioning within biomedicine has been a concomitant eleva-tion in status and sanction for many discrete therapeutic modal-ities, once viewed as one-off exemplars of unconventional med-icine but now linked under the common rubric of CAM. Themost professionally and socially marginal of these modalities,historically, and the most derided, has been the work of healers(ie, practitioners of various forms of hands-on and/or energy-based healing). As such, their acceptance, even within the CAMcommunity, has lagged well behind practitioners of other, nowmore accepted therapies such as acupuncture, Traditional Chi-nese Medicine, herbal medicine, and even homeopathy. A principal impediment to the acceptance of healing as an established form of therapy has been its seeming resistance torigorous, systematic empirical research. There is good reason forthis perception; what published research exists indeed has beenlargely (but not exclusively) unrigorous and unsystematic. 1Yet there is nothing implicit in the phenomenon of healing thatrequires this to be so. Healing and healers are no less amenableto serious scientic investigation than representative CAM-re-lated topics. 2Indeed, according to Benor,1at least 50 method- ologically sound studies of healing directed to various biologicalorganisms have been published, three quarters of which havereported statistically signicant results indicative of efcaciousoutcomes. Still, the promise of a eld of sophisticated, programmatic healing research remains mostly unfullled. Many of the goodstudies are hidden away in obscure or nonmainstream journalsand thus are unlikely to enter the academic discourse and stim-ulate collaborative efforts. Moreover, despite existence of thesewell-conducted studies, research to date has been plagued, over-all, by methodologically flawed studies. These often includeanalyses informed by theoretically vacant perspectives, or noperspective at all, and by inadequate conceptual models that donot accurately reflect the understandings of healing work postu- lated by healers themselves. None of this is unique to healing.The historical trajectories of Western medical research on somany CAM modalities were similarly flawed until concertedefforts were made to set coherent research agendas featuringmeaningful collaboration between scientists and practitioners. 3 There is no reason to expect that research on healing will notfollow the same path. The challenge is to advance the eld to thepoint where a critical mass is reached that can facilitate suchcollaboration. Another big impediment to progress in the empirical study of healers and healing is rampant confusion regarding the termhealing . This issue is summed up by one of the present authors (J.L.) in a forthcoming article in this journal: To some, healing is an intervention, as in Therapeutic Touch or Reiki. Healing is something done by healers\u2014atherapeutic modality delivered by a practitioner to a client.To others, healing is an outcome, such as recovery fromillness or curing of a disease. As a result of treatment,whether conventional or alternative, we hope to experiencea healing. To still others, healing is a process\u2014for example,Antonovsky's concept of \"salutogenesis.\" When the patho-genic process is halted, we then, ideally, may begin heal-ing\u2014moving from a state of disease to a state of renewedhealth. 2 This paper examines healing mostly in the rst context, as a modality of care delivered by a schooled practitioner to a patient or client, and which, ideally, exhibits a therapeutic or otherwiseefcacious effect. The end result, hopefully, is healing in thesecond context\u2014the remission of a disease state and/or restora-tion of functioning and well-being\u2014by way of mechanisms sub-sumed under healing in the third context, as a salutogenic pro-cess. To be specic, we are speaking here of healing as thecontact or noncontact therapeutic use of the hands, in proximityto the client or patient, and ostensibly transmitting a hypothet-ical bioenergy or otherwise engaging and working with a subtlebiologically based life force or eld. Numerous schools or philosophies of energy healing exist in the United States, some of them supported by established edu-cational and credentialing organizations. Among the mostprominent are Reiki, Therapeutic Touch, Brennan, Jin Shin Do,Healing Touch, Bruyere, Qigong, and Wirkus Bioenergy. Otherwell-known energy healers have built their respective brandthrough successful clinical practices and instruction and men-torship offered to selected trainees. Although these approachesdiffer in many important ways\u2014conceptually, theoretically, andin terms of parameters by which energy healing is delivered\u2014common elements have been identied that justify classicationof the work of energy healers as a single modality. These pertain mainly to a shared mindset that characterizes successful heal-ers regardless of approach. This mindset has been described insimilar, but not identical, ways.

One of the present authors (L.M.), a bioenergypractitioner (BP), identies single-pointed relaxed focus (asense of inner quiet), setting of an ideation or intention to behelpful, and empathic compassion or loving kindness di-rected toward the client. 6 One of the few energy healing approaches to have been sub- ject to more than cursory empirical scrutiny is the Polish-born healer on the detection and manipulation of elds of low-fre-quency subtle energies that encircle and interpenetrate the hu-man body, surrounding every cell like a blueprint or matrix andserving as a medium for the flow of information. 7Unlike other forms of contact or noncontact healing, especially those pur- porting to involve psychic or supernatural powers, Wirkus de-scribes his technique as grounded in an energy transfer betweenhealer and healee\u2014specically, the sensation and transmission ofa real, physical energy that is associated with electromagneticenergy. 8The immediate objective of a bioenergy session, accord - ing to Wirkus, is to restore the innate balance between the bio-chemical and bioenergetic components of the human body. 7 This form of bioenergy healing has been investigated by severalinterested parties, including the U.S. military, the MenningerClinic, and members of the academic community; empiricalreports have been published in mainstream, peer-reviewed basicscience journals. 9,10Wirkus' bioenergy technique has been found capable of seemingly miraculous physical healings, and Wirkus himself has generated sudden electrical surges registering80 volts and higher. 11 The work of healers, not surprisingly, has elicited controversy and skepticism. Supercially, the existence and transmission ofpotentially therapeutic healing energy seem to contravene theconventional worldview underlying modern biomedicine, con-structed as it is on a foundation of philosophical materialism,mechanistic conceptions of human life, and a reductionisticapproach to disease etiology and treatment. 12Criticism and re - jection of bioenergy healing by Western physicians is thus notunexpected, especially in light of misunderstandings resultingfrom unfamiliarity with the topic. 2An example of the negative tone sometimes injected into these critiques is that of one con- troversial study purportedly debunking Therapeutic Touch,13 which although overwhelmingly flawed and itself subsequentlydebunked, 14was extremely strident in its triumphant denuncia - tion of healing and healers as inherently fraudulent. More sensitive and helpful criticism has been offered from within the CAM community. For example, Dossey15contends that energy healing, as a moniker and metaphor for the work of healers, is of limited use. The term energy does not make sensewhen referring to a putative distant therapeutic effect that osten-sibly pushes past the known limits, in space and time, of the transmission of any form of energy ever validated experimen-tally. He prefers use of the terms consciousness and nonlocalmind, since physical scientists have successfully validated andmade sense of the sorts of operations at a distance for theseconstructs that experimental and theoretical work has yet tovalidate for energy healing. 16Many healers would disagree withthis perspective, but it is nonetheless offered as a call to attend more carefully to conceptual and theoretical issues that must beresolved before a scientic eld can fully mature around thistopic. The present paper seeks to clarify conceptual and theoretical issues related to energy healing through consideration of a seriesof case reports based upon the practice of Wirkus Bioenergy.First, energy healing is described within the context of the salu-togenic model of the natural history of health, developed by oneof the present authors (J.L.). Second, the theory and practice ofbioenergy healing are described, and three cases are presented\u2014one an acute presentation, one a chronic degenerative disease,and one a psychiatric case. These cases, and their interpretation,are derived from the many years of work of this paper's otherauthor (L.M.), a master practitioner and teacher of WirkusBioenergy. Finally, implications of these ndings are offered anddiscussed for clinical practice, education, and research. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS Prevailing Western biomedical understandings of etiology andtreatment focus on the identication and eradication of thosefactors that hasten pathogenesis, or the process of becomingdiseased, both in populations and in individuals. The course orspectrum of pathogenesis, from baseline health to the crossingof an outcome threshold, is typically depicted in several stagestraversing exposure, pathological onset, symptomatology or thecrossing of the clinical horizon, tissue changes resulting fromsymptomatic disease, a state of advanced disease, and, eventu-ally, either chronic disease, disability, or death or some type ofrecovery. This narration of the pathogenic process is known asthe natural history of disease. 17 Healing, as such, has no explicit place in this model, which accounts for its low prole in Western medicine. The wordhealing, where it is used at all, is reserved solely for the context ofwound healing and granulation of a focal lesion. Western med-ical treatment is mostly about intervening in the pathogenicprocess, seeking to prevent further tissue and organ damage.Reversal or undoing of the pathogenic process, restoration ofprepathogenic states of health, or attainment of high-level statesof wellness exceeding the prepathogenic condition\u2014these arenot emphasized in Western medicine. Indeed, models of thenatural history of disease provide no guidance as to how toproceed. As a result, healing is not engaged as a concept, is notprioritized as a clinical objective, and is not empirically studied. The most famous effort to rethink the pathogenic orientation of Western medical practice and biomedical science is found inAntonovsky's concept of salutogenesis. 18,19This concept, he explained, is not just the flipside of pathogenesis\u2014not just ori- ented to effecting \"backward\" movement through the naturalhistory of disease, if that were even possible. Rather, it is some-thing radically different. Salutogenesis means the creation ofhealth, or the fostering of healing, much as pathogenesis refers tothe creation or development of disease. Through the concept ofsalutogenesis and his subsequent research and writing on thetopic, Antonovsky wished to convey a fundamental point: thatthose factors that initiate and facilitate healing are not necessar-ily the reverse or negation of those factors that cause disease. For 202 EXPLORE May/June 2008, Vol. 4, No. 3 Bioenergy Healingexample, tobacco smoking may be a signicant risk factor for lung cancer and obesity may be etiologic for coronary arterydisease, but once advanced cases of these diseases have takenhold we would not expect smoking cessation or weight loss bythemselves to cause a malignant tumor to disappear or occludedarteries to unclog, respectively. Healing, in this context, clearlyrequires something more. Contemporary research ndings from psychosocial epidemi- ology, medical sociology, and health psychology have been in-tegrated with Antonovsky's theoretical writing on salutogenesisto produce an alternative to the natural history of disease, fo-cused instead on the healing process. This model, developed byone of the present authors (J.L.), describes the stages that must betraversed by an individual or population in moving from apathophysiological state to a state of remission, recovery, orcure, or to high-level wellness. 17The course or spectrum of salutogenesis begins with the recruiting of a positive psycholog- ical state leading to what Antonovsky referred to as a sense ofcoherence, and then in turn to a coping response, to host resis-tance, and to decreased susceptibility to disease. These stagesmanifest in a sequentially experienced process of cognitive ap-praisal, enhanced psychological competence, moderation orbuffering of a health threat, strengthening of one's physical con-stitution, and ultimately, amelioration of disease or disease risk. This model of the natural history of health provides a saluto- genic lens through which to conceptualize the healing process. Itidenties the pathways, and constituent biobehavioral and psy-chosocial touchstones, along which a diseased person or morbidpopulation must ideally travel in seeking to heal and to restorewholeness. This model is presumably universal\u2014that is, it oper-ates irrespective of classes of therapeutic interventions or puta-tive physiological mediators. Whether induced and explained byrespective methods and mechanisms found in biomedicine, psy-chosocial therapies, bioenergy-based practices, nonlocal healing(such as purported by paranormal healers), and even the super-natural interventions believed in by the religiously devout, heal-ing comes about through an observable sequence of events thatare grounded in the capability of human beings to comprehend,manage, and successfully cope with challenges and threats, thusmarshaling the body's innate resources for restoring equilibriumand strengthening resistance. 20This is the crux of what An - tonovsky meant by his concept of coherence. Such a perspective may shed valuable new light on the nature of the healing process, whether resulting from conventionalmedical treatment or from encounters with healers. In the con-text of energy healing, a salutogenic orientation would suggest,to start, that one consider the potential importance of character-istics of the human actors engaged in the healing transaction.This would include not just the patient or client, but the healer,as well as features of the healer-healee exchange. Such consider-ations are rarely made in pathogenically oriented investigationsof mainstream therapies, where the focus is typically on charac- teristics of the diagnosed disease entity and of the treatment, andsometimes of the patient. This is not surprising, in light of theestablished conventions and worldview of Western biomedi-cine, which favor hierarchical power relationships and valuationof physician-dened clinical observations over and above theself-perceptions of patients. 2More surprisingly, this focus is also characteristic of research on healing, even the best of this research. In so much of thiswork, it is as if the healer is invisible and the interaction betweenhealer and client is presumed to be a constant or invariant andthus unworthy of description, measurement, and control. This iswell in keeping with the Western biomedical perspective of bodyas machine, practitioner as technician, and treatment as con-textless. The highly laudable recommendations recently issued by the Samueli Institute, for example, contain over 200 detailed guide-lines compiled to guide investigators in designing and conduct-ing the best possible studies of healing. 21This report addresses factors related to study design, subject selection, research meth- ods, randomization, masking, placebos, controls, assessment,data collection, analysis, and more. Forty of these guidelinespertain specically to trials of bioeld energy healing. None ofthese, however, has much to say about characterizing or assess-ing the healer or the healer-healee transaction, except for a cou-ple of notes suggesting that practitioners be qualied and beselected based on reputation or established effectiveness.Clearly, if even a fraction of the Samueli recommendations wereto be implemented, research on healing would be dramaticallyupgraded\u2014but we can do better. For healing research, as forclinical research generally, the focus is still mostly on the diag-nosis and the outcome, and much less so, if at all, on attributesof the human beings sharing the care-giving/care-receiving rela-tionship. The idealized case is what seems to matter; the unique-nesses of the people involved and their shared experiences aretreated as less important. If detailed information descriptive of healers and how they ply their trade was more systematically elicited as a part of researchstudies of healing, what might we expect to observe? This is animportant and difcult question. There are no consistent re-search data and few systematic observations to recommend spe-cic areas to assess, but preliminary thoughts are offered here asa starting point. For example, an important variable may be theextent to which the client is cognitively and emotionally en-gaged as a full partner in the healing experience. This might beassessed in conjunction with the extent to which the healer iswilling to ll the role of facilitator and not just professionalexpert provider of an external intervention. Might we hypothe-size that healing encounters which are egalitarian, involving agive-and-take of information and grounded in shared interac-tion, are more efcacious and lasting than healing experiencedsolely as an actively dispensed product to a passive recipient?Might we also hypothesize a further increment in efcacy forhealing that is experienced through a healer acting principally asa facilitator of a client's own pursuit of healing through self-actualization, empowerment, and mastery? A close reading ofthe work of mystics and healers from across the world's esoterichealing traditions, 22supplemented by evidence from the litera - tures on psychotherapy23,24and spiritual development,25sug- gests something along these lines. These ideas, though, awaitfurther exploration in the context of energy healing. A different question is that of explanation: are there fleshed- out theories of healing that propose mechanisms of effect ac-counting for efcacious energy healing encounters? From anemic perspective\u2014that is, from within the ranks of energy healers 203 Bioenergy Healing EXPLORE May/June 2008, Vol. 4, No. 3themselves\u2014numerous theories of healing exist. As detailed else- where,1,26-29healers taxonomically and typologically describe healing in many ways, engaging and differentiating concepts such as pra/H6126na,magnetism, nous, bioplasm, and external Qi. Bioenergy practitioners typically have their own unique perspec-tives on these issues. Etic perspectives\u2014that is, those originating outside of the en- ergy healing world\u2014may also be useful. Salutogenic theory sug-gests that well-being and health will result from successful effortsto enhance psychological coherence and coping, through thecognitive, affective, and psychophysiological benets involvedin restoring physical and psychological equilibrium or balance,strengthening one's innate resistance-enhancing resources, andreducing one's further susceptibility to disease. If one readsclosely, this is not dissimilar (although communicated differ-ently) from how energy healers typically frame and describe theirwork. Naturally, healers themselves might choose to emphasizetheories based on subtle energies or on cutting-edge physicalscience theories of consciousness, especially for nonlocal heal-ing at a distance. But for more proximal healing, whether contact(touch) or noncontact, theoretical writing based on concepts ofsalutogenesis and the natural history of health seem capable ofdescribing a process akin to the therapeutic effect of healingwork. METHODS The three cases presented below are representative of the work ofthe coauthor (L.M.) of this paper, a BP and certied bodyworktherapist with a private clinical practice in the Midwest. Detailedinformation on master-level training and certication in WirkusBioenergy is available elsewhere. 30 A typical bioenergy session with this practitioner includes the following sequence of steps: 1. Upon greeting the client, the practitioner establishes an ini- tial energetic impression based on her intuitive faculties. 2. The practitioner takes a history to establish a baseline for bioenergetic intervention. This is a medical and/or personalhistory and elicits any current symptomatology. 3. The practitioner and client reach a mutual agreement on overall clinical objectives, setting an intention for the bioen-ergy session or sessions. 4. The BP begins the formal bioenergy session by assessing the etheric layer of the energy eld. This eld extends approxi-mately one to three inches around the entire physical body.The assessment is done by, rst, creating a \"ball\" of energybetween the practitioner's hands, using a deep rhythmicbreathing technique. This eld of energy between the handsis then used by the practitioner to evaluate and correct im-balances in the client's etheric eld. This is accomplished byplacing the energy ball around the client's body, rst aroundthe left side of the body and then around the right, andslowly scanning down the eld. Using the ball of energy, thepractitioner \"offers\" extra energy to areas of depletion andhelps to release areas of congestion and distortion. (Thesethree concepts are explained in more depth later.) 5. The practitioner begins to evaluate and correct imbalances in the client's astral eld, which extends beyond the ethericlayer. The practitioner stands several feet in front of the client with her arms extended forward, using her hands tosense and correct energetic imbalances in the client's astrallayer and chakras. 6. The practitioner performs an overall energy reassessment of the etheric and astral layers. 7. In the nal step, the practitioner completes the session with transmission of a mental message. At this point, the practi-tioner reinforces the intention, set at the beginning of the session, through transmission of a mental message directedat the client's sixth chakra, which regulates the mental layerof the body. The practitioner stands in front of the client,cups her hands behind the client's head, creates a ball ofenergy between her own sixth chakra and her hands with theclient's head in the middle, and projects a brief afrmativerestatement of the original intention. She holds this for 30seconds to a minute and closes the energy session by touch-ing her hands to a wall to \"ground\" extraneous energy accu-mulated during the session. Underlying this practice model is a sophisticated theoretical perspective on bioenergy. Many theoretical models postulatehow human energy elds are shaped, formed, and interact.None has been proven or validated conclusively by Westernscience, yet such models are ubiquitous among the world's tra-ditional societies, 31where normative understandings of an ener - getic eld around the human body can be identied. Thesemodels or frameworks serve an instrumental function, most ofall conceptually. To work within any system, one must rst havea good \"map.\" For bioenergy healers, and other CAM practitio-ners, the four core constituent elements of subtle energy anat-omy constitute just such a map: (a) the subtle bodies or sheaths,(b) the subtle energy centers or chakras, (c) bioenergy, and (d) thesubtle energy channels. These concepts go by a variety of namesacross cultures and therapeutic systems. The present author,informed by her training in Wirkus Bioenergy, 32in myofascial release, and in modalities based on Traditional Chinese Medi- cine, has developed an understanding that is at once sui generisand also contextually within a mostly Chinese (rather than In-dian) conceptual framework. In other words, she prefers Qi topra/H6126naand meridians to na/H6126d/H6126s,distinctions that are substantive and not just denominative, 33while retaining selected Indian concepts. The development of an eclectic personal model of subtle energy anatomy and physiology, incidentally, is not un-common among BPs, who typically possess an eclectic educa-tional background. In the present practice model, the human energy eld com- prises seven interpenetrating sheaths or layers of energy arrangedin a three-dimensional web spreading out from a vertical channellocated in the center of the body. In the energy philosophy ofIndia, this is known as the shushumna /H6126channel. The shushumna /H6126is situated in the energy eld adjacent to the location of the spinalcolumn in the physical body. It is flanked, on the left and right,by respective subsidiary channels known as the /H6126da/H6126and pingala /H6126. These channels marshal energy that creates and gives form todiscrete energy vortices or centers, which in turn serve as distri-bution points for the energy gathered originally by the centralchannel. These energy centers, which resemble three-dimen- 204 EXPLORE May/June 2008, Vol. 4, No. 3 Bioenergy Healingsional toroids (or doughnut-shaped objects), are known as chakras, the Sanskrit word for wheels. In most conceptual mod-els, seven major chakras are identied, lined up from \"root\" to\"crown.\" Like totems, each one is believed to be associated orafliated with an array of corresponding elements: an endocrinegland, a nerve plexus, a color, a tone, an emotion, a mantram, etc. The chakras are differentiated by vibratory rate\u2014higher frequen-cies as one moves upward along the chakra system\u2014and theypossess different functions, analogous to our major organs andtheir respective functions. Together, the chakras have much tosay about the structure, function, and vitality of the body, emo-tions, and mind. The energy gathered and distributed by the main channels and then regulated and distributed further by the chakras isknown in Traditional Chinese Medicine as Qi. Within this sys-tem, numerous types of Qi are posited, each with a specializedfunction. Qi, in turn, flows throughout the human vehicle alonga network of primary and secondary channels known as merid-ians. The meridian system is akin to the circulatory, lymphatic,and nervous systems of the gross physical body in that it consti-tutes a single open system of branching connections trans-porting and circulating Qi to all points near and far. Qi hasseveral physiological functions, including nourishing, warming,strengthening, and protecting the body. When Qi cannot flowfreely and unimpeded, physical pathology can result. 34 The BP seeks to facilitate the flow of bioenergy throughout these layers, channels, and centers, known collectively as thebioeld. 35According to existing theories of bioenergy, this bioeld surrounding the body of all living beings, including human beings, constitutes a dynamic eld or \"living matrix\" ofinformation. 36This matrix communicates information to and among the various layers of the human energy body, instructing or informing the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual statesof the individual. Specically, the bioenergy circulates through-out the bioeld and then penetrates our meridian system, whichthen gives direction to all levels of our being. Correcting andmaintaining this system of energy allows for a free flow of infor-mation, which in turn enables the bioeld to self-regulate\u2014thatis, to automatically correct any imbalance that may be causingsymptomatic or presymptomatic disease. Certain challenges present in the energy eld are commonly encountered by energy practitioners. These include energy de-pletion, distortion, and congestion. A depletion in the energy eld refers to a deciency of energy in a particular region of theeld, which can manifest on multiple layers. A distortion of the energy eld is characterized by an area in which energy is presentbut not evenly distributed, as it otherwise would be in a balancedenergy eld. It has a quality of nonregularity. Congestion in the energy eld refers to an obvious excess of energy, or blockage inthe flow of energy, located in a particular region of the eld,which again can manifest on multiple layers. This understandingof bioenergetic pathophysiology is strongly informed by per- spectives on nosology and pathology taught in Wirkus Bioen-ergy training, notably with respect to depletion and conges-tion. 32But this taxonomy also recapitulates concepts ubiquitous throughout systems and schools of esoteric healing, in general, which consistently implicate congestion and imbalance (akin tothis model's distortion) as markers or indicators of disease. 22It is important to note that we have not attempted to describe how these states of pathology feel to the practitioner of bioen-ergy. There is a very important reason for this. Bioenergy feelsunique to each individual sensing it; therefore, there is no \"cor-rect\" way of sensing or perceiving bioenergy. Although theremay be common elements involved in the physical or intuitiveperception of subtle energies\u2014in techniques that are employedand particular affects, or emotions, that arise\u2014it is important fora practitioner to develop his or her own denitional frameworkfor how energy is recognized and experienced. Further, although the practitioner must hold a strong inten- tion to be of benet to the client, there is no imperative for theBP to drive or manipulate the client's energy eld in a predeter-mined direction according to a standard model of practice.Bioenergy work is done to facilitate the balanced flow of energyand information throughout the client's entire energy eld. Thispractice can be analogous to jumpstarting a car battery. Once thecables are hooked up between the working battery and the strug-gling battery, the charge that is offered flows naturally throughthe system to where it is needed. Water seeks its own level, thesaying goes, and so does bioenergy. The BP's clinical objective isnot to treat a disease process, but rather to enable a client'senergy to go where it needs to go\u2014by rectifying depletions,smoothing out distortions, and removing congestion. The cor-rections or healings that occur in bioenergy practice are a resultof the energy system rebalancing itself. Once the system hasbeen provided sufcient and appropriate energy to establish agreater degree of balance, it can begin to draw on this innateresource to correct itself. It is interesting to observe how well this bioenergetic perspec- tive on the healing process parallels key features of the emergingsalutogenic model that has originated from within the academicbiobehavioral and sociomedical sciences. Although character-ized quite differently, essential points emphasized in the bioen-ergetic model are consonant with concepts and processes postu-lated throughout the work of Antonovsky and located within thepresent author's (J.L.) natural history of health. 17Bioenergy healers and population health scientists may come from vastly different worlds and visualize the same terrain through vastlydifferent lenses, but the outcome objectives implicit in theseotherwise very different models seem to parallel each otherclosely. First, bioenergy practice emphasizes, as a clinical objective, what epidemiologists refer to as host resistance\u2014the strengthen-ing or bolstering of the client's physical constitution and innatephysiological resources to enable one to withstand pathogenicexposures or threats, thus ameliorating susceptibility to diseaseand/or facilitating recovery. Second, BPs seek to achieve this byenhancing a client's sense of coherence\u2014Antonovsky's term forthe cognitive, affective, and behavioral competencies that en-able one to make sense of, address, and successfully cope withsuch challenges. Third, bioenergy can be applied not just to reverse or correct an ill client's pathological state and to restorebalance, but also to prevent future pathology in a normal clientand to elevate a healthy client to a state of high-level wellness.The facility with which the concepts and practices of BPs can beaccommodated by a salutogenic perspective attests to the prom-ise of this conceptual and theoretical framework as a template for 205 Bioenergy Healing EXPLORE May/June 2008, Vol. 4, No. 3making sense of the healing process, which, ideally, is also mo- bilized by the application of other CAM modalities. CASES The following three cases are representative of the bioenergypractice of the present author (L.M.), as well as of the types ofcomplaints referred to other experienced BPs. These include aself-referred acute case (severe back pain), a chronic case (consti-pation) referred by another client, and a practitioner-referredmedical case (pain and depression). The descriptions that followexemplify how a BP typically assesses and works with clientspresenting with these classes of complaints. Case 1 The client was a 39-year-old Caucasian male, married with twochildren under the age of ten. He presented with severe backpain in December 2004. The onset of pain had occurred sud-denly, within the past six months. He was recently diagnosedwith disc degeneration and was recommended for back surgeryby two different surgeons. The procedure was to place a \"spinalcage\" around the lower vertebrae. The client had heard of thework of the BP from another client of the BP and was self-referred. The client expressed great apprehension over the rec-ommended surgery. He had been told that he would be unableto participate in sports nor would he be able to lift his childrenand hold them in his arms after surgery. Prior to bioenergy work,the BP tested the client's range of motion (ROM). The client hadlittle ability to bend either forward or backward, and these min-imal movements were accompanied by signicant pain. The BP began the bioenergy session and immediately \"saw\" issues regarding the care of the client's father. This seeing, orobservation, manifested in two ways. First, the BP intuited thesituation regarding the client's father as an image in her mind, ina complete piece, as it were. Second, the BP visually saw a largeeld of congested energy radiating around the client's right hipand lower back. The BP then asked the client about the health ofhis father, and the client immediately burst into tears. He ex-plained that his father was recently placed in a nursing home andthat his siblings had refused to be involved with the care of theirfather. This left the client to carry the entire weight of thisresponsibility on his own. As a result of a very busy work sched-ule, providing for his immediate family, and now being the solecaretaker for an aging and ill parent, the client felt emotionallyand physically overwhelmed. The BP found that congestion was present in the etheric, astral, and mental layers of the energy eld. She then performedbioenergy work to relieve the area of congestion around the righthip and lower back. When the BP retested the client, he hadgained full ROM. The client could also nearly touch his toes andhad gained the ability to bend backwards very deeply with nopain. He said that he felt a \"stretch,\" but no pain at all. The BPnished the session with a short interlude of cranial-sacral work.This was done with the client lying supine on a treatment tablewhile the BP placed her hands on the area where discomfort hadbeen present. The BP also recommended that the client seekhelp at his father's nursing home for assistance in how to managecaring for his father. The client left this session with full ROMand was pain free. As follow-up, the client returned to accom- pany his wife at her own bioenergy session almost two years later,in August 2006. He reported that he has been almost completelypain free since the initial session and had resumed normal activ-ities, including sports. Case 2 The client was a 24-year-old Caucasian female, married with nochildren. She presented in April, 2002, complaining of lifelong,chronic constipation. The client was referred to the BP by hermother. The client stated that she had suffered from constipa-tion since she was a small child. She had used over-the-countermedicines regularly in an effort to cope with this problem. Shewas curious to see if bioenergy work could help resolve hersymptoms. The BP began the bioenergy session and soon noticed an area of energy congestion around the lower abdomen in the ethericlayer, as well as signicant congestion of the second and thirdchakras of the astral layer. The BP attributed this to externalenergetic influences related to her family of origin. There alsoappeared to be sluggishness in the client's ability to energeticallyprocess her emotions. The BP helped her to release these oldenergy congestions. There also appeared to be an area of conges-tion in the etheric and astral layers around the right shoulder andneck area. The BP intuited that this was related to the clienthaving extremely high expectations of herself, often associatedwith congestion in the fth chakra. The BP asked the clientabout this, and the client agreed that this was a huge issue in theclient's life and always had been. The BP worked to relieve thecongestion in these areas, as well as to facilitate the movement ofenergy through the chakras, particularly the second and thirdchakras. The client experienced very noticeable sensations dur-ing energy work, such as \"pulling and releasing\" of energy in theabdomen area. Once the session was completed, the client was instructed to report back with her post-session experiences. The client calledback a week later and reported that for several days following thebioenergy session, she experienced multiple bowel movementsper day, some with very thick, dark stools. These events weretransient, and she was now having regular daily bowel move-ments, which she never recalled experiencing before in her life.The BP has maintained regular contact with the client, workingwith her on other energetic issues as well as working with mem-bers of her family. The client continues to report that she hasnever again suffered from constipation since the initial bioen-ergy session in 2002. She also reports being surprised by the factthat she no longer seems to be so highly self-critical. Case 3 The client was a 55-year-old African-American female, marriedwith three adult children. She rst presented in April 2005 withnumerous physical and emotional complaints. These included,but were not limited to, depression, bromyalgia, fatigue, backand neck pain, and insomnia. These conditions were diagnosedby various physicians, who subsequently prescribed a variety ofmedications, including Wellbutrin (bupropion) and Ritalin(methylphenidate). The client was referred to the BP by herphysical therapist, to whom she had been referred by her pri- 206 EXPLORE May/June 2008, Vol. 4, No. 3 Bioenergy Healingmary care physician. The client reported a history of childhood physical and emotional abuse as well as neglect. By the time shereached her 40s, she had been formally diagnosed with depres-sive symptomatology. This resulted in psychiatric hospitaliza-tion and years of psychotherapy and medical treatment, includ-ing electroconvulsive therapy. When the client rst presented to the BP, she was marginally functional. She was able to participate in volunteer work in hercommunity and to care for her home in a limited fashion but wasunable to go through an entire day without frequent naps andwas easily overwhelmed by physical and emotional stimuli. Atsuch times, she became unable to function. The client was still inthe care of her psychiatrist and psychotherapist, and the BP wasable to consult with the physical therapist regarding this case,when necessary. Once the BP began the bioenergy session, she saw signicant congestion around the client's lower abdomen in the ethericlayer. She also noted signicant depletion of the client's rstchakra. Depletion of this energy center is often seen when aclient presents with low energy levels or with diagnoses such asbromyalgia or depression. In this instance, the BP conductedmonthly bioenergy sessions to release congestion in the ethericlayer of the lower abdomen and gradually strengthen the rstchakra, specically its ability to distribute energy. She alsosought to nourish the spleen chakra on the etheric layer, whichis believed to be the main distributor of energy for this layer.This work was done progressively, allowing for a gentler shift ofenergy to release a long-term pattern. The client gradually began to notice a change in her emotions and physical endurance. Eight months following the initialbioenergy session, the client reported feeling much more ener-gized and much less depressed. She was able to experience somevery signicant family emotional challenges while remainingpresent and calm. She no longer required daily naps. Her backpain remitted and her overall sense of well-being greatly in-creased. The client has continued to work with the BP approxi-mately once per month since the initial session. These follow-upsessions provide a regular opportunity to balance the client'senergy eld. The client is also learning energetic self-regulationtechniques during her sessions, such as methods to center herenergy and focus her attention. These enable her to monitor andregulate her own energy between sessions. In the two years sincebeginning bioenergy sessions, the client's physicians have beenable to adjust her medications. DISCUSSION The presentation of these three cases exemplies how subtleenergy anatomy and physiology operate in pathophysiologicaland clinical contexts. Moreover, resolution of these cases in-vokes phenomena and themes consonant with the concepts andprocesses postulated by salutogenic models such as the naturalhistory of health. This is important to acknowledge, as the clin-ical course of these cases subsequent to working with a BP can-not easily be accommodated by existing understandings ofpathophysiology and therapeutics favored by Western biomed-icine. The take-away points here are thus twofold: (a) the poten-tial value of bioenergy work for clients presenting with certainpathophysiological conditions, and (b) the potential value of alternatives to pathogenically oriented theoretical models suchas the natural history of disease, especially for understanding thehealing process, whether resulting from energy healing or fromany other complementary or mainstream medical modality. The practice model of healing described in this article has features that distinguish it from the methods of Western clini-cians. Bioenergy healing seeks to address the whole person andto empower one's innate healing resources\u2014not to attack a dis-ease process, the objective (stated or unstated) of Western bio-medicine. The principal objective of a bioenergy session, bycontrast, is not the alleviation of disease, but rather promotionof what has been termed \"human flourishing,\" 37regardless of external circumstances. Some healers, the present author (L.M.) included, believe that human health is not achieved solely byremission of disease, but by creating an opportunity for clientsto access and maintain a state of peace and well-being. That thisoften creates the circumstances for \"miraculous\" healings ofphysical and emotional disease processes is a happy coincidenceof the more primary objective. The author's experience with bioenergetic healing has led her to believe that efcacious bioenergy work is not accomplishedby projecting healing at the client, but rather is intimately tied tothe practitioner's ability to hold this state of peace and well-being within oneself. Accordingly, the practitioner must simul- taneously facilitate a healing and experience the healing state. Inthe author's experience, this can only succeed among BPs whoare maintaining a daily contemplative practice that seeks to mo-bilize these states within themselves. Through a daily routine ofmaintaining single-pointed focus, compassion for all beings, andthe intention to be of service, 6a mindset is reinforced that not only is applied in subsequent clinical encounters but becomes a way of life. Bioenergy practitioners, in this respect, may pointthe way toward a future in which each of us can become our ownhealer. Naturally, we would still seek aid for serious health chal-lenges, but we would recognize that successful healing is ulti-mately attributable, in large part, to characteristics of ourselvesand not solely to those of a particular practitioner or therapeuticmodality. This perspective differs not only from the Western biomedi- cal model, but from many contemporary CAM modalities. Alltoo often, therapeutic practices originating in ancient teachingand healing lineages have become co-opted by Western medi-cine as a result of the latter's well-intentioned efforts to rational-ize and integrate CAM practices into mainstream medical care.Recent efforts to patent and license yoga techniques and herbalremedies provide representative examples. 38Such practices are thus no longer integral components of complex, holistic models of genuine human flourishing, but instead are reduced to stand-alone interventions, like pills, whose effectiveness may be com-promised when divorced from their natural context. Practitio-ners of healing work, of whatever type, would do well toadvocate for a practice model whereby their interventions,whether medical, psychotherapeutic, or energetic, strive to focuson restoring function to and enhancing the general well-being ofthe whole person and not solely on eradicating discrete patho-logical states. 207 Bioenergy Healing EXPLORE May/June 2008, Vol. 4, No. 3To this end, the professional training of healers will need to move beyond the weekend workshop model of continuing edu-cation and credentialing, which is typical of both energy healingand Western medicine. The training of healers must focus moreexplicitly on fostering an understanding of the broader contextthat informs the healing technique being learned. It also shouldfacilitate the kind of personal growth that is required to embodythe states of wholeness and balance that healers seek to engenderin their clients, as described earlier. Participation in a brief sem-inar or retreat does not sufciently qualify one as a \"masterhealer,\" no matter any ofcial designation bestowed upon at-tendees. The training of healers must instead instill a recognitionthat being a healer is a lifelong commitment to personal as wellas professional development. If healers are to be effective facili-tators of human flourishing in their clients, then they will needto cultivate this state within themselves. Naturally, this is a verydifferent understanding of the training model than is found inWestern medicine or even in many CAM modalities. As for the education of physicians about healing, advocates of healing work have good reason for hope. Granted, the day maynot come soon when Western physicians are routinely offeredelective training in energy healing, as has occurred in some nurs-ing schools since the 1970s. Undergraduate and postgraduatemedical education is already a full plate; moreover, we recognizethat there are other pressing priorities. Contact or noncontacthealing is unlikely to replace or preempt elements of Westernmedicine in the near future, no matter the utopian visions ofsome proponents of healing. But energy healers are already be-coming integrated into the conventional primary care medicalpractices of those physicians envisioning a more holistic modelof the team approach to ofce-based medicine. More and more,healers are working alongside body workers, CAM practitioners,and the usual allied health professionals who populate suchpractices. Healers have begun to ll important niches in thesesettings, as well as in hospitals and pain treatment centers. Theyprovide follow-up care for clients with diagnosed chronic con-ditions; offer cost-effective, safe, and noninvasive treatment; area source of hands-on human contact and compassionate sup-port, a secondary outcome with potential therapeutic benet;and furnish medical colleagues with useful feedback regardingpatients' bioenergetic status. 6 In nearly all prior biomedical research and writing on this topic, efforts to make sense of energy healing typically havereferenced the physical sciences as the cognate eld best suitedto provide theories for understanding a putative therapeuticeffect. Representative examples include provocative andthoughtful discussions of torsion and gamma radiationhormesis, 39information transport mechanisms,40quantum en - tanglement,41and transmission and reception of extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy.42Recent work along these lines has been scholarly, sophisticated, and well-intentioned, and has contributed considerably to our basic-science under- standing of this complex phenomenon. But such contributionsdo little to implicate the work of BPs in the enhancement ofhealth or in the amelioration of disease. For the most part, thelarger literature on the putative how and why of energy healingfails to broach or discuss health or healing, neither dening theseconcepts nor detailing the intrinsic processes that presumablylead to these outcomes. We believe that this reflects the general disregard for conceptual and theoretical engagement of thesetopics within Western medicine in general. What is required to change this are efforts to reconcile the concepts and theories of healers with the basic-science knowl-edge of Western biomedicine, and in turn to integrate theseunderstandings into emerging theories of health and healing.This paper has sought to make a contribution to this end, butmuch is left to accomplish. The need for collaborative partner-ships between clinicians, research scientists, and BPs (and otherhealers) may seem like an obvious point, but so far it has notbeen realized. Yet without such collaboration, the conceptualand theoretical integration called for cannot be achieved, nomatter the good intentions of all parties involved. Each playerbrings something unique, and indispensable, to the table, andwithout all of the pieces, the puzzle will not be completed. It is difcult in the setting of this present paper to identify explicitly just what all of the key scientic questions and researchfoci will turn out to be as we begin, more systematically, toexplore the phenomenon of energy healing. But it can be statedwith full condence that Western clinicians and biomedicalscientists working in isolation will never be able to identify theseissues nor investigate them successfully. They do not have thesubstantive understanding of bioenergy practice possessed bycredentialed healers, nor are they likely to be familiar with recentwork on the production of health and healing conducted bythose behavioral, social, and public health scientists who special-ize in population-health theory and research. Such collabora-tion, admittedly, may not come easily in the present academicand funding environment. But partnerships like the one thatproduced the present paper are well worth pursuing if we wish tofurther our understanding of the salutogenic process that occursnot just in response to bioenergy work, but as a result of effectiveconventional and complementary medical therapies of all types.
