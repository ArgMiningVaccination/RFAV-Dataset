It establish es a common voice and perspective on health and wellness. It describes the Nations' overall direction regarding their vision and guiding principles; who the Nations are; and their Regional and Nation health and wellness priorities. This plan describes how the Nations and their partners will work together based on the 7 Directives , the guiding principles outlined in the Indigenous Nations of the Interior Declaration of Unity (2010) , the Interior Partnership Accord (2012) and the Nation Letters of Understanding with Interior Health Authority . The Interior Nations' priorities focus on improving health programs and services, bringing financial resources and decision -making closer to home and strengthening, maintaining and aligning capacity with communities and Nations through a system that is deeply rooted in the values, principles and cultures of the 7 Nations of the Interior. Governance structures and proc esses continue to evolve to support implementation of this vis ion and the iRHWP describes the various entities that the 7 Nations will establish, in partnership with Interior Health Authority and the First Nations Health Authority, to support technical wor k and decision -making. The iRHWP also sets the intention to further refine communication and engagement processes to ensure that everyone receives the information they need and have opportunities for engagement and to provide input and direction to the wor k moving forward. Each of the 7 Nations have identified emerging health priorities and remain committed to developing Nation Health and Wellness Plans over the next year. Regional priorities, summarized below, have been identified based on the 7 Directive s and the priorities shared among multiple Nations. In future planning cycles, Nation plans, which have been informed by community priorities, will be the basis of the Regional Health and Wellness Plan. This interim plan is a living document that will be revisited and revised to reflect the structures and processes being developed and the further planning work that will be done throughout the year by the 7 Nations. This work will lay the foundation for the 7 Nations to continue to operationalize the 7 Directives and Unity P rinciples, and to transform the health system serving their people to one that is based in their values, principles and cultures and best supports the health and wellness of the people of the 7 Interior Nations.

Four years on from the signing, the Nations of the Interior Region remain committed to the Nation model of working to gether \"for the betterment of the health, safety, survival, dignity and well -being of all of our peoples.\" It is in this spirit of unity and cooperation that we celebrate the completion of a Community - Driven and Nation -Based interim Interior Regional Healt h and Wellness Plan (iRHWP). In developing this plan we are guided by the directives provided by First Nations leadership in British Columbia through Consensus Papers 2011 and 2012. Consensus Paper 2012 mandated the development of regional teams and supp orts, regional planning (iRHWP) and the phase -in of regional funding envelopes. This interim plan provides a foundation, for in addition to identifying key emerging priorities for health service improvements, the iRHWP highlights the ongoing development of our regional governance structures and processes and the further planning that will be conducted by each of the 7 Nations to develop Nation Health and Wellness Plans over the next year. The iRHWP further builds on the Interior Partnership Accord and defines how we will begin to transform the relationship between our Nation s and Interior Health Authority, leading to greater collaboration and joint efforts to ensure high quality and equitable services for our people. Implementation of the prioriti es in the iRHWP will lay the groundwork for putting our Unity Declaration and the 7 Directives into practice and sets the stage for the transformative work we will be doing to establish a health system that is embedded in our values and principles and supp orts the health and wellness of our Nations. Chief Zach Parker D\u00e3kelh Den\u00e9 Nation Chief Arthur Adolph St'\u00e1t'imc Nation Gwen Nation Mic Werstuik Syilx Nation Michel Nlaka'pamux Nation Chief Bernie Mack Tsilhqot'in Nation Kukpi7 Wayne Christian Secwep emc Nation 2 Introduction At Gathering Wisdom for a Shared Journey IV (May 2011), BC First Nations leadership provided direction for each of the five health regions to develop a \"Regional Health and Wellness Plan\" that establishes a shared voice and priorities for health and wellne ss1. This interim Interior Regional Health and Wellness Plan (iRHWP) is the product of this direction. It builds on a significant amount of work accomplished to date by First Nation s, federal and provincial government partners , and partners within the region. It establish es a common voice and perspective on health and wellness among the 7 Nations of the Interior Region , Nations' overall direction regarding their vision and guiding principles; who the Nations are; and their Regional and Nation health and wellness priorities . This plan describes how the Nations and their partners will work together based on the 7 Directives, the guiding principl es outlined in the Indigenous Nations of the Interior Declaration of Unity (2010) , the Interior Partnership Accord (2012) and the Nation Letters of Understanding with the Interior Health Authority . The iRHWP is an important milestone for the 7 Interior Nations in putting the Community -Driven, Nation -Based approach into practice and identifying the emerging priorities of the Nations . Additionally , stemming from the signing of the Partnership Accord between the 7 Nations and Interior Health Authority, t his is the first time a planning process has been conducted jointly among the 7 Nations, the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) and Interior Health A uthority. This development of a joint plan will enable increase d alignment and coordination of the work of the two Health Authorities with the priorities that have been identified by the Nations. The iRHWP will guide regional envelop e decision - making and guide FNHA work in partnership with the Interior region and othe r population health and provincial scale initiatives . It will also inform the provincial work and planning processes of the F irst Nations Health Council (F NHC ) and First Nations Health Directors Association ( FNHDA ). Overall, t he iRHWP will support the deli very and transformation of high -quality health and wellness programs and services for First Nations in the Interior region. This interim plan is a living document that will be revisited and revised to reflect the structures and processes being developed and the further planning work that will be conducted throughout the year . The Nations of the Interior remain committed to creating Nation Health and Wellness Plans2 and, over the coming year , the fou ndations will be laid for a planning cycle whereby Community Health and Wellness P lans will inform Nation Health and Wellness P lans and these Nation Plans will b e the basis of future Regional Health and Wellness P lans (see figure 1). 1 See Consensus Paper: Brit ish Columbia First Nations Perspectives on a New Health Governance Arrangement (2011). Additional information on the history and context of the First Nations Health Transfer, foundational documents and governance structure are provided in Appendix B. 2 See Interior Partnership Accord (2012). 3 Methodology to develop the interim Regional Health and Wellness Plan The iRHWP was developed through a process of reviewing existing planning work already completed by the Nations3 and holding discussions about the iRHWP and Nation priorities at Nation Assembly meetings conducted throughout February and March, 2014. Based o n the discussions at the Nation Assemblies and further engagement within their respective Nations, the Community Engagement H ubs took the lead in gathering and refining the priorities and profiles of th eir respective Nation s to be included in this iRHWP. In the Nation Assemblies and documents , common priorities among the 7 Nations emerged and these were identified as Regional priorities . Figure 1 : Health and wellness planning framework 3 See References for list of documents consulted. \"We need to move out of crisis mode and into proactive mode\" Chief Zach Parker 4 Vision and Guiding Principles Collective efforts of First Nations in BC are united and guided by a vision of \"Healthy, Self -Determining and Vibrant BC First Nations Children, Families and Communities.\" The work toward achieving this overall vision is guided by the following shared values: Respect, Discipline, Relationships, Culture, Excellence, and Fairness4. First Nations in BC also set and agreed on the following 7 Directives: Directive #1: Community -Driven, Nation -Based Directive #2: Increase First Nations Decision -Making and Control Directive #3: Improve Services Directive #4: Foster Meaningful Collaboration and Partnership Directive #5: Develop Human and Economic Capacity Directive #6: Be without Prejudice to First Nations Interests Directive #7: Function at a High Operational Standard 4 FNHA vision and values. \"We need to incorporate our values and principles into this health initiative, that includes traditional foods and medicines\" Chief Art Adolph 5 Declaration of Unity The 7 Interior Nations ' vision and guiding principles are based upon the Declaration of Unity (2010) . This declaration confirmed the commitment of the 7 Nations of the Interior Region to work together in implementing the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan through a Nation to Nation model. In the Declaration , the Nations of the Interior committed to \"respectfully work together, collaborating for the betterment of the health, safety, survival, dignity and well-being of all of our peoples \". The Unity Declaration includes the following principles shared by the Interior Nations: Health and wellness outcomes and i ndicators will be defined by each Nation Partnerships will be defined by each Nation Agreements will be negotiated and ratified by the Nations No Nation will be left behind; needs are addressed collectively The federal fiduciary obligation must be strengthened, not eroded Services will be provided to all of our people regardless of residency/status Adequate funding will be provided for our corporate structure(s) Socio -economic indices will be incorporated into planning and projections - plan for 7 generations Negotiations will be interest based - not position based (Nations define) Community hubs wil l be linked to the health governance process Documents will be kept simple and understandable The Interior Leadership caucus will meet regularly Liability will be minimized; the Nations will inherit no liability from other entities Celebration will be incl uded in all activities The speed at which development occurs will be determined by the Nations The authority to govern rests with each Nation, as does the responsibility for decision -making 6 Social and Cultural Context Action on the Social Determinant s of Health The 7 Nations recognize that improving the health of their people will take more than the implementation of the Regional H ealth and Wellness P lan. Within a First Nations holistic perspective there is recognition of the significant impact that the social determinants have on health and wellness. Factors such as housing, employment opportunities, income and wealth, working conditions, education and experiences of colonization, residential schools and institutional racism all contribute to people's health and wellness. Addressing these complex issues challenges those working in health to reach out and build partnerships with other sectors to create and a dvocate for the supportive environments and public policy that will enable First Nations people to achieve the quality of life they are entitled to as an inherent right . This requires an approach that is collaborative and recognizes and build s upon the int egral strengths and assets of the 7 Nations. First Nations Perspective on Wellness The First Nations Perspective on Wellness is a holistic health and wellness approach that provides a guide for health and wellness planning, program and service delivery t hroughout British Columbia . It builds on the recognition that health and wellness are intimately connected, and that they encompass emotional, mental, spiritual and physical health and well -being. It also recognizes how health and wellness is interwoven wi th the health and wellness of families, communities, Nations, Land, and other aspects of the contexts we live in. The First Nations Perspective on Wellness has been derived from a holistic perspective and concepts from traditional knowledge. Figure 2. First Nations Perspective on Wellness \"We are a land based culture. In order for us to have healthy Nations and communities we need to look at ways to heal the land, in turn we will heal our people\" Chief Art Adolph 7 Interior Nations The territorial land base of the Interior Region, as defined by BC Regional Health Authority boundaries , covers almost 216,000 square kilometres. For health planning purposes, there are First Nations communities included in the Interior Region that may lie outside this geographic boundary , creating unique jurisdictional complexities . It is also essential that planning take into consideration the diversity of the geography and climate in the region , the travel distances required and the effects of weather conditions. According to Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada data (AANDC 2011), the First Nations population in the Interior Region is close to 30,000 , representing 22% of the First Nations population in BC. The 54 Interior First Nations communities vary in size and include a number of small and isolated communities . Figure 3 . First Nations Communities in the Interior Region 8 Governance Structures and Processes The First Nations of the Interior have formed the Interior Region Health Caucus, which serves as an engagement forum for the political (i.e. Chiefs) and technical leaders (i .e. Health Directors or Health Leads) relating to the implementation of the resolut ions and consensus papers passed at Gathering Wisdom for a Shared Journey forums and the Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nations Health Governance. The Caucus represents 54 First Nations of the 7 Nations: The Interior Region Caucus Terms of Reference outline s the roles and responsibilities of the g overnance entities and technical advisory bodies that are being established to create the space for Nations to provide gui dance and make decisions . The diagram and descriptions below outline the governance structures and processes involving the Interior Nations. Figure 4 . Interior First Nations Health Governance Pathways Model Interior Regional Caucus The Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus table provides a forum for the 54 First Nations of the Interior Region to engage with each other for purposes of planning, priority setting and decision -making rela ted to regional health matters. The Health Caucus prov ides guidance to the Interior Region Nation Executive, Partnership Accord Leadership Table and provides advice and recommendations to the FNHC, FNHA and FNHDA along with approval of region specific documents. 9 7 Interior Nations The province is broken down into five geographic regions for the purposes of health care service delivery. The Interior Region coincides with the boundaries of the Interior Health Authority and is comprised of 7 distinct Nations: Each of the 7 Nations will develop a Nation Health Plan and negotiate a Letter of Understanding, or other agreement, independently with Interior Hea lth. Issues or interests that are common to the Nations will be addressed in a collaborative manner. Interior Region Nation Executive The Interior Region Nation Executive Table is comprised of one representative from each of the 7 Nations of the Interior Region, and acts as an Executive body to the Interior Region Caucus, carrying out direction s in between Caucus sessions. The Executive Table offers a more equitable decision -making capacity for Interior First Nations and gives regional direction to the First Nations Health Council. First Nations Health Council Interior Representat ives The FNHC is comprised of 15 members, with 3 members appointed by the First Nations resident in each of the 5 geographic Health Aut hority regions of the province. The 54 First Nation Communities of the Interior Region, through the Caucus, appoint their 3 representatives to the Health Council from amongst the 7 Nation representatives who form the Interior Region Nation Executive. Interior Region Nation Technicians Table The Interior Region Nation Technicians Table is comprised of one representative from each of the 7 Nations of the Interior Region and acts as an advisory body to the Interior Region Nation Executive providing recommendations to the Interior Region Nation Executive Table on concerns common to the region. Partnership Accord Leadership Table The Partnership Accord Leadership Table is comprised of Senior Officials from Interior Health Authority along with the 7 Nation representatives of the Interior Region Nation Executive. The Partnership Accord Leadership Table is a decision -making body that provides direction and oversees the implementat ion of the Partnership Accord. The Table serves as a senior and influential forum for partnership, collaboration, and joint efforts on First Nation and Aboriginal priorities, policies, budgets, programs and services in the Interior Region. Interior First Nations Health & Wellness Committee The Interior First Nations Health & Wellness Committee is comprised of Senior Management from Interior Health Authority and First Nations Technicians appointed by the 7 Nations of the Interior Region. The Committee is an advisory body that provides recommendations to the Partn ership Accord Leadership Table. Upon agreement from the Nations, space may be created for one Urban and one M\u00e9tis representative. \"Ther e are going to be growing pains but in the end we are going to have better health services\" Chief Percy Guichon 10 Interior Region al Team The Interior Region al Team of the FNHA includes the Regional Director, the Regional Health Liaison, an Administrative Assistant and a collaborative relationship with the Nation Engagement Coordinators . This team also draws on support from teams throughout FNHA and will be evolving as regional processes continue to develop. This regional and matrix approach will be outline d in the regional team charter that is currently being reviewed and updated based on input gathered through the regional planning process. Communication and Engagement For effective health governance, engagement and communication must be community -driven and Nation -based. It must be inclusive and happen at every level. Communities can only give direction if communications are provided in clear and plain language, and they are given sound information upon which to base decisions. There is currently a robust and dynamic communications and community engagement network to support both political and health service conversations, and specifically to support ongoing planning and implementation of plans in the Interior region. Leadership has recognized the need for this network to evolve in order to keep pace with the emerging governance and partnership structure, and the evolving role of the FNHA to enhance the delivery of quality healt h services to BC First Nations. The Regional Team support s regional efforts in communication, collaboration, and planning, and serve s as a main contact for information within the region. Also, the Regional Team will work in partnership with Interior Health to streamline and integrate community engagement eff orts. Communicatio n has been identified as a key r egional priority of the Nations and, as part of addressing this priority, an Interior communication plan will be developed and implemented. This plan will strive to ensure clarity, understanding and consi stency around communications among all partners within the region and support communication and engagement on health and wellness issues, including priority areas identified in the iRHWP. The process used in the development of the iRHWP, which involved en gaging with health technicians and Chiefs at Nation Assemblies and other meetings occurring prior to the Regional Caucus will continue to be one of the key processes for communication and engagement. Ongoing, regular communic ation processes among the FNHA Regional T eam, Interior Health Authority, Hub Coordinators, Health Leads and Governance Entities will also continue and be further refined in the communication plan that will be developed in the Region. \"We need to make the plan unique to our Nation and unique to our communities. We need to be working together with our partners\" Chief Joe Alphonse 11 Strategic Challenges and Opportunities In the work moving forward there are a number of opportunities for health service improvements and supporting increased health and wellness ; however, there are also challenges that will be encountered, many of which are deeply entrenched and will require time and creativity to address. Challenges Persistent health gaps Inequities facing First Nation communities compared to the non -First Nation population Limited resources Social determinants of h ealth Historic and current government policy Jurisdictional complexities Cultural s afety Opportunities Improved planning for , and res ponding to , regional needs (including socio -geographic factors) Capacity, decision -making, pol icy-making and health care design and delivery closer to home Foster meaningful collaboration and partnerships regionally Maximize other revenue streams at the regional level Regional influence over investments Address region -specific information gaps \"The most important priority is to get money to our community. That's us doing our job\" Chief Jonathan Kruger 12 interim Interior Regional Health and Wellness Plan Goals Long term goal Bringing financial resources and decision -making closer to home and strengthening, maintaining and aligning capacity with communities and Nations in a health system that is deeply rooted in the values, principles and cultures of the 7 Nations of the Interior. Goal 1: Design strong , sustainable health and wellness services that support community capacities Goal 2: Improve health and wellness programs and services to better meet the needs of the Interior Nations Goal 3: Align First Nations Health Authority and Interior Health Authority planning and investment s with the Interio r Regional Health and Wellness P lan Goal 4: Improv e access to high quality health services and infrastructure Regional Priorities To support the implementation of the goals of the Nations , and to make early improvements on priority health services, regional priorities have been identified and described below , in ali gnment with the 7 Directives5. Upon completion of the Nation Health and Wellness Plans that will be developed over the next year , the regional priorities will be revisited and updated to reflect the 7 Nations ' priorities. 5 Regional priorities were identified through analysis and synthesis of the discussions that occurred at Nation Assemblies that took place February through March, 2014, and the documents listed in the Reference section below. 13 The framework for planning that the Interior Nations will work towards is Nation Health and Wellness Plans informed by C ommunity Health and Wellness P lans, and a Regional Health and Wellness Pl an that is based on the Nation P lans. This planning process will lay the foundation for implementing the Community -Driven, Nation -Based approach and linking investment and supports with community and Nation priorities . Priorities: 1. Community -Driven, Nation -Based 1.1. Support each Interior community to have an up -to-date Community H ealth and Wellness Plan 1.2. Develop Nation Health and Wellness Plans in each of the 7 Nations 1.3. Conduct asset and service mapping and complete the Interior Region expenditure analysis to support planning processes \"We worked on and signed health transfer so we could have better control and better options for our health care\" Kukpi7 Ann Louie 14 The 7 Nations are in the process of developing and refining their health governance structures and the processes for how they will work together and make joint decisions. Establishing these structures and processes and strengthening Nations' policies will lay the foundations that will enable good governance and increased decision -making and control by the 7 Nations. Ensuring all people are included in decision -making and control, regardless of gender, age or status, is also an essential part of conducting this work in alignment with the values and principles of the Interior Nations. Priorities : 2. Increased First Nations Decision -Making and Control 2.1. Establish governance and technical structures and processes enabling regional and Nation -based decision -making 2.2. Identify and develop strategies and policies for topics that require a regional approach 2.3. Enhance regional data governance and processes ensuring data and research activities are conducted in ac cordance with Nation priorities, policies and protocols \"Data governance is having the information you need to tell the story\" Gwen Phillips 15 Systems transformation for service improvements will be a long term process as Nations look at strategies to incorporate holistic wellness perspectives and improve programs and services to ensure they are equal to or better than services provided in the provincial system. The Nation planning that will be taking place will provide an opportunity for Nations to identify their service improvement priorities. Emerging priorities within the region are listed below. Priorities: Additional Goals: 3. Improve Services 3.1. Improve the First Nations Health Benefits Program to better meet the needs of First Nations people 3.2. Promote mental wellness and reduce harmful substance use 3.3. Promote Elder wellness and increase supports enabling Elders to remain at home or close to home a.

Enhance health data and information management systems Holistic Wellness Access to High Quality Services Infrastructure 3.4. Promote child and family wellness and improve services in collaboration with social service partners 16 The signing of the Partnership Accord set the stage for fostering meaningful collaboration and partnership among Interior Health Authority and the 7 Nations . Nations have also been negotiating Letters of Understanding with Interior Health Authority and look to strengthen the ir relationship with the Health Authority throu gh joint implementation of the work plans developed from the se agreements . Priorities: 4. Foster Meaningful Collaboration and Partnership 4.1. Build a collaborative relationship with Interior Health Authority based on the Partnership Accord and Nation Letters of Understanding 4.2. Align Interior Health Authority First Nations and Aboriginal planning and investment with the Interio r Regional Health and Wellness P lan 4.3. Explore mechanisms to resolve the issues of Nations whose territories encompass more than one Regional Health Authority \"We want to be recognized as intelligent, educated and experienced people and ensure that we have a voice at the table\" Sheila Dick, Health Director for Canim Lake 17 Bringing resources closer to home has been an overarching theme of the Interior Nations . As stated in the Unity Declaration , the Nations \"desire to establish and maintain a desired level of capacity in the areas of health research, health c areer development, health service delivery (including traditional practices), information management and governance (health planning, administration, policy/program design and implementation and...), in order to achieve their individual and collective Nation visions.\" Priorities: 5. Develop Human and Economic Capacity 5.1. Increase the number of First Nations health professionals and staff working in each of the Interior Nations 5.2. Improve recruitment and retention of health service providers in First Nations communities 5.3. Explore economic opportunities that will support sustainability and build First Nation health sector capacity \"Equal access to health services by recognizing our community clinics the same as those off reserve\" Jackie McPherson, Health Services Coordinator, Osoyoos Indian Band 18 As outlined in the Consensus Paper (2011), it is essential that there be no impact on Aboriginal Title and Rights or the treaty rights of First Nations, no im pact on the fiduciary duty of the crown, no impact on existing federal funding agreements with individual First Nations, unless First Nations want the agreements to change, and is without prejudice to any self -government agreements or court proceedings. Priority : 6. Be Without Prejudice to First Nations Interests 6.1. Establish processes for engaging M \u00e9tis and urban Aboriginal groups that respect and reflect the inherent rights and interests of First Nations peoples 6.2. The Interior Caucus will consider avenues for supporting self-determination and jurisdiction interests of the Interior Nations 19 The newly established structures and processes among the Interior Nations will require processes, procedures and policies to enable them to function at a high operational standard in line with the principles of the Interior Nations. Additionally, data and research can be used to inform best practices. Priorities: 7.1. Establish clear, consistent communication and information -sharing among partners within the Interior Region 7. Function at a High Operational Standard 7.2. Strengthen Interior Region processes for reciprocal accountability 7.3. Develop indicators enabling Nations to report from the perspective of their values, principles and understandings of wellness 7.4. Explore the potential for more effective and efficient use of existing resources 20 Nation Priorities This section contains a profile and emerging priorities of each of the 7 Nations in th e Interior R egion. These priorities were drawn from existing plans and community engagement reports provided by the Nations. Based o n the discussions at the Nation Assemblies and further engagement within their respective Nations, the Community E ngagement Hubs took the lead in gathering and refining the priorities and profiles of their respective Nations to be included in this iRHWP. As the Nations conduct further planning in the development of their Nation Health and Wellness Plans, these priorities will be updated and expanded. \"When we really look at our early teaching with r ites of passage and our legends, we focused on the betterment of our communities\" Chief Art Adolph 21 D\u00e3kelh Den \u00e9 1. Lhoosk'uz Den \u00e9 Nation ( receives services from N orthern Health and at times Interior H ealth when members are referred ) 2. Lhtako Dene Nation (receives services from N orthern Health ) 3. Ulkatcho (part of V ancouver Coastal Health but receives services from Interior Health through a Memorandum of Understanding ) The Southern Carrier territory is part of the Cariboo -Chilcotin Region in the interior o f British Columbia. The Southern Carrier today are represented by the people of Red Bluff (Lhtako Dene Nation), Kluskus (Lhoosk'uz Den\u00e9 Nation) and Ulkatcho. The Southern Carrier are a semi -nomadic people who migrate with the seasons. They are hunter gath erer people who depend on the land as their way of life. They have been able to maintain an independent, self -sufficient lifestyle based on hunting, trapping and fishing that provides them with the animals, fish, berries and plants for the medicines they m ay need throughout the seasons. Provisions are taken throughout the summer months to make sure there is enough food dried and stored away for the winter months. Most Carrier call themselves D \u00e3kelh, meaning \"people who travel around by boat\". The traditional Carrier way of life was based on a seasonal round, with the greatest activity in the summer when berries were gathered and fish caught and preserved. The mainstay of the economy was fish, especially the several varieties of salmon , which were smoked and stored for the wint er in large numbers. Hunting of deer , caribou , moose , elk, black bear , beaver , and rabbit provided meat, fur f or cloth ing, and bone for tools. With the exception of berries and the sap and cambium of the Lodgepole Pine , plants played a relatively minor role as food, though Carrier peop le are familiar with and occasionally used a variety of edible plants. Plants were used extensively for medicine. Winter activity was more limited, with some hunting, trappi ng, and fishing under the ice. Fish, game, and berries still constitute a major por tion of the Carrier people's diet. The D \u00e3kelh Den\u00e9 have developed a work plan and the priorities identified in this plan are summarized below: 1. Community and Nation Wellness 1.1. Development of the RHWP 1.2. Incorporate Elder and Youth representative s in the Health Committee 2. Land and environmental health 2.1. Mold remediation of affected buildings 3. Social determinants of health 3.1.

Tobacco Plains Ktunaxa (pronounced 'k -too-nah-ha') people have occupied the lands adjacent to the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers and the Arrow Lakes of British Columbia, Canada for more than 10,000 years. The Traditional Territory of the Ktunaxa Nation covers approximatel y 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) within the Kootenay region of south -eastern British Columbia and historically included parts of Alberta, Montana, Washington and Idaho. For thousands of years , the Ktunaxa people enjoyed the natural bounty of the land, seasonally migrating throughout our Traditional Territory to follow vegetation and hunting cycles. We obtained all our food, medicine and material for shelter and clothing from nature - hunting, f ishing and gathering throughout our Territory, across the Rocky Mountains and on the Great Plains of both Canada and the United States. European settlement in the late 1800s, followed by the establishment of Indian Reserves, led to the creati on of the p resent Indian Bands. Ktunaxa citizenship is comprised of Nation members from seven Bands located throughout historic traditional Ktunaxa territory. Five Bands are located in British Columbia, Canada and two are in the United States. Many Ktunaxa citizens a lso live in urban and rural areas \"off reserve\". The Ktunaxa language is unique among Native linguistic groups in North America. Ktunaxa names for landmarks throughout our Traditional Territory and numerous heritage sites confirm this regi on as traditio nal Ktunaxa land. Shared lands, a rich cultural heritage, and a language so unique that it is not linked to any other in the world, make the Ktunaxa people unique and distinctive.

The ir lands, Secwepemc\u00fal 'ecw, are geographically located in the South Central Interior of the Province. The Secwepemc, in terms of land base and population, are one of the largest Indigenous people in BC. The ir lands cover over 180,000 km2. The traditional Secwepemc were a semi -nomadic people, living during the winter in warm semi - underground \"pit -houses\" and during the summer in mat lodges made of reeds. The traditional Secwepemc economy was based on fishing, hunting and trading. Secwepemc diet consisted of fish, meat, berries and roots. Many Secwepemc people st ill depend on these subsistence food gathering activities to meet their basic needs while also participating in the broader economy. The Secwepemc Health Caucus has identified the following priorities: 1.

The six Northern St' \u00e1t'imc communities are: Tsal'alh (Seton Lake), which is considered remote, and the rural communities of Xwisten (Bridge River), Ts'kw'aylaxw (Pavilion), Xaxli'p (Fountain), T'it'q'et (Lillooet), and Sekw'el'was (Cayoose C reek). Approximately half of our community members live on reserve and half live off reserve, either in Lillooet or in surrounding neighbourhoods and communities, towns, cities, and other First Nations communities. The St'\u00e1t'imc are the original inhabita nts of the territory which extends north to Churn Creek and to South French Bar; northwest to the headwaters of Bridge River; north and east toward Hat Creek Valley; east to the Big Slide; south to the island on Harrison Lake and west of the Fraser River t o the headwaters of Lillooet River, Ryan Ri ver and Black Tusk. The St'\u00e1t'imc way of life is inseparably connected to the land. Our people use different locations throughout our territory of rivers, mountains and lakes, planning our trips with the best time s to hunt and fish, harvest food and gather medicines. The lessons of living on the land are a large part of the inheritance passed on from St'\u00e1t'imc Elders to our children. As holders of one of the richest fisheries along the Fraser River, the St'\u00e1t'imc defend and control a rich resource that feeds our people throughout the winter and serves as a valued staple for trade with our neighboring nations. The St'\u00e1t'imc can think of no other better place to live. The current health priorities of the Northern St '\u00e1t'imc are: 1. Complete Community Health Plans in all six Northern St' \u00e1t'imc communities . 2. Carry out an Urban Health Strategy in the Northern St' \u00e1t'imc Territory. 3. Develop a Northern St' \u00e1t'imc Health Plan which will contribute towards the Interior Regional Health and Wellness Plan . 4. Strategize on improvements to the First Nations Health Benefits Program . 32 Syilx 1. Lower Similkameen Indian Band 2. Okanagan Indian Band 3. Osoyoos Indian Band 4. Penticton Indian Band 5. Upper Nicola Band 6. Upper Similkameen Indian Band 7. Westbank First Nation The Okanagan Nation Alliance (ONA) is a tribal coun cil and was formed in 1981. It is representative of the seven member Bands (noted above) including the Colville Confederated Tribe s of Northern Washington State. The ONA's mandate is to advance, assert, support and preserve Syilx title and rights. The ONA is charged with providing members with a forum to discuss and develop positi ons on areas of common concern. ONA's responsibilities include serving the Syilx peop le as a collective, by addressing common issues and opportunities of the Nation and supporting a shared vision that promotes asset and capacity building for long term sustainable self -sufficiency. The Syilx Nation represent their citizenry regardless of residency and supports the pursuit of its rights to retain responsibility for the health, safety, survival, dignity and well -being of Syilx children and families, consistent with the UN Convention on the rights of the child and the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Tl'esqox 3. Tl'etinqox Government 4. Tsi Del Del 5. Yunesit'in Government 6. Xeni Gwet'in First Nation Government Chilco tin, meaning \"people of the river,\" also refers to the Chilcotin Plateau region in British Columbia. The Chilcotin (Tsilhqot'in) First Nation are a DENE -(Athapaskan) speaking peopl e numbering nearly 3200 who live between the Fraser River and the Coas t Mountains in west -central BC. The Chilcotin traditional culture was similar to that of other Northern Athapaskan. Through much of the year, families moved about independently hunting, fishing an d gathering roots and berries. In late summer most families gathered along the rivers to fish the salmon runs. In midwinter they moved to sheltered locations, usually near lakes suitable for ice fishing, where they lived in shed -roofed houses or pit houses. The current health priorities of the Tsilhqot'in are: 1. Mental health and addictions 2. Elder care 3. Patient travel 4. Youth s ervices 5. Promote traditional diet, medicines and H ealers 6. Implementation of the Tsilhqot'in Wellness Plan: 6.1. Unify the Tsilhqot'in people by gathering and sharing ideas and resources 6.2. Balance and strengthen the spiritual, language and cultural traditions of the Tsilhqot'in people. Deni gatin gwayajelh tg 6.3. Integrate traditional and contemporary health services i n the community wellness centres 6.4. Promote holistic wellness practices 7. Letter of Understanding implementation 35 Next Steps The next steps for the iRHWP will be the develop ment of a detailed implementation work plan and framework for reporting and evaluation . Implementation of the iRHWP will be a collaborative process by the First Nations Health Authority, Nation health technicians and Leads , and Interior Health Authority . To support implementation, t he iRHWP will be linked with human and financial resources from the First Nations Health Authority and Interior Health Authority . Reporting and evaluation are essential components for accountability and establishing a clear, transparent framework will enable tracking of progress in achieving the goals that have been set, identification of lessons learned and celebration of successes. Conclusion This first interim Regional Health and Wellness Plan lays a strong foundation consisting of the principles, values, structures and processes that will support the 7 Nations, the First Nations Health Authority and Interior Health Authority in the work moving forward in their new partnership . Recognizing that additional planning will be conducted at the Nation level to develop Nation Health and W ellness Plans, the iRHWP is a living document that will be revisited and revised to reflect new information and priorities identified by the Nations. The 7 Nations, the First Nations Health Authority and Interior Health Authority have a vision to create improvements in the health and well -being of First Nations in the Interior Region by transforming healthcare for the better. The 7 Nations are driven by the common values of their cultures and their holistic perspectives of health and wellness. They look t o their traditions to enhance health practices and they look to their current and future health leaders for guidance. This is an historic opportunity to achieve transformative change in First Nations health and wellness, and all of the partners involved are committed to make the most of thi s opportunity. Through the ir combined strengths and assets, the 7 Nations, the First Nations Health Authority and Interior Health Authority will strive to make this vision a reality. 36 References In preparing this iRHWP, the following documents were reviewed and relevant content was incorporated: 1.

Demographics Population Data Sources Census: The mandatory long -form Census (2006) contained a field in which Aboriginal peoples could choose to self- identify as First Nations (status or non-status), Metis or Inuit1. However, some First Nations reserve communities did not participate in enumeration. The mandatory long -form Census was cancelled and replaced in the 2011 Census with the non -mandatory National Household Survey (NHS)2. Since pa rticipation in NHS is voluntary, Aboriginal data from the NHS are less representative than those from the long -form Census. Note that only on -reserve population data are available from the 2011 Census. AANDC Indian Registry: The AANDC's Indian Registry i s the definitive registry for all individuals registered under the Indian Act (Status First Nations) . The AANDC population for BC captures all First Nations registered to BC bands and is not a BC Resident population. It excludes BC residents who are members of non -BC Bands. Two major limitations of the Indian Registry as a population data source are late reporting of life events (e.g. births and deaths) and the fact that residency code (e.g. on- and off-reserve) is not consistently updated after in itial registration. 1.1 Geography The territorial land base of the Interior Region, as defined by BC Regional Health Authority boundaries is 237,692 km squared, 25.7% of the total provincial land base. For the purposes of this profile, the administrative geographic boundaries of the Interior Health Authority (IHA) are used but there are First Nations communities within these geographic boundaries that are included in other health regions for First Nations health planning purposes (see section 1.3). 1.2 Population Table 1 provides estimates of the First Nations population living in Interior Region using different data sources, including the 2011 Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC)'s Indian Registry, the 2006 Census and the 2011 Census (see Sidebar for more information on these data sources). According to AANDC 2011 data, the First Nations population in Interior Region is close to 30,000, representing 22.3% of the First Nations population in BC.

Health Status Information The graphs included in this section pull in data from a number of sources outlined in the \"Health Status Data Sources\" panel below. Statistics reported in this section are based on currently available data. These statistics are largely \"illness -based\" and do not reflect the envisioned Wellness approach to health reporting. Health Status Data Sources First Nations Client File (FNCF)9: The First Nations Client File is the product of a record linkage between an extract of the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada Indian Registry and the BC Ministry of Health Client Registry and subsequent probabilistic matching. The Personal Health Number contained in the FNCF enables linking to other administrative databases. The First Nations Client file is a cohort of BC Resident First Nations people registered under the Indian Act, and their unregistered descendants for whom entitlement -to-register can be determined, linkable on their BC Ministry of Health PHN number. In the 2012 FNCF, approximately 5% of the total FNCF cohort has had their Status inferred. The First Nations Client File is u pdated on an annual basis using a fresh extract from the BC Client Registry and the AANDC Indian Registry. The data presented in this section are derived from databases held by the British Columbia Vita l Statistics Agency linked to the First Nations Client File. Vital Statistics Agency Database : The Vital Statistics Agency Database registers all births, marriages, deaths, and changes of name that occur in British Columbia. Medical Services Plan Group 21: The MSP Registration & Premium Billing Group 21 includes individuals who have registered to have their MSP premium funded by the federal government. Eligible recipients are Status First Nations, Inuit recognized by Inuit Land Claim organizations and infants less than one year of age whose parent is an e ligible recipient. MSP Group 21 does not include Status First Nations who have not requested their premiums to be paid by the federal government (eg. those who are working and have their MSP premiums covered by their employers). Blue Matrix: The Blue Ma trix is a collection of chronic disease and health service utilization registries held by the BC Ministry of Health. This data source includes physician services, hospital inpatient and day surgeries, PharmaCare, Residential Care, Home and Community Care S ervices. Non -insured Health Benefits (NIHB): Data are presented for NIHB pharmacy utilization for status First Nations using pharmacies in British Columbia. The NIHB Program covers claims for pharmacy benefits not covered by private, public or provincial health care plans. The NIHB Program covers prescription drugs listed on the NIHB Drug Benefit List and approved over -the-counter medications. Provincial Health Officer (PHO) Annual Report 200710: BC Resident Status Indian population in the 2007 PHO report was estimated using Health Canada's Status Verification File (SVF) with the Ministry of Health's Client Roster to count persons living in BC. The SVF is an extract of data from the AANDC Indian Registry. 9 BC Ministry of Health. Presentation to the Tripartite Data and Information Planning Committee.

A 95 per cent confidence interval means that 19 times out of 20, the true values lies between the horizontal bars shown as (I) on the charts. Because of the fluctuations in the small numbers of events, the use of confidence intervals helps to determine whether changes from year to year are more likely to be due to chance alone or are reflecting a real change. 0.005.0010.0015.0020.0025.00PYLL per 1000 population Male Female 050100150200250 Interior Fraser Vancouver Coastal Vancouver Island NorthernRate per 100,000 Status First Nations Other BC ResidentsP a g e | 16 Infant mortality rates for Status First Nations living in Interior Region have improved between the years 1993-1997 to 2006-2010, however it still higher than the rate for all other residents.

An eligible recipient must be identified as a resident of Canada and one of the following: A registered Indian according to the Indian Act; An Inuk recognized by one of the Inuit Land Claim organizations; or An infant less than one year of age, whose parent is an eligible recipient.15 Table 6 Remoteness and percentage of clients who filled out prescriptions in BC First Nations Communities (2011) The above table illustrates that proximity to a service centre had no effect on the % of eligible clients who filled out prescriptions using NIHB. All clients were approximately equally likely to fill out a prescription regardless of their proximity to a service centre. 15 As defined by Health Canada on: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/nihb-ssna/index-eng.php accessed on June 27, 2013 Remoteness and % of clients who filled out prescriptions in BC First Nations Communities (2011) Proximity to Service Center 7 # Communities % of eligible clients who filled out prescriptions using NIHB 95% Confidence Interval < 50 km to service center 75 63.1% 63.5 - 69.6 Between 50 and 350 km to service center 73 63.5% 60.2 - 69.1 > 350 km from nearest service center 11 64.7% 61.9 - 65.2 No year round access to service center 28 66.6% 61.1 - 65.1 P a g e | 27 Table 7 NIHB Pharmacy Utilization by Region, 2011 Source: Non-insured Health Benefits Pharmacy Data Cube Table 7 illustrates that for that for Interior Region, there was in increase in the average cost per claimant between the years 2000 and 2011 from $330 to $660.

Budget Information First Nations Inuit Health- BC Region Program Funding data This report includes regional summaries on the status of First Nations and Inuit Health's (FNIH) Health Transfer Program, which began in 1989. In 2005, FNIH introduced new Health Funding Arrangements entitled the Contribution Funding Framework (CFF) to the Health Transfer Program. According to FNIH, the new CFF is designed to be more responsive to communities and have increased flexibilities across sectors, as well as allowing the possibility of greater community-control.16 Under the new CFF, a recipient can enter into a longer term contribution agreement (up to ten years in the flexible transfer funding model) compared to the old maximum of five years associated with previous model Transfer agreements. Significantly, a recipient does not need to go through each of the four models in the new CFF to apply for the highest level of self-control. Rather, following a capacity assessment done collaboratively between the recipient and FNIH, a recipient can apply for the most appropriate model based on their capacity and abilities. The previous funding arrangements consisted of three defined funding agreement models ( General, Integrated, and Transfer). Associated with these funding models were additional elements, such as community size that determined whether a community may reach the final phase. In 2007, updated funding models were introduced ( Set, Transitional, Flexible, and Flexible Transfer ). One or more of these funding models could be accommodated in a single funding agreement, with flexible transfer allowing for the most community-control. In 2011, new funding models were introduced ( Set, Flexible and Block) in an effort to harmonize federal government funding mechanisms. These funding models are similar to the funding models introduced in 2007, with the exception of the Block funding model, which combines the characteristics of the previous Flexible and Flexible Transfer funding models17. The funding models vary in the amount of participation of FNIHB in program management and administration; flexibility in reallocating funds within and between programs; the ability to carry forward unspent funds from fiscal year to fiscal year and to use a surplus; as well as reporting and evaluation requirements. At the time of publication, updated funding arrangement and program funding data from FNIH BC Region were not available so the 2008/2009 funding amounts and funding arrangement details published in the previous version of this Profile report are repeated. 16 First Nations and Inuit Health, BC Region (2007).

Appendix 5.1 Definition of Potential Years of Life Lost20: Potential years of life lost (PYLL) is the number of years of life \"lost\" when a person dies \"prematurely\" from any cause - before age 75. A person dying at age 25, for example, has lost 50 years of life. Potential years of life lost are calculated by taking the median age in each age group, subtracting from 75, and multiplying by the number of deaths in that age group disaggregated by sex and cause of death. These data are presented as a standardized rate per 100,000 population. (However, in this report, the data are presented as a rate per 1,000 population.) Causes of death are classified according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD -9) from 1979 to 1999. The year 2000 and subsequent years available are classified according to the Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10). 20 Statistics Canada website: http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82- 221-x/2011002/def/def1-eng.htm#de1pyo retrieved November 23, 2012 P a g e | 33 5.2 First Nations Health Authority Health Services Health Promotion & Prevention Health Protection Dental Health Surveillance Children and Youth Maternal Child Health Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Aboriginal Head Start Communicable Disease Control Unit TB Control Pandemic/Emergency Planning HIV/AIDS STI/BBI Immunization Consultation for Environmental Public Health Children's Oral Health Initiative Therapy and Treatment Prevention and Promotion Epidemiology Health Reporting e-Health Solutions Regional Pharmacist Consultation for Nursing, Non -Insured Health Benefits an d Tripartite First Nations Health Plan Mental Health and Addictions Indian Residential Schools National Native Alcohol & Drug Abuse Program National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy Chronic Disease and Injury Prevention Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative Nutrition Injury Prevention Environmental Public Health Services Non -Insured Health Benefits Health Transfer & Benefits Drinking Water Waste Water Waste Management Food Safety Facilities Health Inspection Emergency Response Housing Zoonotic Diseases Communicable Disease Control Environmental Contaminant Pharmacy Dental Care Vision Care Medical Supplies & Equipment Short -term Crisis Intervention Medical Transportation Administration of Provincial Care Card Manage Post Transfer Manage Transfer Development Community Development and Capacity Building Quality Improvement and Accreditation Contracts & Contributions Nursing Services Policy and Strategic Planning Capital Transfer Nursing Recruitment and Retention Nursing Education Nursing Practice and Research Northern Operations Home and Community Care Planning with FNHA in year of transition Health Services Integration Fund Supporting Transition Engagement and change management Health Facility Development Health Facility Replacement Health Facility operations and maintenance Best Practices for construction/tender process Residences - use and management 1 Appendix B: First Nations Health Transfer History and Context The Transformative Change Accord (2005) was the starting point of a shared journey of BC First Nations and the federal and provincial governments to improve the quality of life of First Nations people. In health, incremental progress has been made since then through a series of health plans and agreements, including the Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan (2006) ; the First Nations Health Plan Memorandum of Understanding (2006) ; the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan (2007) ; the BC Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nations Health Governance (2011) ; and the Health Partnership Accord (2012). These are illustrated in figure 1, and key agreements are summarized below. Figure 1. Health Plans and Agreements The Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan (TCA: FNHP; 2006) was signed by the First Nations Leadership Council1 and the Province of BC. The 10-year plan includes 29 action items in four areas: Governance, Relationships and Accountability; Health Promotion/Disease and Injury Prevention; Health Services and Performance Tracking. Subsequently, a tripartite process was established to develop a Tripartite First Nations Health Plan (TFNHP, 2007) to build on the commitments in the TCA: FNHP. The BC Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance (the \"Framework Agreement\") provided for the creation of a new health governance structure and the transfer the federal programs and operations to First Nations control. This new health governance structure includes the First Nations Health Council (FNHC), First Nations Health Authority (FNHA), First Nations Health Directors Association (FNHDA) and the Tripartite 1 First Nations Leadership Council - Collective body of First Nations organizations in BC (BC Assembly of First Nations, First Nations Summit, and Union of BC Indian Chiefs) who came together to push for improvements to policies and programs and a new relationship with BC, and later with Canada. 2 Committee on First Nations Health (TCFNH) (see figure 2). It holds responsibility for health planning and administration as well as health design, delivery and accountability to better support the health care and service delivery needs of BC First Nations. Figure 2. Overview of the First Nations Health Governance Structure The Health Partnership Accord describes the parties' common vision for the tripartite partnership, including the scope of possibilities for health innovation enabled by a committed, resourced and supportive relationship. It sets context for the tripartite efforts in implementing the Framework Agreement and the other tripartite commitments regarding First Nations health. As part of this new health governance structure, BC First Nations have, through engagement and consensus-building processes, collectively established a new First Nations health governance structure and standards. The structure and standards build from the ground-up and include a strong regional emphasis, recognizing the value of making decisions at the appropriate levels (e.g., community decisions made in communities, regional decisions made in the region). A key part of this new structure are regional caucuses in each of the health regions. The Interior Region Caucus is represented by 54 communities and seven Interior Region Nation Executive2 and the Interior Health Authority signed the Interior Partnership Accord on November 14, 2012 with the overall goal to improve the health and wellness outcomes for First Nations people in the Interior by establishing a coordinated and integrated First Nations health and wellness system. A Partnership Accord Leadership Table has been developed to oversee the implementation of the Partnership Accord. At Gathering Wisdom for a Shared Journey V (2012), BC First Nations Chiefs and leaders provided direction to establish Regional Offices (now referred to as regional teams and supports) in order to support the implementation of these agreements and improve health programs and service delivery and health outcomes for First Nations in the regions. To date, the FNHA has supported the development and implementation of extensive community engagement in each region to facilitate dialogue and participation through the regional structures and Community Engagement Hubs. Activities have taken place to build regional teams and supports, including the hiring of Regional Directors in each Region in 2013. The iRHWP will further support the planning, collaboration and implementation of the evolving regional work, including regional health and wellness priorities and regional envelopes 2 Acts as an executive body to the Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus and carries out the directions of the Caucus. Appendix C: Interior Nations Declaration of Unity FIRST NATIONS HEALTH COUNCIL Interior Region PARTNERSHIP ACCORD FIRST NATIONS HEALTH COUNCIL: INTERIOR REGION NATION EXECUTIVE (INTERIOR NATIONS) and INTERIOR HEALTH AUTHORITY (INTERIOR HEALTH) FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 ~l Interior Health 1 Whereas, the First Nations of the Interior of British Columbia, as Indigenous People, (Interior Nations) endorse the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People which affirms, amongst other things, that ... Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development; and ... in exercising their right to self-determination, have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs; and Whereas, the title and rights of First Nations of British Columbia have been intact since time immemorial and remain intact, despite numerous attempts by other governments to disregard or otherwise extinguish these rights; and Whereas, the Nations of the Interior continue to recognize the sovereignty of each Nation and their right to assert their authority to govern over both their lands (territorial jurisdiction) and their peoples (personal jurisdiction) and to relate Nation-to-Nation with the Government of Canada and Government-to-Government with the Government of British Columbia; and Whereas, the First Nations of British Columbia, the Province of British Columbia and the Canadian Government, ratified the Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance, which empowers B.C. First Nations to take-over the administration of Health Canada programs and services and identifies additional provincial resources, to be administered by a First Nations Health Authority; and Whereas, the Nations have stated their desire to establish and maintain a desired level of capacity in the areas of health research, health career development, health service delivery (including traditional practices), information management and governance (health planning, administration, policy /program design and implementation ... ), in order to achieve their individual and collective Nation visions; and Whereas, the province is organized into five geographic regions for purposes of health-care service delivery, and Interior Health is the provincial Authority whose operating region includes the territories of seven Indigenous Whereas, Interior Health, is the party with whom the Interior First Nations primarily relate with respect to delivery of health services to their citizens; and Whereas, the Interior First Nations have and will remain committed to working together as unified Nations in establishing Nation-based Health and Wellness plans, with a number of the Interior Nations' territories extending across more than one Provincial Health Authority boundary; and Whereas, First Nations, on a regional/tribal basis, are now forming structures and processes through which to carry out the engagement, research, planning and development work required to shape the final form the First Nations Health Authority will take; and Whereas, the Government of British Columbia created the Interior Health Authority through the Health Authorities Act, for the purpose of delivering health services and planning. FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 2 Whereas, Interior Health is governed by a Board of Directors, and each Director is appointed by the Minister of Health. The Board strives to have a diverse and balanced set of skills and geographic representation, bringing differing perspectives of community, culture and geography to the Board. The governing principle for the Board of Directors is that each Director's duty of care is to the organization as a whole. Interior Health delivers its health services through a President and Chief Executive Officer and the staff of Interior Health, according to the Vision, Mission and Values for Interior Health, and within the broad directions of the Ministry of Health. (See Appendix eleven for Interior Health Strategy Map.) Whereas, Interior Health, pursuant to its Vision, Mission and Values has established a Strategic Plan which enunciates four Goals. Goal #1 is to Improve Health and Wellness. Under this goal, item 1.2 is, \"Meet the needs of First Nations and Aboriginal communities by collaboration with them to plan and deliver culturally sensitive health care services.\" Whereas, Interior Health, pursuant to the Goal Statement 1.2 noted above, has developed an Aboriginal Health and Wellness Strategy 2010-2014 which is based on 5 key strategies: 1. Develop a Sustainable Aboriginal Health Program; 2. Ensure Aboriginal Peoples' Access to Integrated Services; 3. Deliver Culturally Safe Services across the Care & Service Continuum; 4. Develop an Information, Monitoring and Evaluation Approach for Aboriginal Health; 5. Ensure ongoing Meaningful Aboriginal Participation in Healthcare Planning. Whereas, Interior Health supports the concept that the First Nations that are party to this Accord may represent other organized groups of Aboriginal people, provided there are written formal agreements to that effect. Whereas, the Indigenous Nations of the Interior and Interior Health (herein after referred to as the Parties) have stated their commitment to work together to avoid the creation of separate and parallel First Nation and non-First Nation health systems, and to develop a more integrated health and wellness system with stronger linkages to the provincial health-care system, including the creation of new approaches to achieving the desired health and wellness outcomes of each Nation; and Whereas, the Interior Nations have declared their desire to be fully involved in decision-making regarding the health of their people, and in defining how health services and programs are planned, designed, managed and delivered and have entered into, or will enter into relationships directly with Interior Health; and Whereas, the Framework Agreement on First Nations Health Governance and a resolution at the Gathering Wisdom IV directed First Nations leaders to enter into partnerships with provincial health regions in order to establish collaborative working relationships to carry out planning and to implement health actions aligned with the Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan and the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan, as well as providing guidance to the development of reporting systems and measures of performance; and FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 3 Whereas, the Parties agree that a coordinated approach to governance undertakings, in relation to diverse topics, can best be addressed in the context of an Accord that establishes an Action Plan for the purpose of achieving substantial progress on matters of shared priority. ***************************************** Therefore, the Parties do hereby agree as follows: Definitions, titles of organizations and agreements which appear in this Accord are listed in Appendix One, and form part of this Accord. Purpose: The Parties are committed to improving the health and wellness outcomes for First Nations people of the Interior Region. The purpose of this Partnership Accord is to clarify the roles and relationships of each of the Parties, jointly and severally, as they work together to fulfill this commitment. Further, it is intended to be a general statement of purpose but does not create a legally binding obligation on the Parties nor is it enforceable against either of the Parties in any court of law or otherwise. This Accord builds on the following documents: Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan (TCA: FNHP) (November 2006); Identifies priorities and actions to improve the health and well-being of First Nations in BC. First Nations and the Province identified actions required in four key areas: Governance, relationships and accountability; Health promotion and disease and injury prevention; Health services; and, Performance tracking. Signed by the Province of BC and the BC First Nations Leadership Council. Tripartite First Nations Health Plan (TFNHP) (June 2007); The Federal Government joined with the Province and First Nations Leadership Council to build on the TCA: FNHP by releasing the TFNHP. Central is a commitment to create a new governance structure that will enhance BC First Nations' control of health services, and will promote better integration and coordination of services to ensure improved access to quality health care by all BC First Nations. British Columbia First Nations Perspectives on a New Health Governance Arrangement: Consensus Paper (May 2011); Clearly articulates the collective direction and feedback given by First Nations to the First Nations Health Council in their work to establish a new health governance arrangement that is Community-Driven and Nation-Based. FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 4 British Columbia Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance (October 2011); Establishes commitments to transfer the operations of First Nations and Inuit Health Branch-BC Region to a First Nations Health Authority, and to provide a greater role for First Nations in the broader health system in Canada and BC with respect to First Nations health needs. Navigating the Currents of Change: Transitioning to a New First Nations Health Governance Structure\u00ad Consensus Paper (May 2012) Captures First Nations feedback and broadly reflects how change will be managed through the transition process of taking control over First Nations Inuit Health Branch-Pacific Region into First Nations Health Authority control. Parties: Interior Region Nation Executive Due to the large size of the Interior Region and the high number of First Nation Communities who reside within the Interior Region, the First Nations Community Health Caucus (54 First Nation Communities) have agreed to work under a model that is 'Community-Driven and Nation-Based'. This principle means that services will be developed and delivered as close to home as possible and that the Nations each have responsibility for developing and implementing health and wellness strategies and relating directly to Interior Health in implementing these strategies. Each of the 7 Nations will negotiate a Letter of Understanding, or other agreement, independently with Interior Health. Issues or interests that are common to the Nations will be addressed in a collaborative manner. Nations who are accessing health services from other Health Authorities may develop additional agreements. As per the First Nations Health Council Interior Region Governance Entities Terms of Reference, the leadership of the respective Nation will ensure that their Nation has a comprehensive health and wellness plan in place, building on Community Health Plans and where possible, proposing areas where aggregation of services into a Regional Health Plan, might occur. The Nations' member communities will approve their Nation Health Plan. The Interior Nations will jointly establish a Regional Health and Wellness Plan, at the Interior Region Nation Executive Table, for adoption by the Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus. This Interior Region Nation Executive Table acts as an executive body to the Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus and carries out directions in between Caucus sessions. They also ensure that the First Nations Health Council is being accountable (implementing the work plan as approved), and responsive to regional issues. They interface with the region's First Nations Health Directors and with the Interior Health Board and Senior Executive, leading the negotiation and implementation of Regional Agreements with Interior Health. FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 5 The Executive functions as the 'Regional Table' for purposes of First Nations Health Council activities. Executive Membership consists of 1 member from each of the with Nation-approved processes and appointed through resolution, signed by authorized Nation representatives {Tribal Council Motion or Resolution). (See appendix eight for detailed Terms of Reference to describe these relationships) The 7 Nation Representatives, coordinated as the Regional Table, are signatories to this Accord and are jointly, a Party to this Accord. Interior Health Interior Health is one of 5 regional health authorities, established under provincial legislation. Interior Health is led by a government-appointed Board of Directors and is accountable to the Ministry of Health through the Interior Health Board. The Interior Health Board sets the mission, vision, values and strategic plan for Interior Health within the broad directions set for the health care system by the Government of British Columbia through the Ministry of Health. The President and CEO is responsible for leading Interior Health's operations in accordance with the direction set by the Interior Health Board and ensuring the implementation of directives issued, from time to time, by the BC Ministry of Health. (See appendix three for a map of Interior Health, showing the First Nations of the Interior) The Interior Health Board Chair and the President and CEO are the signatories to this accord, representing Interior Health as a Party. Principles: The Nations of the Interior have signed a Unity Declaration which states they will be guided by a set of principles. Interior Health recognizes and respects these principles as stated by the First Nations, guiding the Nations involvement in the Partnership Accord. Interior Health also notes that pursuit of some of these Principles are beyond the scope of Interior Health as a health service organization, such as funding First Nation corporate structures or strengthening federal fiduciary responsibility, and that these are the subject of agreements between the First Nations, the federal government and the Government of British Columbia. The principles of the Unity Declaration are: Health and Wellness Outcomes, and Indicators will be defined by each Nation Partnerships will be defined by each Nation Agreements will be negotiated and ratified by the Nations No Nation will be left behind; needs are addressed collectively The federal fiduciary obligation must be strengthened, not eroded FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 6 Services will be provided to all of our people regardless of residency I status Adequate funding will be provided for our corporate structure(s) Socio-economic indices will be incorporated into planning and projections-plan for 7 Generations Negotiations will be interest based -not position based (Nations define) Community engagement will be linked to the health governance process Documents will be kept simple and understandable The Interior Region Community Health Caucus and Interior Nation Executive will meet regularly Liability will be minimized; the Nations will inherit no liability from other entities Celebration will be included in all activities The speed at which development occurs will be determined by the Nations The authority to govern rests with each Nation, as does the responsibility for decision\u00ad making The Interior Region will work together in ways which promote our values of Collaboration, Trust, Inclusion, Celebration and Innovation. Objectives: To establish a coordinated and integrated First Nations health and wellness system in the Interior that: 1) will contribute to the achievement of Interior Nations' wellness goals, by continually improving quality, accessibility, delivery, effectiveness, efficiency, and cultural appropriateness of health care programs and services for First Nations in the Interior; 2) reflects the cultures and perspectives of Interior First Nations, incorporates First Nations' models of wellness, builds First Nations health human resource capacity, and respects that the Nations have and will continue to work together; 3) affords equitable recognition in strategies to address First Nations who have limited capacity, including small and isolated communities; 4) embraces knowledge sharing and facilitates discussions in respect of addressing broader determinants of health; and 5) is based on respecting and addressing the lands, history, health, safety, food security, dignity and well-being of all Interior First Nations people. Action Plan: With a goal of improving the health outcomes for First Nations People, the Parties will form a Health and Wellness Committee, comprised of Senior Management from Interior Health (appointed by the Vice President responsible for Aboriginal health) and First Nations of the Interior Region FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 7 (appointed by the Interior Region Nation Executive). The Committee will be co-chaired by the senior representatives of Interior Health and the Interior Region Nation Executive. The Board Chair and President and CEO of Interior Health and the 7 Nation Executive members will monitor the work of the Committee and receive reports from them annually. Terms of Reference for the Committee will be established by the Parties. The work of the committee will also be reported to the Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus. The Committee will carry out specific actions including, but not limited to, the following: 1) develop a consistent and harmonized Planning and Evaluation Framework; 2) develop a Regional Health and Wellness Plan that builds upon Community /Nation Health Plans and Interior Health Plans including setting standards, targets, outcomes and measurements; 3) review of the existing standards and processes; 4) continually improve on processes; 5) localize cultural competency training throughout the Interior Health Region; 6) develop service delivery systems to better reflect the needs of First Nation people in the Interior Region; 7) develop a comprehensive health human resources strategy; 8) establish common indicators, targets, milestones, benchmarks; 9) engage in dialogue, identify linkages and establish networks with other Aboriginal and non\u00ad Aboriginal stakeholders; 10) discuss program and service delivery changes and manage impact; 11) identify those matters including policy issues that will address gaps and eliminate overlaps; and 12) establish, at the program level, communications with the First Nations Health Authority and at the governance level, with the First Nations Health Council. The Parties will: a) support each other in a positive and constructive manner intended to facilitate improved health and wellness outcomes for First Nations people residing in the Interior Region; b) collaborate to identify health needs of First Nations people residing in the Interior; c) establish mechanisms to address issues of those Nations whose territories encompass more than one Regional Health Authority; d) respectfully educate one another about each other's governance structures, service delivery processes, fiscal restraints, opportunities, budgetary process and other matters; e) develop partnerships with other Ministries, municipal governments and non-profit organizations to work together in order to address the social determinants of health; f) hold each other accountable in the spirit of reciprocal accountability for the commitments in this Accord; FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 8 g) maintain clear roles and responsibilities and performance expectations balanced by capacity of each party; h) provide timely reporting; i) meet annually to receive reports and review this Accord; j) participate in scheduled meetings to conduct the work of this Accord; k) communicate in a timely and effective way, potential risks or impediments to achieving the objectives of this Accord, or those outlined in the Interior First Nations Health and Wellness Plan.

The Consensus Paper sets out a historic level of agreement amongst First Nations in BC about their health and well-being and a series of next steps for the First Nations Health Council to undertake. First Nations \"First Nations peoples\" refers to the Indian peoples in Canada, both Status and non-Status. The term is rarely used as a synonym for \"Aboriginal peoples\" because it usually doesn't include Inuit or Metis people. First Nations Health Authority (FNHA): A non-profit Society, representative of and accountable to BC First Nations, with a mandate to promote and advance health and health service issues on behalf of First Nations in BC, including by: assuming administrative responsibility for the functions, programs, and services transferred from First Nations & Inuit Health Branch-BC Region and delivering other health services to First Nations; supporting the implementation of the Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan (2006), the First Nations Health Plan MOU (2006) the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan (2007), and the British Columbia Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance (2011); collaborating with governments and other health authorities and service agencies to coordinate and support the provision of health services to First Nations in BC; and, carrying out research, policy, planning and other activities related to health and the FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 11 determinants of health.

Each of the five regions of the province has a First Nations Health Council Caucus that engages communities locally and offers a direct avenue to bring regional issues to the provincial First Nations Health Council table. Interior Region Nation Executive Table: The Interior Region Nation Executive Table is comprised of one representative from each of the 7 Nations of the Interior Region, and acts as an Executive body to the Interior Region Caucus, carrying out directions in between Caucus sessions and functioning as the Interior Regional Table for purposes of networking with Interior Health. The Executive Table offers a more equitable decision-making capacity for Interior First Nations and gives regional direction to the First Nations Health Council Caucus. First Nations Health Directors Managers working in First Nation communities, Health Directors have for many years managed and overseen a range of services and programs for their communities -based in diverse health facilities, with programs largely funded by Health Canada-First Nations and Inuit Health (FNIH). Health Directors are responsible for delivering front-line health services for First Nations community members, planning, coordinating and managing services (as well as other services of other health providers). First Nations Health Directors design and implement a comprehensive capacity development for the management and delivery of community\u00ad based services and support BC First Nations and their mandated health organizations in training, program development and knowledge transfer. Gathering Wisdom The Gathering Wisdom for a Shared Journey forums are the largest assembly of BC First Nations leadership in the province. The event brings together Chiefs, Elders, front-line health workers, community members, and provincial and federal partners to move forward on health systems transformation for BC First Nations. It's a FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 12 celebration of culture, tradition and the vision of healthy, self-determining and vibrant BC First Nations children, families and communities.

Amendments and Review of Terms of Reference: 29 FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 21 1. Preamble: A. The First Nations of British Columbia, the Province of British Columbia and the Canadian Government, ratified the Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance, which will empower B.C. First Nations to take-over the administration of Health Canada programs and services and identifies additional provincial resources, to be administered by a First Nations Health Authority. B. Under this yet to be defined First Nations Health Authority, BC First Nations Governments will be fully involved in decision-making regarding the health of their people, and in defining how health services and programs are planned, designed, managed and delivered. They have agreed that First Nations should avoid the creation of separate and paraliel First Nation and non-First Nation health systems, and develop a more integrated health and wellness system with stronger linkages to the provincial health-care system and the creation of new approaches to achieving the desired health and wellness outcomes of each Nation. C. The Framework Agreement briefly describes the roles of the entities formed as a result of the Agreement, including a Tripartite Committee on First Nations Health, a First Nations Health Authority, a First Nations Health Council and the First Nations Health Directors Association (FNHDA). D. The Tripartite Committee on Health is made up of federal, provincial and Health Council representatives, and their role is to engage in discussion on the progress and implementation of the Agreement and other health arrangements including the Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan (2006), the First Nations Health Plan MOU (2006), the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan (2007) and the Health Partnership Accord. E. The First Nations Health Authority and Health Council roles are described in more detail later in this document. F. The First Nation Health Directors Association represents health directors and managers working in First Nation Communities to: i. support education, knowledge transfer, professional development and best practices for health directors and managers of First Nation Health Providers; and ii. act as an advisory body to the provincial First Nation Health Council and the First Nations Health Authority, on research, policy, program planning and design related to administration and operation of health services in First Nation communities. G. The First Nations Health Directors Association, as a provincial body, relates to the First Nation Health Council and Society at that level. Individual Health Directors work with their respective First Nations through the Hub and Caucus tables, at the Regional level, to provide expert advice in program and policy review and redesign. H. The First Nations of B.C. are now modeling a provincial First Nations Health Authority to implement the Tripartite Framework Agreement; defining its structure and functions, in relation to the structures and functions of their own local health governance authorities. They envision a province-wide, coordinated First Nations wellness system that: i. is based on respecting and meeting the rights of First Nations people; ii. will result in improved quality, accessibility, delivery, effectiveness, efficiency, and cultural appropriateness of health care programs, and services for First Nations; iii. reflects the cultures and perspectives of BC First Nations, incorporates First Nations' models of wellness, and respects that the Nations have and will continue to work together iv. embraces knowledge and facilitates discussions in respect of determinants of health in order to contribute to the design of First Nation health programs and services; v. Provides First Nations in all regions of British Columbia with access to quality health services that are at a minimum, comparable to those available to other Canadians living in similar geographic locations. vi. First Nations, on a regional/tribal basis, are now forming structures and processes through which to carry out the engagement, research, planning and development work required, to define the authority of the Authority, and to shape the final form it will take. This Terms of Reference is the instrument that describes the roles of the parties that are working together to advance the formation of the First Nations Health Authority, specifically the Interior First Nations government officials and their technical support. DRAFT 8-FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 22 2. Interior Region Values: The Interior Region will work together in ways which promote our values of Collaboration, Trust, Inclusion, Celebration and Innovation. 3. Purpose: A. The purpose of these Terms of Reference is to describe the roles and responsibilities of the governance entities and advisory/planning bodies involved in the First Nations Health Council Governance processes of the Interior Region. These entities include: i. Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus (54 Communities-Caucus) ii. Interior Nation Health Assemblies (7 Nations -Assemblies) 111. Interior Region Nation Executive Table (Executive-Regional Table) B. The document will also describe the relationship of these governance entities to the First Nations Health Council Society Members and Directors and the Community Engagement Hubs and Health Directors of the Interior Region. C. A list of the First Nation Communities belonging to each Nation of the Interior Region is attached as an Appendix \"A\" to this document. D. Engagement and Approvals Pathways will be clearly defined, to ensure that the pathway model will enable the FNHC to gather First Nations input and guidance for key decisions of the First Nations health governance structure. This engagement and approvals pathway could be included in the governing documents of the First Nations Health Council, First Nations Health Directors Association, and a future First Nations Health Authority, so that First Nations have clarity and certainty about the process for decision-making, and know that their voice and direction will be heard on key decisions such as program redesign. E. Reciprocal Accountability: The members of the Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus, the Interior Nation Health Assemblies, and Interior Region Nation Executive Table are to report to their First Nations and Nations on the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) and regional progress, share information, and develop common positions and perspectives. DRAFT 8-FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 23 4. Parties, Roles and Relationships of FIRST NATIONS HEALTH GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE: A. First Nations Health Society The First Nations Health Society has two divisions carrying out different functions within it; the Society Members (who sit as the Health Council) carrying out the Governance function on behalf of B.C. First Nations and the Society Directors (Health Society acting as the Interim First Nations Health Authority), carrying out the Management function without political interference. i. First Nations Health Council (First Nation Health Society) Members (Council/Society Members): The First Nations Health Council is comprised of 15 members, with 3 members appointed by the First Nations resident in each of the 5 geographic Health Authority regions of the province; the Interior Region is one of these 5 Regions and the 54 First Nation Communities of the Interior Region, through the Caucus, appoint their 3 representatives to the Health Council from amongst the 7 Nation representatives who form the Interior Region Nation Executive (Community-driven-Nation-based). For purposes of these Terms of Reference, the First Nations Health Society Members will be called the Health Council as the collective or Health Council Members in reference to individuals. The First Nations Health Councils' primary role is to implement the Gathering Wisdom IV Resolution and Consensus Paper; to finalize the sub-agreements in preparation for the transfer of Health Canada Resources (human, facilities ... ) to the new First Nations Health Authority and, as guided by the First Nations of the province, to establish the final structures through which to administer First Nation-designed programs and services as the new First Nations Health Authority. In carrying out this work, the Health Council representatives, as Society Members, also have a responsibility to ensure that the Society (which operates as the Interim FN Health Authority) is responsive, transparent and accountable to First Nations of the province. As Health Council Members, the individuals represent the collective of all BC First Nations, not the individual Nations appointing them. As per the Constitution and By-laws of the Society, the Health Council Members appoint the Directors to the Society Board, and provide high level governance oversight of the FN Health Society operations; as Members, they don't get involved in the day-to-day operations of the Society. These roles are described in the Terms of Reference for the FNHC. The Health Council Members cannot serve on the Board of Directors for the Society. The Constitution and By-laws provide the basic terms of reference for the Society Members and Directors. The Health Council Provincial and Regional Staff will ensure that all First Nation Communities receive frequent, accessible reports on the progress of the Council and Society; transparency and accountability are key governance principles. ii. First Nations Health Society (Interim First Nation Health Authority) Directors (Society Directors): The Society acts as the health management and administration body ensuring that there is no 'political' interference in carrying out the directions given collectively to the Health Council by the First Nations of the province, at Gathering Wisdom Forums. The Board provides direction to the Society CEO in leading the business arm of the Society, managing resources and working with the technicians from First Nations communities in delivery of Health Actions. All First Nations Communities receive Annual Reports and newsletters from the Society Directors and First Nations Health Society Staff, reporting on their work. DRAFT 8-FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 24 The First Nations Health Society Board of Directors are selected for their expertise in health related fields as required for the Incorporated Society, as a legal entity, to carry out the day-to-day business related to administration of health programs. As the operational arm, the Society (The Interim First Nations Health Authority) is the body responsible for entering into contracts and other arrangements on behalf of the First Nations Health Council. Background on the Society Directors, strategic plans and financial statements of the Society can be found on the Health Society Page of the Health Council Website at: www.fnhc.ca/index.php/about/councilmembers/health society/ B. Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus (54 Communities Caucus): The province is broken down into 5 geographic regions for purposes of health-care service delivery. The Health Council Regions coincide with these Provincial Health Authority Regions. The Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus table provides a forum for the 54 First Nations of the Interior Region to engage with each other for purposes of networking and planning, as related to the implementation of the Gathering Wisdom IV Resolution and Consensus Paper and the Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance. i. Caucus Mission We will assure the development of a comprehensive and inclusive Health Governance Framework that leads to the establishment of a people first, community driven and nation based BC First Nation Health Authority(s). ii. Caucus Membership The 54 First Nation Communities of the Interior Region as listed in Appendix \"A\" each have a voting seat as members of the Interior Region Community Health Caucus table. iii.

This principle means that services will be developed and delivered as close to home as possible and that the Nations will have responsibility for governance. The Nations of the Interior have signed a Unity Declaration that includes the following principles: Health and Well ness Outcomes and Indicators will be defined by each Nation Partnerships will be defined by each Nation Agreements will be negotiated and ratified by the Nations No Nation will be left behind; needs are addressed collectively The federal fiduciary obligation must be strengthened, not eroded Services will be provided to all of our people regardless of residency/status Adequate funding will be provided for our corporate structure(s) Socio-economic indices will be incorporated into planning and projections-plan for 7 Generations Negotiations will be interest based-not position based (Nations define) Community hubs will be linked to the health governance process Documents will be kept simple and understandable The Interior Leadership caucus will meet regularly Liability will be minimized; the Nations will inherit no liability from other entities Celebration will be included in all activities The speed at which development occurs will be determined by the Nations The authority to govern rests with each Nation, as does the responsibility for decision-making DRAFT 8-FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 26 The 7 Interior Region Nations will each host a Nation Health Assembly to ensure that their member Communities, (as per Appendix \"A\"), are engaged in the Health Council planning processes (making sure that no\u00ad one is left behind). The leadership of the respective Nation will ensure that their Nation has a Comprehensive Health and Well ness Plan in place, building on community health plans and where possible, proposing areas where aggregation of services into a Regional Health Plan, might occur. The Nations' member Communities in Assembly will approve their Nation Health Plan The Nation's communities in Assembly will choose their representative to the Interior Region Executive Table, in accordance with their own processes. The Health Council will be provided with a Nation resolution signed by their member Communities, indicating who their representative is, as soon as possible, after the appointment is made. i. Meetings and Voting: a. Nation Health Assemblies are the forums through which each of the 7 Interior Nations' member Communities (see Appendix \"A\") meet to share information and formulate health-related strategies. The Nations in Assembly are also responsible for making decisions regarding the assertion of their rights, the establishment of Nation health standards and outcomes and for the approval of the Nation health plan. b. Nation Assemblies will be held a minimum of 2 times per year. c. Each of the First Nations Communities belonging to the Nation will have 1 vote at Assemblies. d.

To identify any health-related issues or concerns that their member Communities may have and to, when unable to address issues within the Nation, bring the issue forward through their representative to the Nation Executive Table, for resolution, or advancement to the Health Council. D. Interior Region Nation Executive Table (Executive): Due to the large size of the Interior Region and the high number of First Nation Communities resident within the Region, a Nation Executive Table has been established by the 7 Nations of the Interior Region; this table will function as the 'Regional Table' for purposes of Health Council activities. This table acts as an Executive body to the Interior Region First Nation Community Health Caucus and carries out directions in between Caucus sessions. They also ensure that the Health Council is being accountable (implementing the work plan as approved), and responsive to Regional issues. They interface with the Region's DRAFT 8-FNHC: Interior Region Nation Executive & Interior Health Authority: Partnership Accord 2012 27 Health Directors and with the Interior Health Authority (IHA) Board and Senior Executive, leading the negotiation and implementation of Regional Agreements with the IHA. Executive Membership consists of 1 member from each of the following Nations, selected in accordance with Nation-approved processes and appointed through resolution, signed by authorized Nation representatives (Tribal Council Motion or Resolution). Dikelh Dene, Ktunaxa, Secwepemc, Syilx, St'at'imc, Tsilhqot'in, Nlaka'pamux Members are responsible for bringing forward issues of concern to their Nation and for reporting back to their Nations on the activities of the Executive and Health Council within a timeframe agreed upon by their Nation. In order to ensure that full participation is maintained at the Executive Table, Nations may choose an Alternate representative to the Executive Table to attend meetings when the designated representative is unable to attend, provided the alternate is an official that has been designated with the authority to make decisions at this table, on behalf of the Nation. When an Alternate is chosen, a resolution or motio'n will be provided to the Executive Table informing them of the expanded representation and the Alternate will from that point forward, receive all communications that Executive members receive, related to this role. Members and Alternates are responsible for bringing forward issues of concern to their Nation and for reporting back to their Nations on the activities of the Executive and Health Council. It is acknowledged that governance and government are different functions, both equally important in the implementation of the Health Agreements. The First Nations Health Council and by extension the Community Caucus table and Executive table, are governance (authority/control) tables; the Health Directors and Hubs are part of the First Nations government (administration/management). i.

The northern area of this territory is close to the area of Mica Creek, just north of modern-day Revelstoke, B.C., the eastern boundary lies between Kaslo and Kootenay Lakes. The southern boundary extends to the vicinity of Wilbur, Washington, and the western border extends into the Nicola Valley. The map below is the IHA region, showing our communities. Page 9 of 13 Appendix 3 Syilx Health Plan 2010 Extract: The Four Food Chiefs C hi ef S iy a (S ask ato on B e r ry ) - Vi si on & In no va ti on Pe r sp e c ti v e For Syilx people, health is multifaceted, holistic and interconnected. The health of the Syilx people is reflected in the health of the individual, family, community and land. These elements are inseparable and cannot be looked at in isolation. The survival of the Nation as a whole is dependent on the well-being of the individuals, the families, and the community. The reverse is also true. We know that cultural pride, cultural identity and traditional knowledge are important to our individual health and to the health of our families, the community and the land. The long history of colonization has therefore played a major role in the current health of individuals, families and the Nation. This was very evident in the environmental scan. We have therefore applied our Indigenous \"way of knowing\" as the framework for this Health Plan. S y i l x C u l t u r a l F r a m e w o r k The Syilx people have passed down their cultural way of knowing from one generation to the next, orally through storytelling. When we tell Chaptikwl, \"our stories\", we breathe life into the ember that is waiting to come alive again. When we talk about how we are going to reclaim and restore the well-being of our communities, we are breathing life into our words and into our actions and into the people. This is a regenerating experience that creates fluid dynamic movement and begins to address the years of oppression when the colonial governments attempted to silence our stories, literally to strip us of the knowledge of our ancestors. \"COMMUNITY \" in Nsyilxcn (Okanagan) is a word that has the meaning that we are 'OF ONE SKIN'. The one skin is not referring so much to the idea that we're biologically related as to the idea that we share something which gives us a covering, a security, a protection - in the same way that our skin, stretched over our blood and bones protects us f rom dissipating back into our larger selves which is the external world. Your skin holds you together.\" (Sharing One Skin, by Dr. Jeannette Armstrong, 1998 ) Page 10 of 13 The Syilx (Okanagan) cultural framework is built on the foundation of Syilx cultural ways of knowing and of being and is drawn from a Chaptikwl called \"How Food was Given.\" In this story, Kul'nchut'n (creator) visited the Tmixw (including but not limited to the people, animal plants, air and water). Kul'nchut'n (creator) sent Senklip (coyote) to prepare for the future of the Stelsqilxw (people-to-be). Kul'nchut'n told the Tmixw that people were coming. The four (4) Chiefs : Skemxist (Black Bear) Siya (Saskatoon Berry), Spitlem (Bitter Root), Ntyxtix (King Salmon) then came together and made a plan for how to feed Stelsqilxw (people to be). The story then tells how the differing perspectives of the four chiefs were brought together to inform the discussion, the problem solving, the decision making and the action plan. The Chaptikwl illustrates the Enowkinwixw process, the cultural practice or discipline that describes how to plan, solve problems, make decisions, resolve conflicts and/or develop an action plan. It brings people together to dialogue on specific issues. The practice welcomes, encourages and supports the expression of differing perspectives that, at times, may be in opposition to each other. The practice of Enowkinwixw embraces the dynamic tension that emerges and uses it to develop a collective understanding or to shape a shared approach to an issue or concern. This process has been described as a \"mind meld\" (Okanagan Nation Response Team 2007 Booster Training Session). Enowkinwixw is a consensus based practice developed on the principles of respect, trust and inclusion. The following principles/actions are embedded within the process. Consensus Establishment of Common Ground Protocols for discussion Full participation Commitment to see the process to its end, regardless of the time involved Differing perspectives ( Siya, Spitlem, Skemxist, Ntyxtix ) that have a defined place: Innovators, Traditional, Action, and Relationships The process is complete when an action and implementation plan incorporating all views is in place. Page 11 of 13 Differing Perspectives \"How Food was Given\" is a teaching that illustrates how the Okanagan/Syilx community can come together and make decisions about how to take care of future generations, especially in relation to their well being. It lends itself very well to providing a framework for, and an understanding of, the four main components of our health plan. The Four Food Chiefs are described as having the following attributes (please note this list is not meant to be exhaustive.) Siya (Saskatoon Berry) Chief of all things growing above Land Youth Innovation/Creative We CAN do it No Barriers Think BIG Creative Spitlem (Bitterroot) Chief of all Roots Female Relationships Interconnectedness Nurturing Skemxist (Black Bear) Chief of all 4 legged Animals Elder Tradition Protocols Culture Contemplation/Thinking Ntyxtix (King Salmon) Chief of all that is in the Water Male Action Get it done Timely Efficient Planning issue Skem xist Spitlem Siya Ntyxtix Page 12 of 13 1 Chief Siya (Saskatoon Berry) embodies the spirit of creative energy, vision and innovation that can be associated with Youth. In this section of our health plan we provide those components that relate to the Nation's vision and the innovation associated with the use of the Syilx Cultural Framework to assist in the understanding of the health plan. 2 Chief Spitlem (Bitter Root) describes relationships, and the interconnectedness among Tmixw including but not limited to the people, the animals, the plants, the land, the air and the water. This provides the \"context\" in which individuals, families and communities endeavor to live in harmony with each other, and with their relatives - the animals, the plants and the land. This section of our plan provides a description of the Okanagan Nation Alliance (ONA) including its structure , capacity and existing programs , and profiles of the seven Okanagan member Bands and the Wellness Committee. The need for the health plan and the phases of the health plan are also described. 3 Chief Skemxist (Black Bear) represents the traditions and cultural practices, the concept of reflection and contemplation on \"what is\" informed by an understanding of the past and how that is connected to the future. It is this understanding that then shapes development of protocols. In this section of the health plan, the environmental context , the analysis of data, research, key findings and the establishment of priorities are the focus. 4 Chief Ntyxtix (King Salmon) exemplifies the process of preparing (readiness), determining the objective (aim), and then taking action (act). In this section, the Findings, Action Plan and the Conclusions are presented. The concepts of individual, family, community, land (Armstrong, J. 2000-Let us begin with courage) are defined thus: \"Each individual person is singularly gifted, each person actualizes full human potential only as a result of physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual well-being - those four aspects of existence are always contingent on external things. Each individual is a single facet of a trans- generational organism known as family.\" \"Through this organism flows the powerful lifeblood of cultural transference designed to secure the best probability of well-being for each of the generations. Family systems are the foundation of a long-term living network called community .\" \"In its various configurations this network spreads its life force over centuries and across physical space; it uses its collective knowledge to secure the well-being of all by the short- and long-term choices made via its collective process. A community is the living process that interacts with the vast and ancient body of intricately connected patterns in perfect unison called the land. \" \"Land sustains all life and must be protected from depletion in order to insure its continued good health and ability to provide sustenance over generations. \" Page 13 of 13 All of these Syilx concepts and framework are integrated in the Wellbeing of the Syilx. Appendix 4 Glossary of Terms Aboriginal People Aboriginal People include all Indigenous people of Canada. The Constitution recognizes three groups of Aboriginal people: Status and Non -Status First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit. ONA Member Bands Okanagan Indian Band, Westbank First Nation, Penticton Indi an Band, Lower Similkameen Indian Band, Upper Similkameen Indian Band, Upper Nicola Indian Band, Osoyoos Indian Band. Cooperate To act or work together with another or others for a common purpose. Collaborate To work with another party towards a share d goal. Consultation A process by which the interested party's input on matters affecting them is sought. Note: IH will consult (confer) with the ONA on issues that pertain to the Nation as a whole. Specific band issues will be the responsibility of IH and the band. Recognizing that there are some changes that IHA has no control over (e.g. at Ministry level), IH determined service changes that impact bands will be required to include consultation process with the band. Cultural Safety Cultural safety is the effective care of a person/family from another culture by a health -care provider who has undertaken a process of reflection on their own cultural identity and recognizes the impact of the health -care provider's culture on their pract ice. Unsafe cultural practice is any action which diminishes, demeans or dis -empowers the cultural identity and well -being of an individual. Client focused, holistic or \"wrap -around\" These terms are used within the respective Parties to reflect similar principles. Terms that are also used include \"recipient of service\" (not client) thus the appropriate terminology will be used in each context. Mediation Mediation is a voluntary settlement negotiation facilitated by a neutral third party who has no decis ion-making power (as defined by the BC Dispute Resolution Office).

It is one of the major factors influencing the way we look at, interpret and interact with the world around us and thus an integral part of our I iving culture. The process of conducting research can itself perpetuate the colonization of Secwepemc knowledges and ways of knowing by privileging Western research techniques and knowledge over Secwepemc research techniques and knowledge keepers. Researchers must understand the historical relationship Indigenous peoples have had with research and be committed to, and held accountable through, relationships with the people and community they partner with. This research policy is meant to be a vehicle to ensure research is conducted in partnership with Secwepemc communities and individual s with the aim to strengthen the Secwepemc Nation on Secwepemc terms. The Secwepemc Health Caucus (SHC) recognizes its duty to develop protocols to address the need for an organized, transparent and accountable approach for individual s and/or groups conducting research in Secwepemc Territory related to Health. These protocols have been developed to aid researchers in ensuring they abide by the protocols of the Secwepemc communities when conducting research in their territory. Where there is any discrepancy between the protocols of an individual Secwepemc community and those in this policy, the community protocols will take precedence. Application This Secwepemc Health Caucus Research Policy applies to all individual s and I or groups conducting research within the Secwepemc Nation, who request to consult with members of the Secwepemc Nation and whose research will or could potentially impact Secwepemc Nation members, ancestors, descendants or territories (including but not limited to land, air and water). Health Information Health information includes any information relating to the health and wellbeing of individual s and communities (as defined by the individual s and communities) including physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, and intergenera tional wellbeing. Point of Contact and FN Community Participation Each Secwepemc First Nation will be contacted via the Health Director/Health lead and the Chief and Council. Each FN will follow their internal process to determine if and how their community will participate. 16 17 Informed Consent and Voluntary Participation Researchers will clearly and concisely offer information on the research (including aims and anticipated outcomes) and obtain consent of individuals prior to commencement of the research. Researchers will recognize and respect the historical relationship Indigenous people have had with research(ers) and ensure a relationship of reciprocity is fostered. The participation must be free, voluntary and where possible, compensa ted. Consent must be provided based on being \"informed\" about the research and research activities. Conditions of the informed consent will be jointly decided by the Health Director/lead and researcher and where appropriate, provisions for oral consent will be made. All researchers must apply the following when seeking and obtaining \"consent\": 1. Obtain written and/or oral consent from individuals I community prior to the commencement of research, and on an ongoing basis. 2. The \"consent agreemen t\" must be easily understood and thoroughly explained to the participant in a respectful and non-intimidating manner 3. If the participant is an Elder, the Researcher must ensure that the Elder has a member of the community, whom the Elder is familiar, present to ensure that the Elder understands the details and implications of consent 4. The signed consent forms and/or oral consent recording or witness account must be available to the Health Director for review 5. A provision will be made where the participant may withdraw from the research program without penalty 6. A provision will be made where the participant may revoke any and all information provided to the research program including beyond the program' s completion Privacy and Confidentiality All data must be kept secure at all times following accepted standards for health research. The identity of responden ts must be protected at all times and researchers must ensure that all data released ensures the anonymity of the participants. Ownership, Control, Access and Possession of Data A written research agreemen t will be created collaboratively between the community, group and/or Health lead and researcher addressing the following (but not limited to): 1. How the principles of Ownership, Control, Access and Possession will be applied and upheld 2. How the commun ity will benefit from the research program itself with the training of research assistants and other capacity building 18 19 Appendix Ownership, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP) Principles The Secwepemc Health Caucus adheres to the principles of Ownersh ip, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP) as a tool for the assertion of First Nations rights to self-determination and Nation building within the area of Health. Ownership: Ownersh ip refers to the relationship of First Nations to their cultural knowledge, data, and information. This principle states that a commun ity or group owns information collectively in the same way that an individual owns his or her personal information. Control: The principle of control affirms that First Nations, their communities and representative bodies are within their rights in seeking to control over all aspects of research and information management processes that impact them. First Nations control of research can include all stages of a particular research project-from start to finish. The pri nci pie extends to the control of resources and review processes, the planning process, management of the information and so on. Control from conception to completion. Access: First Nations must have access to information and data about themselves and their commun ities, regardless of where it is currently held. The principle also refers to the right of First Nations communities and organizations to manage and make decisions regarding access to their collective information. This may be achieved, in practice, through standardized, formal protocols. Possession: While ownership identifies the relationship between a people and their information in pri nci pie, possession or stewardsh ip is more concrete. It refers to the physical control of data. Possession is a mechanism by which ownership can be asserted and protected.; And further declared within our collective position to honour the political relationship proposed in the Memorial Sir Wilfred Laurier, Premier of the Dominion of Canada. The Secwepemc Health Caucus supports the research protocols and principles as outlined by the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) Ownersh ip, Control, Access and Possession (OCAP) standards;;, as follows: ; 2009 <http://www .fnigca.ca/node/2 >First Governance Center Assembly of First Nations-Environmental Stewardship Unit. (March 2009}. \"Ownership, Control, Access and Possession\" (p.21} in Ethics http://www .afn. ca/u ploads/fi les/rp-resea rch ethics fi na I. pdf 20 These Principles, Apply to all research, data, and information initiatives that involve First Nations Health Issues. Helps ensure self-determination over all research concerning First Nations is respecte d and adhered to; Provides a means to decide-what research will be approved; how collected informa tion and data will be used; where information will be stored; and who will be able to access the information. In agreeing to these principles, the Secwepemc Health Caucus recognises and affirms: Secwepemc Title, jurisdiction, and self-determination on Secwepemc territory and guardiansh ip over the preservation, dissemination, and use of traditional knowledge and cultural heritage; The crucial importance of the active participation and leadership of Indigenous research partners in all phases of research, including its application and management of all project phases and funds. Thus, all research partners are entitled to be fully informed of and discuss the nature, scope and ultimate integration of their participation, knowledge and narratives in all stages of the thesis work, as well as its potential publication, dissemination, and use; That materia l relating to the Secwepemc people that are collected by the researcher or any of his/her project team is owned by the Secwepemc People and ultimately housed in the Secwepemc Health Caucus archives. This includes oral testimony (transcr ipts) historical, genealogical, anthropological, traditional use study, resource based data and studies and other relevant materia l; The research will be conducted in an ethical, open and respectfu l manner; That the raw data obtained from interviewees must be reviewed and approved by the interviewees prior to finalizing and/or inclusion in a research document/thes is; That the copyright of the final written report will remain with the Secwepemc Health Caucus as the author and the project funder (if outlined accordingly) but it is understood that the Secwepemc retain their respective inherent rights, including all intellectual property rights associated now and in the future, and have ownership of all cultural information obtained from them; 21 22 23 Appendix D Secwepemc Health Caucus - Interior Health Authority Workplan 2013 - 2014 Letter of Understanding Between the Parties: Northern St' \u00e1t'imc And Interior Health (each a 'Party', collectively 't he Parties ') Northern St'at'imc - Interior Health Authority LOU Page 2 of 16 Table of Contents Definitions ..................................................................................................................................................... 3 1.0 Purpose ............................................................................................................................................. 4 2.0 Preamble ........................................................................................................................................... 4 3.0 Principles ........................................................................................................................................... 7 4.0 Geographic Area ............................................................................................................................... 8 5.0 Service Provisions, Activities and Outcomes .................................................................................... 8 6.0 Implementation ................................................................................................................................ 9 7.0 Resource Requirements .................................................................................................................. 10 8.0 Evaluation of Letter of Understanding ............................................................................................ 11 9.0 Other Agreements .......................................................................................................................... 11 10.0 Process ............................................................................................................................................ 11 11.0 Term ................................................................................................................................................

The St'\u00e1t'imc way of life is inseparably connected to the land. Our people use different locations throughout our territory of rivers, mountains and lakes, planning our trips with the best times to hunt and fish, harvest food and gather medicines. The lessons of living on the land are a large part of the inheritance passed on from St'\u00e1t'imc elders to our children. As holders of one of the richest fisheries along the Fraser River, the St'\u00e1t'imc defend and control a rich resource that feeds our people throughout the winter, and serves as a valued staple for trade with our neighboring nations. Northern St'at'imc : the six communities are Tsal'alh (Seton Lake Indian Band) which is considered remote, and the rural communities of Xwisten (Bridge River), Ts'kw'aylaxw (Pavilion), Xaxli'p (Fountain), (Cayoose Creek) are Lil'wat, N'Quatqua, Samahquam, Skatin, and Xa'xtsa. British Columbia Health Authorities: The province of BC is organized into 5 geographic regions for purposes of health-care service delivery. Interior Health and Vancouver Coastal are the provincial Authorities whose operating regions align within the territory of the St'\u00e1t'imc. The Government of British Columbia created the Health Authorities through the Health Authorities Act, for the purpose of delivering health services and planning. Interior Health Authority - The Interior Health Authority (IHA), is the party with whom the Northern St'at'imc primarily relate with respect to delivery of health services to their citizens. Interior Health is governed by a Board of Directors, and delivers its health services through the President and Chief Executive Officer and the staff of Interior Health, according to the Vision, Mission and Values for Interior Health, and within the broad directions of the Ministry of Health. Interior Health, pursuant to its Vision, Mission and Values has established a Strategic Plan which enunciates four Goals. Goal #1 is to Improve Health and Wellness. Under this goal, item 1.2 is, \"Meet the needs of First Nations and Aboriginal communities by collaboration with them to plan and deliver culturally sensitive health care services.\" Interior Health, pursuant to the Goal Statement 1.2 noted above, has developed an Aboriginal Health and Wellness Strategy 2010-2014 which is based on 5 key strategies: 1. Develop a Sustainable Aboriginal Health Program; 2. Ensure Aboriginal Peoples' Access to Integrated Services; 3. Deliver Culturally Safe Serv ices across the Care & Service Continuum; 4. Develop an Information, Monitoring and Evaluation Approach for Northern St'at'imc - Interior Health Authority LOU Page 4 of 16 Aboriginal Health; 5. Ensure ongoing Meaningful Aboriginal Participation in Healthcare Planning. Interior Health supports the concept that the First Nations that are party to this Accord may represent other organized groups of Aboriginal people, provided there are written formal agreements to that effect. Vancouver Coastal Health Authority - Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCHA) is the party with whom the Lower Stl'atl'imx primarily relate with respect to delivery of health services to their citizens. The Lower Stl'atl'imx communities have not created a Letter of Understanding with VCHA to date. 1.0 Purpose 1.1. The Parties wish to define a collaboratively developed engagment process for the planning of Aboriginal services, programs and operations across St'at'imc Territory for delivery of health services and improvement of health outcomes for St'at'imc people. 1.2. The Parties seek to improve the health outcomes for St'at'imc people by achieving effective shared decision making that will reduce the barriers for St'at'imc people to access better health services. 1.3. The Parties commit to working together through meaningful participation and collaboration, to increase the influenc e of the Northern St'at'imc in decisions related to health services that impact their members and other Aboriginal peoples residing within the St'at'imc Territory. 1.4. The Parties agree that health outcomes held in common with all residents of British Columbia should be equal or exceeding for St'at'imc citizens and health outcomes beyond these, as defined by St'at'imc citizens, pursued with equal vigor and diligence. 2. 0 Preamble 2.1 The First Nations of British Columbia, the Province of British Columbia and the Canadian Government, ratified the Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance, which will empower B.C. First Nations to take-over the administration of Health Canada programs and services and identifies additional provincial resources, to be administered by a First Nations Health Authority. 2.2 Under the First Nations Health Authority, BC First Nations Governments will be fully involved in decision-making regarding the health of their people, and in defining how health services and programs are planned, designed, managed and delivered. They have agreed that First Nations should avoid the creation of separate and parallel First Nation and non-First Nation health systems, and develop a more integrated health and wellness system with stronger linkages to the provincial health-care system and the creation of new approaches to achieving the desired health and wellness outcomes of each Nation. Northern St'at'imc - Interior Health Authority LOU Page 5 of 16 2.3 The First Nations of B.C. are now modeling a provincial First Nations Health Authority to implement the Tripartite Framework; defining its structure and functions, in relation to the structures and functions of their own local health governance authorities. They envision a provincially coordinated wellness system that: 2.3.1 will result in improved quality, accessibility, delivery, effectiveness, efficiency, and cultural appropriateness of health care programs and services for First Nations; 2.3.2 reflects the cultures and perspectives of BC First Nations and incorporates First Nations' models of wellness; 2.3.3 embraces knowledge and facilitates discussions in respect of determinants of health in order to contribute to the design of First Nation health programs and services; 2.3.4 provides First Nations in all regions of British Columbia with access to quality health services that are at a minimum, comparable to those available to other Canadians living in similar geographic locations. 2.4 First Nations on a Regional/Nation basis, are now forming structures and processes through which to carry out engagement, research, planning and development work required, to define the authority of the First Nations Health Authority, and to shape the final form it will take: The First Nations Health Council Interior Governance Entities Terms of Reference describe the roles and responsibilities of the parties that are working together to advance the formation of the First Nations Health Authority. The Interior Region Nation Executive Table acts as an executive body to the Interior Region First Nations Community Health Caucus and carries out directions in between Caucus sessions. They also ensure that the First Nations Health Council is being accountable (implementing the work plan as approved), and responsive to regional issues. Executive Membership consists of 1 member from each of the following accordance with Nation -approved processes and appointed through resolution. The Parties of the Interior Partnership Accord; the Interior Health Authority and the 7 Nations in the Interior are committed to improving the health and wellness outcomes for First Nations people of the Interior Region. The purpose of the Interior Partnership Accord is to clarify the roles and relationships of each of the Parties as they work together to fulfill this commitment. The overall objectives are to establish a coordinated and integrated First Nations health and wellness system in the Interior that: a) will contribute to the achievement of Interior Nations' wellness goals, by continually improving quality, accessibility, delivery, effectiveness, efficiency, and cultural appropriateness of health care programs and services for First Nations in the Interior; b) reflects the cultures and perspectives of Interior First Nations, incorporates First Nations' models of wellness, builds First Northern St'at'imc - Interior Health Authority LOU Page 6 of 16 Nations health human resource capacity, and respects that the Nations have and will continue to work together; c) affords equitable recognition in strategies to address First Nations who have limited capacity, including small and isolated communities; d) embraces knowledge sharing and facilitates discussions in respect of addressing broader determinants of health; and e) is based on respecting and addressing the lands, history, health, safety, food security, dignity and well-being of all Interior First Nations people (p.7) . One of the success indicators of the Interior Partnership Agreement is Letters of Understanding [will be] developed and implemented between Interior Health and each of the Seven (7 ) Interior Nations (p.8); 2.5 The Parties agree to enter into a mutually beneficial relationship that will work towards, in a quantifiable and qualitative manner, shared responsibility and shared decision making as it impacts the provisions of Health Services to Aboriginal people within the St'at'imc Territory . 2.6 The Parties agree to use a cooperative, collaborative approach to improving the health status of St'at'imc individuals, families and communities through the design, delivery and evaluation of culturally safe health programs and services. 2.7 Interior Health Authority acknowledges the inherent and Aboriginal rights (including but not limited to self-determination and freedom from discrimination) of the St'at'imc People. Further, Interior Health Authority recognizes the St'at'imc regardless of residency and supports the St'at'imc pursuit of its rights to retain responsibility for the health, safety, survival, dignity and well-being of St'at'imc children and families, consistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous people. 2.8 This letter of understanding does not abro gate nor derogate from St'at'imc Aboriginal Rights as per Section 35(1) Constitution Act. 1982 . 2.9 The Parties agree and understand that this Letter of Understanding pertains to the Interior Health Authority's roles and responsibilities accordi ng to the purpose and description under the Health Authorities Act which states that: \"5 (1) The purposes of a board are as follows: (a) To develop and implement a regional health plan that includes (i) The health services provided in the region, or in a part of the region, (ii) The type, size and location of facilities in the region, (iii) The programs for the delivery of health services provided in the region.

Interior Health's Vision, Mission, Values, and Guiding Principles inform how it delivers on its legislated mandate. Interior Health provides health services to over 744,000 people across a large geographic area covering almost 215-thousand square kilometres and serves larger, urban centres alongside a large number of small, rural and remote communities. Only 11 of the 59 incorporated communities in the health authority have a population of 10,000 or more.1 Within IH there are 55 First Nations Bands, the majority of which are rurally located. In 2006, there were 44,900 people who identified with an Aboriginal group living in the Interior Health region, constituting 6.7 per cent of the overall IH population (British Columbia's overall rate is 4.8 per cent).2 While improvements in overall mortality and increasing life expectancy in the Aboriginal population have been made, significant gaps in health status between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations still exist. For instance, the Aboriginal population in B.C. experiences a disproportionate rate of chronic diseases and injuries compared to other British Columbia residents.3 Interior Health has 19,428 staff, 1563 physicians (which includes 954 general practitioners) physicians and 5,312 nurses.4 There are 2 tertiary level hospitals, 4 service area hospitals, and a network of community hospitals and health centres offering services to the population of the region. Interior Health Structure Structurally, Interior Health has both service delivery and support portfolios. Service delivery portfolios include: Community Integrated Health Services, Residential Care, and Acute Services. The Aboriginal Health Program is one program area within the Community Integrated Health Services Portfolio and includes specific programs and services such as the Aboriginal Patient Navigator Program, Aboriginal Tobacco Reduction Coordinator and Aboriginal Addictions Knowledge Exchange Lead. Service delivery is coordinated through a regional \"network of care\" that includes hospitals, community health centres, residential and assisted living facilities, supports for housing for people with mental health and substance use problems, primary health clinics, homes, schools, and other community settings. Aboriginal Communities The IH region includes a large number of First Nations reserve communities. Figure 1 identifies the 55 First Nations Bands within the Interior Health service region. This includes five Bands that are located 1 BC Stats. Demographic Analysis Section. Ministry of Citizens' Services and Open Government. Municipal Estimates, 2006 - 2012. 2 BC Stats.

Many of these 55 Bands are rurally or remotely located . Figure 1: First Nations Communities in IH Region Interior Health Aboriginal Specific Programs and Services Our vision is to improve the health status of Aboriginal people within Interior Health by improving access and creating a culturally safe environment and culturally appropriate care for Aboriginal people and acting as a resource for health care service providers. Our mission is to improve access and ensure Aboriginal people receive culturally safe and appropriate service Aboriginal Patient Navigator Program Aboriginal Patient Navigators are located in community or acute sites across Interior Health. Aboriginal Patient Navigators support families by providing resources to help connect them to appropriate health care services and provide cultural support. Aboriginal Patient Navigators also work with health care workers to provide resources to assist in providing culturally appropriate care and to connect them with external Aboriginal services. There is no financial cost to clients that access the services. 3 The Aboriginal Patient Navigator works as part of the Interdisciplinary Care Team, and as required, act s as a resource for both Aboriginal patients and health care providers to ensure care is culturally specific, ethno sensitive and patient centered. 1. For every Aboriginal person who presents and requests APN service at identified referral sites to have timely access to Aboriginal Patient Navigator Services. 2. For Aboriginal Patient Navigators to support culturally safe and appropriate care in health care and community settings through education, advocacy, identification of service gaps and barriers 3. The APN provides referrals, services, and/or resources for patients to meet the unique health needs as identified by the patient, family, and/or interdisciplinary care team. 4. The APN functions as an active member of interdisciplinary healthcare teams. The target Populations are: 1. Individuals who identify as Aboriginal (Metis, First Nations Status and Non-Status, Inuit). 2. Healthcare Providers Aboriginal Health and Wellness Strategy The Aboriginal Health and Wellness Strategy is a primary guiding document for the Aboriginal Health team and Interior Health. Interior Health's Aboriginal Health and Wellness Strategy, 2010 -2014, presents a strategic framework that consists of 5 specific strategies, with the goal to improve the health of the Aboriginal peoples we serve. The strategy relies on a good understanding of the health issues faced by the Aboriginal population and the opportunities for improvement. Reflecting our renewed direction i n Aboriginal Health, this strategy is consistent with the aims of the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan, and affirms the ongoing need to nurture locally based relationships with Aboriginal peoples. The 5 strategies are: 1. Develop a Sustainable Aboriginal Health Program 2. Ensure Aboriginal Peoples' Access to Integrated Services 3. Deliver Culturally Safe Services across the Care and Service Continuum 4. Develop an Information, Monitoring and Evaluation Approach for Aboriginal Health 5. Ensure ongoing Meaningful Aboriginal Participation in Healthcare Planning Aboriginal Governance Structures Aboriginal Health and Wellness Advisory Committee ( AHWAC) is a committee of the Interior Health's Board of Directors that is composed of representatives from First Nation's communities, Friendship Centers, and the M\u00e9tis Nation BC, plus members of IH's Board of Directors and Aboriginal Health Program to provide advice to Interior Health on matters pertaining to the improvement of health and health services for Aboriginal people. The Partnership Accord signed in November, 2012, in Kamloops, details the foundations of working relationships with the 7 Nations in the IH region. This agreement ensures that the Nations are partners in health care decisions that impact their communities and peoples. The agreement aligns with IHA Goal #1 \"improve health and wellbeing\". The Partnership Accord Leadership Table is comprised of Interior Health and First Nations Representatives for the implementation of the Partnership Accord. 4 Letters of Understanding (LoU) have been signed with several Aboriginal Nations within Interior Health. The purpose of the LoU is to enhance direct relationships between decision makers to improve health outcomes of the respective Aboriginal group. Decision makers may include Aboriginal leadership (such as Health Directors, HUB coordinators, etc.), IHA Aboriginal Health (Practice Lead and/or Director) and IHA representatives (Program and Operations representation). Other Aboriginal Health Funding Opportunities, Initiatives, and Partnerships Aboriginal Health Contracts Aboriginal Health contracts are awarded to qualified not-for-profit Aboriginal organizations. The contracts support grassroots programs that will improve health of Aboriginal people in the ir communities and within IH. Funds are distributed by a population based funding formula, with the statistics derived from the 2009 Stats Canada data. The proposals are received and evaluated by an internal team that cleared conflict of interest guidelines. Interior Health awards three different types of contracts to allow for flexibility and innovation of programs that will work with each community's specific needs. 1. AHIP I funding is designated for projects that fall into the Community Health Education and Community Health Collaboration categories. 2. AHIP II is directed towards health promotion and disease prevention programs that run for over 2 years. These programs support community development and health education, health promotion, and or disease prevention activities. 3. Lastly, Direct Service contracts are contracts are currently focused on Mental Health & Substance Use. Aboriginal Self Identification (ASI) Project The Aboriginal Self Identification was implemented as a result of the Ministry of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation (MARR) which sponsored development of Aboriginal Administrative Data Standard (AADS) in 2007. Following the development of this process, the Ministry of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation (MARR) formally recommended the standard to the Government of British Columbia. British Columbia adopted the standard and mandated it to several Ministries including Health. Since 2007 most provincial Ministries have implemented the standard, with Health being the notable exception. Interior Health's Aboriginal Health & Wellness Advisory Committee (AHWAC) recommended in 2007 that Interior Health adopt the standard and implement Aboriginal Self-Identification. AHWAC approved the Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy 2010-2014 which featured Aboriginal Self Identification as one of the key projects to be implemented by the Aboriginal Health Program. ASI is foundational to: 1. Closing the health status gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations via an evidenced based approach. 2. Delivering client-centered, culturally competent, appropriate care to Aboriginal people. 3. Obtaining a base-line understanding of: a. Current Aboriginal service utilization by program/service by Aboriginal sub-populations; 5 b. Variance in needs across Aboriginal populations and compared to non-Aboriginal populations. 4. Enhancing care continuity, service coordination, flow optimization to appropriate services thereby reducing wasted patient days, transitional service gaps and unnecessary and preventable acute care admission and recidivism. 5. Creating the basic conditions to support culturally appropriate, effective and efficient, evidenced-based, research, planning, policy, and program development. 6. Performance monitoring and evaluation of programs or services serving Aboriginal people. 7. Increasing accountability and 'ability' at all levels across all stakeholders. 8. Improving Aboriginal peoples access to services by better understanding barriers to access and then acting to reduce or eliminate these barriers based on evidence. 9. Improving Aboriginal people's attachment to primary care providers by understanding the dimensions and scope of the current gap. 10. Creating novel business and funding models to more effectively allocate scarce financial resources to programs and initiatives that demonstrably target populations with the greatest needs and prevalence of disease and disability in an equitable and sustainable manner. 11. Realizing the potential and promise of IH community integration via: a. Appropriately sharing de-identified Aboriginal Health Information to empower Aboriginal Communities, Bands, Tribal Councils, and other Provincial or Federal entities responsible for service delivery and planning to the benefit of Aboriginal people. b. Integrated case management, shared care planning, and improved service transitions across diverse and multi-jurisdictional service organizations: 1. Integrated EMR's and transactional sharing of personal health information; 2. Discharge notices, referrals, client instructions for home care, etc. 3. Creating a single virtual ubiquitous client health record and thus: 4. Eliminating the need for Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal people having to repeat their stories to every service provider they choose to engage with 5. Eliminating false provider economies and increasing consumer choice and purchase power. Diabetes Strategy The Aboriginal Health program's involvement in the Interior Health Diabetes Strategy ensures Aboriginal participation and representation occurs at all stages of strategy planning and implementation. The focus of the Diabetes Strategy work included engagement and communication about the three year pilot in select Interior Health communities where Aboriginal participation is promoted and encouraged. This component of the strategy focuses on those living with diabetes, specifically target populations such as Aboriginals. The focus has been on communicating and promoting the strategy to garner interest and participation of local Aboriginal stakeholders in the select communities. Participation is important to ensure that the Aboriginal perspective and experience of living with diabetes is shared with stakeholders in the strategy. 6 The selected communities represent urban, rural, on-reserve and M\u00e9tis populations with high rates of current and projected diabetes. In addition, this work included collaboration and information sharing with Health Canada to determine the services and work from federal departments related to diabetes for on-reserve populations. Thompson Rivers University Dementia Care The Aboriginal Health program is pleased to support the Thompson Rivers University based research project on culturally safe dementia care for elderly Aboriginal people. The research, funded through the Michael Smith Foundation, is lead by Dr. Wendy Hulko with the intent to translate findings to support healthcare professionals caring for Aboriginal clients with dementia. Advanced Care Planning This innovative working group, accountable to the IH End of Life Care Collaborative Committee, was established to provide knowledge and recommendations on the strategic planning for Advanced Care Planning, including identification of cross service linkages. The Aboriginal Health Program's largest contribution was the development o f the Aboriginal specific brochure to accompany the provincially legislated My Voice workbook. This was done to make the workbook more culturally safe for Aboriginal people. The brochure was developed with collaboration of Aboriginal people in the area to ensure the topic of 'end of life' was communicated in a respectful and relevant way for Aboriginal people. The Advance Care Planning brochure is now being accepted provincially to accompany the My Voice workbook. The brochure assists in directing Aboriginal patients on how and where they can express their future traditional health care choices. The work results from participation on the Advance Care Working Group and previewing the \"My Voice\" workbook. It was noted that this workbook was an opportunity for Aboriginal persons to express traditional and ceremonial rites that are culturally relevant and important to them. Doula Initiative: The Aboriginal Health Program recently participated in the Tripartite First Nations Aboriginal Doula Initiative with t he goal of \"improving maternal health services for Aboriginal women and bringing birthing closer to home and back into t he hands of women\". This goal wa s identified within the priorities outlined in the Transformative Change Accord First Nation's Health P lan (Nov 2006) that First Nations, Provincial and Federal governments are working towards. As a member of the Aboriginal Doula Implementation Working Group, directed by the Tripartite Maternal Child Health Planning Committee, the Aboriginal Health program worked towards addressing the many barriers Aboriginal families within our region face today in accessing culturally appropriate and accessible maternity care. The BC Aboriginal Doula Initiative was one way we are working towards achieving our goal. The role of the Doula is to build on the more traditional role of aunty, a lay woman recruited from the community who bridges language and cultural barriers and provides the woman, her partner and family with continuous emotional support, physical comfort and assistance in obtaining information before, during, and just after childbirth. Our region was selected to host Doula training which took place in Kamloops. Twelve Aboriginal women attend ed the training from a variety of communities across the health authority. As a part of our commitment to this initiative we were also offered demonstration funding to hire a 0.5 FTE Aboriginal 7 Doula Liaison to help support the Aboriginal women trained within our region to achieve certification as a Doula, in order for them to be able to provide these much needed services in their local communities. Aboriginal HR Strategy: The Aboriginal population represents approximately 6.7% of the total population in the southern interior (BC Stats, 2009). Compared to other Health Authorities, Interior Health has the second highest total Aboriginal population in the province (Statistics Canada, 2006). From data collected through the Employee Aboriginal Self-Identification Project, 2.24% (422) of the total Interior Health employee count have identified as Aboriginal as of December 2012. This rate is below a representative workforce target of 6.7% of the total Interior Health Aboriginal population. The government of British Columbia and the First Nations Health Society are signatories to the \"Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan\" [Accord], designed to support the health and wellness of First Nations in British Columbia. Health Canada later signed the \"Tripartite First Nations Health Plan\" that, in effect , has all parties adopting the Accord. One of the key elements in the Accord is: \"Each regional health authority will increase the number of professional and skilled trades First Nations in health professions. Health authorities will identify emerging employment opportunities, share the information, and link Aboriginal learners with appropriate training institutions.\" The expectation is that health authorities in British Columbia will work to meet this commitment. Interior Health's Aboriginal Human Re source Plan will support this on-going commitment. The Plan was built upon a scan of best practices \"Building an Aboriginal Strategy\" and stakeholder involvement \"Aboriginal HR Strategy: Summary of Focus Groups\", to ensure the Plan was relevant and informed by the Aboriginal peoples in Interior Health. Four cornerstones were identified that will form the foundation for ongoing work : 1. Employee Engagement, 2. Workplace Readiness, 3. Recruitment and 4. Education. 1 Appendix G: Interior Health Authority Aboriginal Strategy 2010- 2014 Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy 2010 -2014 October 27, 2 010 2 Acknowledgements This Strategy draws from the contributions of numerous individuals dedicated to Aboriginal health. Participants at our health planning meetings included representatives from First Nations communities, Friendship Centres, urban Aboriginal health and social service organizations, M\u00e9tis organizations, First Nations Health Council, Health Canada, Provincial Health Services Authority, academic institutions, and Interior Health staff and physicians. We appreciate the rich insight provided by all participants - thank you for generously sharing your time and expertise. We would like to acknowledge the ongoing contributions of the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Advisory Committee (AHWAC) to health planning for Aboriginal peoples in the Interior Health region. AHWAC remains an important means by which we liaison with Aboriginal community members. This Strategy distills what we have learned to date, and leads the way for our renewed direction in Aboriginal health. This document was prepared by Geeta Cheema , Community Integrati on, Interior Health 3 Message from the Board Chair On behalf of the Interior Health Board of Directors, I am pleased to present the Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy, 2010-2014. The Board is confident that this strategy provides a s ound direction for Interior Health's continuing and evolving work to improve the health outcomes of Aboriginal peoples. Interior Health is concerned that Aboriginal peoples' health lags behind other residents of our region. We recognize the barriers that Aboriginal peoples face in attaining good health, including challenges in accessing healthcare services. The health authority assumes responsibility for eliminating the barriers that we can control, and mitigating the barriers that we can influence. The Board of Directors acknowledges the vital partnerships that we have with Aboriginal communities and organizations to ens ure Aboriginal peoples' health needs are met. We are committed to local relationships as the foundation of our successful efforts, including Interior Health's role in implementing the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan. I wish to extend my support to the Community Integration portfolio for its leadership in providing inclusive health services. The Board will be interested in learning about the outcomes of this strategy. Norman Embree Chairman of the Board, Interior Health October 27, 2010 Message from the CEO Interior Health is currently engaged in a significant restructuring process in order to achieve a vision of \"One IH\" - that is, an organization where consistently high quality healthcare services are provided across our vast geography in ways that ensure accessibility and responsiveness to patients' needs. This vision is particularly relevant to reducing the health inequities experienced by the Aboriginal population. As outlined in this Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy, we will ensure tha t Aboriginal peoples' health needs are integral to \"One IH\". Local Aboriginal peoples have a deep rooted connection to the lands within the Interior Health region. Interior Health acknowledges the history of this area, and the special relationship that Aboriginal peoples have with Government. To counter the often-devastating experiences Aboriginal peoples have had within residential schools and healthcare facilities, and the effects of ongoing marginalization, we are committed to providing inclusive, culturally competent care. With leadership from the Community Integration portfolio, Interior Health is accountable to our stakeholders for successful implementation of the Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy. 4 Dr. Robert Halpenny President & Chief Executive Officer, Interior Health Table of Contents Acknowledgements ................................................................................................................................... 2 Message from the Board Chair ................................................................................................................. 3 Message from the CEO ............................................................................................................................. 3 Table of Contents ...................................................................................................................................... 4 Executive Summary ................................................................................................................................... 5 Introduction .............................................................................................................................................. 7 Background & Context for Aboriginal Health ........................................................................................... 9 Strategic Framework for Aboriginal Health ............................................................................................ 14 Implementation ...................................................................................................................................... 15 References .............................................................................................................................................. 16 APPENDIX A: Terms ............................................................................................................. 20 APPENDIX D: M\u00e9tis Communities ........................................................................................................... 21 5 Executive Summary Interior Health's Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy, 2010-2014, presents a strategic framework with the goal to improve the health of the Aboriginal peoples we serve. Our Strategy relies on a good understanding of the health issues faced by the Aboriginal population and the opportunities for improvement. Reflecting our renewed direction in Aboriginal health, this Strategy is consistent with the aims of the Tripartite First Nations Health Pla n, and affirms the ongoing need to nurture locally-based relationships with Aboriginal peoples. Aboriginal people - including First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit persons - constitute 6.7% of the population in the IH region (BC Stats, 2009), yet experience disproportionate rates of many diseases and injuries compared to other residents. For instance, there are wide disparities in the childhood dental surgery rates, cervical cancer mortality rate, and life expectancy for Status Indians in the IH region (BC Provincial Health Officer, 2009). Interior Health is committed to closing the gap on such health inequities. The health system's impact on Aboriginal health outcomes can be amplified when the determinants of health are considered. In addition to commonly understood health determinants such as income, education, and access to health services (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2010), Aboriginal health determinants include colonization, cultural continuity, and self-determination (National Aboriginal Health Organization, 2006). This Strategy supports the principle that healthcare for Aboriginal people is most effectively delivered through inclusion in all service streams across the continuum of care. Inclusion does not preclude the need for specialized approaches in order to meet the needs of Aboriginal clients. With the aim for inclusion, this document presents 5 key strategies that define our renewed approach to Aboriginal health. They are: 1. Develop a Sustainable Aboriginal Health Program 2. Ensure Aboriginal Peoples' Access to Integrated Services 3. Deliver Culturally Safe Services across the Care & Service Continuum 4. Develop an Information, Monitoring and Evaluation Approach for Aboriginal Health 5. Ensure ongoing Meaningful Aboriginal Participation in Healthcare Planning The Community Integration portfolio within Interior Health (composed of Promotion & Prevention, Mental Health & Addictions, Primary Healthcare, Community Care, and Aboriginal Health) assumes primary accountability and leadership for implementation of the se key strategies. Community Integration will monitor implementation of the Strategy and report on Aboriginal health outcomes. 6 Having established inclusive services across their Care & Service Continuum, the Community Integration Leadership Team will be able to facilitate inclusion of Aboriginal health across other IH Programs. 7 Introduction Interi or Health's Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy, 2010-2014, presents a strategic framework with the goal to improve the health of the Aboriginal peoples we serve. Resulting from extensive stakeholder consultations, this document distills the key strategies for our renewed direction in Aboriginal health. The health of Aboriginal peoples merits particular attention. While the Aboriginal population is a relatively small proportion of the entire regional population, we recognize that Aboriginal health is influenced by historical and contemporary determinants of health that have resulted in disproportionate rates of disease and injury. In order to close the gap in Aboriginal health status, we must pay special attention to these health determinants and collaborate with Aboriginal people to identify healthcare solutions that will meet their needs. This Strategy acknowledges that for Aboriginal health gains to occur, efforts are required across the Care & Service Continuum (see Figure 1). As depicted within the Continuum, Interior Health's services are collectively directed with Illness\" of Life\". By providing a client-centered approach to health services, the Care & Service Continuum serves as a roadmap for health services integration. This Strategy supports the principle that healthcare for Aboriginal people is most effectively delivered through inclusion in all service streams (i.e., Programs) across the Care & Service Continuum. This Strategy relays expectations for inclusive health planning and service delivery that will contribute to Aboriginal health. By ensuring services are accessible and responsive to all residents - and particularly those with the greatest health needs - Programs will direct their efforts to achieving population health gains and reducing health inequities. In the aim for inclusion, Aboriginal health will provide clear impetus for action. Successful approaches learned through experience in Aboriginal health will be applied to parallel initiatives across the health authority. While this Strategy is based on the premise that Aboriginal health will improve through inclusive, integrated service delivery , this does not preclude the need for specialized approaches suited to the needs of Aboriginal peoples. For instance, the Aboriginal Health and Wellness Advisory Committee provides a vehicle for participation in Aboriginal health planning, and Aboriginal Patient Navigators are vital to ensuring cultural safety for Aboriginal clients. This Strategy affirms that inclusion will be supported through practices appropriate for Aboriginal people. The Community Integration portfolio within Interior Health assumes primary accountability and leadership for implementation of the key strategies identified in this Strategy . Community Integration provides community-based health services in 5 program areas: Promotion & Prevention; Mental Health & Addictions; Primary Healthcare; Community Care; and, Aboriginal Health. Having established Aboriginal inclusion across their Care & Service Continuum, the 8 Community Integration Leadership Team will be able to facilitate change across other IH Programs. Interior Health is committed to having an impact on Aboriginal health. Community Integration will monitor and report on the implementation of this Strategy and key Aboriginal health outcomes.

This section provides an overview of Aboriginal population health status and health determinants, identifies important developments in Aboriginal health policy, and highlights key aspects of IH's Aboriginal Health Program. ABORIGINAL PEOPLES SERVED BY IH As embedded in Section 35 of the Constitution Act (1982), the term Aboriginal refers to people of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit ancestry. Status Indian is a legal term that refers to a First Nations person registered with Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. These and other key terms are defined in Appendix A. The service area of Interior Health is the traditional territory of many culturally distinct First Nations, and is also home to many Aboriginal people from other parts of the province, country and continent. Diversity among the Interior's Aboriginal p eoples is marked by varying cultural practices, languages, residency (i.e., on- or off-reserve) and Status. The 2006 Census enumerated 196,075 self-identified Aboriginal people in British Columbia (4.8% of the total provincial population); within the Interior Health region, there were 44,900 self-identified Aboriginal people (6.7% of the total regional population) (BC Stats, 2009). In 2006, there were 27,475 First Nations people residing in the IH region, comprising 61% of the Interior's total Aboriginal population (BC S tats, 2009). 42% of First Nations people in the IH region reside on-reserve, in one of 53 First Nations communities (BC Stats, 2009). See Appendix B for further information about First Nations communities within the IH region. 58% of the First Nations population in our region reside off-reserve (BC Stats, 2009) . Friendship Centres provide health and social services to 'urban' Aboriginal people, and there are seven of these organizations within the IH region. Appendix C provides further information about Friendship Centres in the IH region. According to the 2006 Census, 16,200 M\u00e9tis people reside in the Interior Health region, which constitutes 36% of the Interior's total Aboriginal population (BC Stats, 2009). There are 13 M\u00e9tis Chartered Communities within the IH region (M\u00e9tis Nation BC, 2009). Further information about M\u00e9tis communities is provided in Appendix D. AN OVERVIEW OF ABORIGINAL HEALTH STATUS IN INTERIOR H EALTH The ability to profile the health status of Aboriginal people is limited. In most cases, provincial health data can only be sourced for the Status Indian population, because non-Status Aboriginal 10 persons are not identifiable within the records. Population health surveys, such as the M\u00e9tis Nation BC Survey, provide some information to supplement the available provincial data. The BC Provincial Health Officer's 2007 Annual Report provides the most current analysis of health information for British Columbia Status Indians (BC Provincial Health Officer, 2009). In assessing population health changes that have occurred from 2001 to 2006, the Provincial Health Officer (PHO) states, \"some progress has been made in improving both the determinants of Aboriginal health and health outcomes. Nonetheless, significant gaps in health status continue to exist\" (p xxxi). The PHO report provides an analysis of health indicators by regional health authority. For 48 indicators, the report presents the \"gap\" between Status Indians and Other Residents of the Interior Health region. Indicators where Status Indians fare better than or the same as Other Residents are: All Cancers Lung Cancer Female Breast Cancer Prostate Cancer Ischemic Heart Disease Chronic Lung Disease Smoking Attributable Mortality Prescriptions for Cerebral Stimulants Preventable Admissions to Hospitals Status Indians fare worse than Other Residents for numerous indicators. Such indicators related to 'Healthy Beginnings' and 'Disease & Injury 'are presented in Table 1. Here, the last column (\"ratio\") shows the degree of the inequity. Because they are sometimes ambiguous to interpret, 'Health Services' indicators are presented separately in Table 2. Table 1.

This is one source of information that can be used to set priorities for the Aboriginal Health Program. It is also necessary to consider the number of people affected by the health issue, the impact on quality of life, the burden on healthcare utilization, and the ability of the healthcare system to intervene. While not as extensive as the Status Indian data featured above, t he 2006 M\u00e9tis Nation BC Survey provides some perspective on M\u00e9tis health status in BC based on survey responses from nearly 1500 M\u00e9tis households. The results infer that the M\u00e9tis population faces similar health disparities as those profiled for Status Indians. Commenting on the survey results, the Provincial Health Officer (2009) explains , \"overall, M\u00e9tis health indicators appear to be closer to the indicators for the Status Indian population rather than other residents\" (p. xxxvi). 12 The three most commonly reported health concerns of the adult M\u00e9tis survey respondents were Dental Care, Prescription Assistance, and Traditional Healing, while M\u00e9tis youth cited Drug Addiction, Teen Pregnancy and Smoking as their most important health issues. DETERMINANTS OF ABORIGINAL HEALTH Health status indicators vividly convey the health inequities experienced by the Aboriginal population. In order to effectively address these inequities, it is vital to understand the determinants of Aboriginal health. Health outcomes are related to a variety of factors and influences. It is estimated that the healthcare system contributes only 25% towards health outcomes (Senate Subcommittee on Population Health, 2009). As identified by the Public Health Agency of Canada (2010), the determinants of health are: Income & Social Status Social Support Networks Education & Literacy Employment / Working Conditions Social Environments Physical Environments Personal Health Practices & Coping Skills Healthy Child Development Biology & Genetic Endowment Health Services Gender Culture The National Aboriginal Health Organization (2006) affirms the relevance of these determinants of health for Aboriginal people, but adds the following factors: Colonization Globalization Migration Cultural Continuity Territory Access (remoteness) Poverty Self-Determination These health determinants imply that the health system's impact on Aboriginal health outcomes can be amplified when the broader determinants of health are considered. DEVELOPMENTS IN ABORIGINAL HEALTH POLICY The landscape of Aboriginal health policy in British Columbia has been shifting rapidly. The most substantial developments originate from the Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan (2006) and the subsequent Tripartite First Nations Health Plan (2007). The Tripartite First Nations Health Plan (TFNHP) is a 10-year agreement between the Government of Canada, the Province of British Columbia and the First Nations Leadership Council to close the gaps in health status between First Nations and other British Columbians. The First Nations Health Council was created in 2007 as a coordinating body mandated to implement the TFNHP, and is composed of representatives of the First Nations political organizations in BC; however, the FNHC does not speak on behalf of First Nations in the region. 13 IH works with a Community Development Liaison designated by the FNHC who facilitates engagement between IH and First Nations communities. The TFNHP will result in significant changes to the delivery of health services to First Nations communities, and will require the involvement of health authorities in the development of strategies, plans and implementation. The IH Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy is consistent with the approaches and aims of the TFNHP. The IH Aboriginal Health Program will also be connected to the provincial table on Community Integration, currently known as the \"Tricouncil\" (composed of Primary Healthcare, Community Care, and Mental Health & Addictions). Aboriginal Health will join membership of this group in early 2011, and a Work Plan will be developed provincially to guide Aboriginal Health Program delivery across the regional health authorities. In addition to these provincial developments, IH's relationship with the Ktunaxa Nation continues to be guided by a Letter of Understanding signed in January 2008. This agreement establishes a collaborative process for planning and provision of health services within the Ktunaxa Nation's traditional territory (in BC). HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ABORIGINAL HEALTH P ROGRAM IN IH The 2010-2014 Aboriginal Health & Wellness Strategy is the third cycle of dedicated Aboriginal health planning since Interior Health's inception in 2001. Following are a few key highlights of our efforts to work closely with Aboriginal patients, communities and organizations over nearly a decade: Aboriginal Health Program Tea m. Led by a Program Director, this Program team is dedicated to closing the health status gap experienced by the Aboriginal population. Aboriginal Health & Wellness Advisory Committee (AHWAC). AHWAC is a health planning advisory body that is composed of representatives from First Nations communities, Friendship Centres, and the M\u00e9tis Nation BC, plus members of IH's Board of Director s and Aboriginal Health Program. Aboriginal Patient Navigators (APNs). IH's seven Aboriginal P atient Navigators are located throughout the region, and act as a resource to patients and healthcare providers to ensure culturally competent care. APNs assist healthcare providers with needs assessment and discharge planning, and connect Aboriginal patients with community services. 14 Strategic Framework for Aboriginal Health This Strategic Framework presents five key strategies. Together, these provide clear direction for Interior Health to close the health status gap experienced by the Aboriginal population. Access to health services requires a connection between patient and provider. The patient -provider connection will be facilitated through communication, community engagement, transportation, outreach and telehealth. Aboriginal Patient Navigators play a special role in connecting patients and providers. Accessibility also presumes the delivery of culturally competent care. Deliver Culturally Safe Services across the Care & Service Continuum 3 Services are culturally safe when Aboriginal people experience culturally competent service delivery within welcoming environments. Cultural safety also considers continuity of care when Aboriginal people return to their home communities. Mechanisms to promote cultural safety will include Indigenous cultural competency training, culturally competent clinical practice (e.g., discharge planning), spaces for cultural/spiritual practice, and the services of Aboriginal Patient Navigators . Ensure Aboriginal Peoples' Access to Integrated Services Through Practice Leads, the Aboriginal Health Program will provide consultation to ensure that all Community Integration Program strategies are inclusive of Aboriginal Health. The Aboriginal Health Program will be sustained through stabilized funding and a positive working environment for staff. 2 Ensure ongoing Meaningful Aboriginal Participation in Healthcare Planning Develop an Information, Monitoring and Evaluation Approach for Aboriginal Health 5 4 Develop a Sustainable Aboriginal Health Program 1 Information on the health needs of Aboriginal people supports good service delivery, and monitoring and evaluation allows us to determine our effectiveness. Our approach will include monitoring key performance indicators through the Community Integration Dashboard, implementing the Aboriginal Self-identification Project, sharing information with Aboriginal communities, and evaluating selected initiatives. Participation of Aboriginal people improves health planning. We will work with the Aboriginal Health & Wellness Advisory Committee and through the Letter of Understanding with the Ktunaxa Nation to provide meaningful opportunities for Aboriginal participation. Liaison with the First Nations Health Council will enhance our role in the implementation of the Tripartite First Nations Health Plan. 15 Implementation The Community Integration portfolio within Interior Health assumes primary accountability and leadership for implementation of the key strategies identified in this Plan; this will occur under the guidance of the Community Integration Leadership Team. Once inclusive services are established across the Community Integration Care & Service Continuum, the Community Integration Leadership Team will identify mechanisms to facilitate inclusion of Aboriginal health in other IH Programs. Accountability related to this Plan will be demonstrated through two primary channels: (1) Semi-annual dissemination of a newsletter highlighting accomplishments in Aboriginal Health, for internal and external stakeholders, and; (2) Quarterly reporting of performance indicators identified within the Community Integration Dashboard, to Senior Executive and to the Aboriginal Health & Wellness Advisory Committee. 16 References BC Stats (2009).

The Canadian Constitution recognizes three groups of Aboriginal people, Status and Non-Status First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit, each having their own unique heritages, languages, cultural practices and spiritual beliefs. Band: Many First Nations communities have legally changed their name from \"Indian Band\" to \"First Nation\". A First Nation or \"band\" is usually made up of one or more land bases, more commonly known as reserves. Generally, First Nations identify themselves as communities and not bands. Chartered M\u00e9tis Communities: Communities of M\u00e9tis citizens as registered through the M\u00e9tis Citizen registry. First Nation: A term that came into common usage in the 197 0s to replace the word \"Indian.\" Although the term First Nation is widely used, no legal definition of it exists. The term First Nation generally refers to the Indian people of Canada , both Status and Non -Status . First Nations Community: For the purpose of this Aboriginal Health Plan, this is defined as Status First Nations people residing on-reserve. This definition facilitates the use of available statistics. Inuit: The Inuit are people of Aboriginal descent in northern Canada who generally reside in the Northwest Territories, northern Quebec and Labrador with a small percentage living throughout the rest of Canada. The Inuit are officially recognized as Aboriginal people in the Constitution. Non-Status First Nation: A person of Aboriginal ancestry who is not registered under the Indian Act but traces their ancestry back to a First Nation, M\u00e9tis or Inuit person. Reserve: \"A tract of land, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, that has been set apart by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of a band.\" Indian Act, 1876. Status First Nation or Registered First Nation: Status First Nation or Registered First Nations persons are defined as\" Indian\" under the Indian Act and are usually members of a First Nation or Band. Prior to the mid-1960s, most Status First Nations lived on-reserve; however, recently a steady migration to urban centres has seen almost 50 per cent choosing to live off-reserve. M\u00e9tis: \"M\u00e9tis\" means a person who self-identifies as M\u00e9tis, is distinct from other Aboriginal peoples, is of Historic M\u00e9tis Nation ancestry, and is accepted by the M\u00e9tis Nation. The M\u00e9tis have been recognized as Aboriginal people under the Canadian Constitution. Defined Terms in National Definition of M\u00e9tis: i. \"Historic M\u00e9tis Nation\" means the Aboriginal people then known as M\u00e9tis or Half-breeds who resided in the Historic M\u00e9tis Nation Homeland 18 ii. \"Historic M\u00e9tis Nation Homeland\" means the area of land in west central North America used and occupied as the traditional territory of the M\u00e9tis or Half-breeds as they were then known. iii. \"M\u00e9tis Nation\" means the Aboriginal people descended from the Historic M\u00e9tis Nation which is now comprised of all M\u00e9tis Nation citizens and is one of the \"aboriginal peoples of Canada\" within the meaning of s.35 of the Constitution Act 1982. iv. \"Distinct from other Aboriginal peoples\" means distinct for cultural and nationhood purposes. v. M\u00e9tis identity and citizenship is established in the M\u00e9tis Nation British Columbia (MNBC) in partnership with Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. M\u00e9tis identity is verified through M\u00e9tis ancestry. Genealogy review with supporting documentation, determines citizenship. 19 APPENDIX B: First Nations Communities First Nations Communities within the IH Region (Source: IH Information Support, 2010).
