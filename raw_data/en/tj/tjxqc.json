Crystal healing therapy is a non-invasive, relaxing, natural and enjoyable process. Whether you believe in the physical healing properties of crystals or not, the therapy itself will offer you a chance to lie back, relax and get in touch with your body's energies so you can leave feeling refreshed, restored and de-stressed - a perfect platform for improved physical health. More about Crystal Healing When using crystals for healing, their energy actually blends with the client's energy, therefore transmuting and/or amplifying their vibrational frequency or the energy within their body. Therefor crystals help to rebalance and re-energize the body on the physical, emotional, and spiritual levels. As with most alternative and complementary therapies, you will first be required to have an initial private and confidential consultation. The initial consultation is basically an opportunity for me to learn as much about you, your medical history and your lifestyle as possible, allowing me to analyse your personal situation as thoroughly as possible before selecting the appropriate crystals for treatment. Crystal therapy is based on the premise that crystals can balance and interact with the chakras which are connected to energies flowing around the human body known as the aura. On a microscopic level a crystal is a network of repeating geometric patterns made up of compressed ions, atoms and molecules. Every crystal has its own unique electromagnetic charge. These charges or 'healing vibrations' interact with the body's energy centres (chakras) to remove 'blockages' and restore a healthy balance and flow through the body mind and spirit. At the beginning of a session you will be asked to either sit on a chair or lie on the therapy couch. You do not need to remove any clothing apart from your shoes, belt buckles and glasses or jewellery I will then help to induce a deep state of relaxation before assessing your chakras and energy field. I then choose crystals carefully for each individual patient as the essence of the human body is through stable and balanced energy flow. Every crystal vibrates to its own specific type of energy, which causes it to resonate at a certain frequency. I place these crystals on the chakras or different areas of the body and channel healing energy to activate the healing like with reiki or other energy healing therapy's, for around twenty minutes. This help to restore stability and balance to the body's energy systems, stimulating the body's natural healing mechanisms. I may also use sound tools for example a Tibetan or crystal bowl/bell or Koshi chimes as needed. When the session is over I will place my hands on your knees and call your name. During the session you may experience some slight tingling and some existing issues may slightly intensify before being released. This is perfectly normal and caused by the shifting energies within the body. I will be able to give you advice on what you can do after the therapy to enable a smooth assimilation of the balancing energies in between sessions. Once I have managed to ground and balance a client's chakras and energies and they are feeling real sense of wellbeing, I can then start to work on deeper issues on the emotional level which can help to reprogram and remove old false belief patterns, working on aligning their bodies or healing their grid lines to name but a few of the many different healing methods that can be achieved using crystals. Our Seven Main Chakras and Aura Our energy field consist of the seven subtle bodies called the aura, surrounding the physical body. These are connected to the seven main corresponding spinning wheels of energy that lie along the vertical spinal axis from the crown of your head to the base of the spine and are known as the chakras, which allow Kundalini, Ch'i, prana, or life force, to flow through our energy field and chakras. When a chakra is blocked, or we have attachments in our auras it is hard for us to live in a balanced state of body, mind and spirit, we become ungrounded, unable to focus, susceptible to picking up others negative energies and dis-ease (disease) will inevitably follow, causing discoloration and dense vibrations in the aura which prevents essential energy from the higher bodies to be filtered into the physical body. This can eventually lead to physical, emotional, spiritual and mental illness. However if our energy is flowing properly, we are protected and able to reach higher states of awareness and intuition, recognise and accept the feelings of unconditional love for ourselves and fellows, become more focused therefore enabling us to raise our vibrations. When all your chakras are spinning healthy, balanced and processing energy properly we can enjoy our time on this beautiful planet the way it was intended for us with a clear spiritual energy field, zest for life and willing to embrace the life are meant to live and for fill hear on earth.
