Notice given by or on behalf of the claiman t or beneficiary to this Plan or authorized claims payor with information sufficient to identify the Covered Person shall be deemed \"notice.\" A completed claim form should be attached to the submitted expense. Claims should be submitted to: The Alliance Claims Dept. P.O. Box 44365 Madison, WI 53744-4365 Claim Forms A fully completed claim form must be submitted if requested by the Third Party Administrator. The claim form should include current mailing address, student status (as applicable) and information regarding any other plan of benefits under which the Covered Person may be enrolled. Additional claim forms should be submitted on a Covered Person whenever that person experiences a change in student status, is enrolled or ter minated from another health benefit plan, or incurs expenses related to an Accident or Injury in order to provide details of the Accidental Injury. Claim forms may also be requested by this Plan at any time to provide information required to determine if a Claim is Eligible or Covered. Incomplete Claims This Plan has the right to delay or deny reimbursement on any Incomplete Claim. Incomplete Claim means any claim which cannot be determined to be an Eligible or Covered Expense as a result of a lack of information pertaining to the Claimant's eligibility to participate in this Plan, the service(s) rendered, the diagnosis, application of this Plan's Right of Recovery or Subrogation clause, details of any Accidental Injury, or any other reason which may be reasonably pertinent for a benefit determination. Pre-Determination of Benefits There are circumstances in which a Covered Person, his or her health care provider or other appropriate representative of the patient may request a pre- determination of coverage prior to the initiation of a Treatment or proce dure. Any pre- determination of coverage issued by this Plan is not a guarantee of benefits; benefits will be paid in accordance with Plan provisions in effect at the time services were rendered, patient eligibility, Plan exclusions and Plan limitations. 29 CLAIMS PROCEDURES AND REGULATIONS Large Case Management Often it is most efficient and more convenient for both this Plan and the family of the Covered Person to have this Plan provide active management of care and its delivery. When a covered Person h as been identified with a medical condition or catastrophic Illness, that Covered Person may require long term or lifetime care, or complicated patterns of care. In addition, when medical care costs for a particular condition are expected to exceed a cert ain dollar amount, and there is a potential for alternative treatment or an alternative setting, then the case may be referred for Large Case Management (LCM). LCM is a program which provides an individual case analysis and medical treatment plan recommendations to address the needs of the catastrophically ill or injured individual. The decision to implement LCM will be determined by the Third Party Administrator in coordination with the Third Party Administrator's Case Management (vendor or provider). A case manager will contact the Covered Person and/or family to explain about case management . The case manager, team of Physicians and rehabilitation nurses wor k with the Attending Physician and the Covered Person to develop a cost effective, long term plan of care that maximizes Plan resources, eliminates excess services and meets the individual Covered Person's needs. In certain circumstances, a recommendation to use alternative treatment, some of which may not normally be covered by this Plan, may be suggested when such treatment endorses quality care, Medical Necessity and cost effectiveness. Under these circumstances, any such suggested alternative treatment will be covered by this Plan. The patient and family are required to review the recommended alternative treatment plan. The final determination regarding the services to be rendered is the decision of the patient and/or family and the Attending Physicia n. There is no reduction of benefits or penalties imposed if the patient and family choose not to participate. Independent Medical Examination An Independent Medical Examination (IME) is a consultation, examination or records review requested by the Thir d Party Administrator on any Covered Person. An IME is most often used to determine medical necessity or the experimental/investigational nature of a Treatment plan or procedure. If a Covered Person fails to attend a scheduled IME without good cause, his or her benefits for that Treatment plan or procedure, or related care, may be suspended or denied. 30 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS This section will be used to determine a Covered Person's benefits under this Plan if: (a) the person is insured for medical care benefits under this Plan and is also covered for these benefits under other plans; and (b) the benefits that would be paid by this Plan, without this section plus the benefits that would be paid by the other plans, without a section similar to this section would exceed Allowed Expenses as defined below. Definitions \"Other Plan\" means a plan which provides benefits or services for, or by reason of Hospital, surgical , medical (including treatment for mental health and chemical dependency) , or dental care or treatment through: 1. any other group, blanket or franchise insurance coverage; 2. pre-paid plans for: - group Hospital service - group medical service - group practic e - individual practice and - any other such plans for members of a group; 3. any plan provided by: - labor management trusts - unions - employer organizations - professional organization, or - employee benefit organizations; 4. a government program or statute, other than a state medical assistance plan that implements Title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965; 5. any part of a state auto reparation or indemnity act (\"no fault insurance\") with which the state permits coordination ; and 6. insurance coverage provided by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) or the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA); or any coverage provided by the University of Wisconsin Athletic Department . This Plan does not cover nor provide benefits for expenses incurred for injury resulting from the play or practice of intercollegiate sports for which benefits are paid under insurance coverage provided by the NCAA or the NAIA; or any coverage provided by the University of Wisconsin Athletic Department. Any Medically Necessary Eligible Expenses provided for under this Plan and not paid for under insurance coverage provided by the NCAA, NAIA; or the University of Wisconsin Athletic Department Plan will be payable under thi s Plan. The total benefits paid under all plans cannot exceed 100% of the Eligible Expenses incurred. 31 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS \"This plan\" means the medical care benefits provided by this Plan. \"Allowed Expense\" means an Expense which is: - necessary, Usual and Customary; - incurred while the person for whom the claim is made is insured, or is entitled to benefits after insurance ends, under this Plan; - at least partly covered under one of the plans covering such person. The difference betw een the cost of a private Hospital room and the cost of a semi -private Hospital room shall not be deemed to be an Allowed Expense unless the patient's stay in a private room is Medically Necessary in terms of generally accepted medical practice. When this Plan does not pay its benefits first, \"Allowed Expense\" will not include an Expense which is not paid because of the claimant's failure to comply with the cost containment requirements of the plan which pays its benefits first. When a plan provides a benefit as a service rather than a cash payment, the reasonable cash value of the service will be considered to be both an Allowed Expense and a benefit paid. Effects On Benefits Under This Plan When this section is used, the rules listed below will determine the amount of benefit each plan will pay. All benefits will be determined on a Plan Year basis. These rules may require this plan to pay its benefits first. If so, this plan will pay its full benefits without taking into account other pl an benefits. These rules may require one or more of the other plans to pay their benefits before this plan. If so, this plan will reduce its benefits so that in any Plan Year, the sum of all benefits to be paid to a person (by this and all other plans) e quals the Allowed Expenses for that year. Benefits to be paid under other plans include benefits that would be paid if proper claim is made for such benefits. Rules to Determine which Plan Pays First A plan, or part of one, that does not have a section s imilar to this section will pay its benefits before a plan that has such a section. In all other cases, the plan that will pay its benefits first will be dependent upon the first applicable rule: 1. The plan that does not reserve the right to take this Pl an's benefits into account in figuring its own benefits will always be primary. 2. The plan which covers the Covered Person as an employee; rather than as a full or part - time student. 3. If 2 does not apply, the plan which covers the person as a full or part -time student rather than as a Dependent. 4. If 1, 2, and 3 do not apply, the plan which covers the person as a Dependent of the parent whose month and day of birth occurs earlier in the year. If the other plan has a rule based on the gender of the parent , the gender rule will determine the order of benefits. However, a child's parents may be divorced or separated. If so, the plan to pay its benefits first will be the plan which covers the child as a Dependent of the parent with custody rather than as a Dependent of the parent without custody. 32 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS If the parent with custody remarries: - the plan which covers the child as a Dependent of a parent with custody will pay its benefits first, - the plan which covers the child as a Dependent of a stepparent will pay its benefits next, and - the plan which covers the child as a Dependent of a parent without custody will pay its benefits last. For a Dependent child of separated or divorced parents, the following governs which plan pays first when the person is a Dependent of a student: (a) when a court order makes one parent financially responsible for the health care expenses of the Dependent child, then that parent's plan pays first; (b) if there is no such court order, then the plan of the natural parent with custody pays before the plan of the stepparent with custody; and (c) the plan of the stepparent with custody pays before the plan of the natural parent without custody. Item 1 will not apply unless a similar provision is contained in all plans. In this case item 2, 3, or 4 will determine which plan pays first. If none of the above apply, then the plan which has covered the Covered Person for the longer time rather than the shorter time pays first. If the benefits of this plan are reduced due to these rules, such reduction will be done in proportion. Any benefits paid by this plan on a reduced basis will be charged against the benefit limits of this plan. Right to Receive and Release Necessary Information For this section to work, the University must exchange information with other plans. To do so, the University may give to or get from any source all such information it thinks necessary. This will be done without the consent of or notice to any person except as required by the applicable state statute. Any person claiming benefits under this plan must give the University the information it requires. Facility of Payment Another plan may pay a benefit that should be paid by this Plan by the terms of the provision. If this happens, the University may pay to such payer the amount required for it to satisfy the intent of this provision. This will be done at the University's discretion. Any amount so paid will be considered a benefit under this plan. The University will not be liable for such payment after it is made. 33 GENERAL PROVISIONS Fiduciary Liability To the extent permitted by law, neither the Plan Administrator nor any other person shall incur any liability for any acts or for failure to act except for their own willful misconduct or willful breach of this Plan. Compensation of Plan Administrator Any Plan Administrator who is also an employee of the University shall service without compensation for services rendered in such capacity, but all reasonable expens es incurred in the performance of their duties shall be paid by the University.

Furthermore, the Plan Administrator shall be required to amend this Plan as is necessary to ensure compliance with applicable tax and other laws and regulations. Indemnification The Plan Administrator shall be indemnified by the University against claims, and the expenses of defending against such claims, resulting from any action or conduct relating to the administration of this Plan except claims arising from gross negligence, willful neglect, or willful misconduct. Applicable Laws The provisions of this Plan shall be construed, administered and enforced according to applicable Federal law. Post -Mortem Payments Any benefit payable under this Plan after the death of a Participant shall be paid to his or her surviving spouse (if any), otherwise, to his or her estate. If there is doubt as to the right of any beneficiary to receive any amount, the Plan Administrator may retain such amount until the rights thereto are determined, without liability for any interest thereon. 34 GENERAL PROVISIONS Mental or Physical Incompetency Every person receiving or claiming benefits under this Plan shall be presumed to be mentally and physically competent and of age until the Plan Administrator receives written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to it, that such person is mentally or physically incompetent or a minor, and that a guardian, conservat or or other person legally vested with the care of his or her estate has been appointed. Inability to Locate Payee If the Plan Administrator is unable to make payment to any Participant or other person to whom a payment is due under this Plan because he or she cannot ascertain the identity or whereabouts of such Participants or other person after reasonable efforts have been made to identify or locate such person such payment and all subsequent payments otherwise due to such Participant or other person shall be forfeited one year after the date any such payment first became due. Requirement for Proper Forms All communications in connection with this Plan made by a Participant shall become effective only when duly executed on any forms as may be required and furnished by, and filed with, the Plan Administrator.

Provisions Relating to Insurers No insu rer shall be required or permitted to issue an insurance policy or contract that is inconsistent with the purposes of this Plan, nor be bound to take any action not in accordance with the terms of any policy or contract with this Plan.
