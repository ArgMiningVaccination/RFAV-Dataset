Tips to help with anxiety There are many things you can try to help you learn how to manage feelings of anxiety. Make notes Every day, for at least 2 weeks, make a note of how you are feeling at different times of the day. Rate your anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 and note: - where you were - who you were with - what you were doing - what you were thinking This will help you see what situations are most likely to make you anxious. Think of anything you might be able to do to make these situations easier. Make a plan Make a list of the things you are anxious about. If you think there are things you can do to help with them, write a plan. Include in your plan: - what you can do about it - how you can do it - when you will do it If there are things you can do, do them as soon as possible or set a time for when you can. Start with the small or easiest ones first. Gradually build up to facing your bigger problems or fears. If the anxiety returns, remind yourself that you have either taken action or have a plan in place. If you don't stick to your plan, don't be too disappointed. Focus on small achievements. Manage your screen time Screen time is the time you spend looking at a device such as a phone, tablet, computer, games console or TV. Screen time can take up time that could be spent outdoors, socialising or being physically active. It can also expose you to stress, bullying or negativity through social media. To help manage your screen time: - make screen free zones in your home, for example, the bedroom - turn off or limit notifications on your phone - avoid using screen time when you're bored or stressed - avoid screen time during meals or when you are with family or friends - swap screen time for healthier alternatives - manage your social media apps and feeds Make time If your worry is overwhelming, set aside an amount of 'worry time' to go through your worries each day. Try 15 to 30 minutes each day to start with. When the time is up, focus your thoughts on other things until tomorrow. Challenge unhelpful thoughts Negative thought patterns can make anxiety worse. They can lead to unhelpful feelings and actions. Do not accept a negative thought as a fact, challenge it. Ask yourself: - what is the evidence for and against your negative thought? - are there other ways you can look at this situation? - if you were to be positive about the situation, how would you view it? Try to change a negative thought for a more helpful one. Sometimes you will be able to, but it is OK if you cannot Talk about your feelings If you feel anxious, it can help to talk to a friend or family member about how you feel. Telling someone about how you are feeling can help to make things clearer for you. It can help you understand why you are feeling anxious and to get help with how to manage it. Breathing exercises Breathing exercises can help your mind and body get control of a difficult situation. They only take a few minutes to do and can help you manage strong emotions and reduce stress. Mindfulness Mindfulness teaches you to become aware of the present moment. This helps you enjoy things more. You can learn to not react or become overwhelmed by what's going on around you by doing mindfulness. Instead, you notice your thoughts, feelings and sensations. Mindfulness can be an easy activity you can fit into your day. Sleep well Anxiety can make you feel more tired than usual. It can also make it more difficult to get or stay asleep. Sleep is important for mental health. It helps you to think clearly and gives you the energy to deal with problems. Most people need 5 to 9 hours sleep a night. More than 7 hours is recommended for adults. The ideal amount is 8 hours, but everyone's different. Healthy eating What you eat can make a difference to your mental health. A diet rich in foods such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds can boost your energy and mental health. Healthier food choices can improve your mental and physical health. Physical activity Physical activity can help you sleep, relax and feel better. It can help reduce stress and burn off anxious energy. It can also be a good way to meet people and get more involved in your community. Any activity is useful, as long as it is suited to your ability and you do enough of it. Find something that you enjoy doing. This will help keep you motivated to do it every day. Alcohol and anxiety Alcohol affects your mental health and can make anxiety worse in the long-term.
