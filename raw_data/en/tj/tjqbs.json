There are many cleanses out there, and many ways to cleanse, and they differ in timing and dietary recommendations. Typically, a 3-day cleanse will include drinking plenty of water (any cleanse should include this) along with supplements to help with elimination and support of resetting your system. Any dietary recommendations should be included with the supplements, though a good rule of thumb is to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and steer away from processed foods and foods with added sugar. You should follow the directions of any 3-day cleanse carefully to get the best results. Eating nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables and whole grains, will help support the detoxification process. We also recommend drinking plenty of water and increasing your fiber intake throughout the cleanse.
