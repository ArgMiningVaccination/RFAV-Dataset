For thousands of years, many cultures have used heat bathing, to cleanse and heal the body. The Finnish heat baths were \u2014 and still are \u2014 called saunas. The ancient Roman baths, Russian Banyas and Native American sweat lodges were all forms of saunas. In Morocco, Turkey and the Middle East the Hammam is a type of Sauna/Steam. Today, saunas are gaining popularity all over the world as way to increase health and vitality. Saunas can help you relax, and research is proving other long-term potential benefits for your health, including relief from pain due to injury or arthritis, positive effects on blood pressure, and faster wound healing. The Difference between Saunas and Infrared Saunas: Saunas use heat to cause you to sweat while also increasing your heart rate - as if you were exercising. Originally, saunas consisted of just a small fire built underneath an enclosed space. Today, traditional saunas use heaters to heat rocks, which warm the air in the room and ultimately warm your body. Newer infrared saunas have now become the most popular Saunas. Most infrared saunas use far-infrared (FIR) light. The term \"far\" refers to where the infrared waves fall on the light spectrum. Some saunas also use near infrared light (NIR) and mid infrared light (MIR). NIR light may promote skin renewal, improved cellular functioning, and wound healing. MIR light can penetrate deeper into the body's soft tissue where inflammation occurs and may speed up the healing process. FIR light reaches deepest into the body, where toxins are stored. Some infrared saunas contain the full spectrum of light. Unlike traditional saunas which heat the air, an infrared sauna uses light to heat your body in much the same way the sun does. So, an infrared sauna can produce the same benefits as a traditional sauna, but at a lower temperature of between 120 and 140\u00baF compared to the temperature range of a traditional sauna, which is typically between 150 and 185\u00ba F. How Infrared Helps You Detoxify Many people believe that sweating is a great way to release toxins and other impurities from your body. In fact, it's a common \"benefit\" pitched at hot yoga studios. One theory is that fever is the body's way of ridding itself of toxins, and a sauna creates a self-induced fever. However, this theory may be a bit simplistic. The primary organs of detox in the body are your liver and kidneys. The reason your body sweats is to cool its internal temperature. When analyzed, sweat is comprised mostly of water and a tiny bit of salt. There is no exception when it comes to sweat caused by a traditional sauna \u2014 studies show sweat caused by a traditional sauna is 95-97% water and the rest is salt, with a tiny bit of protein and urea. In other words, it's not made up of \"toxins\" per se. The main reason you feel good after sweating \u2014 whether after exercise or a sauna \u2014 is that your body releases endorphins. It does not necessarily mean that you are releasing toxins. But there may be an exception when it comes to infrared saunas. As humans, we are all bio-accumulators. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we all have dangerous toxins stored in our bodies, including pesticides and mycotoxins. We retain these toxins in our bodies' fatty tissues, including breast milk, the liver, and blood plasma. Most of these environmental toxins are known to contribute to a whole host of diseases, including cancer, arthritis, autoimmune disease, autism, fibromyalgia, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's and more. While most sweat is comprised of water and little salt, 15-20% of infrared sauna-induced sweat is composed of cholesterol, fat-soluble toxins, heavy metals, sulfuric acid, and ammonia (as well as sodium and uric acid.) In other words, an infrared sauna may enable your body to eliminate environmental toxins through sweat. 10 Additional Benefits of Infrared Sauna Many doctors agree that the use of an infrared sauna is virtually one of the most powerful healing therapies. There are many studies that document the effectiveness of sauna therapy for hypertension, congestive heart failure, and for post-myocardial infarction care. In addition, there are proven benefits of infrared sauna for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic fatigue, chronic pain, or addictions. Here are some of the more common benefits of infrared sauna: Provides temporary relief from pain The dry heat from an infrared sauna can relieve soreness due to over exertion by helping to loosen tight muscles. This helps with recovery time for athletes and the rest of us after a hard workout. One reason is because, during a sauna, beta endorphins and norepinephrine are released. This temporarily raises your body's pain threshold. The dry heat of infrared saunas may reverse chronic pain and stiffness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis whose conditions are typically aggravated by humidity. Helps with weight loss A sauna increases your heart rate just like when you exercise. Used regularly, saunas can help increase your metabolism. Some infrared sauna manufacturers claim that users can burn anywhere from 300-600 calories in one sauna session. Sauna therapy can release toxins stored in fat tissues that can otherwise prevent weight loss. These toxins include heavy metals, and fat-soluble chemicals like PCBs, PBBs, and HCBs. Improves heart rate variability One of the key indicators of a healthy heart is heart rate variability (HRV). The more variability you have between heart beats, the better. If you are under chronic stress or have a condition where you cannot exercise, your heart rate can become less variable. Infrared saunas not only give your heart a workout, but they also help to relax your body and mind, reduce autonomic nervous stimulation, and improve your HRV. Increases circulation Heat causes your blood vessels to dilate. As blood is drawn closer to the skin's surface, your blood vessels expand to accommodate increased blood flow. This allows your blood vessels to become more elastic over time. This can improve and decrease your risk of cardiovascular disease. Maintains healthy looking skin Infrared sauna can improve psoriasis and other skin conditions. Far infrared saunas stimulate blood circulation in your skin, which in turn may help boost your skin's ability to produce collagen. And sweating may accelerate your skin's ability to detox traces of dirt, makeup, pollution, heavy metals, and alcohol. Finally, the heat relaxes tense facial muscles. Supports kidney function Releasing toxins through sweating can help support kidney function by reducing the load put on your kidneys. Some doctors recommend infrared sauna use for their patients on dialysis. Reduces blood pressure Infrared sauna therapy lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly with regular use. Lowers your risk of dementia Regular sauna bathing is associated with lower risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease. And the more frequently you take a sauna the better. One of the ways saunas may help protect your brain is by stimulating the production of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) in much the same way aerobic exercise does, helping to bulk up grey matter through neurogenesis. Improves your immunity Regular Sauna sessions can reduce your chance of getting a cold by 30 percent. In addition, infrared saunas have even been shown to help prevent a cold from getting worse. One of the reasons is that a sauna-induced fever may stimulate the immune system to increase production of white blood cells and antibodies. Promotes a sense of well-being Saunas have been traditionally used to produce a feeling of relaxation. The heat helps to relieve physical and emotional tension in your muscles, including your face and neck muscles, by triggering the body's parasympathetic nervous system. This relaxation effect is one of the biggest benefits to using a sauna.
