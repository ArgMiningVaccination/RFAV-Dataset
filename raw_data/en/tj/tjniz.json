Learn about some alternative remedies that might help and what they involve here.", "sitename": "Medical News Today", "date": "2017-06-14", "cleaned_text": "Epilepsy is a condition in which disruption to electrical activity in the brain results in seizures. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), epilepsy affects around [3 million adults](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/data/index.html) The most common and effective [treatment for epilepsy](/articles/seizure-medications) is prescription antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol). However, there are different [types of epilepsy](/articles/types-of-epilepsy) and different types of seizures, and only around [two-thirds](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/about/faq.htm) Antiepileptic drugs can also cause side effects for some people, so a doctor may need to make adjustments to a person's medication type or dosage over time. Also, around [80% of people](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33023444/) For these and other reasons, some people seek alternative, complementary, and non-drug therapies, such as herbs, supplements, [cannabidiol (CBD)](/articles/317221) products, and essential oils. However, epilepsy is a complex condition. It is essential to discuss any natural remedies with a doctor before using them, as some options may not be safe or effective for everyone. In this article, learn more about some of the non-drug options available for managing seizures with epilepsy. There is currently [no cure](https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/epilepsy.htm) [Learn more about the types of epilepsy and their treatment methods here.](/articles/types-of-epilepsy) Some people use [cannabis](/articles/246392) products to help treat convulsions. Preliminary [scientific evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911937/) In 2020, the [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-indication-drug-containing-active-ingredient-derived-cannabis-treat-seizures-rare) [Epidiolex](/articles/epidiolex), which is a drug containing a cannabis-based ingredient, to treat seizures that stem from two rare and severe genetic conditions: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and [Dravet syndrome](/articles/dravet-syndrome). This is currently the only cannabis-based product with FDA approval, and it is only available with a prescription. In addition, some anecdotal evidence suggests that some people use cannabis or products containing CBD to help manage their seizures. However, larger scientific studies have not shown that cannabis and most CBD-based products are effective in treating epilepsy. There is also a risk of serious side effects, including worsening epilepsy or interactions with antiepileptic drugs or other medications. For this reason, it is essential to speak with a doctor before using these substances. It is also worth bearing in mind that cannabis and CBD are not legal in all states, so people should also check their local regulations before purchasing a product containing either of these substances. [Learn more about using CBD oil for seizures here.](/articles/cannabis-oil-for-seizures) Is CBD legal?The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3% THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3% THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check [state laws](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx), especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled. There is [some evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836058/) Research suggests that this diet can reduce the frequency of seizures in some people with epilepsy and help them think more clearly. The diet causes ketosis, which is the chemical breakdown of proteins in the muscles. This suppresses seizure activity. According to the paper above, people have used this diet since 1921 to help manage epilepsy, and it appears to be successful for people who have epilepsy that is hard to treat, including children. However, it is very restrictive, and most people find it difficult to follow. Many people around the world use herbal remedies for epilepsy. They may do this because herbal remedies are [easy to obtain](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.604040/full) or because they cannot access professional healthcare. The author of a [2021 review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33023444/) They considered their effect on: - the balance of [neurotransmitters](/articles/326649) - the prevention of neuroinflammation [oxidative stress](/articles/324863) [mitochondrial](/articles/320875)dysfunction However, there were no studies specifically showing an effect on epilepsy in humans. Some substances in the various herbs could potentially interact with the body, including: - Salvia miltiorrhiza, or red sage - curcumin, which is present in [turmeric](/articles/306981) [resveratrol](/articles/resveratrol-benefits), which is an antioxidant present in red grapes and other plants - Acorus tatarinowii, which is an herb used in Chinese medicine - Aniba candelilla, or Kunth, which is also known as precious bark - Uncaria rhynchophylla, or cat's claw - American ginseng - Silybum marianum, or [milk thistle](/articles/320362) However, these findings do not mean that taking any of these herbs will cure or treat epilepsy. Far more research is needed to confirm how they work, if they are effective, and whether or not there are any risks. Currently, there are no known dosage, frequency, or mode of delivery recommendations for using these herbs to reduce seizures in humans. Herbal remedies containing ingredients that could interact with antiepileptic drugs or make seizures worse is worth remembering that the FDA does not monitor the quality of herbs and supplements, and it does not guarantee their safety for specific conditions. So, people should not use any herbs or supplements for epilepsy without first speaking with a doctor. [Learn more about herbal remedies for anxiety, migraine, and other conditions here.](/articles/herbal-remedies) There is a [lack of research](https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(20)30591-4/fulltext) into how supplementing with vitamins might help people with epilepsy. An [older review from 2007](https://altmedrev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/v12-1-9.pdf) considered the following supplements in relation to epilepsy: In 2016, [some scientists](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2016.00218/full) proposed further research into vitamin D3 to help reduce seizures, but more work is still needed. Some deficiencies may have links with seizures. In the 2007 review, people who had [tonic-clonic](/articles/grand-mal-seizure) seizures were more likely to have low magnesium levels than those who did not, and people with very low levels had more severe seizures more frequently. Doctors use magnesium as a treatment for certain neurological conditions. Some research suggests that people with epilepsy may have lower levels of certain nutrients \u2014 such as folic acid, vitamin D, or calcium \u2014 as well as higher cholesterol levels. However, there could be various reasons for this, including medication side effects. It does not imply that taking more of those nutrients will reduce seizure frequency. Instead, it is considered good for a person's health to have adequate vitamins and other nutrients. If a person is deficient, they may need supplements to reach a healthy level. When antiepileptic drugs do not work, some people use [biofeedback therapy](/articles/265802) to reduce seizures. Biofeedback is a medical technique that helps a person recognize changes in their body. Based on this, they can develop ways to respond that can minimize the chance of experiencing a seizure. For example, if the person feels a seizure aura \u2014 which can occur just before a seizure \u2014 they might sit down or go to a safe place. If they have light-induced seizures, they might be able to look away in time to prevent the seizure from happening. A [2018 study](https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2352-3964(17)30493-0/fulltext) Biofeedback is a noninvasive therapy that shows promise for people with epilepsy, but it needs more research. It involves using a machine that detects electrical activity in the brain, using this information to learn how to recognize the warning signs of seizures, and training the brain to prevent seizures. [Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)](/articles/vagus-nerve-stimulation) involves implanting a device in the chest that sends electrical signals to the brain. It sends well-calibrated, mild, regular electrical signals to the vagus nerve, and these signals calm those that lead to seizures. The effect of VNS varies widely among people with epilepsy. Some people see a significant improvement, while others do not find that it helps. It usually begins to have effects right after surgery, but it can sometimes take up to [2 years](https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/about-epilepsy/treatment/vagus-nerve-stimulation) to make a difference. It is also unlikely to stop seizures completely. According to research from 2020, [50-60%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6432928/) Before starting VNS treatment, a person may need to undergo testing to see if they have the type of seizures that are likely to respond to VNS. This improves the likelihood of the technique being effective. People can still use antiepileptic drugs with VNS, but they may find that they are able to reduce the dosage. For people with epilepsy, [stress](/articles/145855.php) and [anxiety](/info/anxiety/) may [increase the risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8071059/) Relaxation strategies can help people feel calm, relax the muscles, and improve sleep. Some [relaxation techniques](https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/living-epilepsy/wellbeing/complementary-therapies) that may help include: - Indian head massage, which is a massage of the head, shoulders, and arms - whole or partial body massage - shiatsu, which involves putting pressure on acupuncture points - reflexology, which focuses on [pressure points in the hands](/articles/324699)and feet Deep breathing and meditation may also help, but they can affect electrical signals to the brain. People with epilepsy should find a qualified practitioner who can train them appropriately. As interest grows in neurostimulation therapies for epilepsy, some researchers believe that [acupuncture](/articles/156488) could help. An acupuncturist inserts very fine needles into specific places on the body. They then leave them there for a few minutes or as long as [30-40 minutes](https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/living-epilepsy/wellbeing/complementary-therapies). In theory, this affects the energy channels in the body. [Research suggests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4273587/) [Seizures happen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430765/) Certain events and activities can trigger such a shift. Knowing their triggers may help people reduce the risk of experiencing a seizure. Some [common triggers](https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/about-epilepsy/epileptic-seizures/seizure-triggers) include: - a lack of sleep - stress - exposure to flashing lights, 3D films, or virtual reality, for people with photosensitive epilepsy - the use of [alcohol](/articles/305062)or drugs, including medications - not taking medication for epilepsy Anyone, in theory, can experience a seizure. For example, people without epilepsy can experience [febrile seizures](/articles/168010), [psychogenic nonepileptic seizures](/articles/322016), and other types of seizures in response to an infection, stress, a stroke, or a head injury. However, people with epilepsy have more frequent seizures because they have a higher tendency to experience PDS. Some seizures can occur with no apparent trigger. Knowing about epilepsy can improve quality of life for people who have seizures and their families. Patient education [can help](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK100608/) - knowing what to expect - understanding why seizures happen and how their treatment works - recognizing and managing triggers - establishing an individual treatment plan by working with healthcare professionals - talking with friends and others about epilepsy and helping reduce stigma in communities The authors of [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6188960/) Some of the ingredients in essential oils can cross the blood-brain barrier, which means that they may be either helpful or harmful, depending on the substance. Oils that may help If an essential oil contains ingredients that can help a person sleep or reduce stress, it may help prevent seizures by alleviating certain triggers. According to a [2019 review](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2019/6216745/), oils from plants belonging to the Cymbopogon family (which includes [lemongrass](/articles/325209) and citronella) and the Acorus family (which includes sweet flag) may have this property. Lavender may help people relax, is likely safe for people with epilepsy to use, and may also have anticonvulsant properties. However, these are not a substitute for antiepileptic drugs, and more studies are needed to confirm that they are safe and effective for managing epilepsy. People should always speak with a doctor before using them. Oils to avoid [Some scientists](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2019/6829428/) note that camphor and eucalyptus may trigger seizures in people with epilepsy. For this reason, they warn against using these oils. Some oils contain a substance called thujone, which can trigger seizures. Such oils include: - sage - hyssop - rosemary - pennyroyal - cedar - thuja - fennel It is not always possible to know exactly which ingredients an essential oil product contains. Even a pure oil can contain a range of chemicals, not all of which may be beneficial. It is essential to seek advice from a qualified practitioner who knows about the interaction between essential oils and epilepsy before using any such product and to learn about the most appropriate way of using the oils. [What does aromatherapy involve, and are there any risks? Find out here.](/articles/10884) Although research suggests that essential oils may have some health benefits, it is important to remember that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not monitor or regulate the purity or quality of these. A person should talk with a healthcare professional before using essential oils, and they should be sure to research the quality of a brand's products. A person should always do a [patch test](/articles/patch-test-skincare) before trying a new essential oil. Around the world, [many people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6188960/) There is some evidence to suggest that [yoga](/articles/286745), prayer, and other faith-based activities can [help reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6480109/) However, epilepsy is a neurological condition with physical causes. For those with access to medical help, faith-based healing can offer a complementary approach, but it is not an alternative to medical treatment. More work is needed worldwide to bring practical medical help to people with epilepsy in countries where many people have a low income. People have used traditional Chinese medicine to treat epilepsy for thousands of years. Such techniques include the use of herbs and supplements and the manipulation of pressure points, such as through acupuncture. Some experts say that combining specific herbs in particular ways \u2014 such as Gastrodia elata and Uncaria rhynchophylla, which people often use together to help treat neurological conditions \u2014 may affect the balance of neurotransmitters. One [2021 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8284486/) Anyone who is considering using traditional Chinese medicine as a complementary therapy should speak with a doctor first, as there may be a risk of interactions between drugs. For many alternative and natural remedies, there is some research and anecdotal evidence to support their use. However, there are not enough scientific studies to prove that they work. For those who have access to medical care, it is best to start by visiting a doctor. [Two-thirds](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/about/faq.htm) Those who are keen to try natural and alternative remedies should speak with a doctor about the options to check that they are safe to use. Epilepsy is a complex condition, and there are many types. The doctor can help make a plan that suits the individual. Epilepsy can occur for many reasons, some of which are genetic. However, epilepsy can also develop following a head injury and some types of infections. Although it is not always possible to prevent epilepsy, the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/preventing-epilepsy.htm) - taking care to avoid [traumatic brain injury](/articles/179837), such as by wearing protective headgear when cycling or playing contact sports - starting to reduce the risk of [heart disease](/articles/237191)and [stroke](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7624)early in life, such as through regular exercise - following the recommended vaccination schedules to prevent infections that may increase the risk of epilepsy - following hand-washing guidelines to reduce the risk of cysticercosis, which is a parasitic infection that can result in epilepsy - following all guidelines for staying healthy during pregnancy to prevent the risk to a fetus Around the world, complementary, alternative, and non-drug remedies for epilepsy range from learning as much as possible about the condition to herbal remedies and faith healing. Some of these have research to support their use, but others may not be effective. Some, such as misusing herbal remedies, may even be dangerous. Most importantly, people should always talk with a doctor before trying natural treatments to help ease their symptoms. "}
