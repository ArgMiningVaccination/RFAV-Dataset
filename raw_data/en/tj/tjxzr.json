The United States National Herbarium, which was founded by the Smithsonian Institution, was transferred in the year 1868 to the Department of Agriculture, and continued to be maintained by that Department until July 1, 1896, when it was returned to the official custody of the Smithsonian Institution. The Department of Agricul- ture, however, continued to publish the series of botanical reports entitled \" Contributions from the U. S, National Herbarium,'' begun in the year 1890, until, on July 1, 1902, the National Museum, in pursuance of an act of Congress, assumed responsibility for the pub- lication.

PHYSICAL FEATURES AND NATURAL HISTORY OF THE ISLAND, OF THK CHARACTER AND HISTORY OF ITS PEOPLE, AND OF THEIR AGRICULTURE By WILLIAM EDWIN SAFFORD * * * II WASHINGTON GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1 9 \u00b0 5 BULLETIN OF TIIE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM Issued Aprii- 8, 1905. PREFACE Mr. W. E. Safford, assistant botanist in the Department of Agri- culture, for several years availed himself of the opportunity afforded him as a lieutenant in the United States Navy to study and observe the useful plants of the Tropics. In addition to cruises in other parts of the world he visited, in 18SC, 1887, 1894, and 1899, Upolu and Tutuila of the Samoan group, and Oahu of the Hawaiian group; and from August, 1899, to August, 1900, he acted as assistant governor of the island of Guam. This paper has been prepared by Mr, Safford through the recent elaboration of notes and observations made in those years. While presented under the title \"The Useful Plants of Guam,\" it includes some reference, however brief, to every plant known to occur on that island, particular note being made of those which have been described from Guam by various writers as species new to sci- ence. It discusses the principal plants used for food, liber, oil, starch, sugar, and forage in the Pacific tropical islands recently acquired by the United States, and gives their common names not only in Guam but in the Philippine Islands, Samoa, Hawaii, and Porto Rico. The method of cultivating and propagating the more important species is treated in considerable detail, as is the preparation of their derivative products, such as arrowroot, copra, and cacao. The publication will be useful to the rapidly increasing number of American travelers and officers who wish to have in language of as little technicality as possi- ble information about the economic plants of the world; and while the author does not lay claim to more than a report on the island of Guam, much of the information he gives is applicable throughout the Tropics. Besides consulting the original narratives of travelers, Mr. Safford took advantage of his exceptional opportunities to study the archives of Guam, and his account of the discovery, early history, and explo- rations of the island, together with its climate, ethnology, and eco- nomic conditions, will afford the most comprehensive and authentic picture of Guam thus far published. The technical names of the plants have been critically scrutinized by Mr. W. F. Wight, also assistant botanist in the Department of 3 4 PREFACE Agriculture. The tii.sk has been a laborious one, far more laborious than the printed results suggest, but in the progress of the work its necessity has been amply demonstrated. The result is a substantial basis for the uniform designation of economic tropical plants in accord- ance with the system now followed by American botanists. Mr. vSafford is indebted to Dr. Barton W, Evermann, of the Bureau of Fisheries, for photographs Nos. 1, 20, 22, and 44, taken by Dr. Alfred G.

During a series of cruises 111 the Pacific Ocean the routine of my official duties was pleasantly broken by frequent excursions on shore for the purpose of collecting material for the United States National Museum, as well as for recreation. While sitting in native huts and while wading upon coral reefs, traversing forests and climbing moun- tains, I interested myself in taking notes on the languages and customs of the natives, their arts, medicines, food materials and the manner of preparing them, and the origin of their dyes, paints, fibers for fishing nets and lines, materials for mat making and thatching, woods used in constructing their houses and canoes, and gums and resins used in calking. In attempting to identify many of the plants entering into their economy, I felt the need of some popular work containing the com- mon names of the more important species in various island groups, together with their descriptions and the uses to which they are applied in various parts of the world, the methods of their cultivation, and the processes of preparing the commercial staples which they yield. Some information of this nature may be derived from accounts of mis- sionaries, travelers, and explorers, but our ship s library was woefully lacking in such works, and much of the information contained in the books which were available was incomplete and untrustworthy. Works of a scientific nature, such as the Botany of the Challenger Expedition, though discussing the geographical distribution of strand plants and the means of their dissemination, I found to contain only lists of names which were useful in comparing island floras, but did not serve in any way to identify the plants in which I was interested. Others, like Seemaim's Flora of Fiji, were too rare and expensive to be placed in the library of an ordinary man-of-war, and could be con- sulted only during visits to San Francisco or Honolulu. Moreover, 10 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. though frequent mention is made of the uses of plants in this work, the descriptions are 111 Latin, and the hook is not available lo the average lay student. H occurred to me, therefore, that a popular work on the useful plants of Polynesia would be welcome, and I set out accordingly to gather together such information as I could for this purpose. Many of the plants with which I became familiar 1 encoun- tered on widely separated shores. Some of them I found bearing the same name on islands whose inhabitants have had no intercommunica- tion within historic times. These and kindred facts opened up an alluring field of ethnological inquiry as to the origin and dispersal of the inhabitants of the myriads of islands which dot the Pacific, a sub- ject upon which I shall enter in an initial way during the course of this work.\" It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable assistance I have received in the preparation of this work from Mr. Frederick V. Coville, Botanist of the United States Department of Agriculture; Mr. O. F. Cook, Mr. Guy N. Collins, and Mr. F. L. Lew ton, of the office of tropical agriculture, aiul the late Mr. Henry K. Baum. 1 am indebted to Mr. Carl S. Scotield and Mr. Thomas IT, Kearnev for aid # and suggestions during its progress, and to Messrs. Lyster II. Dewey, Rodney H. True, and V. K. Chesnut for references relating to the fiber plants, medicinal plants, and poisonous plants included in my lists. Acknowledgments are also due to Dr. II. W. Wiley and M r. B. J. Howard, of the Bureau of Chemistry, Department of Agriculture, for investigations as to the cause of the acridity of the taro plant and for fine micro-photographs showing the raphides, or needles of oxalate of lime, found in its leaves; also for beautiful representations of extra- floral nectaries of Ricinus and Gossypium. For notes on the agriculture of the island I am indebted to Don Justo Dungca and Don Antonio Martinez, citizens of Guam, and for botanical material forwarded to me since my departure from the island to Rev. Jose Palomo and Mr. Atanasio T. Perez. In the determination of flowering plants I have been assisted by Mr, E. S. Steele and Mr. Philip Dowel 1, and of cryptogams by Mr. William L. Maxon, of the National Herbarium. In conclusion, I wish to express my thanks to Mr. E. S. Steele and Mr. F. L. Lewton for their great assistance in preparing this work for publication and in helping me to correct the proof sheets. In submitting it I venture to express the hope that it may fill a want not only of travelers and students of botany, but also of settlers on tropical islands and in other warm regions of the globe; and I trust that it may be of some use to merchants and manufacturers seeking new sources of tropical staples and raw materials. \u00ab See p. 116. SLANT) AND PEOPLE 11 GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION. Guam, the largest and most important of the group known as the Ijadrones or Marianne Islands, is situated in the Pacific Ocean about 1,200 miles east of the Philippines. The group forms a chain 420 miles long, extending from latitude 20 30' north, longitude 14% 46' east, to latitude '13'-' 14' north, longitude 14*2 31' east. Beginning at the north, the names of the islands are Fa nil Ion de Pajaros, Ivas Guahan.\" Guam is the only island belong- ing to the United States. The rest were sold by Spain to Germany at the close of the late war. The seat of the German Government is on the island of Saipan, where there is a colony of Caroline Islanders, besides a small population of Marianne natives. The islands are of volcanic origin and are fringed with coral reefs. In the southern members of the group there are no active volcanoes, but on several of the northern islands there are still a number of smok- ing craters. Guam and Samoa lie in corresponding latitudes on oppo- site sides of the equator, and their climates are much alike. Their flora and fauna have many features in common, and many of the plants used in the economy of the natives are the same. The inhabitants of the two groups, however, though both of the Oceanic race (allied to tho Malayan), belong to different grand divisions of it and have distinct languages and few traditions in common. Guam is consider- ably larger than Tutuila, the most important of the Samoan Islands owned by the United States, though its chief port, San Luis de Apra, can not be compared with Pango-Pango, our naval station in the South Pacific, and perhaps the finest harbor in the world. The advantage of Guam as a station for repairs and supplies is e vident, forming, as it does, a stopping place for vessels between Hawaii and the Philippines. Its strategic importance has been greatly enhanced since it has been made the landing place of the trans-Pacific cable, and the completion of the Panama Canal will make it still more valuable to our Government. The extreme length of the island from north-northeast to south- southwest is 29 statute miles. Its width is from 7 to 9 miles, narrow- ing at the middle to a neck only 4 miles across. On the northwest coast of this neck is situated Agana (Hagadna), the capital, a city of over 6,000 inhabitants. (PI. LXX.) The entire population of the island, according to the census of 1901, was 9,676/' For the pronunciation of vernacular names, see p. 170. {'This indicates the number of actual residents oil the iwland and doen not include visitors nor the Government forces of the United Staten stationed there* 12 TTSEFTTL PLANTS OF GTTAM HISTORICAL NOTICES. DISCOVERY OF GUAM AND ITS EARLY HISTORY. MAGELLAN, The island of Guam was discovered on March 6, 1521, by Magellan, after u passage of three months and twenty days from the strait which bears his name. An account of the privations and suffering of his crew, many of whom died on the way across the hitherto unexplored ocean, is graphically given by Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's historian. He describes how the expedition arrived at Guam with the crews suffering from scurvy and in a starving condition, having been com- pelled on the passage to eat rats and even the leather from off the standing rigging to keep soul and body together. In comparison with Magellan's feat of crossing the vast Pacific the first voyage of Columbus, from the Canary Islands to the West Indies, seems insig- nificant. The natives of Guam came out to meet the Spaniards in strange \"flying praos\" (canoes provided with outriggers and trian- gular sails of mats). The Spaniards had dropped anchor, furled their sails, and were about to land, when it was discovered that a small boat which rode astern of the flagship was missing. Suspecting the natives of having stolen it, Magellan himself went ashore at the head of a landing party of 40 armed men, burned 40 or 50 houses and many l>oate, and killed 7 or 8 natives, male and female. He then returned to his ship with the missing boat and immediately set sail, continuing his course to the westward. Before we went ashore [says Pigafetta] some of our people who were sick said to us that if we should kill any of the natives, whether man or woman, that we should bring on board their entrails, being ]>ersuaded that with the latter they would lie cured. When we wounded some of those islanders with arrows, which entered their bodies, they tried to draw forth the arrow now in one way and now in another, in the meantime regarding it with great astonishment, and thus did they who were wounded in the breast, and they died of it, which did not fail to cause us compassion. Seeing us take our departure then, they followed us with more than a hundred boats for more than a league. They approached our ships, showing us fish and feigning to wish to give them to us, but when we were near they east stones at us and fled. We passed under full sail among their boats, which, with greatest dexterity, avoided us. We saw among them some women who were weeping and tearing their hair, surely for their husbands killed by us. The natives did not fare much better at the hands of later visitors. Some of the early navigators enticed them on board and made slaves of them, so that they might man the pumps and keep the ships free from water.\" They were spoken of as \" infidels,\" to slay whom was no great sin; but if encounters took place between them and Europeans and a white man was killed, he was declared to have been murdered, a See Narrative of the Loaisa Expedition, 1520, Burney, Chron. Hist., vol. 1, p. 217. EARLY NAVIGATORS. 13 and his death was avenged by the burning of villages, boats, and boat- houses, and by killing men, women, and children.\" They were branded by their discoverers with the name of ladt'ontx (thieves) for stealing a boat and some bits of iron. The early navigators themselves did not hesitate to steal husbands from their wives and fathers from their children. PUTCH NAVHiATOUH. Among the Dutch who visited the island was Oliver van Noort, who touched at Guam in ItJOO on bis way from the South American coast to Manila. About 200 canoes came off to meet him, bringing fish, fruit, rice, fowls, and fresh water to exchange for iron. He was followed in 161(i by the Dutch admiral, Joris Spilbergen, in command of a fleet fitted out by the Dutch Company, which was on its way to the Moluccas by the westward route; and in 10'25 by the Nassau fleet, organized in Holland against Peru, and commanded by Jacob FHcre- mite. One hundred and fifty canoes came off to meet them, to traffic with coconuts and yams. The fleet watered at the island, and in exchange for iron procured rice, fowls, coconuts, yams, and bananas. Coconuts were observed in inexhaustible (jtmntities; rice was culti- vated in many places, and the natives sold it by weight in bales of seventy to eighty pounds each. The Hollanders considered it unsafe for their men to ramble about the island singly or unarmed. HAILING ROL'TES IX THE l'ACIFIt. Guam was reckoned seventy days from New Spain, as Mexico was then called. After the founding of Manila regular traffic, was estab- lished between the coast of Mexico and the Philippines. The first port selected as a place of departure on the Mexican coast wasNavidad, but Acapulco was substituted later. The vessels would leave Mexico each year in February or March, shaping their course a little to the south- ward until they reached the latitude of Guam, when they would con- tinue due west until tliev reached that island. This season was chosen in order to avoid the westerly monsoon in the Philippines, which usually sets in about the middle of June. The vessels returned by a northerly route in order to avoid the trade winds and the adverse equatorial current. lioth the Mariannes and the Philippines were made dependencies of New Spain and were ruled by the viceroy residing at the City of Mexico. JUSl'IT MISSION'ARIKS. On his way from New Spain to the Philippines in one of the regular vessels, Padre Diego Luis San vi tores, a Jesuit priest, touched at Guam and was moved to pity at the sight of the natives living in spiritual \u00ab See narrative of the ex{>e<liti\u00bb>ii under Miguel Lopnz Le^azpi, visited Guam W ln 1565t in Burney, Chron.

An account of his life and martyrdom is given in an old vellum-covered hook,\" in which much interesting information may he found concerning the natives of Guam. In it, in contrast with the barbarous cruelty with which the natives had been treated by visiting Europeans, one may read of their kindness to shipwrecked sailors cast upon their shores, and of the cordial reception of Padre Sanvitores. They provided homes for him and his companions and built for them a church. Ail wished to I Hi baptized forthwith, though the missionaries would at first baptize only the infants and dying persons; adults in good health had to be instructed in the Chris- tian doctrine before they could enjoy the privilege. In this book manv wonderful occurrences are related\u2014stories of supernatural apparitions, of miraculous cures of men possessed of the devil, of lances, east by the natives, suddenly arrested in mid-air, and of stones hurled from their slings crumbling harmlessly to dust; but it must not be forgotten that this was an age of marvels. The devil's influence in the affairs of everyday life was recognized throughout Christendom, and it is not surprising that it found its way to Guam. It was to the power of the evil one over the elements that the early missionaries attributed the adverse winds, which blew almost con- stantly to the westward and prevented ships from sailing directly to Guam from the Philippines. Sanvitores, \"the Apostle of the Mariannes,\"' was born in the city of Burgos, in northern Spain, November 1%, 1(527. The history of his life tells of his early boyhood, his call to the Society of Jesus and ordination, his work among the poor, his journey to Mexico; his departure from Acapuleo, April 5, 16(52, for Manila; the impression made upon him by the natives of Guam, whom he saw on his passage across the Pacific; his efforts to be sent to them as a missionary, the refusal of his superiors at Manila to grant his request, the King's decree ordering the governor of the Philippines to furnish him with the means of reaching the Mariannes, the building of the ship aSW DUyo at Cavite and his sailing therein to Acapuleo, his appeal for aid to the viceroy of Mexico, his arrival at Guam, March %, l(i6S, his emotion on seeing the islanders coming out to meet him, the kindness with which they welcomed him to their island, the zeal with which he pursued his work, the hardships which he had to endure, and his final martyrdom. The first serious stumbling block in the way of the missionaries was a Chinaman named Choco, living in the village of Paa, at the southern end of the island. This man had been shipwrecked about twenty years before their arrival, and had been kindly received by the natives. He pointed out to the islanders that many children and old people had died immediately after having been baptized. lie spoke slightingly of the padres, saying that they were people despised and looked down a Garcia, Vida y martyrio tie Sanvitores, 16H3.

WAR OF EXTERMINATION. 15 upon by the Spaniards themselves, who for that reason had wont them into exile on this island: and he said that surely the water used in 7 f baptism was poisonous, though some of the more robust upon whom it was poured might resist its effects. As it was indeed true that many of those baptized had died shortly after the performance of the rite, and as the missionaries thought them happy in dying thus secure of salvation, it seemed to the natives that there might be truth in the Chinaman's charges. Henceforward, instead of receiving the mission- aries joyfully in their villages and retaining them as guests almost against their will, the natives greeted them with scowling faces, and, calling them murderers, threatened them with their spears. They no longer offered them breadfruit, as had been their custom, and mothers on their approach would catch up their infants and fly with them to the woods for safety; or if the little ones were sick or dying, they would conceal them in their houses as best they could.\" In their zeal the missionaries would often baptize children in spite of the threats of the fathers and the tears and prayers of the mothers. Moreover, they awakened the enmity of the w/rti'rtAww*, or wise men, whom they declared to be impostors; they assailed the liberty of the urritaox, or bachelors, by their efforts to abolish the u great houses \" of the villages, in which they lived with unmarried women; they tried to change the marriage customs, according to which the parents received presents from the bridegrooms for their daughters; they tried to put an end to the invo- cation of the (initi, or spirits, and taught that it was wrong to venerate the relics of ancestors. Less than two years after the arrival of the missionaries in the islands, 011 January 2JJ, 1070, a priest was killed on the island of Saipan for having baptized a child in spite of the protests of its parents;* and on April 2, 1(5752, in Guam, Padre Sanvitores met his death in the same way.

A war of extermination now began, which lasted twenty-throe years. n r ^ suspended from time to time when the Spaniards found themselves too weak to continue it, but resumed at the arrival of each ship bring- ing reinforcements, no matter whether in the meantime peace with the natives had been declared or not. Often whole villages were punished for the act of a single man, and innocent natives who had committed no crime whatever were shot down wantonly/ Much did the evangelical ministers regret these excesses of the fervors of the new soldiers [says Padre Garcia], which, with the luck of experience and too great desire to make themselves feared, placed in jeopardy all Christianity; for the Indians retired from their villages t<> others more distant from Agadfia, and it was feared with reason that the whole inland would form a confederation against the Spaniards a Garcia, op. eit., p. 224.

Padrt; Solano, calling together the soldiers of the post, declared to them that though arms used in their proper time and season were the defense of that Chris- tianity, yet wielded intenipestively they would be its destruction, since they would not only irritate with reason the Indians, hut would become unworthy of the favor of the Lord, without which what could twenty or thirty men do against thirty thou- sand? For thus far only the barlwrians' dread of firearniH had protected the mission, and if this were lost the multitude could not Iks withstood. That they would lose this dread with their constant use, even at the price of injuries to themselves, and if they once rushed upon the arms they might seize them, and with these in their pos- session ottr defense would be converted into our injury, lie charged the soldiers very particularly that in the southern part of the island, where the only villages were in which the missions were unhampered, they should akstain from all hostility, so as not to hinder the only harvest which at that season could Ix; gleaned, and not tn make enemies of those whom they now held as friends. The soldier* approved the discourse and promised to con line themselves within the limits of justice and prudence.\" It is not the province of these notes to give a detailed account of the uprisings of the natives and the methods taken )>y the various gov- ernors and military commanders to quell them. The yearly reports of the missionaries tell of the flight of the natives from island to island, pursued by their conquerors, whose arquebuses and arrows they resisted with their simple slings and spears as best they could, and of their reconcentration on the island of Guam, where they were stricken by an epidemic which almost exterminated them. Moreover [says one of these writers],& this diminution was caused greatly by the repugnance with which they bore a foreign yoke\u2014lovers ever of all the latitude which their primitive freedom permitted them\u2014and this burden weighed so heavily upon their haughtiness, laziness, and barbarity that some even sacrificed their lives in despair; and some women either purposely sterilized themselves or cast into the waters their new-born infants, believing them happy to die thus early, saved from the toils of a life gloomy, painful, and miserable. In all the dominions of Spain there is no nation more free from burdens, since they pay no tribute to the King\u2014a common custom in all nations\u2014nor do thev give to the church the fees which are given throughout Christendom; but, as they see not what the rest suffer, they judge that subjection is the worst misery of the world. EKUI.ISEI PIRATES. Two years after the publication of Padre Garcia's account of the island, on March 15, 1685, the English pirates, Eaton and Cow ley, anchored at Guam. Thev found the governor, Don Damian Esplana, in a state of uneasiness owing to the hostile attitude of the natives, who, under a chief named Yura, had risen against the Spaniards less than a year before, had wounded the governor and killed several mis- sionaries and a number of soldiers. Cowlev describes in narrative \"Garcia, Gen., Tomo VII, p. 348, 1788-92. DAMPIER. 17 how the ship was received by the natives, who brought thorn \"pota- toes, mananoes, coconuts, and plantains, selling thetn to us for old nails and old iron. But they being treacherous, we trusted them not; for we had always our small arms ready, and great guns loaden with round ball and cartridges. Sometimes we would have our dock full with these infidels; but we were always in arms, having our swords and pistols by our sides, with some Centinels standing abaft before them.\" Some of the Englishmen having gone fishing with the natives, the latter surrounded the boat by a seine, as though to draw it ashore together with its crew. The bucaneers in the boats being provided with firearms\u2014 let go in amongst the thickest of them and killed a great many of their number, while the others, seeing their ma ten fall, ran away. Our other men which were on ehoar meeting them, saluted them also by making Holes in their Hides. We took our Boat immediately thereupon, and went on board, most of our well men being on ehoar, and seeing many of these Infidels' boats lie along our ship's side, did not know what design they might have on board [against] our sick men; but as it fell out, they were Boats which came from the governor, with more presents for our refreshment. * * * We took four of these infidels Prisoners, and brought them on board, binding their hands Whind them; but they had not been long there, when three of them leajH'd over board into the sea, swimming away from the ship with their hands tied behind them. However, we sent the boat after them, and found a strong man at the lirst Blow could not penetrate their skins with a cut! ace: One of them had received, in my judgment, 40 shots in his body before he died; and the last of the tliree that was killed, had swam a good Knglish mile iirwt, not only with his Hands behind him, as before, but also with his Arms pinion'd. The governor gave carte blanche to the pirates to kill as many natives as they pleased and even rewarded them with presents of hogs, pumpkins, green stuff, ''potatoes,1* and rice; after which they saluted him with three guns and sailed away.\" DA.MPIEI-t's VISIT. The following year, on May iiO, 1G?>G, Captain Swan arrived at Guam, accompanied by Danipier,6 who gives in the first volume of his voyages an excellent account of the island, its products, the inhabitants, and their wonderful canoes, which he \"did believe to sail the best of any Boats in the World.\" Under the above date he writes as follows: At 4 a Clock, to our great Joy, we saw the Island Guam, at about S leagues dis- tance. It was well for Captain Strati that we got sight of it before our Provision was spent, of which we had but enough fordays more; for, as I was afterwards informed, the Men had contrived, lirst to kill Captain Stntn and eat him when the Vituals was gone, and after him all of us who were accessary in promoting the undertaking this Voyage. Thin made Captain Swan say to me after our arrival at Guam, Ah! Dam pier, yoft tniuld hate made them but a poor Meal; for I was as lean as the Captain was lusty and fleshy.

Dampier's accurate descriptions of the breadfruit and the coconut are given further on, in the Alphabetical list of useful planks, under the headings Artoearpus cow man is and Coco# nucifern. Of the bread- fruit he savs:a I did never see of this Fruit anv where but here. The Natives told us, that there V * is plenty of this Fruitgrowing oil the rest of the SAuirone Islands; but I did never hear of it anywhere else. And of the coconuts he says:'' These at Guam grow in dry ground, are of a middle size, and I think the sweetest that I did ever taste. Dampier relates that when the natives were repulsed by the Span- iards in the recent uprising they destroyed the plantations and stock, and those implicated in the conspiracy then went to other islands. As for the remaining ones, if they were not actually concerned in that broil, yet their hearts were also bent against the Spaniards, for they offered to carry the Englishmen to the fort and assist them in the con- quest of the island; but Captain Swan was not for molesting the Span- iards here, as it was to his interest to use the island as a base for supplies. At this time there were at Guam only the governor, twenty or thirty Spanish soldiers, and two or three priests. Captain Swan detained a priest who came off to visit his ship, and requested him to write a letter to the governor stating that the English had come to the island not in any hostile manner, but as friends to purchase with their money what they wanted. Me sent a present to the governor of 4 yards of scarlet cloth and a piece of silver and gold lace. The governor replied to the letter at once, complimenting Cap- tain Swan for his present and promising as much provision as he could possibly spare. As a token of his gratitude he sent a present of 6 Hogs of a small sort, most excel- lent Meat, the best I think that ever I eat [says Dampier]. They are fed with Coco- nuts, and their flesh is hard as Brisket Reef. They were doubtless of that breed in America which came originally from Spain. lie sent also 12 Musk melons, larger than ours in England, and as many Water-melons, both sorts here being a very excellent Fruit; and sent an order to the Indians that lived in a Village not far from our Ship, to bake every day as much of the Bread-fruit as we did desire, and to assist us in getting as many dry Coco nuts as we would have; which they accordingly did, and brought off the Bread-fruit every day hot, as much as we could eat. After this the Govemour sent every day a Canoa or two with Hogs and Fruit, and desired for the same Powder, Shot, and Arms; which was sent according to his request. * * * The 30th day of May, the Govemour sent his last Present, which was some Hogs, a Jar of pickled Mangoes, a Jar of excellent pickled Fish, and a Jar of fine Rusk, or Bread of fine Wheat Flower, baked like Bisket, but not so hard. He sent besides, 6 or 7 packs of Rice, desiring to be excused from sending any more Provision to us, saying he had no more on the Island that he could spare. He sent word also, that the West Monsoon was at hand, that therefore it behooved us to lie jogging from \u00abA new Voyage Round the World, p. 297, 1717. &Op. cit., p. 290.

Then we prepared to be gone, being pretty welt furnished with Provision to carry us to ifindamo, where we designed next to touch. We took aboard as many Coco-nuts as we could well stow, and we had a good stock of Rice, and about 50 Ilogs in salt.\" WOO n KM ERS. On March 11, 1710, the celebrated English privateer Woodcs Rogers arrived at Guam, accompanied by Alexander Selkirk, whom he had recently rescued from the island of Juan Fernandez, in the South Pacific. The English were in pretty bad condition. Their provisions were nearly exhausted, and many of them were sick and suffering from wounds received in battle with the Spaniards on the American coast. Rogers had with him a prize, X>i<'xtr<<- Senont de la bicarnaeioft, the name of which he had changed to the Batchelor Frigate, lie car- ried with him considerable booty in the form of money, jewels, and fabrics taken from the natives of Guayaquil and other Spanish-Ameri- can tosvns recently sacked by him, and among his prisoners were sev- eral officers of the recently captured prize. To the governor of Guam (Don Antonio Pimentel) Rogers and his associates wrote the following letter: Sin: We being Servants of her Majesty of Great Britain, and stopping at these Islands on our Way to the East Indies, will not molest the settlement; provided you deal fairly with us. We will pay for whatever Provisions and Refreshments you have to spare, in such manner as best agrees with your Conveniency, either in Money or any Necessaries you want. But if after this civil Request you deny us, and do not act like a Man of Honour, you may immediately expect such Military Treatment, as we are with ease able to give you. This we thought (it to confirm under our Hands, recommending to you our Friendship and kind Treatment, which we hope you'll esteem, and assure yourself we then shall be with the strictest Honour Your friends and humble Servants, W. Rogers. S. Courtney. E. Cooke. To the Honourable Governor OF the Island ok Guam. March 23, 1709 (1710). As the governor had no adequate means of resisting the English, he supplied them with provisions. Courtesies were interchanged, the Spaniards entertaining the English on shore and accepting their invi- tation to entertainments on board the ships. Rogers presented to the governor two negro boys ''dressed in liveries,\" 20 yards scarlet cloth- serge, and (*> pieces of cambric, \"wh^ch he seemed wonderfully well pleased with.'1 The ships were supplied with <i0 hogs, 99 fowls, 24 \"Op. cit., pp. 301-304. 20 ITSKFUL 1'LANTS OK GUAM. baskets of Indian corn, 11 bags of rice, 44 baskets- of yams, and 800 coconuts. Fourteen bullocks, described as \"small anil lean,'1 were dis- tributed among the ships, and each ship was given \"2 cows and calves. The English took receipts from the Spanish for their presents, and gave to them certificates \"to show to any English that they had parted friendly.\" They sent ashore an old Spaniard whom they held as prisoner and got a receipt for him. In Woodes Rogers's Narrative he gives the population of the islands and various other data. Among the fruits were oranges, lemons, cit- rons, muskmelons, and watermelons, which were brought hither by the Spaniards. The orange trees were thriving well. Cattle were plenty, but were small and poor. Much indigo was seen growing wild and not utilized. Money was scarce. The 200 soldiers were paid once a year in money brought from Manila, the ship bringing their pay carrying also clothing, sugar, rice, and liquors. These articles being sold on the island, the ship usually returned to Manila with most of the money she had brought. On this account the natives were plant- ing rice and making other improvements in their agriculture. The hogs were described as \" the best pork in the world, because they are fed altogether on coconuts and breadfruit, which are plentiful here/' The Spaniards were marrying with the natives. The Indians are described as tall, strong, and dark-colored, the men wearing no cloth- ing but a breech clout and the women wearing little petticoats. The natives were skillful in slinging stones, which they made of clay, of an oval form, burning them till as hard as marble. They were such good marksmen that the Spaniards said they seldom missed hitting any mark, throwing a projectile with such force as to kill a man at a considerable distance. Thcv also had lances, made of coconut wood. W * One of the flying praos of the natives was presented by the governor to Woodes Rogers, who gives a detailed description of it in his Narrative.\" The governor of Guam, Don Antonio Pimentel, was afterwards tried by the Spanish authorities for giving aid and comfort to the English, A copy of the proceedings now in the archives at Agana, dated 1720, is marked \"Causa formada en virtud de Real provision a Don Juan Pimentel, Grobernador de estas is las Marianas, sobre la Nao Almiranta Nu&stra de la carrera de Acapulco.\"' ANSON. Among the other travelers to visit the Marianne Islands was Anson, the famous circumnavigator, who stopped at Tinian for repairs in 1742, the same year that he captured the treasure-laden galleon from \"See Woodes Kogere's Narrative, 1712, EXPULSION OF THE JESUITS. 21 Aeapulco, on which was found the chart containing, as far as is known, the first indication of the existence of the Hawaiian Islands.\" Anson had been sent from England in 1740 to annoy the Spaniards in the South Seas. After having lost most of his men from scurvy, lie crossed the Pacific in the only remaining ship out of his squadron of eight vessels, the Centurion. He found the island of Tinlan nearlv n \" * deserted and overrun with wild cattle and wild hogs. He gives a glowing account of the beauty of f he island, but this was declared by Byron, who afterwards visited the island, to be overdrawn. ])K PACES. In 1768 Guam was visited by the French traveler, De Pages, who was a passenger on the galleon that brought Don Enrique de Olavide y Miehelena. Don Enrique was about to begin a second term as gov- ernor of the Mariannes, relieving Don Jose de Soroa. In De Pages's narrative6 he gives a vivid account of his trip from Aeapulco to Guam, describing the conditions on board the galleon, the character of the passengers and cargo, the courses steered, and the weather encountered: At Guam he saw the breadfruit for the first time, and lie speaks of the habit of betel chewing, to which the natives were addicted, describing the areca nut and the betel pepper. As an illus- tration of the isolated state of Guam, he states that it had been eight years since a vessel from Manila had touched at the island. EXPULSION OK THE JESUITS. A year after the arrival of Olavide the Jesuit missionaries were expelled from the Mariannes by the edict of the King of Spain, Carlos III, dated February 27, 1707. It was this King who joined France in sending assistance to the American colonies during their struggle for independence. The Jesuits had been in the islands for a century, and whatever may have been the harsh means by which they were established there, they had won the love and confidence of the natives, and were kind and just in their dealings with them, protecting them when necessary against acts of cruelty, injustice, and oppression on the part of the military authorities/'and never exacting services from them without due compensation. A school for the education of native children had been established shortly after the death of Padre Sanvi- tores under the name of \"Colegio de San Juan de Letran,\" and had been endowed with a fund yielding 3,000 pesos a year by Maria Anna '\u00abSee Lord Anson's Voyage Round the World, 1748. & De Pages, Travels Round the World (English translation), 1791. c Among the official papers in the archives at Agafia are the proceedings of several \" residencias/' or courts of inquiry, held at Agafia for the trial of governors and officers composing their staff. Jn these trials the padres represented the interests of natives who might have cause for complaint against the authorities.

They also instructed the native youths in music, as is shown by the inventory of their effects and the testi- mony of travelers visiting the island shortly after their expulsion. They hud several farms in flourishing condition, the finest of which was that of Tachogna, in the interior of Guam, between Agana and Pago, On this farm, called San Ignaeio de Tachogna,they had a fine herd of cattle, and elsewhere they had a stallion and a number of T V brood marcs. They were in constant communication with missions of their order in other countries, receiving fabrics from New Spain as well as from China and Manila, spices from Ceylon, and tobacco from Mexico. Under their supervision the natives learned to cultivate maize, tobacco, cacao, sweet potatoes, and other plants brought from America, and in the inventories, besides a supply of garden imple- ments called \"fosinos\" (thrust hoes), new machetes for clearing the forest, and other implements, were found steel, iron, and blacksmith's tools, tan hark and vats for tanning, carpenters' tools, saws, crow- bars, pickaxes, paints, stones for grinding pigments, \"nictates\" and umanos,\" like those of the Mexicans for converting maize into tor- tillas, and material and instruments for making ornaments for their altars. The young lieutenant of the armada who brought the order for their expulsion had been instructed to take away in his schooner the Jesuits, together with all their belongings. Realizing that this would be impossible, he made an official statement in writing to the governor, saying that his little schooner, with a single deck, could not accomplish the task; that it would require several two-decked vessels much larger than his own to take away all the belongings of the Fathers. Nevertheless, on November 2, 17M, the schooner Xuratra Smora de Guadalupe, which had brought the decree of banishment, sailed away from Guam, carrying the Fathers, together with as many of their personal effects as possible. Many of their papers were burned. In the inventory of their effects in the archives at Agana is r> a list of letters, copies of memorials, manuscript sermons, and books. Even the lay brother in the kitchen, who acted as procurador, had a library of his own. On the arrival of the decree the senior of the missionaries, Padre Xavier Stengel, was absent, having gone to the neighboring island of liota to hear confessions and administer the annual communion to the natives. A canoe was sent to brinir him. O As one of the Fathers had died sometime before the arrival of the decree, it was necessary to carry back a certified statement of his death and burial to account for his not sailing with the others. After the Jesuits' departure the farms were neglected, the cattle, now the property of the Crown, ran wild, and many animals were killed by the natives, as may be seen in the records of trials in the ADMINISTRATION OF TOBIAS 23 archives. The .spiritual administration of the islands was handed over to friars of the order of St. Augustine, who had come as passengers on the schooner bringing the decree. This religious order continued on the island until its seizure by the United States. V crozet's visit. The next governor of the Mariannes, Don Mariano Tobias, has been immortalized by the Abbe Raynal in his Ilistoire et politique des 6tah- lissements commerce des Europeens dans Ies deux Indes. Raynal hated the tyranny and injustice with which primitive nations were so often treated, and believed that the rights of individuals should be considered even though their skins might be brown and their clothing scant. He called attention to glaring acts of cruelty and oppression perpetrated by European nations upon the natives of newly colonized countries. In consequence of his bold accusations his book was condemned to be burned (May 20, 1781), and he was obliged to fly from France. An interesting account of the island during Tobias's administration is given by Crozet, who visited Guam September 27, 177%/' Crozet was an officer of the expedition of the French navigator Mario n- Dufresne, which left Mauritius on a voyage of discovery in the South Seas. On June 8, 1772, Marion was killed and eaten by natives of New Zealand by whom he and his men had been invited ashore to a feast. The Chevalier du Clesmeur, who commanded one of the vessels, left seeds of a number of useful plants at Guam. Among them were those of Cttjan cajmi, which has ever since been called \"lenteja francesa\" by the natives. Crozet describes the breadfruit tree, the manner of its propagation by cuttings, and the preparation of its fruit for food. He noticed that cattle arc verv fond of its leaves. lie speaks of the edible chestnut-like seeds of the '\"dugdug,\" or fertile breadfruit, and mentions the principal fruits growing on the island. Guavas already formed thickets in open places. The indigenous capers growing near the sea attracted him by the beauty and fragrance of their flowers. They had already been transplanted to the Philippines. Provisions were so plentiful that it was not necessary to fish, though the French sailors caught some fresh-water fishes, including eels, in the streams of the island. These were held in less esteem by the natives than salt-water fish. Crozet savs that Tobias had stimulated the natives to cultivate their fields, which they had neglected owing to the importation of breadstuIt for the missionaries and garrison by the galleons from Mexico. He attributes the introduction of the cultiva- tion of maize, rice, sugar cane, and other useful plants to Tobias, who also planted avenues of coconut palms and breadfruit trees four deep \"Nouveau Yoya^i\\ Sw List works. 24 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM along the- beach and around the town, making Agafia an enchanting place. Crozet is undoubtedly wrong in his statement as to the intro- duction of many of these plants. It is certain that maize was culti- vated in Guam as early as 10TB, nearly a hundred years }>efore Tobias's time; for Padre Garcia states that the natives in that year destroyed the maize plantation, which was the principal sustenance of the missionaries and the soldiers.\" Rice and sugar cane were cultivated by the aborigines before the advent of the Spaniards, Many of the improvements attributed by Crozet to Tobias were due to the Jesuits, though it is undoubtedly true that he encouraged agriculture and other useful arts, and in all probability introduced domestic animals, as well as the deer which now overrun the island. What the Jesuits did for the island is shown bv the documentary evidence left behind them. i * Crozet speaks of the use of cattle for draft animals, and says that then, as now, they were ridden like horses and that each family of 7 k i-- natives had several riding beasts. La Perouse, who visited Manila in 1787, has given the following account of Tobias s subsequent misfortunes: I saw at Manila that, virtuous and upright fjoverimr of the Ladrones, M. Tobias, who, unhappily for liin repose, bus been too much celebrated by Abbe Ray mil. I .saw him persecuted by the monks, who, representing him as a wretch desti- tute of piety, have alienated the affections of bin wife, who has even demanded to be separated from him, that she might not live with a reputed reprobate, and all the fanatics have applauded her resolution. M. Tobias is the lieutenant-colonel of the regiment which forms the garrison of Manila, and is known to be the beet officer in the country, yet the governor has ordered that his appointments, which are con- siderable, should be paid to thin pious wife, leaving him only $26 a month for his own subsistence and that of his son. This brave soldier, reduced to desperation, was waiting for a pro]>er opportunity to (juit the colony in order to obtain justice. & It is interesting to read Crozet's description of Agana as it was in l87ii, six years before the rediscovery of the Hawaiian Islands hy Cap- tain Cook.

THADDAEUS HAENKE. 25 SCIKKTIFir HX l*KDITK)PC. In February, 1702, Guam was visited by Alessandro Malaspina, in command of the corvettes Atrevidn and which had been sent by Carlos IV, King- of Spain, on a voyage of scientific investiga- tion. Attached to his expedition as naturalists were Thaddaetis I laenke and Luis Nee, who were the first to make systematic botanical collec- tions on the island. Thev were also the first botanists to visit Cali- fornia, having the preceding year collected in the vicinity of San Diego and Monterey.\" The story of Haenkc's adventures while attempting to join Mala- spina is told both in the official narrative of the expedition and in the preface to Presl's Reliquiae Haenkcamc. Haenke was a Bohemian by birth. He received his botanical education from Jacquin, who for a time was professor of chemistry and botany in Vienna, and upon his recommendation was appointed botanist of the expedition by the King of Spain. Although he set out for Cadiz immediately on receiving his appointment, he reached that port only to find that the two cor- vettes had just set sail (July 30, 1789). Following them in the first vessel bound for Montevideo, he suffered shipwreck on one of the numerous shoals at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, losing nearly all his books, papers, and effects. He succeeded in reaching shore, how- ever, with his Linmeus and a collecting outfit, but he found that the expedition had already sailed. Knowing that it was to stop on the coast of Chile, he set out at once on foot, crossing the Pampas of Argentina and the Chilean cord ill era of the Andes, collecting and drying plants on the way.'' On reaching Santiago, Chile, to his great joy he found there Malaspina and a number of his officers, who had left their ships at anchor in the harbor of Valparaiso to pay an official visit to the capital. He immediately reported for duty and was assigned to the J)emubierta. The expedition skirted the coasts of South America, Mexico, and North America as far as Port Mulgiave, which is situated in Yakutat Bay, southern Alaska. Their exploration of the latter region is com- memorated by the name of the celebrated Malaspina Glacier. Return- ing to Mexico, Haenke went alone on a collecting tour from Acapuleo to Mexico City and back. Leaving Acapuleo on December 21, 1701, the expedition sailed for Guam, coming to anchor on February 1%, \u00abSee Brewer, in Ueolojrical Survey of California, Botany, vol. 2, p. 553, 1880. b \" Con un wnladoro carar- tenzadaa/' Official narrative, p.

Ilaenke proceeded to Agafia and the northern part of the island, Nee to the hills near Umata, each making collections of plants. Don Antonio Pineda, who shortly afterwards lost his life in the Philippines, occupied himself with the geology and zoology of the island. The governor, Lieut. Col. Don Jose Arlegui, offered them every facility for carrying on their work. Don .Juan Rave net made sketches of a couple of the natives and of a native of the Caroline Islands, between which group and Guam a regular traffic had existed since 1788. The expedition set sail at daylight on the morning of February 24. A few plants were collected on Tinian, one of the northern islands, but the bulk of the collection from the Mariannes was made on the island of Guam. From Guam the expedition sailed for Cape Espiritu Santo, island of Samar, in the Philippine group. From the Philippines it proceeded to Botany Bay, and thence to the Societv Islands. Returning to the Peruvian j t rj coast, the expedition received news of the French Revolution and of the declaration of war with France. The botanists separated. Ncc left the Atreoida- on the coast of Chile and proceeded overland, stop- ping at Talcahuano, Concept'ion, and Santiago, and thence by way of the cordillera del Valle to Mendoza and over the pampas to Buenos Ay res. He rejoined the expedition May 10. Haenke crossed the Peruvian Andes to Tarma and visited the region about Huanuco, at the headwaters of the Rio Huallaga, a tributary of the Marafion. With the approval of the viceroy of Peru, it was decided that he should proceed across the continent to Buenos Ayres by way of Iluancavelica, Ayacucho, Cuzco, and Potosi (situated in what is now Bolivian territory), occupying himself on the way with botany, zoology, and mineralogy, and a soldier named Geronimo Arcangel was detailed to accompany him. Letters were received from him from Cuzco and Areqnipa reporting the progress of his explorations and stating that he expected to reach Montevideo the early part of the following year. The expedition, however, was suddenly ordered home on account of the war, and Haenke remained in South America, collecting extensively in the interior of what is now Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. In 1790 he established himself at Cochabamba, a city beautifully situated on the fertile plateau watered by the tributaries of the Rio Grande, now the chief agricultural and industrial center of Bolivia. Here he estab- lish ed a botanical garden, gave medical assistance to his neighbors, and occupied himself with the study of natural science, making repeated excursions throughout the territory of what is now Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. Alcide d'Orbigny, in his paper on the genus Vic- toria, tells of meeting in his travels in South America with a Spanish missionary, Padre Lacueva, who had accompanied Haenke on one of his expeditions. The padre related an incident which illustrates in a COLLECTIONS OF HAENKE AND NEE. 27 most touching manner the enthusiasm which was characteristic of the collector and observer. While they were navigating the Rio Mamore in a canoe they discovered in a marsh bordering the river a plant so marvelously beautiful that Ilaenke fell upon his knees in worship, offering to the Author of so magnificent a creation a prayer of grateful homage. He insisted on stopping and camping at this place and left it with the greatest reluctance.\" This was about the year 1801. The plant was in all probtihility the magnificent water lily afterwards described as Victoria amaz<mica. Ilaenke looked forward to returning some day to Europe, but he was accidentally poisoned and died at Cochabama in 1817. Only a small proportion of his herbarium reached Europe, the greatest part having been sent by the authorities to Lima, where it was lost. About 9,000 plants collected on the Malaspina expedition w ere sent, according to his wish, to the National Museum of Bohemia, at Prague. Others found their way to the Royal Garden at Madrid, with those of Nee, Duplicates of these were sent to the University of Prague and the Musee Palatin at Vienna, and about-700 species to the Royal Herbarium at Munich.

A part of the narrative is said to have been published in the A nates Ilidrograticou in 1871, but no such publication can be found in the official list. The narrative, much abridged, finally appeared in 1KS5, seventy-six years after the death of the brave and unfortunate navigator.\" For the most part it consists of bare statements of facts, resembling a log book, and has few descriptions and little detailed information concern- ing the countries visited. A satisfactory history of this important expedition still remains to be written. ROM AN/OFF EXPEDITION. On the evening of November 24, 1817, the brig Rurih, fitted out at the expense of the chancellor of the Russian Empire, Count Roman - zoff, for the purpose of scientific exploration, and commanded by Otto von Kotzebue, a lieutenant in the Russian navy, came to anchor in the harbor of San Luis de Apia. Attached to her were the botanist Adelbert von Chamisso; Owing to the shortness of the JhtriFx stay at Guam it was not possible to make extensive collections. Chamisso. however, got much interesting and valuable information while on the island from the Sargento Mayor Don Luis de Torres. To botanists, Eschscholtz's name is chiefly associated with the beautiful \"California!! poppy\" (Eschscholtzia), named in his honor by Chamisso. The narrative of the expedition was published by Kotzebue, under the title of \"A Voyage of Discovery into the South Sea and Rehring's Straits,\" etc/' This narrative, which embodies Chamisso's observa- tions, is filled with errors and misstatements. It was miserably \" done into English\" by a translator who \"joined to a style at once bald and incorrect a deplorable ignorance of his subject; hence the work abounds in errors of the grossest kind. Chamisso, wishing to cor- rect them, made out a list of errata, but no attention whatever was paid to him. He accordingly published his notes and journal inde- pendently, under the titles of \" Bemerkungen und Ansichten,\" and \"Tagebuch,\" in the former of which he gives comparative vocabu- laries of the languages of Guam, Yap, Ulea, and Radak/ In these two works a most charming personality is revealed. Cha- misso's love of nature was equaled by his love for his fellow-man.

He was mueh moved by the sad havoc wrought by the Spaniards in the Marianne Islands, and repeated the story of persecution and cruelty accompany- ing the \"reduction\" of the natives as related by the Spaniards themselves.\" From the statement published by Kotzebue that the natives of Guam had been exterminated by the Spaniards a wrong1 impression has gone abroad. The facts are presented under the head of \"The modern inhabitants,\" below.b The plants collected by the Roman zo# expedition were deposited in the Imperial Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg. Duplicates were sent to the Hooker Herbarium, at Kew, England, and to the Univer- sity of Kiel, Germany. A number of the plants were described by Chamisso and Schlechtendal in the journal Lin mm, the series beginning with the first paper of the first volume/ In the introduction to this paper, Chamisso, in he describes him as a young doctor from Dorpat, a naturalist and entomologist, shy and retiring by nature, but true and noble as gold. Such tributes reflect the character of their author. FKKYCIXET K\\ I'KIHTION. A little more than a year after Ohamisso's visit, on March IT, 181!*, the French corvette Uvanle, Louis de Freycinet commanding, arrived at Guam. With him were the botanist, Charles Gaudichaud-Iieaupre, the zoologists Quoy and Gaimard, and an artist named Arago. A stav of several months allowed the naturalists to make extensive col- lect ions and observations on the island of Guam, and the islands of Rota and Tinian were also visited by them. On the return voyage the Umnie, while at the Falkland Islands, struck a rock and foundered. GaudichaiuTs collections were almost ruined. The hold, in which his herbarium was stowed, was flooded, and the plants saturated with sea water. Only a collector can appreciate the feelings of Gaudichaud when, several days afterwards, he fished them up and spread them out to dry as best he could. The collections were taken to France in the Phy$icimm>, and deposited in the Museum d'Histoirc Natu relic, at Paris. An interesting account of the vegetation of Guam was given \u00ab 30 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM by Gaudichaud in the Botany of the Freycinet Expedition,\" and the greater part, of his observations are embodied in the narrative of the expedition published by Freycinet himself.h The zoology was pub- lished by Quoy and Gaimard. A narrative of the expedition was published independently by the artist .Tatpies Arago, which abounds in exaggerations, scandalous stories, and unkind criticisms and ridi- cule of the people whose hospitality he had enjoyed. Its publication naturally offended the Spaniards, and the next expedition from Franco to visit the island met with a very different reception at the hands of the governor/' While waiting for supplies from Manila a survey of the island was made by M. Duperrey under the direction of Freycinet. Existing maps were corrected and several charts of small harbors were drawn. I>rMONT nVkVlLLK/ti TWO VISITS, Dumont d'llrville made two visits to the island of (iuain. On his first visit, in May, 1828, he came in command of the Axtrohtb*', which had been sent out on an exploring voyage with special instructions to look for traces of La Pe rouse. Attached to the Axtroialx were Lesson, as pharmacist and botanist, who assisted dTTrville in collecting plants, and Quoy and Gaimard, as zoologists, who were the first to collect specimens of the Guam reed-warbler, Acroiujihahtx Imvinitt* the only true song bird of the island. A most interesting narrative of this expedition was written by Dumont d'LTrvillc himself, and the zoology was published by Quov and Gaimard/' The Axtrokihe anchored at Umata and w as boarded by Jose Flores, alcalde of the village. He told the captain that he had seen the ships of Malaspina, who visited Guam in 1792, thirty-six years before. In the roadstead d'LTrvilIe saw two ships which had been captured by the Spaniards from the independents of Mexico and were now being taken to Manila. Three years before this there had been a mutiny on board some Spanish vessels lying at anchor in the roadstead of Umata. The squadron was commanded by Don Andres Garcia (Jamba, Caballero de Santiago, afterwards governor of the Philippines. General (Jamba had served in South America against the revolutionists and had been captured at the battle of Ayacucho, December 9, 1824, in which the \u00ab TCotanique du voyage autour du monde.

JOHN ANDERSON 31 South American colonies won their final victory over Spain. On the 1st of January, lS2f), he sailed in command of a squadron composed of the ship Ax/'// and the brigantines Aqta'lcx and ( onxfantt\\ hound for the Philippines. The water of the squadron becoming scarce, they anchored in the roadstead of Umata and filled their casks. On the night of March Lo, while weighing anchor, the crews suddenly rose, set fire to one of the vessels, maltreated the commanding officer, and drove him ashore, together with his officers and 100 loyal men. Ganga-Herrero, the governor of Guam, went on board and tried to restore discipline, but they put him ashore, hoisted the flag of the insurgent republics of America, and set sail for Peru to join the inde- pendents. The general, accompanied by his officers and loyal men, proceeded in a whaling vessel to Manila, where they arrived April 4, and were received with great hospitality by all classes of people.'' P'Urville states that Governor Ganga-llerrero was much regretted by the natives, whom he permitted to trade on their own account with vessels anchoring at the island. His successor, Medinilla, on the other hand, was universally disliked. He forbade all traffic with visiting vessels, monopolizing it for himself. Among the officials visiting the ship was the captain of the port, a Scotchman named John Anderson, who had come to the island with Freycinct. He had served tem- porarily on the (Iranla as chief quartermaster, and was allowed to remain in Guam at his own request. P'lTrvillo describes him as a fine-looking man, well-behaved, and speaking French pretty well. Anderson knew Quoy and Gaimard, having been shipmates with them on the Uranle. He came to investigate the sickness on hoard, fearing that some contagious disease might be introduced into the island. He gave d'Urville information regarding the hydrography of the region. As an illustration of the conditions in Guam, he said that Medinilla, the governor, on his return from Manila had brought back more than 60,000 pesos worth of goods of all kinds to sell to the natives of Guam, and that he conducted a very profitable business, since he per- mitted no competitors in trade. This monopoly [says d'Urville], which aceording to our ideas would not be very honorable on the part of a governor, does not cause surprise in the Mariannes. The governors have had this privilege from time immemorial. D'Urville attributed the lack of enterprise and progress on the island to the absurd laws and this disheartening monopoly. How should industry flourish? [he says]. The governor is the sole trader. He receives annually money for the salaries of the oJlh-ers, whieli lie sends bark, giving them instead inferior goods at prices fixed by himself. \" This account is taken from the narrative of Burnout d'Urville, supplemented by the report made to the Queen Regent, inserted in the work \" Lns die/ v scin mescs de mando superior de Filipinas,\" Don Andres Garcia Camba; Cadiz, 1W39. 32 PLANTS OF GUAM On 1S3!), Dmuont d'lTrville, commanding the Antvol&he and Zeler, paid his second visit to Guam.

EXTRACTS FliOM THE ARCHIVES OF GUAM, RELATING TO ITS ECONOMIC HISTORY. At Agana, the capital of Guam, there are a number of letter books containing copies of the official communications of the governors of the Mariannes to their immediate superior, the captain-general of the Philippines. In these letters various questions are discussed at length regarding the policy which should be pursued to make the Marianne Islands self-supporting and profitable to Spain, and to make the natives prosperous and happy. Arguments are advanced in favor both of protection and of free trade with visiting vessels. Attempts were made to compel the natives to till the ground, and inducements were offered by tempting their self-interest. Causes for the failure of the population to increase were sought in the destruction of the crops by hurricanes and pests, in the use of unwholesome or injurious food, and in the disinclination of the natives to work more than was neces- sary for their daily needs. Some of the governors greedily monopo- lized all trade, forcing the natives and the soldiers of the barracks to buy goods from them at prices arbitrarily fixed by themselves, and forbidding the natives to sell their products to the whalers who flocked to the islands. Others gave the natives free license to trade and entered into their daily life by cultivating farms of their own after the native fashion. Efforts were made to benefit the islands by decrees of the captains-general of the Philippines, to whose ears came stories of dishonesty and oppression on the part of the governors, and confidential subordinates were sent to the islands to sec what could be done for their good. The following extracts, showing the efforts made in behalf of the islands and the natives, are taken from the archives at Agana. \" Voyage an pole slid, etc., 1841-1 Hf>4. See List of works.

On December 17, 1828, new regulations were issued by Don Mariano Ricafort, the captain-general of the Philippines, for the government of the Marianne Islands; and Don Francisco Ramon de Villalobos, captain in the royal corps of artillery, was sent thither to study the condition of affairs in that group, with a view of reporting upon them and making such suggestions as he might sec fit for the improvement of the islands and the people. Instead of sending his correspondence through the governor, he communicated directly with the captain- general of the Philippines, as may be seen by his letter books in the archives at Agafia. In the new regulations Article II provided for the absolute liberty of trade and for the abolishing of dues paid by vessels arriving at the islands. The object of this was to stimulate the application and the industry of the natives and inhabitants of the Marianne Islands, so that they might attain greater prosperity, even to such an extent, per- haps, as to become self-supporting, Vilhilol>os belonged to that school of economists who believe *' wealth\" and \" money\" to be synonymous terms, estimating the wealth of a country by the amount of coin it contains, and holding that trade should be restrained in such a manner as to prevent money from being sent out of the country. He writes to the captain-general as follows: The lack of circulation of coin is the cause of the very small interior and exterior trade of this territory, which consist# almost entirely in bartering certain goods for others, with the countless difficulties arising therefrom which caused the establish- ment of money by our remote ancestors. This same cause has prevented the natives from dedicating themselves exclusively to one branch of industry or trade, each family finding itself obliged to engage in all occupations according to its needs, with the consequent imperfection and scarcity resulting therefrom, and, finally, as it is not possible for a single person or family to procure for itself as many articles and resources as are necessary for its nourishment, clothing, and conveniences, these natives have lacked the advantages enjoyed by other countries, in which the free circulation of money secures for them everything needful. It ia evident, then, in order that the Marianne Islands may issue from so sad a plight, it is indispensable that there should be in them an abundance of money, and as long as this is not the case, whether, aw in the former system, little comes in and soon goes out, or whether great sums conic in and go out immediately, as will hap- pen in the present system, the evil will always be the same or nearly the same. At present there are in the Marianne Islands no articles of export to attract the attention of the foreigner hut some edibles or beverages made from the coconut palm. Freedom of trade once established, it would introduce many articles, and the few things produced by the country would not suffice to pay for them, so that the difference would have to be made good in money. From this it would follow that money paid for salaries would remain here only temporarily; the country would be merely a channel through which the money from the royal treasury would flow to foreign parts with no hope of its return. The Mariannes would be deprived of the spirit of agriculture and industry, which I think ought, in a certain degree, to come before commerce, and the islands would be no less poverty stricken than they have been up to the present time. 9773\u201405 3 34 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. Don Francisco goes on to make the following suggestions: First, considering the impossibility of preventing the arrival of foreigners in these islands, they should be obliged to pay at least the established anchorage dues; second, industry and agriculture on the part of the natives should l>e fostered, obliging them, on their own account and for their own benefit, to engage in producing objects easy of exportation, such as dyewood, indigo, cotton, tortoise shell, mother-of-pearl, arrowroot, and I icches de mer, and in the breeding of animals, the more extensive cultivation of land, and the production of wines, brandies, sugar, and other articles\u2014 all in accordance with the regulations of good government\u2014which will not be hard to formulate according to the system in force in the Visayan Islands; third, the said freedom of trade will allow the natives to sell their goods, as will be seen; fourth, the royal treasury will continue to send half of the appropriation for the pay of the forces on the island in goods at prices as moderate as practicable; and fifth and last, if national or foreign vessels arrive with articles of commerce, they shall take away with them the equivalent of what they leave in the country in products of the island, and, if they do not wish the latter, they shall be sent away. He also suggests that the proceeds from the port dues be applied in part to the payment of premiums to persons who have most excelled in some branch of industry or agriculture or who have been of some benefit to the public. By these methods [says Villalobos\"], sustained with constancy and intelligence and favored by the docility and good disposition which I observe in the inhabitants of these islands, I believe that the day will really come in which the Marianas will have much money, many goods; that they may without difficulty be self-sup- porting, like other provinces; that ships will concur, and that all amplitude desired will be given to trade. Villalobos did much to benefit the people of Guam. In his official letters to his chief he reports, among other things, the segregation of lepers and provision for their care and comfort; the appointment of hunters to supply the leper hospital with fresh meat by killing wild hogs and cattle; his efforts to encourage commerce, so that Guam may derive profit, like the Hawaiian Islands, from the visiting whalers; the vaccination of the natives as a protection against small- pox; the reorganization of the urban militia; proposed reforms in the administration of the college for the education of native children; efforts to promote the cultivation of coffee, \"which article may be the wealth of this country;\" the condition of agriculture on the island; the preparation of the large marsh east of Agana for the cultivation of rice; the injuries to maize caused by rats and weevils, and the con- sequent restriction of its cultivation to amounts barely sufficient for the needs of each family; the substitution of taroand yams for maize, when the latter has been destroyed by hurricanes, and the use of plantains and bananas as food staples instead of bread; the cultivation of sweet potatoes for supplying visiting ships; the excellence of the pineapples and the use made of pi neapple fiber; the fine quality of Guam \u00ab Letter book, January 18, 1830. CONDITIONS UNDER GOVERNOR VILLALOBOS. 35 tobacco, and the means employed to keep the plants free from worms; the introduction of manila hemp and the failure to make it profitable; the cultivation of eggplants, red peppers, tomatoes, squashes, water- melons, muskmelons, and peanuts in the natives' gardens; the scarcity of sugar cane on the island; the importance of the coconut palm, and the manufacture from it of toddy, vinegar, yeast, brandy, oil, syrup, fiber, and thatch for houses; the importance of breadfruit, both sterile and fertile, as a food staple; the manufacture of fecula, like arrow- root, from nuts of ' federieo\" (Cyeax ch'cinalhi); the yield of betel nuts from Arcca palms, growing spontaneously on the islands; the manufacture of mats, hats, and lashings from the leaves of Pandanus; the scarcity of mango trees and sappan wood {used dyeing); the abundance of achiote or arnotto (/>i.m ordlana), and the cultivation of the orange, lemon, lime, citron, bergamot, custard apple, tamarind, papaya, earambola, island arrowroot, and turmeric. lie also reports on the wild and domestic animals, and states that 011 the neighboring islands of Saipan and Tinian there are thousands of cattle and swine roaming in the woods.\" Villalobos erected a kiln for making pottery and t iles, paying the cost of it partly from his own pocket, lie also made charts of the island at his own expense, and superintended in person the construc- tion of bridges and the repairing of roads, stimulating the workmen by fees and small gratuities. In consequence of mutinies and acts of insubordination on the part of crews of ships in the harbor, England proposed to establish a consulate either at Guam or in the Ron in Islands. Villalobos objected to this, saying that if there were an English consul at Guam questions might arise leading to international complications, which might perhaps result in the loss of the island. On the other hand, if a consulate were established in the Bon in Islands, the whaling fleet would assemble there to the detriment of the natives of Guam, who derived much benefit from trading with the said vessels. He pro- posed that an arrangement he made whereby the British Government would authorize the governor of the Mariannes to act in settling cases of mutiny and the like. He also recommended the establishment of a store of marine supplies by either one of the two governments, and called attention to the immense advantages of the presence of many ships at Guam with liberty to trade with the islanders, the governor being prohibited from engaging in trade of any kind. Orders having been issued to collect import duties from the ships coming to Guam, Vil- lalobos informed the captain-general that it would be practically impos- sible to carry out the provisions of the decree. He stated that if guards were placed on board the ships, the cost of maintaining them a Villalolxja, manuscript report, to the captain-general of tliu Philippines, dated November 16, 1831. 36 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM would exceed the amount received for duties. If no guards were sta- tioned the duties would be only imaginary, on account of the bad faith of tho.se who sold and their \"lack of delicacy.\" Moreover, if it should come to light that a sale had been secretly made and the corre- sponding duties on the Maine be exacted from a foreign captain, his pride and insolence would be apt to compromise the dignity of the authorities beyond all bearable limits or bring about disagreeable con- sequences resembling perhaps an unhappy affair between the ex-Gov- ernor Ganga-Herrero and an English captain, Mr. Stavers, who, in 1824, died from injuries received while resisting arrest. In view of these difficulties Villalobos on his own authority ventured to grant free trade between the visiting ships and the islanders. PABLO I'EREZ. Don Pablo Perez began his service as governor of the Mariannes on September 8,1848. Among the first reports forwarded by him to the captain-general were statistical tables regarding the population of the islands, a list of ships anchoring at Guam, a report of recent hurri- canes, the destruction of crops, and the resulting dearth of food, and a list of the useful woods of the island. He calls attention to the lack of laborers in Guam, especially of men skilled in mechanical trades, and begs that convicts be sent to the island, including mechanics of various kinds and husbandmen or tillers of the soil. He speaks of the presence of a few such men on the island who remained there after the expiration of their terms of imprisonment, and states that these were the only individuals skilled in the use of the plow, carpenter's tools, etc. He comments upon the inadequacy of the method practiced by the natives of cultivating the soil by means of the \" fosino,\" or thrust- hoe,\" in consequence of which u their harvests arc small which might be large.\" Don Pablo found the roads and bridges in a deplorable state, owing to the effects of recent floods and hurricanes, and he reported that there was a lack of suitable tools for carrying on public works and of iron for making such tools. Following the hurricanes and Hoods there was an epidemic, caused probably by a dearth of nutri- tious food, and shortly after this the island was visited by a severe earthquake. In response to the report of this, supplies of rice, maize, and other food were sent to Guam from Manila, together with a relief fund raised by the young ladies and gentlemen of that city by means of theatrical performances for the benefit of the sufferers. Don Pablo acknowledges the receipt of these contributions as follows:'' The governor of the Mariana Islands in the name of the inhabitant#, who do not cease giving thanks to the Almighty for not having suwumbed to a desolating epi- demic and the most horrible of earthquakes, which still continue, saw themselves \u00ae See p. 144. 6 Manuscript copy of letter in the archives of Guam, dated October 10, 1849. RELIEF RECEIVED FROM MANILA. 37 threatened anew by a devouring famine which threatened to put an end to their miserable existence. But Providence, which incessantly watches over those peoples who implore its aid, willed that the beneficent hand of our Superior Government, ever benevolent and philanthropic, should put a happy end to so much misfortune and un happiness so great. What joy was ours on the 3d day of September, when there arrived at this port the frigate Union, bearer of most bounteous supplies of rice, maize, and other grains, at prices more moderate than have ever l>efore l>een known in these possessions! It is impossible to describe the joy and animation of the people of this community, whose misery and poverty were increasing by a plague of worms which consumed as much rice, maize, and other seed as were sown in the months of July, August, and September; so that if succor had not arrived so opportunely the ruined crops could not have been replaced for lack of seed. Such was the scarcity that on the Ulrtli of August, four days before the arrival of the said ship, the only remaining five cabanes of rice were put up at auction and sold at 5 pesos a caban. From this alone may be formed an idea of the great if not the total lack which was suffered here. Like one who suddenly recovers from a mortal illness to perfect health, so was the air of contentment and rejoicing which seized upon all souls in their most sincere gratitude to the author of so many and such great benefits. Nor was our gratitude less to those gentlemen who contributed the subscription in money of $(>75-4-5, which was dis- tributed among the poor of these islands on this the birthday of our adored Queen, Dofia Isabella II (whom God save), in accordance with the directions of- the Superior Government. Without elements, means, or resources whatever for manifesting our gratitude, 1 directed that on the 9th of the same month of September a mass of thanksgiving Ik; celebrated by three priests, something very rarely seen in this city, with a sermon preached eloquently and eruditely, aw is his custom, by Padre Fray Manuel Kncama- cion, the parish priest of the village of A gat, who, in speaking of the calamities suf- fered by these islands, made his hearers understand and exhorted them to the grati- tude due our Government, which so prodigally relieved our necessities, finishing the function with a solemn to deum, and displaying the most holy sacrament. All the people bowing down like those of Israel before His Divine Majesty, breathed forth their prayers and vows for the happiness of their benefactors. 1\u00bb order to give another proof of the sentiments of gratitude which filled us and to carry out in a certain way the l>eneticent ideas of our Government, which especially distinguish it, as is seen by the sublime acts which illustrate the pages of the history of our colonies, I decided to act as godfather to the first girl baby which might be born, and J gave to it the name of Isabella, in memory of our august. Queen; and the lieutenant-governor acted in the same capacity for the first buy baby, which he called Narcissus, in memory of his excellency our captain-general, Count of Manila, who so justly rules these remote regions, each one of us giving to his godchild 50 j\u00bbesos and an outfit of decent clothing, which event took place at 9 o'clock on the morning of the 16th of Septeniljer, with the assistance of the authorities and of nearly all the population, so that these children may be living testimony of the remembrance of the generosity of our Sovereign and of your excellency, who knows so well how to act as the instrument of ho many and such great acts, which history will record for the honor and the glory of the great Spanish nation. On August 10, 1S51, the brigantine Clavelhio arrived from the Phil- ippines bringing 65 convicts. They were in a miserable plight. On the voyage two of their number had died, and nearly half of the remain- der were afflicted with scurvy, virulent ulcers, or cutaneous diseases. No medicines were available for treating these poor people. They 38 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM were handed over to a little Irish doctor named William E. George, who had acted as apothecary on a whaler and had been permitted to take up his residence in Guam; but his private supply of medicines was soon exhausted. Finally the board of directors of the hospital for lepers consented to furnish means out of their own fund for lint, bandages, and drugs to relieve the sufferers, asking the approval of their action by the captain-general. On September 1, the governor caused 51 of these convicts, all of whom were farmers by calling, to be distributed over the island, putting them under the charge of the most thrifty cultivators of the soil The principal one of these was the priest of Agat, Fray Manuel Encarnacion, to whom 18 of them were assigned. The governor issued a circular prescribing the conditions under which they were to be employed. The sick were to be kept at Agafia under treatment. On the 1st of September there were 14 on the sick list and on October 17 all had been put to work but G. CONVICT LABOR. The governor apprehended no trouble in allowing the convicts to be scattered over the island so long as there were no ships in harbor, as there was no possible means for them to escape from the island. It was his intention to have them divided into gangs, placed under the surveillance of guards, and employed at as great a distance as possible from the port, as soon as the season for the whalers1 visits should arrive. At these seasons there were often fifteen or twenty vessels in the harbor, and as most of them were short-handed, there would be great danger of their smuggling these people on board on the eve of sailing. Those convicts who should misbehave were to be punished by being placed in gangs under a guard and compelled to work in his sight. Those who might become sick or who were returned by their masters as unfit for work or as dangerous subjects, would have to be sup- ported by the Government. The governor asked the captain-general to authorize their subsistence from Government funds under the direct supervision of the governor. Scarcely a month had passed when the governor was informed that the convicts had entered into a conspiracy to rise against the authorities and take possession of the island. They were surprised by the guard, who tired upon them and charged bayonets. Their leader, Fortunato de los Angeles, \"a villain from the Province of Cavite,\" was taken prisoner, one was killed, and two wounded. The rest scattered through the town and sought refuge in the woods. Before a week had passed all had been captured. The governor in his report to the captain- general says: I acknowledge that. T was mistaken. Relieving that men whom your excellency had pardoned from the punishment of (loath by your decree of the 11th of hist ,f no- nary would live fateful of auch a boon, J never dreamed thai (hey would rise aguiiiist the authorities and attempt to make ub the victims of Iheir ferocity. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN 1856. 39 The prisoners were sent back to Manila in the brigantine Clavelino, the same vessel which had brought them, in charge of Lieut. Jose Martinez, assisted by 12 privates and 2 corporals. Thus ended the attempt of Don Pablo to introduce convict labor into Guam. FELIPK I>E LA COKTE. On May 16, 1855, Don Felipe de la Corte relieved Don Pablo Perez as governor of the Mariannes. During his administration Guam was visited by a terrible epidemic of smallpox, which lasted nine months and carried off two-fifths of the population. In a report upon economic conditions, dated June 1W, 185G, Don Felipe says: For a long time the attention of the superior Government has been called to the slow progress* of the population of these Marianne Jslands, and the governors and special commissioners sent here have I teen directed to investigate the causes of this stationary condition of the population and even the decrease sometimes noticed in the number of inhabitants. * * * Some have thought to find the origin of this evil in the changeableness of the climate and the inconstancy of its seasons; others in the use of articles of food not very nutritious or perhaps injurious (nuta of Cycas), and others in the great number of rats, which destroy the abundant harvests. After a dissertation on the principles of political economy, \"a science which teaches us by sure principles the means of bringing about the prosperity of a country and of ridding it of objects opposed to its progress,'1 Don Felipe goes on to say: It is not necessary to tire oneself in seeking other causes than that of poverty, which is the only thing that retards the progress of the population of the Marianne Islands. Other things to which it has l>een attributed are accidents. The use of hurtful food, poor clothing, and other things, far from being considered a cause, are in reality the effects of that poverty and the direct means through which it works for the sp<iedy destruction of this unhappy portion of the human race. Thin |>ov- erty, the general and sole cause, has not, however, been perceived by many, because they could not believe that it could occur in the midst of a soil which produces abundant and varied fruits, in spite even of those plagues, and because they have confounded with wealth the occurrence here at all times of fruit* growing spontane- ously which the natives use for food during the periods when more wholesome kinds are lacking. * * * The prosperity of a country depends, instead of upon the abundance of its spontaneous products, rather upon the wealth accumulated in it, and here precisely is the great defect and the origin of the evil in the Marianne Islands. In them, most excellent SefSor, nobody possesses anything, with very few exceptions. Here all live absolutely for the day, and domestic utensils, tools of laborers, lodgings, and everything\u2014absolutely everything\u2014is so mean, so little durable, and so incapa- ble of constituting wealth that all, or nearly all, could with solemnity declare at all hours that they are poor. * * * To correct the evils upon which I here have touched, and to ameliorate the condition of these islanders, my predecessors, with laudable %oal, have reproduced without ceasing exhortations, orders, and decrees that they should plant and harvest wholesome and abundant fruits. But who would believe it? With fat harvest*, of which the grain has sometimes even lieeu burned for lack of consumers, poverty has continued and reached even to us; for not hav- ing sought the means of accumulating that wealth then superfluous, to fill out the dearth later in worse seasons, all has perished at the moment, and without object. And what is still worse, it has created in these natives the idea in good years as well as in bad, of large crops as well as of small, that they can not hope for a beneficial 40 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM change. They have logically figured that it is futile to work for superfluous harvests which ro.ay have to l)e burned, consequently not relieving them in the periods of scarcity which are sure to come later; that it is better to work little than to work without result. On account of this they have been accused of possessing a lazy dis- position, which they are far from manifesting 011 occasions in which they clearly see the good results of their work. PRESERVATION of maize.\u2014To dispel so harmful a prejudice I have thought it of the greatest importance to inaugurate the first accumulation of wealth in the preser- vation of the article most important for the subsistence of these natives. This is maize, or Indian corn, which is harvested with the greatest ease and n iay be planted at three epochs of the year in such a way that three times as much as the amount necessary for consumption may be produced at each harvest if its cultivation lie fol- lowed on a great scale and leaving out accidents. There is in contrast with this the experience which they have that with their small resources the most careful can scarcely make their supply of thin grain last from har- vest to harvest, so that there are repeatedly seasons during which a great portion of the population, being without maize or even the other articles of food used here, finds itself forced to fall back on federico [OyeiW nuts] and other fruits and roots of the forest, which can not fail to do them injury either from their being essentially harmful or because the organic system of the native suffers from the repeated changes from one kind of diet to another. Anxious to root out an evil which I consider the greatest in these islands, and per- suaded that when this is once accomplished a new era will begin for their inhabit- ants, I have availed myself of the teachings pertaining to my profession, and I have thought that without prejudice to anyone and by means of light work uf all there could be put into practice the ancient system practiced by Spain and other countries of preserving cereals in subterranean granaries, and, combining this idea with the beneficent institution of the public granaries of Spain and some places in the Indies, I published an order which I hope will meet with the approval of your excellency, assuring you that in taking this step I have been prompted by a fervid wish to ben- efit these natives. Don Felipe de la Corte wrote a most interesting account of these islands, which was published hy the Spanish Government.\u00ae He was relieved at his own request by Don Francisco Moscoso y Lam on Jan- uary 28, 1866, after having served eleven years. SOME I) AD AORICOLA, During the administration of Governor Moscoso a society was formed under the title \"Sociedad Agricola de la Conception.\" It was composed of the governor and several of the officials and leading citi- zens of the island- Laborers were introduced from Japan and efforts were made to develop the resources of the island. The project failed, however. Some of the Japanese died and the rest returned to Japan. SUMMARY. From the above extracts some idea may be gathered of the economic conditions on the inland of Guam.

PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF GUAM. CLIMATE AND RAINFALL. Seasons.\u2014Though Guam lies within the Tropics, its climate is tem- pered throughout the greater part of the year by a brisk trade wind, blowing from the northeast and east. Its mountains are not high enough to cause marked differences in the distribution of rain on the island, and the island is not of sufficient extent to cause the daily alter- nating currents of air known as land and sea breezes, Generally speaking, the seasons conform in a measure with those of Manila, the least rain falling in the colder months or the period called winter (invierno) by the natives, and the greatest rainfall occurring in the warm months, which are called summer (vera.no) by the natives. The year may be divided into a rainy and a dry season, but this division does not correspond exactly to that based on temperature, for the period of maximum temperature precedes that of the greatest rainfall. During the winter months the wind blows briskly and steadily from the northeast and east. In June it becomes unsteady, veering to the east and southeast, and by September what is generally known as the u southwest monsoon \" sets in. The climate is healthful in compari- son with other tropical countries, the only period when sickness may be expected being that of July and August, when the absence of the trade wind and the presence of moisture in the atmosphere causes the heat to appear greater than it is. The mean annual temperature is about 80\u00b0 F., and the mean monthly temperature ranges from 78\u00b0 F. in December, the coldest month, to 82\u00b0 F, in May and June, the hottest months. The highest absolute temperature recorded in 1902, 90\u00b0 F., occurred in June and July, the lowest, 66\u00b0 F., in December. Though the mean monthly temperature varies only 2\u00b0 on either side of the mean annual temperature, yet the u wintersof Guam are so definitely marked that certain wasps which during the summer make their nests in the open fields among the bushes invade the houses of the people at that season and hibernate there. Meteokouhjioal Tables.\u2014The following tables, compiled from observations made at the naval station at Agana, the capital of Guam, show the temperature, rainfall, and prevailing winds for each month of the year 1902. They arc taken from a report drawn up by Dr. Cleveland Abbe, jr., who, through the courtesy of Prof. Willis L. 42 USEFUL PLANTS OP GUAM Moore, Chief of the Weather Bureau, was detailed to examine and interpret the records forwarded to the United States Hydrographic Office: Temperature^ 1002, [Degrees Fahrenheit and centigrade.] January...

According to available records they appear to have been most frequent during the months of April and November. The first one recorded occurred on the 8th of September, IfiTl, in the midst of a war between the Spaniards and the natives. It is described as \"a typhoon, called 'bagnio' by the natives, the most furious which had been seen on the island, veering in a short time all round the compass, and causing injuries which it would take years to remedy, ruining nearly all the houses of Agana and the other towns of the island, especially those of the chief conspirators, as they have since confessed; tearing up breadfruit trees, together with palms and other plants with which they nourish themselves, leaving them in a condition without farms, without houses, and without food.\" Not even the church of the missionaries was spared, and one of the wizards of the natives declared that he was more powerful than the god of the Spaniards, since the hurricane had swept away their church and had not been able to injure his house. A violent hurricane laid waste the island on the night of August 10, 1848. A description of the damages wrought by it may be found in a report of the Spanish governor, Don Pablo Perez, to the captain- general of the Philippines. Since the American occupation there have been several hard storms. The first occurred on May 2t>-27,1900, the wind being accompanied by very heavy rainfall. Breadfruit, coco- nuts, coffee, and cacao were stripped from the trees and bushes; plan- tains and banana plants were torn to shreds, and many trees were snapped off or uprooted. In the southern part of the island fowls died from exposure. At the village of Surnai, on Orote Peninsula, the infirmary and wharf shed were demolished and several private houses were blown down. At Agat several dwellings were destroyed, together with the school house. At Merizo the rice fields were destroyed, and at Umata the corn was killed, the chapel unroofed, and several dwellings demolished. At Inalahan three bridges were car- ried away by swollen streams and the tribunal, rectory, and school- 44 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. house unroofed. In the harbor of San Luis de Apra the U. S. S. Brutm was torn from her anchorage and blown upon the reef, with- out, however, suffering serious injury. On the 13th of November following occurred the hurricane which caused the loss of the U, S. S. Yosemite, which was lying at anchor in the harbor. This vessel was swept from her moorings and carried out to sea, where she foundered. Five of her crew were lost. The sea overflowed the lowlands and flooded the streets of Agana. Crops of all kinds were destroyed and most of the vegetation was stripped bare of foliage. Government buildings were injured and many native houses destroyed. Of the 255 deaths which occurred on the island during the year 1900, 84 wore caused by the hurricane. This destruc- tion was followed, as is always the case, bv a dearth of food. It 7 v caused our Government to expend nearly $10,000 for the relief of the natives, who received the proffered aid with expressions of deep grat- itude/' Among the most serious results of hurricanes of this nature is the stripping of coconut trees of their leaves. The intiorescence is formed in the axils of the older leaves and if these are injured the flower buds shrivel up and the tree fails to produce. During the year which followed the hurricane not one ounce of copra, which is prac- tically the only export of the island, was produced in Guam, Coffee and other shrubs and trees soon recover from the effects of a storm, and maize, tobacco, and rice may be replanted. Cacao, however, is often killed outright, and several years are necessary for new plants to begin to bear. The records for 1902 show that hurricanes passed near the island of Guam in May, July, September, and October. In examining the Philippine weather records Doctor Abbe waa able to identify the stormy periods of Guam as days when typhoons must have passed close to the island. Many of the typhoons which sweep the Philip- pines apparently have their origin in the vicinity of the Marianne Islands. Doctor Abbe has suggested in his report that a station be established on the island of Guam for meteorological observations, to be connected by telegraph with Manila. This could not fail to be of great benefit to vessels about to put to sea, giving warning of approach- ing blows and indicating what kind of weather is to be expected. JIYDROOliAPHY. Contour op this ocean's bottom.-\u2014In taking soundings with a view to selecting a cable route across the Pacific, the U. S. S. Nwo found the ocean bed between Midway Island and Guam to be a great plain from 3,100 to 3,200 fathoms deep, somewhat broken in places by submarine reefs and mountain ranges. The first thousand miles from Midway, \u00ab Anmuil Report, of the Assistant Herretary of the Navy, I HO 1, j>p. 75-7ti. VI HYDROGRAPHY. 45 with the exception of a submarine mountain peak near Ocean Island, is entirely level. The remainder of the distance, though fairly level in general, is interspersed by a number of reefs and mountain ranges. On approaching the great submarine volcanic range running nearly north and south which forms the islands of the Marianne group, at a point a short distance east of Guam, this plain descends into an abyss, which is the deepest yet discovered in the world, lacking only 66 feet of a depth of 6 statute miles. The temperature at this depth was found to be 36\u00b0 F. It was necessary to select for the cable a route around the northern limit of this depression, which has been christened the Nero Deep. Its southern limits are not yet known. Between Guam and the Philippines the bed of the ocean is less regu- lar than to the eastward. For the first t>00 geographical miles the depth varies from 1,400 to 3,700 fathoms. The character of the bot- tom is described as undulating, but without definite ranges of hills or valleys. After this a low mountain range occurs which slopes to the westward down to a plain 3,000 to ,5,500 fathoms deep, which reaches to the Philippines and has a bottom of soft mud and ooze. A route was also surveyed between Guam and Yokohama, Japan, to the westward of the Mariannes and to the eastward of the Bon in Islands. For the first 500 geographical miles a level plain 2,100 fath- oms deep was found. Then the Nero encountered a submarine moun- tain range which apparently connects that of the Marianne Islands with the range extending from the Bon in Islands to Japan. While crossing this range a submarine conical peak was discovered resem- bling Fujiyama in form/' Ocean currents.\u2014The currents in the vicinity of the Marianne Islands are much affected by the prevailing winds. During the greater part of the year there is a drift to the westward or south- westward of 1 to 2 knots per hour. On the sandy beaches of the east coast of the island of Guam driftwood of American origin is often found, including huge logs of Oregon fir. From July to September, when the easterly winds are interrupted by the influence of the south- west monsoon, the drift is frequently to the northeast. Tides.\u2014The rise of tides in the archipelago is generally less than 3 feet. In the harbor of San Luis de April the rise and fall is 3 to 4 feet. High water occurs there at the full and change of the moon at about seven hours after its meridian passage. The tides play an important role in the economy of vessels lying in the harbor, as the water on the reef is too shallow to permit boats of considerable size to land cargo at any time but that of high water, and it is not unusual \u00ab6ee \"Trans-Pacific submarine telegraph cable survey,\" in the Report of the Sec- retary of the Navy for 1900, pp. 299-302, from which the above information is derived. 46 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. for a boat to stick upon the reef halfway between the ship and the shore. There is a crooked channel through which bouts of small size may pass, and extensive dredging operations have been recommended in order to enlarge the harbor and clear a channel from the harbor to the shore, but the recommendations of the board have not yet been carried out.\" * PHYSICAL GKOflRArHY, Surface and contour.\u2014From a distance the island appears flat and even, but on approaching it the northern portion is seen to be a raised platform or plateau (PI. I), with several low peaks rising from it in the north, and to the southward a low, rounded hill, which has received the vernacular name of uTiyan\" (belly). The southern half of the island is mountainous. The island is irregular in shape. It may be compared roughly to the shape of a human footprint (the right foot), with the heel north-northeast and the toe south-southwest (see map, PI. LXX). The general plane of the northern half is not horizontal but shelving, with eastern and higher side bounded by steep cliffs. The east coast of the southern half is penetrated by a few small bays, none of which is capable of receiving a vessel. On the west coast of the northern part of the island there are a number of sandy bays fringed with coconut groves and separated from one another by as many rocky points. The east shore is constantly beaten by a heavy sea caused by the stiff trade winds which prevail during the greater part of the year. The adjacent sea is very deep, so that it is impossible for vessels to find anchorage there. The swell is even so great that it is dangerous at most times for boats to attempt to enter the small ports in the southern part, except at Hahahvan, at the extreme south, which is sheltered from easterly and northeasterly winds. On the west side of the island the sea is shallow enough in several places to permit vessels to anchor within a safe distance of the shore, except during a certain part of the summer, when winds from the southwest may be expected. The favorite anchorage of the early navigators was the roadstead of Umata (Humatag), where a good supply of fresh water was always to be secured without difficulty. Afterwards the bay of San Luis de April became used as a harbor, and is now the only port of the island in which large ships can find anchorage. The little harbor of Agana (Hagadna) can be entered only by vessels of the size of launches, and the anchorage in Agana Bay is not considered safe. In Alexander Agassiz's description of the islandh he gives a detailed account of its shore line and the physical features of the island. The \u00abSee Report of the Guam Survey Board to the Secretary of the Navy, July 25,1901. PThe Coral Reefs of the Tropical Pacific, p. 366 et seq., 1903. RAISED PLATFORMS OF CORAL. 47 AlbtUroM encountered the east coast of Guam near Point Hanom. He found distinct coralliferous limestone terraces in the faces of the cliffs from Pago Bay north, marking the position of the former sea level, and indicating the periods of rest during the elevation of the island; and when these are not distinct, lines of caverns along the vertical faces of the cliffs indicate the former lines of sea level. The cliffs of the northern part of the island vary from 300 to 5n0 feet in height. The lower part of their faces is riddled with crevasses, and at a higher level, probably on the face of the fourth or fifth terrace, there are numerous caverns. North of Point Anao some of the corallifcrous limestones are stratified, dipping toward the sea; others, nearer the northern extremity of the island, show evidence of great disturbance, probably caused by the volcanic outbursts of Mount Santa Rosa. Mr, Agassiz found them to resemble those of similar limestone islands, such as Makatea, Niue, Eua, Vavau, and others of the Fiji group. Outside of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, Guam proved to be the largest island visited by the Alhatrosx, composed in part of volcanic rocks and of elevated coralliferous limestone. At the northern end of the island, though there are live distinct terraces, these are concealed bv the vegetation growing on the slopes. Talage (\"Lookout\") Bay,\" at the northern extremity of Guam, is an immense sandy flat, flanked by a comparatively broad reef platform full of \" horseheads and of \" ncgroheads'1 of coral, which extends from Taga Point around the north extremity of the island and down the east coast, past Achae and Nigo points, to Ipapao. From the latter point the coast consists of a vertical cliff, with here and there a small stretch of sandy beach along the sea between projecting points until it reaches Tumhun Bay. Ilere the coral forms a great reef flat, which continues along the coast southward, past llagadna Bay, as far as A papa, or Cabras, island. To the south of Orote Peninsula, which projects 4 miles in a northwest- erlv direction and forms the southern side of the bay of San Luis de Apra, a narrow reef flat juts out from the west coast at various promontories in the extension of spurs of volcanic slopes. At Maleso, or Memo, Bay a broad reef flat projects, which forms the southwestern extremity of the island of Guam and extends eastward to Point Hahahyan, but not as far as Inalahan Bay, on the east coast. North of that bay the coast is edged by a narrow reef Mat, which continues as far as Pago Bay. Along the east coast of the northern half of the island there is a narrow reef flat, bordering the precipitous shore from Hanom Point to Point Anao. The southern half of the island of Guam consists of what Mr. Agas- \u00ab The name of thin bay is improperly written on most charts \"Taragav,\" si word with no significance. \"Talage,\" (pronounced tal&gay) the vernacular name, signi- fies \" to look toward.\" Jt was the point from which the ancient Uhamorros looked out ioj vessels naming from the northern islands. 48 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM siz describes as \"a volcanic massif which has burst through the coral- liferous limestone,1' and which at Mount Tengho reaches to a height of more than a thousand feet. The volcanic range to which it belongs has burst through the limestone near Agana and extends southward, parallel to the west coast, at a distance of about 1 or 2 miles from the shore. Its highest peak, called Humuyong-manglo (\"Source-of-the- wind\"), back of Umata, reaches a height of 390 meters. Considerable denudation has already taken place on the volcanic slopes, forming in the interior of the island a number of peaks, ridges, and pinnacles. Ou the western and southern sides of the volcanic mountains the lime- stone masses which once covered their sides have in great measure dis- appeared through disintegration, and the soft material covering the slopes is constantly being washed down their sides. Many of the val- leys form small canyons with very steep walls. The peninsula of Orote and A papa Island are composed of elevated coralliferous limestone containing well-preserved fossils. These show no signs of metamorphism, as do those collected in the immediate vicinity of Mount Makahnag, where the limestone comes into contact with volcanic rock. The fossils arc, however, highly calcified, and their hardness and the crystallization of the rocks would seem to indi- cate considerable age. The haubok.\u2014The bay of San Luis do Aprs! is the only harbor for vessels. It is protected on the southwest by the promontory of Orote, on the east by the island of Guam itself, on the north by A pa pa island and the adjoining reef of Luminan, which is awash at high water. From this reef a bank (Kalalang) extends to the south westward toward Orote Point, terminating in two rocks which rise to within a few feet of the surface, leaving a narrow but deep channel, which serves as an entrance to the harbor. Apap& island consists entirely of elevated cor- alliferous limestone deeply pitted and honeycombed. The limestone mass is full of crevices, potholes, and funnels, covered with stalactites. The island does not rise more than 8 or 10 feet above high-water mark. The shore is undercut and the island furrowed by numerous gullies; it is full of caverns, crevices, and pits.\" As the harbor is much obstructed by coral reefs and is at a consid- erable distance from the seat of government of the island, a board of officers was sent to make a survey of it, with a view to its improve- ment, either by dredging or the construction of a breakwater along the reef, or both. It is intended to make it the site of a naval base and coaling depot of large capacity, as well as to serve as a commercial port. The board was directed to make recommendations as to the removal of reefs and other obstructions to navigation; to draw up plans for wharves, docks, storehouses, barracks, hospital, water sup- a See Agassiz, op. cit., p. 370. art RIHmKKTEP HARHOR IMPROVEMENTS. 49 ply, and so we rage system; port defenses, fortifications, and maga- zines; and to lay out a town site, having\" in view the prospective increase in commercial importance of the port.

It is broken, however, hy 8ever.il outlying reefs. It in protected except to the westward. Luminan Reef gives suilicient protection, hut KalAlang Bank, with a depth of some 30 feet, does not, the swell making round the end of Luminan Reef even with the prevailing northeasterly wind. It would therefore l>e necessary, in order to thoroughly close the harbor against the ocean wwell and atorms, to build a breakwater along these banks, extend- ing from Luminan Reef to Spanish Rocks, leaving a deep entrance between Spanish Rocks and Orote Island 2,000 feet wide. The board did not recommend that such a breakwater should be built, on account, among other considerations, of its great cost and the uncertainty of the force of storms against a breakwater on this narrow bank with deep water so close to seaward. Even if such a breakwater were built, the proposal which had been made of utilizing some of the coral reefs in the harbor as sites for coal depots could not be followed out, as test borings made in these reefs showed that nearly all of them are formed, not of solid coral, but of coral sand interspersed with occasional coral heads, with growing coral of various kinds on the sur- face, so that they would make poor foundations for retaining walls. After duly considering various plans the board recommended that an opening 30 feet deep be dredged through the reef separating the deep water of the main harbor from an inner basin south of the old fort, Santa Cruz, and not far from the village of Sumai on Orote Peninsula; that this basin be enlarged by dredging, and the top of a small reef in the outer anchorage, near Cabras Island, be removed to a depth of H fathoms; that the naval base and coaling station be established on Orote Peninsula, near Sumai, and be supplied with water brought from Paulana, a branch of the Atangtano River; that batteries be located on Orote Peninsula and Cabras Island with good military roads leading to them from the posts and boat landings; that the town site be established on the high land of Orote Peninsula, back of the naval station, and that commercial docks be constructed in places indicated by the board; and that a light-house be constructed on Orote Point with a light of the fourth order. The report of the board was published\" and handed to the Naval and Commerce Committees of Congress. An appropriation of $150,000 for the improvement of the harbor of San Luis de Apra passed the Senate, but the House failed to concur and the measure was lost.

With completion of the Panama canal this will undoubtedly become an important mercantile port of call.\" (See map, PI. LXX.) Earthquakes.\u2014Earthquakes are frequent, but not often violent. Among the most severe were those of April 14, 1825, January 25, 1840, and September 22, 1902. Not long after that of 1849, which destroyed the church and the government house of Umata, a number of Caroline Islanders arrived at Guam in two canoes, stating that their islands had been swept by enormous waves, and begging the governor to allow them to take up their residence in the Marianne Islands. In the letter book of Don Pablo Perez, in the archives at Agafia, a detailed account of this earthquake is given. The first shock was felt at 2:49 p. m. It was followed by repeated shocks and trembling accompanied by a subterranean rumbling \" which made the natives fear that a vol- cano was about to burst forth and blow them all to atoms.\" The earth was cracked open in many places, some houses were thrown down and others were injured; but the only life lost was that of a woman who happened to be in her rancho near the beach. She was carried away by one of the great waves which swept in from the ocean. Great masses of rocks fell from the cliffs. The shocks continued for several days in succession, and it was many days before the damages could be repaired. Sixteen whaling vessels lying at anchor in the harbor were uninjured. The captain of a whaling frigate which arrived shortly afterwards stated that he had felt the earthquake 1,000 miles to the eastward of the Mariannes. Since the American occupation of the island there have been a number of earthquakes, but the only one of serious importance was that of September 22, 1902. Governor Schroeder's account of this is almost a repetition of Don Pablo's report to the captain-general of the Philippines. The earthquake which occurred at 11.24 a. in. [says Governor Hchroeder] is the Beverest of which there is any record. From the government house terrace, during its continuance, there could be seen clouds of dust rising suddenly from the different quarters of Agafia as the masonry houses would fall. The earth opened here and there in small places, from which water would spout and subside, leaving a few round, apparently hollow pita, and innumerable fine cracks were observable every- where. A dull grinding roar preceded and accompanied the shaking of the earth; sure-footed bulls were tripped up and fell to their knees, while buildings rocked and swayed, water tanks were tossed over, and bells rung by the vibration. In other parts of the island fissures 1 to 2 feet wide were made, those of Piti emitting strong sulphurous fumes. Masses were dislodged in the mountains and hills, plowing down the slopes and completely blocking the road from Agafia to Piti at three points. In the harbor of San Luis de Apra the collier Justin, anchored in 22 fathoms of water, was severely shaken. The disturb- ance of the white coral-mud bottom of the harbor was so great as to a Report of the Secretary of the Navy for the year 1902, pp. 361-362. EXTINCT VOLCANOES. 51 give a milky appearance to the sea for .some distance around, A number of the masonry houses of Agana were destroyed, and those left standing were so badly injured as to be unfit for habitation. The old bell tower of masonry near the church, built in 1(W9, was seamed with large cracks. In the other towns of the island nearly all masonry houses, churches, and rectories were ruined. The collier Justin was sent the day after the disaster with an officer to the German island of Saipan, 120 miles to the northward, to ascertain the damage done and offer aid. They found no casualties, though the earthquake had also violently shaken the island. Fortunately the disaster occurred in the 1-- daytime, as did the hurricane of 1890, and the casualties included but one child killed and a few of the townspeople of Agana hurt. The total cost of repairs to government buildings was estimated at$22,lo0 gold. A summary of the earthquake phenomena of 1902 is included in Doctor Abbe's report, published in Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmos- pheric Electricity, 1901, page 81. Extinct volcanoes.\u2014All of the mountain peaks of Guam are undoubtedly of volcanic origin. In some of them the outlines of the craters may still be traced and the lava presents the same appearance as in recent volcanoes.a Surrounding the bases of the mountains are ancient coral reefs, the margins of which, in contact with the volcanic products, have in many places been converted into crystalline lime- stone, showing evidence of volcanic activity after the whole island had been raised from the sea. The heights of the principal mountains are approximately as follows: Santa Rosa 265 meters, Tiyan (Barri- gada) 205 meters, Makahnag 215 meters, Chachao Tengho 310 meters, Tlicho (Huinuyong-manglo) 390 meters, Sanalaguan (Hell mountain), at the southern end of the island, 340 meters. Ancient coral reefs.\u2014The entire northern portion of the island is a raised coral platform penetrated in several places by the low volcanic peaks already referred to. On the west side of the island between the mesa and the sea several distinct flat terraces occur, showing succes- sive upheavals. During the recent earthquakes the general level of the whole island was raised. It would require only a very slight ele- vation to convert into dry land the very extensive reef Hats along the west coast which are covered at high tide by only a few feet of water. The bottom between the shore and the barrier reef is perfectly level and covered with very fine sand resembling flour in consistency. Minerals. \u2014 With the exception of thin layers of iron-ore, no metal- yielding deposits occur on the island. An inferior lignite is found in one or two places. There is also a volcanic rock called houion, which is used for fire places, and a soft pale-green mineral called lauka which a This is especially true of Santa Rosa, in the northern part of tin; island. 52 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM is easily worked. In certain localities nodules of flint are found simi- lar to those from Kuropean chalk formations. Kiveks.\u2014In the northern portion of the island the ground is so porous that the water disappears as it falls. There are, however, a number of sink holes called lupog, and in the rainy season several small streams near the bases of the hills of Santa Rosa and Mataguag. Near the middle of the island about a mile and a half from Agana there is a tine large spring or lake (Matan hanom) from which a copious supply of water issues all the year round. This, after slowly oozing through the great swamp called the \" Ci6naga,\" forms the Agana River, the channel of which has been artificially length- ened and turned for about a mile parallel to the coast before it reaches the sea. This is for the purpose of affording a laundry to the women of Agana. In the southern portion of the island there are a number of small streams on both sides, some of which lose themselves beneath the surface for a time and reappear, issuing from caverns.\u00ae VEGETATION OF THE ISLAND. PLANT COVERING AOOOKDINO TO HABITAT. COltAL HEJSK9. Among the algae growing on the reef the most conspicuous are the brown l'adinas with fan-like fronds expanded like the tail of a strut- ting peacock, jointed Halimedus, like miniature green and succulent, looks as though it bore bunches of minia- ture grapes. Among the red algie arc dense foliaceous fronds, somewhat like Chondrus in form, and conspicuous fruit. From some of the gelati- nous species the natives make blancmange. Among the more delicate green forms are the woolly Rhlzochmlum, tortmsum and the beau- tiful little Jiryopsis plumom. Near mouths of rivers grow Enteromorpha clathrata and K eompressa, with narrow, linear, grass- like fronds. (See Alt/w, catalogue.) Among the marine flowering plants are ITalodulv unint-rvu^ a plant resembling a fine eel grass (Zos- tera), and llalophila ovata, belonging to the Vallisneriaceae, with a creeping rootstock and oval or linear-oblong petioled leaves. MANfiROVE SWAMPS. At the mouths of many streams, where the water is brackish and the shores are muddy, are growths of mangroves and their allies, \u00abThe principal cavern of this nature is that in the valley of the TalofOfO River, til tout a mile from its mouth. RIVER AiJD STRAND VEGETATION 53 which form dense thickets and extend far out into the water at high tide. Among those which send down aerial roots into the mud are Rhisophvra mucrtmata (PI. LXIV) and Bruguiera gymnorhiza (PI. XL), both of which have large, opposite, entire, smooth leaves, and fruit which germinates before dropping from the tree. They are easily distinguished, the former having a four-parted perianth and the latter having 10 to 14 calyx segments and petals. Associated with these are found red-flowered Lumnitzeras, small trees belonging to the (Jombre- taceae; Xyfomrpm grmiatvm (C'ara/Hi molucceiiHit), known in the East Indies as the \"cannon-ball tree,'\" on account of its hard, spherical fruits; and on adjacent firmer ground, Km wear la agallocka, some- times called the \"milky mangrove\" or the u blinding tree,\" the acrid juice of which is called \"tigers milk\" in the East Indies. RIVEKS. Near the mouths of most of the rivers, where the water is brackish, are thickets of Nypa frutuxms, a stem less palm with great pinnate leaves, which furnish the natives with excellent material for thatching their houses. Associated with it are large simply pinnate ferns, Acrostlehum amuum, (PI. IV), of wide distribution throughout the warmer regions of the globe, and growing submerged are species of Potamogeton and Rupjmi maritima. There are also green, filamentous algtti, including species of Conferva and Enteromorpha, and Char a Jibrosa. Near the sources of some of the streams a small red alga (Thorea gaudichaudii) is found growing to rocks. On the banks of the rivers near the sea beds of Pancratium littorale occur, together with a creeping aroid, (Jocos nucifera, screw pines, and Parti/ tilmcY'trm. Higher up the stream there are beds of reeds (Trichoon) and, on the open hillsides, the sword grass, Xiplu>a(jr< >Ht) xfl<>tvV7uht. Where streams flow through shady forests several cordate leaved aroids occur, together with a tree fern {AlxojkMla and the widely spread Angivp- teris evecta (PI. THE STRAND. The principal is Ipomoea pufi-rajwae, often called \"goats- foot convolvulus,\" from the shape of its leaves. Its long, prostmte stems form a carpet over the sand without twining or taking root, and bear large, rose-purple, funnel-shaped flowers.

On the windward side of the island, and near the southern end on the leeward side, growing in the sandy beach at the very margin of the sea are groves of Cmuarlmi eqnlmti- folla (PI. XLI), trees with tufts of linear, leafless, jointed branches resembling horsetails (Equisetum) and cone-like fruit. Among other beach plants are the composites Stemmodontla biflora, H. canmcenx, Ediptib alba, the flora, and the bidens-like Glomogyne tenuifolia; and in places there are mounds formed by Semmmti po-rtulaemtrum, the \" sea purslane,'\"1 often asso- ciated with creeping grasses. Coconuts are abundant on the west coast of the island (PI. I), but almost absent from the east coast. THE INNER BEACH. The principal trees forming the inner beach growth Climbing on trunks of trees are a num- ber of ferns, including Phymatodmphymaiodex (PI. LXII), small, linear-lanceolate, simple fronds, Davallia solida, with beautiful, glossy, divided fronds, and Ilumata heterophylla, with fertile fronds differing from the sterile in shape (PI. LIII). In addition to the above-mentioned .species there are a number of shrubs growing in the vicinity of the beach\u2014the beach plum {Xhnenia amerwawi), Clerodendron yellow heads of fragrant Leucaena glrnica, with similar heads of white, inodorous flowers; and the custard apple, Annima reticulata, the only species of this genus which grows sponta- neously on the island. Twining among these shrubs are several species of Convolvulaceae, including Ipmnoea c/ioiv'ana and (Argyrem tiliaefolia), flowers of which, called \"abubo,\" are strung into gar- lands by the children; and (tpei'culina jieltata, xfhyvXi has white flowers. TIT E CLIFFS. On the promontory of Orote on the west coast, that of Kiroga on the east near Talofofo Bay, on the rocky island of Cabins, or A papa, and on the edges of cliffs are usually found the following plants: Otr- wigonw mariannenaix, a shrub or small tree belonging aceae, with j' I.

Among the smaller plants growing on rocky slopes is Gynopogmi tm*re~ wami*) with glossy, myrtle-like leaves and the aromatic fragrance of the \"maiie\" (Gynopogon olivatftrntiix) so dear to the Hawaiians. FORKfSTS. The forest vegetation of Guam (PI. II) consists almost entirely of strand trees, epiphytal ferns, lianas, and a few undershrubs. The majority of the species arc included in what Schimper has called the Barringtonia Formation.\" The principal trees are the wild, fertile the Indian almond, banyan (PI. XII), called nunu by the natives (Ficmsji.); two other species of Ficus called \"hodda\" and \"takete\" or \"taguete,\" the first with prop-like, aerial roots growing from the trunk near its base and with fruit resembling small, red crab apples and the second resembling the nunu, but with aerial roots from the trunk only and not from the limbs; Pan- danusfragram (\"kafo\") (PI. LX) and Pandantts dtMm (\"pahong\"), screw pines which differ from many of their congeners in not being found growing on the outer beach; Cahphyllum inophyllmn, a handsome tree known in the East Indies as Alexandrian laurel, which yields the tough crossgrained wood of which the natives make their cart wheels; liawingtonia racemosa, which, unlike its congener, JL spicifmiy leaves the coast and follows along the banks of the streams into the interior; Ileritiera littoralix (PI. LII), called in India the look- ing-glass tree, which furnishes the natives of Guam with tough wood for their plows and wheel spokes; and, among recently introduced trees, Canangium odomtuw, the fragrant flowers of which are the source of the perfume known as ilangilang, Amuma retioulata, the custard apple or bullock's heart, and Pithecolobium dulce, a leguminous tree known in the East Indies as the Manila tamarind, but which was brought from Mexico for the sake of its tannin-yielding bark and its edible pods. No truly indigenous palms occur, but Areca cathecu, the betel-nut palm, grows spontaneously in damp places; a small, slender- stemmed species allied to Areca, called \"palma brava\" by the natives, is gradually spreading over the island; and the Caroline Island \"sago- palm,\" (Jodoecoewi amicarumy introduced sparingly.

Ill), with glossy divided fronds, and the interest- ing ITumata heterophylla (PI. LIU), which takes its generic name from the village of Humatag, or (Jniata. on the west coast of this island, where it was first collected. Beneath the shade of the forest trees several undershrubs are usually found, including species of Icacorea, Piper, Peperomia, and the creeping rubiaceous Carinta herlntcea, with small white flowers and scarlet berries. On the edges of the woods and by roadsides are thickets of the spiny Guilandmu erist.a, bearing the well-known gray, stony \" nicker-nuts,\" the sharp recurved thorns of its branches catch- ing or scratching every animal which brushes against them (PL LI). Lemoncito thickets (Triphama are also common, the bushes sprouting from the roots and hearing fragrant, white, jasmine-like flowers and scarlet berries resembling miniature oranges. Among the succulent plants are wild ginger {ZinstbtT the introduced Taetxia, a liliaceous plant with graceful tufts of red leaves. Besides the climbing and epiphytal ferns already mentioned there are many others growing on including ferns (Hymenophyllaceao) have been found on the island.

The fresh-water marshes arc usually overgrown with reeds (Trichoon roxbmyhli\\ associated with the great marsh fern {Aemxti.chi.tm atireum) (PI.

The only trees are Pariti tiliae.emti and a euphorbiaceous tree called \"aloin,\" probably a species of Echinus, Growing about the margins of swamps are the small Baeopa monniera^ a creeping scrophulariaceous plant with blue flowers and the habit of growth of purslane; Ambulia indica and A. fray mux, with an aromatic, camphor- like odor; Cent el la mlatim, the Asiatic pennywort; Aewhyuomeve indica j a species of Polygonum; and the water fern (Ceratopterm gaudichaudii), which has edible fronds. Several large aroids occur both cultivated and growing spontaneously, among them the common taro (Caladium colocanut), the caulescent Alocasia hemp\" {Muaatext Hih)^ grows in several places, but it is not now cultivated by the natives. At least two species of bamboo grow on the island, the most useful and durable of which {Bainhw blumeana) is armed with recurved spines and forms impenetrable thickets in several places. SAVANNAS. These are grassy upland regions almost devoid of trees and shrubs. They are characterized by a red clay-like soil and lack of drainage, and by the reappearance of beach plants and marsh plants which are absent from the forests. Xiphewjrostix flnridtda, which covers large areas, is called \" sword grass\" by foreigners on account of the cutting scabrous edges of its leaves (PI. LXIX). It grows higher than a man's head and offers refuge for deer. Roofs thatched with this grass are more durable than those of coconut or of nipa palm leaves, but more work is necessary in their preparation and they are not common except in regions where coconuts and nipa palms are scarce. Other savanna plants are the bracken-like fern (r u rats- foot\" of the Ilawaiians), and the little golden star grass IlypoaiH (tiirea. The only tree is the ironwood (C<(marina cqitixetifolia), which also grows on the margin of the sea. Among other beach plants which reappear lie re are the shrubs Lobelia lcoenupi, marsh fern Lyyaditrm scandem is common, and the lavender-flowered morning glory Ipmaoea chozsiana also occurs. 58 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM ABANDONED OI.EA KINGS. Abandoned clearings are usually overgrown either with common tropical weeds, thickets formed by hedge plants, plants once cultivated which have continued to grow, or indigenous species which usually grow on the edge of the forest or in open places. Among the tropi- cal weeds of wide The principal hedge plants now forming thickets are the orange berry {Triphasia trifoliata); the \" tarigantangan \" in Guam, and \" lead tree \" in the British West Indies; and the well-known opoponax, Aea<Mi fame- siana, which bears yellow globular heads fragrant flowers. Twining among these bushes are Abrus abrus (PI. XXXII), which bears the tiny eyes; the spiny yam {Dioscorea' the thickets impenetrable; Cmsytha filiform in, a leafless, wiry parasite, sometimes called laurel-dodder; and several Leguminosae, including the yam bean, or Cacara Argyreia tiHaefolm, the flowers of which, called abubo, are strung into garlands by the children; and the white- flowered Operculma peltata. On the sites of abandoned gardens are found trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, both indigenous to the island and introduced, which the natives usually plant near their houses. Among them are Oalo- phyllum inophyllum, and of lemon grass {Andvopogmi nardux). of these are self-propagating. The introduced Canangium odoratum (ilangilang tree), which the natives plant for the sake of its fragrant flowers, is gradually spreading over the island through the medium of fruit pigeons. These birds are also fond of the fruit of the ink berry PLANTS OF ABANDONED CLEARINGS. 59 (Cestmvm pallidtmt), the lemoncito or orange berry the piod or beach plum {Xhnenia amerieana), which they spread in the same way. Pineapples continue to grow for years where they arc planted, and in old garden .spots fire found plants of the intro- duced cassava plant, or mandioca {Manifwt mamhot). Among the trees and shrubs which do not spread of their own accord in Guam are the tamarind, the cashew nut {Anacardimn oe<ddentale), the tree which in is called the \"golden shower1' {(JaxsiajiMula), the pome- granate, the ornamental Phy llaureas, Aralias, and Acanthaceae of the gardens. It is interesting to note that of the three Annonas introduced into the island the custard apple or bullocks- heart (A. reticidata) is the only species found wild, the soursop (A. muricata) (PI. XXXIV), and the sweet-sop or sugar apple (A. sqvamosa) (PI, XXXV), growing only where planted. Among the plants which on account of their sterility must be planted by man are the textile screw pine or aggag (Paadanus ktow), only one sex of which grows are seldom known to produce seed; sweet potatoes, which are propagated by cuttings, and bananas and plan- tains, which are seedless and must be grown from root suckers. Young plants of Agave- mvijmra, which the natives call \" lirio de palo\" or the \"tree lily,\" are often found growing in circles, with the dead mother plant at the center. Whole fields are overgrown with guava bushes, just as in the Hawaiian Islands and many other tropical countries; but the.common Ian tana {Lantava eamara) and the sensitive plant (M'mwtut pudkw), which are pests in so many parts of the world, have, fortunately, not yet found their way to Guam. Among the plants which have escaped from gardens are the pretty blue pea {Olitorla ternatea); the crimson-flowered cypress vine hair1' Locfmera sometimes known as the Madagascar peri- winkle; the marvel of Peru, or four-o'clock (Mir a b H i-s' jal apa), and the touch-me-not or garden balsam {Impatient fadminina). Tomatoes bearing small fruit, either oval or globular, are also found growing near abandoned gardens, and occasionally gourd vines (Lagenavia lagenaria) are seen bearing bottle-shaped fruit. On the edges of clearings, growing in partial shade, are two bur- bearing plants called \"dadangse\" (stickers) by the natives: [Trend xiuuata, a malvaccous five-lobed leaves flowers, and Tvlnmfrtta rhomlxyidea, belonging to the Tiliaceae, with simple leaves and inconspicuous yellow flowers. The fruit of both is 60 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM armed with hooked prickles and catches upon the clothing of men and the fur of animals, so that these plants are common along roadsides.

The in large falcate, lubricating AUK ENVIRONS. Besides the trees mentioned above as growing on the sites of aban- doned gardens many others arc planted about the villages. Oranges, lemons, limes, citrons, shaddocks, and bergamots are common. In many gardens grow the pomegranate, atis, or sugar apple rounded by a red coloring matter; coffee which yields abundant crops; bananas and plantains of several varieties; vines of betel pepper {IVper betle) covering trees and walls; bushes of the fragrant henna, or \" cina- niomo\" (Lawwiria hiermix), which in Jamaica is called tree; the oleander, crape myrtle, and scarlet hibiscus, planted for the sake of their flowers, and ornamental species of Phyllaurea, and of Acanthaceae and Araliaceae, planted for the sake of their foliage. Along the roadsides arc fine mango trees; Mdia azedamch, the \" pride of India,\" bearing clusters of lavender flowers with dark violet stamens; the horse-radish tree (Morhiga moringa) grandiflora^ seed pods; Poinciana ptdcfuvT/'ma, called \"flower fence\" in the British West. bearing racemes of beau- tiful red and yellow (lowers; the Indian almond (T<wnmafta mtappa), here called \"talisai,\" a handsome tree with a straight trunk, whorls of horizontal branches, and large, glossy, deciduous leaves, which turn red before falling off.

Of the last species I know of but one tree, which grows on the ranch of Don Jose de Leon Guerrero in the district called Lalo. There are also one or two date palms, but they have not been known to fruit. The occurrence on the island of Cunurt-nm- eonumtne has been recorded, but the writer has not seen this species. This is the tree called in Manila \"brea blanca\" (white pitch), which yields the valuable resin known in commerce as Manila \"clemi\" and the nuts called oranges were introduced by the writer. All of them grew well at first, but the avocados were killed bv a heavv rain, and it is not known whether the others arc still living. Two trees of mandarin oranges grow in the garden of Don Jose Herrero in the district of San Ramon, Agana, and opposite his house is a vigorous sapodilla tree {Sapota zapotilUt). The mandarin trees bear very good fruit, but the sapodilla (here called \"chica\") has never borne. The durian {Durio zibethiiim), the lanzon {Ltmsium. ), so and the man- gosteen {(larcinia intdHjoxtana) do not occur on the island. Grapes and the edible fig {Fiats car lea) have been introduced but do not thrive well. PLANTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST. I'XIDENTIFIKI) THKKH AND KII KIT IIS. Among the trees and shrubs of the island there arc a number men- tioned by early collectors and by the Spanish governors in their official reports which have not yet been identified. It is a well-known fact that many tropical forest trees yielding important commercial woods, resins, gums, balsams, and medicines are not yet known to science. This is in most cases owing to the difficulty of preparing good botan- ical specimens of such plants for the herbarium. In this connection Mr. O. F. Cook, of the United States Department of Agriculture, writes as follows: The size itnelf millers it difficult to olwerve a tree as a whole or to bring mimcrotiH individuals under tins eye at, 0111:0, 11s may W (lone with smaller plants. Moreover, trees can not Ik; preserved as complete upecimens, and only small fragments can be accommodated for ready reference in the herbarium. Nevertheless, the task may 62 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. be said to be comparatively simple with the trees of tc\u00bbi{>erate climates, where forests are comparatively open and frequently comjiosed of only a few kinds of trees or, perhaps, of a single species. In the Tropics a natural forest of one species is practi- cally unknown; hundreds of kinds grow indiscriminately mixed together. Crowded together in tropical forests trees have nothing like the shapes or habit* they would assume if standing alone. All are putting forth, as it were, their best efforts to grow tall,and thus secure as much sunlight as possible. Their leaves and branches are inextricably confused, interlaced with climbing plank, and encuml>ered with para- sites and epiphytes. To cut down a particular tree may be iiajwissible unless one is willing to clear a large neighboring area to permit it to fall. Unless the botanist finds a clearing his opportunities for securing even the desired fragments of branches with leaves, flowers, and fruit may be extremely few. Hence, our knowledge of tropical trees is still in the early pioneer stages.\" Among the trees mentioned by Gaudichaud under their vernacular the list of woods forwarded by Governor Olive to the captain-gen- eral of sumai, sumaclacla, uniunio, yoga. Only a few of these trees have been identified. Good specimens of all arc desirable for herbaria. Among the unidentified shrubs arc several species which Gaudi- chaud referred to the genus Pavetta, called by the natives \" utud,\" \"otud\" or \" utug,\" \"sesbu\" or \" sosbu,\" and \"guaguabug.\" Another shrub not yet determined, having a disgusting fetid odor and flowers growing in axillary and terminal umbels, is called by the natives *' pau-dedo.\" GROUPS WHICH ARB NOT WELL KNOWN. Certain families of plants have not been well worked up, such as the Apocynaceae, Rubiaceae, Verbcnaceae, Urticaccae, and Euphorbiaceae. Among the first there are certain seaside shrubs allied to Cerbera referred to by Gaudichaud under the name of ltuuwolfia and Plumiera. One of these is probably Ochrosia marianneiisis, but the others are not yet known. Among the Rubiaceae are several small shrubs allied to the genus Ixora. Among the Verbcnaceae the Guam plants belong- ing to the genera Premna and Vitex should be compared with series from other localities, and it is probable that there is a second species of Clerodendron, with bitter leaves, which has not yet been recorded. There are several species of Phyllanthus, Euphorbia, and Glochidion which have not yet been collected as well as a few Myrtaceae. \"Cook, Culture Central American Rubber Trees, U. S. Dept. Agr., Bur. Plant Industry, Bull. 49, p. 18, 1U03. PLANTS FIRST KNOWN FROM GUAM 63 Very little is known of the algae, and still less of the fungi, lichens, mosses, and hepatics of the island. As in every part of the tropical world, there is much uncertainty about the various forms of cultivated yams, aroids, bananas, plantains, and breadfruit, and complete botanical specimens of these should be obtained, together with photographs of the growing plants, their flowers, fruits, and roots, and notes of the odor of the flowers and flavor of the fruit or roots. Similar work should be done on the screw pines of the island in order that careful comparisons may be made with the species and well-defined varieties from other parts of the world. Notes of particular methods of propagation, cultivation, and preparation for use are also valuable. The bamboos are not definitely known, and the entire genus Ficus, which includes the banyans, remains to be worked up. Special efforts should be made to get photo- graphs of flowering bamboos and aroids. GUAM TYI'ES. To the botanical collector the most desirable species are those which were first described from type specimens collected on this island. Some of these original types are in very poor condition or arc incom- plete, lacking fruit or flowers or leaves from various parts of the plant or a representation of one of the sexes, and the identity of others is not well established, owing to the lack of a sufficient number to form a series for comparison with closely allied species from other locali- ties. The handsome caper growing on the rocky shores of the island (CapjHirw mariana Jacq.) is supposed to be a variety of Capparh spinoaaj\" Claoxylon marianum Mull. Arg. taiteme of Tahiti; Ipomoea ntariannenms^ a plant which has never been figured, should be compared with the American Ipoinoea triloha; the epiphytal fleshy-leaved pared with Dischidia benghalensis, for which it was first mistaken by Gaudichaud; the fragrant Gynopoywi torrtsianus of Guam should be compared with the allied species from other Pacific islands; a series of specimens of Metastoma Tnarianum should be secured for compari- son with the closely allied Melastoma denticulatum and M. malahath- ricum of Polynesia and the East Indies. The Guam Pipers and Peperomias need further study, and the Guam types of species of Ochrosia, also be secured. YAMS, BANANAS, AND BREADFRUIT. Many distinct kinds of yams (Dioscorea), bananas (Musa), and breadfruit (Artocarpus) are recognized wherever these plants are cul- a See Schumann, Flora deutschuu ost-asiatisehen Schutzgebiettw, p. 201, 1888. 64 USKFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. tivated, but very little has boon done to fix the species and varieties and to compare those growing in different parts of the world. Yams are duEcious, and the flowers of many recognized varieties arc imper- fectly known. In some cases the flowers of but a single sex have been described; in others the fruit has never been observed, and in others only the tubers arc known. Sir Joseph Hooker/f who has done much to straighten out the Indian species, writes as follows: The species of Dioscorea are in a state of indescribable confusion, and I can not hope to have escaped errors in the determination and delimitation of the Indian ones, to which I have devoted much labor. The Itoxburghian food-yielding species are for the most part indeterminable, and, except through a knowledge of them aw cultivated in India, they can not be understood. No doubt some of the siteeies described by me have other earlier names in the Malayan flora than I have given; but the Malayan species are even more loosely described than the Indian. The Wallichian collection is very complete, but the species are often mixed. What has been said of the Indian yams applies also to those of the IJacific islands, and is also true of the many varieties of Musa and Artocarpus. Nearly every collector gives a list of named varieties of Dioscorea, Musa, and Artocarpus in the vernacular of the various localities visited, but scarcely any attempt has been made to fix these varieties and to bring together the various kinds from different local- ities for comparison. These must be studied in the countries where they are found and should lie represented in collections not only by series of botanical specimens of the flowers, fruit, leaves, and roots (in alcohol, when necessary), but by photographs of the fresh plants, including representations of the flowers, fruits, tubers, etc., of natural size or according to some definite scale of reduction or enlargement. In this way only will it be possible to bring together and compare species and varieties from India, Australia, the Malayan and Pacific islands, Africa, and America. SCREW PINES. The Pandanaceae are known no better than the vams. Some of them are propagated asexually for the sake of their textile leaves, and much confusion exists among the species. Very few have been described. Warburg has done much to delimit the species and varieties and clear up questions of synonymy, but there remains much more to be done. In his monograph of the Pandanaceae6 Warburg mentions only one species, Pandanm diibim Spreng. {llombronm editfis Gaudich.), as occurring in the Marianne Islands, and does not refer to the textile species with glaucous leaves (the aggakoi the natives), which has been cultivated in Guam from prehistoric times (PI. VII), nor the fragrant- fruited species with bright green leaves (hifo), which is one of the most common plants of the island (PI. LX).

HANYAN8, MANGROVES, ANI) EPIPHYTES OF THE FOREST. Of special interest on account of their method of germination and growth a re the giant banyans (/'Vc'/.y spp.) of the forest, arid certain epiphytal cryptogams and other plants. The banyans usually begin their existence upon other trees, sending down aerial roots which interlace and grow together, clasping the trunk of their host and eventually strangling it. They then lead an independent existence, their great spreading limbs sending down more roots, which are like pendent threads at first, but soon thicken after gaining a foothold in the earth, and serve as columns to support the great dome of foliage overhead, as well as to supply it with nourish- ment and moisture (PI. VIII). The chief interest in the mangroves (Rhizophora and Iiruguiera) lies in the fact that their fruit germinates while still attached to the tree, the spindle-shaped radicle perforating the apex of the fruit, elongating and hanging vertically downward. When the fruit falls the radicle sticks into the soft mud below, retaining an upright position, like, a stake thrust into the ground, and resisting the current of the tide as it ebbs and flows. The forest epiphytes are not well known, owing to the difficulty in collecting them. Care should be taken to visit clearings where forest land is being prepared for planting. In such places good material can undoubtedly be collected. The most interesting epiphyte thus far col lected in Guam is D'm-hidia pnlx-riila* which belongs to a genus hav- ing some of their fleshy leaves modified into urn-like receptacles. These usually contain water, and the adventitious roots of the stem often creep into them, as if for nourishment or moisture. PLANTS THAT SLREi', Among the Guam plants there arc a number which exhibit in a marked degree the phenomenon known as li sleep movements,\" folding their leaves each night and opening them again at sunrise. Some of them (Acver/n fnrm'Hiana and Ahvux ahn(H< PI. XXXII), arc so sensi- tive to changes in the intensity of light that they go to sleep if the sky suddenly becomes overcast, and wake up when the sun reappears. Most of these plants are leguminous, but there is one remarkable 9773\u201405 5 60 USEFUL PLANTS OF OIJAM. example belonging to the Oxalidaceae. This is Arert'hoa caramlwla, the \" bilimbinesof the natives, a tree which yields a pellucid oval- shaped, five-angled fruit. (PI. XXXVII.) Its foliage is not only sensitive to light and darkness, sunshine and shade, but also to sudden mechanical shocks, the leaves bending and their leaflets folding very much as in the case of the sensitive plant (jmdica). Besides the above-mentioned plants are several species of Cassia, Caesalpinia, Enjlhrhui hid tea and other Leguminosae; and, among the Euphor- biaceae, two or three species of Phyllanthus and Euphorbia. PLANTS WHICH SELDOM HLOO.M. Many plants grow spontaneously on the island which in many other parts of the world are seen only in a state of cultivation. The plant which produces the celebrated \"Mhea\"' fiber, Boehnwna tmacbuma^ which in cultivation is herbaceous and seldom flowers, grows spontane- ously in Guam in the form of a shrub or small tree, called in the island 4- ' ' vernacular \"amahayan/' Specie's of Colocasia and Alocasia, which seldom bloom in cultivation, and which are classified according to their inflorescence, here appear to grow in a state of nature. Their soft, fleshy spathes should be collected and preserved in alcohol or formalin for comparison with species and varieties from other localities. Bam- boos also are among the plants which seldom flower. The species growing in Guam have not yet been identified with certainty owing to the lack of good specimens of inflorescence. In cultivation all the plants here mentioned are propagated asexually, and are divided into a number of varieties. l'LANTS WITH EXTRA FLORA I NECTARIES. There are perhaps few localities which ofl'er better facilities for the observation of extrafloral nectaries. Here within a small area, grow- ing not in conservatories, but in a state of nature, may be observed a remarkably large number of plants having glands on the midribs, veins, petioles, or rachis of their leaves, or on the peduncles, pedicels, or sepals of their flowers. Among them arc species of Cassia, Eryth- rina, and Acacia, with stalked disk or cup-like glands, and, belonging to the Euphorbiaeeae, the candle-nut (Aleurites) and the well-known castor bean with well-marked nectaries at the junction of the blade and the petiole of the leaf. litcinuH comnmnh is especially well provided with these nectar glands. They occur on the nodes of the stem, aiong the petioles of the leaves, and the serrations of the leaf blades (PI. IX, fig. %), as well as at the base of the blade where it is joined by the petiole. At this point there are usually two nectaries, though there may be but one, or there may be three or four when the leaf has a greater number of lobes than usual. Many of the Euphorbiaeeae Corny.

The above description applies very nearly to the stipulary nectaries of Kicinus, a photograph of a cross section of which, made by Mr, Ii. rl. Howard, of the United States Department of Agriculture, is shown in Plate IX, fig. 1. Among the Malvaceae growing in (iuam several arc provided with nectar glands on the underside of the midrib. These arc most con- spicuous in i'retm sinuata, occurring not. only on the midrib, but some- times on the main lateral ribs of the palmate leaves. They also occur on all leaves of cotton ((rimyfrit* t>t sp.) and on the midrib of Paritl tilhicenm (PI. X, fig. %), in the form of vaginate glands. A photo- graph of a cross section of the nectar gland of a cotton leaf, also made by Mr. Howard, is shown in Plate X, tig. 1. The sweet fluid secreted by these glands is eagerly sought by sugar- loving insects, ;ind a number of authors maintain that the power of secreting it has been specially gained by plants for the sake of attract- ing ants and wasps, which will serve as defenders against caterpillars, leaf-cutting insects, or other enemies; but Darwin,6 after a series of observations, could not see anv reason to believe this to be so with the species observed by him, although the fact that these glands are visited by insects for the sake of their nectar can be verified at any time of the day when the sun is shining, and these insects must servo as a protection for them. It is interesting to note that these glands niav occur in one species und bo absent from another closely allied to * J * it of the same genus. Indeed, there are species in which the glands are present on some leaves and absent from others, and of their vari- ability we have already spoken in connection with Kicinus and I rena. A \u00ab I \" Annals of liotany, vol. S, p. 22S, 1SSJ4. H'ross and self fertilization, pp. 403, 404, JS77. HSKFUL PLANTS OF GUAM On this account Delpino\" argues that these glands ought not to be regarded as excretory, since if they were so, they would be more constant and would occur in every species. Their variability is especially noticeable in the genus Cassia, where the tiny cup-shaped nectaries may be found on the petioles of some species and the rachis of others, but are absent from both in others. If they performed some necssary function it is hard to believe that thev would not occur in all the species. One thing is certain, they arc more highly developed and more active in the young and tender leaves and about opening leaf buds than on the older and tougher leaves, which are less tempting to herbivorous animals, and more able to resist their attacks; and whatever may be the truth regarding the presence of these glands in general, Helt has shown conclusively'' that the bull's-horn acacia of Central America {Acacia xph<(eroceph<ila) not only attracts stinging ants bv its nectaries, but offers them as an additional attraction daintv food rich in oil and protoplasm in the form of small bodies at the end of the divisions of the compound leaflets, which the ants gather when ripe and carry to their homes in the stout hollow thorns of the plant itself. The fruit-like bodies do not ripen all at once, but successively, so that the ants are kept about the young leaf for some time after it unfolds, and Helt arrived at the conclusion that the ants are really kept by the acacia aw a standing army, to protect its leaves from the attacks of herbivorous mammals and insects. In the same way there is a succes- sion of active nectaries about the tender voting leaf buds and flower clusters of Rieinus, which are constantly visited by wasps and ants; and the important part played by the nectar glands in the petioles of the cotton leaf (PI. X) as an attraction to ants which serve to protect the plant from the boll weevil and other injurious insects has recently awakened great interest and lias been turned to economic account/ PLANTS WITH PltOTECTIVE DEVICES. Interesting examples of self-protection are offered by several plants growing in Guam, the most striking of which is that of the spiny yam, IHosewm ftjyhioxa. This plant grows spontaneously oil the island and in places forms impenetrable thickets. It takes its name not from the small prickles on the stem but from a mass of spines surrounding the base of the stem and serving as a protection to the starchy tubers below from hogs and other enemies. This species has often been con- fused with Dioseorea aculeata, the cultivated prickly yarn in Guam, called \" nika,\" which it resembles in the form of its broad heart-shaped \" liapporti tra insetti e tra nettarii Naturalist in Nicaragua, p. 21S, 1S74.

XLIX,) It is very distinct, however, in having about its base the mass of spines referred to. Thcv are wiry and branching, and have very much the appearance of sharp compound fishhooks. In reality they are lateral roots which differ from typical monocotyledonous roots in their hard woody structure and the absence of root caps. Mr. T. G. Hill and Mrs. W. (t. Freeman, who made a study of the root structure of an allied species growing in Africa, found that \"the lateral roots form the actual spines. They only exhibit normal root-structures at the extreme apex; elsewhere the phloem strands travel regularly throughout the whole area of the stele, while the xylern is more or less restricted to the central region. The hardness both of the main roots and the spines is due to the thickening and lignitication of the con- junctive tissue of the stele.\"\" Whether or not these spines have been specially developed for the purpose of protecting the edible tuber may be questioned, but that they do protect it is certain. Among the principal food staples of Guam is the taro, (JaJadimn mlvcmia, a plant of the Arum family. Both the land and water varie- ties (1*1. XXIV) are found invariably to have their smooth, succulent, satiny leaves free from the ravages of snails, insects, or herbivorous animals. Cattle and chickens delight in nipping off the young leaves of bananas and plantains; deer often inflict serious injury on a young coconut plantation in a single night; breadfruit trees suffer from the attacks of all herbivorous animals, and must be protected from them\u2014 fruit, leaves, and bark; and even tobacco will be devoured in the field by insect larvae unless it if* carefully watched and attended. On chew- ing a small portion of a taro leaf, the cause of its safety from attack is at once apparent. The tongue, roof of the mouth, and lining of the throat seem to be pierced by a thousand tiny needle*. The allied Alocasiae, plants also belonging to the Araceae, called klpiga\" by the natives of Guam, are so very acrid that the skin is sometimes slung bv merely rubbing against one of their leaves. Not onlv is the root of the taro edible, but the tender young leaves are eaten like spinach or asparagus. When not thoroughly cooked, however, they retain their acridity, and in Polynesia it is a common occurrence to expe- rience an intense inflammation or burning of the throat after a meal of savory taro tops cooked with cocoanut custard. Tlirough the courtesy of Dr. H. W. Wiley, Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, Tinted States Department of Agriculture, a careful chem- ical and histolngical examination of fresh taro plants was made for me by Mr. Lyman F. Kebler and Mr. B. J. Howard. The result of their examination and experiments tends to corroborate the theory that the burning sensation experienced on chewing the leaves is not caused by an acrid fluid, but by minute needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate 4 * \" Annals n[ l>otuny, vol. 17? p. 4KJ, HHKi. 70 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. (1*1. XJ) contained in their tissue. Many plants in whirl) those crys- tals arc found are not. acrid to the taste, but most of the Araceae, including our own Indian turnip, or jack-in-the-pulpit, are intensely so. In some plants the crystals are developed singly in a cell of the parenchyma; in other cases they are in the form of a radiating clus- ter, while in others, including several families of monocotyledons, they form compact bundles, called raphides. These raphidos are .some- times found in a cell which can not be easily separated from the remaining tissue of the plant. In the genera Caladium and Aloeasia they arc inclosed in what appears to be an elongated transparent cap- sule filled with mucilage. These capsules, or cartridges, are situated in the partition wall between two vacuoles, their ends projecting into the adjacent vacuoles. (1*1. XII.) When the vacuoles become tilled with water by being crushed in chewing or when artificially macerated, the mucilage absorbs water through the capsule walls, increasing in volume so that it exerts such a pressure that the needles are ejected with considerable force from the capsule at one or both ends, where the cell wall is thinner than at the sides. While Mr. Howard was examining a section containing some of these raphides, the capsules absorbed water and began to discharge themselves by what appeared to be a series of explosions.w In PI. XI, tig. 1, is shown a section of taro leaf multiplied by 100 diam- eters, with the raphides in place. The thirsty mucilage, as it has been called bv one author/' has absorbed a certain miantitv of water and * I * some of the needles have been forced out. In liy\\ t is shown a single ~ o capsule discharging the needles at both ends, the distance to which they have been projected to the right showing that the force of the discharge was considerable. At every discharge the capsule recoiled like a gun which has been fired. In PI. XII, fig. 1, is shown a cross section of the blade of a taro leaf magnified 800 diameters. This shows a capsule in place, with its ends projecting into adjacent empty vacuoles. Fig, 2 shows a similar cell in the tissue of the petiole. These capsules retain their power to absorb water and discharge their needles after the leaf has been thorough!v dried. Thev must be * subjected to great heat to lose their activity; and when this is lost, as in cooking, the plant is no longer acrid. Suflicient heat is not always developed in boiling to effect the change, 1*1.

It is interesting to note that in eases where the leaves are chewed, either fresh or dried, the stinging sensation is not perceived until a few momenta afterward, and in many eases it is not until the taro has been eaten that the prickly sensation in the lining of the mouth and throat shows that it has not been thoroughly cooked. * * * Afutvtxiit itniirii, a plant closely allied to the taro plant, is so acrid that the l'acilic Islander# resort to it only in cases of great scarcity of food. The disagreeable effects caused by these plants seem to be con lined to the temporary prickling sensation of the mouth and throat. They are undoubtedly nutritious and are held in high esteem by the natives. The role played by raphides in protecting plants from herbivorous animals has boon discussed by Otto Kuntze, in the Heft %ur Hotanis chen Zeitung, 1S77, and by Krnsl Staid in the Jenaische Zeitscrift fur Naturwissenshaft und Medicine, 1.S8X. The phenomenon of the explo- sion or shooting forth of the needles was lirst noticed by Turpin in bSSti. He called the capsules containing them \"biforines.\" errone- ously supposing them to be provided with an opening at each end. CVCAN < IKCI N A Ms AM) ITS 1-KIT N'DATION. One of the most interesting plants growing' in Guam is the \"fadan,'1 or federiko {Cijc<tx ctrritiai 'fx)* the nuts of which were a food staple of the aborigines before the discovery of the island. Its cylin- drical, scarred trunk, and stiff, pinnated, glossy leaves suggest ideal pictures of the forests of the Carboniferous age. (1*1. VIII.) Its nuts, poisonous when crude, but abounding in starch, are converted into a nutritious arrowroot, or sago, in several tropical countries. Hut its chief interest is in the. structure of its inflorescence und the manner of its fructification. The group of plants to which it belongs occupies a place intermediate between the flowering plants and the cryptogams. Like the former, it has fruit with a large starchy endo- carp, but, as in the latter, fecundation is accomplished by means of spermatozoids and archegonia, corresponding to the male and female elements in animals. The male inflorescence is in the form of an erect cone consisting of modified stamina I leaves which bear on the under surface globose pollen sacs corresponding to microsporaugia. The female inflorescence consists of a tuft of spreading carpellary leaves having their margins coarsely notched. (PI. XIV.) In the notches are situated the ovules, which are devoid of any protective covering. They correspond to macrosporangia. Pollination is effected by the wind. The pollen settles on the ovules and sends down a tube into the tissue of the nucellus. Archegonia are formed, egg cells develop, 72 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. an<l in the pollen tube are produced .spermatozoids provided with minute movable cilia by which they are propelled. These are dis- charged over the archegonia and fecundate the egg. The fecundation of the allied Of/cm revoluto of Japan has been studied by the Japanese botanist Ikeno;a that of floridaua and Z, jmmila of the southern United States by Dr. H. J. Webber, of the United States Department of Agriculture.h Doctor Webber found the mature spermatozoids of Zamia to be the largest known to occur in any plant or animal. They are even visible to the naked eye. He kept them alive in sugar solutions and found their motion to be due mainly to the action of cilia. In fecundation the entire spermatozoid enters the eg# cell, swimming in between the ruptured neck cells. Sometimes two or three spermatozoids enter the same egg, but only one is used in fecundation, the others perishing. On entering the upjx'r part of the egg cytoplasm the nucleus escapes from the Bpermatozoid, being left slightly in rear of the active ciliferouw hand. The plasma membrane of the sper- matozoid entirely disappears, seeming to unite with the cytoplasm of the egg, and this allows the s;\u00bbermatozoid cytoplasm also to unite with the egg cytoplasm and leaves the nucleus free. The nucleus pannes on to the egg nucleus, with which it unites. Fecundation thiu consists of a fusion of two entire cells\u2014cytoplasm with cytoplasm and nucleus with nucleus. <\" With abundance of living material at hand, the study of Oywn eireinah'x along the lines followed by Ikeno and Webber could not fail to yield interesting and important results. DISPERSAL OF PLANTS HY OCEAN CUIIKENTS. On the sandy beaches which form a great part of the east coast of Guam there is always a line of drift, just above high-water mark, which is rich in seeds, fruits of various kinds, and driftwood brought * t*1 by the great ocean current which sweeps across the Pacific from east to west. Sometimes the seeds and logs are riddled with teredo bor- ings or are covered with barnacles, but often they appear fresh and little worn by the erosion of the waves and sand. Many of the seeds * A are dead; some of them are alive and capable of germination. Not all the species which reach the island have gained foothold there. The fruits of plants growing in muddy estuaries or mangrove swamps, for instance, can not establish themselves on a clean sandy beach. Germinating fruits of Khizophora and Bruguiera are frequently cast up only to die, and nuts of the nipa palm, though found in perfect condition, can establish themselves only near the mouths of streams where the water is brackish.

It seems probable that coconuts grow in Guam only where they have been planted, except in cases where nuts which have fallen from trees of established groves have taken root. The seeds which occur in the drift, owe their buoyancy to various causes. Many of the ' sea beans'' inclose an air space between their cotyledons: others have kernels which do not fill the stony, water-tight shells, but leave a space for air to keep them afloat: others have a separate air chamber; others have fibrous envelopes or husks com- posed of light tissue, and still others have woody or cork-like shells of low specific gravity.

Their occurrence on the shores where they were collected, so far removed from the place of their origin, suggested to Sloane the existence of the current which was afterwards known as the Gulf Stream. Sloane published a paper on the subject in the Philosophical Transactions of London in in which he for the first time offered to the world the true explanation of the means by \"which they w ere transported.b il \" Cast up on the Shoar there art* very oft those pretty Nutta, of which they use to make Snuff-1>oxes.

W hen shaken, these seeds, or \" nieker-nuts,1* give forth a rattling sound, owing to the- fact that the kernel, consisting of two closely oppressed cotyledons, fits loosely in the shell, leaving a large air space, which gives buoyancy to the seeds. (1*1. XV, tigs. 5, (>, 7.) The seeds of Lean jt/iawfo/fft's (PI. XV, tigs. 3, 4) do not rattle when shaken. Their kernels till the shell completely, hut inclosed between the two large cotyledons composing the kernel there is a large air space when the seeds are quite mature and dry. They are very light and Hoat like bubbles on the surface of the sea. The seeds of Stizolobiuin are easily distinguished from those of Lens by their prominent raphe. Those of Lens have no raphe and are inclosed in an enormous woody, *aber-shaped pod (1*1. LV1), consisting of many distinct joints, with a strong woody suture surrounding the whole legume. This suture is persistent and forms a sort of frame from which the inclosed joints may be removed separately. Each joint (1*1. XV, tig. 1) is in the form of a closed cell in which the bean tits loosely and rattles about when shaken. This plant owes its very wide distribu- tion to the buoyancy of its seed and its habit of growing near the sea. (treat numbers of the .seeds are thrown up each year by the (iulf Stream on the Azores, but the plant lias not succeeded in establishing itself on those islands.

In addition to the coconut, which is provided with a lihrous envelope, and is known to flout for long periods of time in the sea without losing its vitality, there are found in the drift of Guam the fruits of Utirr'nujitmia xpe.c'nmi* called \" ^ put- ing\" by the natives, and (bhrox><t 'iniiriuintenxix, called \" fago.\" Both of these fruits have fibrous husks, but that of the Harrington ia has a hard glossy surface, somewhat as in the case of the coconut, while the surface of the Oehrosia is soft and easily eroded. The fruits of this Barringtonia (PL XXXVI11) are four-cornered and miter shaped; 'he natives crush them and use them as a fish intoxicant. Those of the Oehrosia are oval in shape, and, like the closely allied Cerbera fruits of Samoa and other tropical countries, are soon deprived of their pulpy parenchyma, and display the, cushion of fiber inclosing the mesocarp. This owes its buoyancy to intercellular air spaces. It is elastic and serves to protect the seed from erosion and from the attacks of animals. Manokovk fiujits.\u2014Great numbers of these spindle-shaped young plants are continually carried by the tide from the estuaries into which they drop after having begun to germinate on the tree. The fruits of lihizophora wncramtla (PI. LXIY) are easily distinguished from those of linujuiera (pjuinorh'cat (PI. XL) by the four-parted persistent calyx, the calyx of Bruguicra consisting of many segments. Associated with them are found the seeds of the \u00a34 red-flowered mangrove^ {Lutuniirntv which grow in keeled nuts of the \"ufa\" {Ihril'uru littoral in), the hard shell of which includes a very large air space (PL LII).

Among the plants which grow on the edge of the sea, whose fruit drops into the water continually, are the shrubby hodittfti and Touruffortta unjrntro \"goats-foot, {Ipnmuwi jjex-afprtte), the seeds of which contain air cavities, and the \" Polynesian iron wood\" {CaxtwtHtt t'tjuixeUfo/ia), the cones of which (PL XLI) are corky and buoyant and inclose seeds provided with wings which adapt them for transportation by the wind. The transparent w ings of these seeds are stiffened by the persistent style. When a handful of them is thrown into the air they resemble a swarm of flying insects. Hundreds of fc. \u00bbi r? these seeds, together with the queer-shaped Harringtonia fruits, are 70 USEFUL PLANTS OF OUAM, always to bo found germinating on the stretches of sandy beach along the southern portion of the east coast of the island.

ANIMALS OF THE ISLAND. MAMMALS. Bats.\u2014There are no indigenous quadrupeds in Guam. The only mammals in prehistoric times were two species of bats, the large fruit- eating J*tet'Ojn(x h'ruudtini Q. & G,, or \"flying fox,\"' called \"fanihi\" by the natives, and EmhaUonuva xrmicatt- ilata Peale, called \"payesyes.v The fanihi flies about in the daytime, flapping its wings slowly like? a crow. It has a disagreeable musky odor, but this leaves it when the skin is removed, and the natives some- times cat it. The flesh is tough, but not unsavory. The principal fruits eaten by it are guavas, fertile breadfruit, the drupes of the fragrant screw pine, called \"kafo,\" and custard apples (Ajutomr retieuhtta)) which it has undoubtedly helped to spread over the island. This species occurs in Fiji, the Friendly Islands. New Hebrides, and Pelew Islands. It very closelv resembles the living foxes of Samoa, * % n ~ which the natives of those islands call \"pe'a,\" or \"manu-langi\" (bird of heaven). Kntballouura st-m ica n da ta, the insectivorous bat, is noc- turnal in its habits, and flutters about vcrv much like our own common species. It remains in caves during the day and ventures forth at twi- light. It is very similar to, if not identical with, the 4iapa\"au-vai11 of the Sanioans, and has been collected in Fiji and the New Hebrides. Rats and mice.\u2014The Norway or brown rat (Mux <!<-cutt<aini.s Pallas), called \"chaka\" by the natives, was probably introduced into the island through the agency of ships. It is very abundant and is a great pest, especially in plantations of maize and cacao. It also destroys young coconuts, ascending the trees and often making its nests there. The common mouse (J fun vmscuhtH L.) has also been introduced. It appar- ently causes little harm. Deek.\u2014An introduced deer, Cermm war/ann Desm., overruns the island and causes great damage to maize, young coconut palms, and other crops of the natives. It was brought to the island by Don Mariano Tobias, who was governor of the Mariannes from 1771 to 1774. Its flesh has a line venison flavor, and it is a favorite food staple of the natives, who hunt the animal with dogs and guns, often burning DOMESTIC ANIMALS 77 groat stretches of sword grass (Xlpheogroxt/x jforulif/a) in which it hides. These animals often make raids upon the garden patches of the natives, sometimes coming down into the palace garden at night and eating the melons and other succulent vegetables cultivated there. During the rutting season the honking cries of the lighting bucks are heard tit night, especially when the moon is full. Domestic animals.\u2014Buffalo, cattle, horses, mules, pigs, goats, cuts, and dogs have been introduced. The buffalo (Bubal h* baifdux L.)are used for carrying burdens, drawing carts, and for plowing rice, just as in the Philippines. Their flesh is seldom eaten in Guam and their milk, which is of excellent quality and in some countries is an impor- tant food staple, is never used. They are very strong animals, but awkward and more difficult to manage than oxen. It is a common sight in Guam to see a small boy riding a buffalo bull. As the huge, ungainly, great-horned animal goes galloping along the road it sug- gests some monster of prehistoric times. Buffalo can not endure long periods of drought. They love to wallow in swamps and, if hot and dry, will sometimes lie down with their riders when crossing a marsh. Many of the Guam cattle bear a general resemblance to Jerseys in size and color, though their udders are much smaller. Both bulls and cows are used as steeds and for drawing carts. A foreigner is espe- cially struck with the speed developed by some of these animals. It is a common si^ht to see a daintv smooth skinned cow saddled and hal- 7 t- to red trotting along as swiftly as a horse, with her calf galloping at her side. With the exception of a few herds of cattle and buffalo in the interior of the island, all animals in domestic use are kept tethered, to keep them away from the unfeneed garden patches and cornfields of the natives. They are subject to the attacks of wood ticks (Acarina), so that they must be frequently examined. The natives rub their skins and currv them like horses. Sometimes a neglected animal dies in consequence of the attacks of these pests. Horses do not multiply on the island. Colts are born but do not thrive. Goats are not plentiful. Wild hogs roam the forests in the northern part of the island. They live on fallen wild breadfruit and various roots. It is interesting to note that they eat the exceedingly acrid rootstocks of the great Alocasia which grows wild in the forests (see p. 70). Hogs kept on ranches and fed on coconuts, breadfruit, and other vegetable substances are prized for food. The excellent flavor of the Guam pork was much praised by early navigators (see pp. 18 and 20). Dogs are pests in the villages. They are not well cared for, as a rule, and get their living by foraging. Cats have gone wild, and sometimes destroy the eggs of sitting hens and catch young chickens and turkeys. Dogs and cats are fed upon coconuts when other food is not available. 78 USKFUL PLANTS UK (.1I*AM. BIRDS.\" Land hiuds.\u2014The most beautiful bird on the island is the rose- crowned fruit dove {Pt'dopwt nmeira^iilm Less.), called \"tot-tot\" by the natives, and closely resembling the u manu-tangi *' of Samoa (/'. futtchitffx Peale). The general color of its plumage is green. Its head is rapped with rose-purple and the lower surface is yellow and orange, with some purple on the breast. The sexes arc similar. When it utters its mournful sobbing note it presses its bill against its breast and swells the back of its neck. Hirds which were kept by the author in captivity would frequently cry out in the middle of the night. Their favorite food was the fruit of the ilangilang {CatmiKji um o<(orn- tuvi), berries They also plum-like fruit of Ximenla (litierUxina, called '* piod11 by the natives. Another fruit dove is Pltleyo'-nux .rahthonura (Temm.), the female of which is smaller than the male and is of a uniform reddish-brown color, while the male has a white throat and olive-green reflections on its breast. Another dove, which was probably introduced from the Philippines, is TuHur dmsuhitcrl (Tcmm.). It is quite common in the open stretches of the mesa and is called u palumaii-halonitano,'' or \" wild pigeon,\" by the natives. It is a graceful, dove-colored bird resembling the common turtle dove, to which it is closely allied. Another introduced bird is the beautiful little pigmy quail (K/vul- faetor'm xinensi* Gm.), called bengbeng by the natives, from the peculiar whirring noise it makes in flying. This little bird, which is only 5 inches long, is remarkable for the large size of its eggs. They are of a brownish color, sprinkled with deeper brownish dots, broadly ovate in form, and 1 inch through in their greatest diameter. The most remarkable bird of the Mariannes is a mcgapode 4fins (aperowiiQuoy 6 (iaimard), which is railed sasen&at,\" or ' polio del monte. - It is closely allied to if not identical with a mcgapode found in the Pelew Islands, and is of the same genus as the jungle- fowl or mound-builder of Australia {MiyajHxliu# fmntthtx). In the Marianne Islands the natives attract it by knocking stones together. These birds are remarkable for the thickness of their legs and the size of their feet. They have a habit of heaping up mounds of earth, decayed leaves, and rubbish in which they lay their eggs. They are of a brownish color with grayish head. On the head there is an area of naked skin of a reddish color. The bill and legs are yellow. The birds are about 9 inches long. They fly heavily. They are not known to occur in Guam, but were collected by M. Alfred Marc he in 1887, 1888, and 1880 on the islands of Rota, Saipan, Pagan, and Agrigan, belonging to this group. \u00bb' I am indebted to Dr. Charles W. Kichiuuiul tor revising the scientific names of the birds in the following list, BIRDS 79 The only bird of prey of the group is tin1 short-oared owl (Asio aecipltrinux Pull.), called \"mongmo,\" or 4 Mnoturo. *7 Hartert doubts its occurrence as a resident of the Mari- anno Islands\" but it is a bird well known to the natives. They describe it as having big eyes and a eat-like face, and say that it catches lizards. It has not been collected in Guam, but is said to be common on the island of Tinian. It was collected by the Freycinet expedition. Terrestrial kingfishers.\u2014-One of the commonest birds in Guam is Ihilcyon <7)inaim>mh>ux Swains., called *\" sihig ' by the natives. It is of a beautiful blue and tawny color, the female differing from the male in having white on the bellv. This bird is allied to the t4tio- n *- tala7' of Samoa (//. pen lei Finsch & Harth). It feeds upon insects and lizards and is said to eat young birds and to pick out the eyes of young chickens. It utters a strident rattling note which is often heard in the middle of the night. An allied species, lhdeyon nlhtc/lla (Dumont) occurs in the northern islands of the group. Other birds arc the edible-nest, swift, (fuviphmja (Thunb.) -1 t iards, which in Guam makes nests of leaves stuck together with a secre- tion from the mouth very different from the typical nests used for food by the Chinese; the fan tailed IIy catcher, chichirlka, ^ or '4 chichirita,v by the natives, a pretty little bird which follows one along the road and spreads its tail as though wishing to attract attention. Another little fly-catcher fre- quenting shady J/v^vVvWWs); a crow, kubaryi lieichenow, called 44 aga,\" which is fond of Terminalia nuts and does much damage to the maize crops of the natives; two honey caters, the little red-and-black Myr-nnnhf fnbi'<ttn* (Less.), called t4egigi,?1 which frequents the blossoms of bananas, coconuts, and scarlet hibiscus, and the olive-green and yellow Zostr/'tjjtx ronxpie'tUalu, (Kitt- litz), called ^nossak'* l>y the natives. The only real song bird on the island is the ga-karriso, or ga-piao, a reed warbler which is well named Acrocephalm Imcmia (Quoy & Gaim.). It nests among the reeds of the large swamp near Agana, known as 44 la Cienaga,\" and has a song of exquisite sweetness. Shore birds.\u2014Among the shore birds area peculiar bittern, Ar- iktta Hhtvnsi* (Gmel.), called \"kakkag\" by of the Pacific, Drmhjretta mem (Gm.), called \"chnchukA,\" which is not rare but wary and hard to approach; two rails called (4koko,\" IlypnittvnntvxUnt 't Rothschild, and Polto!hnnux ctnei'vux (Yieill,), both of which are caught by the natives by means of snares laid in paths; the widely distributed water hen or gallinule, ( a Xovitatea Zooltigiue, \\ (JI'AM. chlontpw Lath., called ^pultUul\"' by the natives, excellent for food, and easily distinguished by ii red shield on its forehead; three birds called u kulalang,\" the Pacific god the oriental whimhrel Xumrnii/.spha<mpux vuricfjutt/.s (Scop.), somewhat smaller, usually seen at periods migration; and the widely spread snipe, (rallhMujo megaltt Swinh. Among the shore birds called by the general name duliliare the gray and white Asiatic (Gin,), very common on cultivated tields and along the shores of the island; the Mongolian sand dotterel, AvyhditU mam/ola (Pall.); and the common turnstone, Artum'tu inh rprt * (L.), which may be easily distinguished from the rest by its bright yellow feet. A duck, A)<<tx omtaletl Salv., called ngaanga by the natives, is peculiar to the Marianne islands. It is closely allied to species occurring in Hawaii and Samoa. Ska hikds.\u2014No gulls are found in the vicinity of the island. Nod- dies, 1 noux leue<>mpillti.s Gou Id and Ann us #\\tolldun (L.), called ' fahan,\" by the natives, are common. The beautiful snow-white tern, <db<t kittlilzi Ilartcrt, called \" chungeby the natives breeds on the island in great numbers, not making a nest but laying its single white egg on the bare branch of a tree. The common booby St da ml a (Iv.)} is common in the vicinity of the island. Great numbers of them may always be seen off the coast of Orote Peninsula, and the red-footed booby (Sula jjisealrlx L.) with white plumage, also occurs. They pursue flying fish, and dart into the water from great heights. The frigate bird, J'Wf/ata mpula (L.), called \" payaaya\" by the natives, is not rare, but is seldom seen near the shore of Guam. The tropic bird, Phaethon Upturns Daudin, nests on the northern islands of the group.0 UKPTILES.* There are few reptiles in Guam. The most conspicuous is a large lizard ( Varamts sp.) about 4 feet long, of a black color speckled with lemon-yellow dots. The combination of these colors gives to the ani- mal a greenish appearance as it runs through the bushes. As in the Guam kingfisher or \"sihig*' we have a lizard-eating bird, so in this animal, called hilitai\" by the natives, we have a bird-eating lizard. <> Students of ornithology are referred to the re)>ort of Quoy and Gaii;:ard the zoology birds of the Marianne Inlands;\" and Seale's u Report of a mission to Guam.\" See ltet of works. ''I am indebted to Dr. Leonard Stejneger, of the U. S. National Museum, for the names of the reptiles. NATURAL HISTORY, 81 It. is a great past, frequently visiting the ranches of the natives, eat- ing the eggs of fowls and young chickens, and robbing birds' nests. It is a common thing on walking through the woods of the island to hear sin outcry among the birds and to discover one of these creatures in the vicinity of a nest which he lias just robbed. Several pigeons belonging to the author were caught and killed by hilitais, their wings having been clipped to prevent their Hying away from a ranch to which they had been carried. These lizards are eaten by Filipinos living in Guam. but the natives look upon them with disgust. All houses of Guam are frequented by small lizards called **ii'eckos.\" They are harmless creatures and are welcomed by the I i 4 fe- natives on account of their habit of catching insects. Their toes are so constructed as to enable them to run upside-down on the ceiling and rafters with great rapidity. At night they may be seen quite motionless lying in wait for moths and other insects which may lie attracted into the houses by the light. Three or four often pursue the same insect, approaching it stealthily like cats after their prey. From time to time they utter a chattering noise, which has won for them the name of \"island canary birds.\" In the woods is a pretty blue-tailed skink (Kmola cyonnra Lesson), a small lizard with a tail the color of turquoise and with longitudinal bronze lines along the hack. The only snake on the island is Typhiitpa hrnatlnus (I)audin), a small species, with microscopic eyes and mouth and covered with minute scales. It is sometimes called 4; blind-worm,\" from its general resemblance to a large earthworm, and is found in damp places, under stones and logs. Turtles are common in the sea, but are seldom taken.

Although the natives do not devote themselves to fishing so exten- sively now as was formerly the case, yet many of them have cast nets with which thev catch small fish swimming in schools near the beach, and a few have traps and seines.

The fruit is pounded into a paste, inclosed in a bag, and kept over night. The time of an especially low tide !:< selected, and bags of the pounded fruit are taken out on the reef the next morning and sunk in certain deep holes in the reef. The fish soon appear at the surface, some of them lifeless, others attempting to swim, or faintly struggling with their ventral side uppermost. The natives scoop them up in nets, spear them, or jump overboard and catch them in their hands, some- times even diving for them. Nothing more striking could be imagined than the picture presented by the conglomeration of strange shapes and bright sharp beak: half-beaks (Iletniramphus), with the lower jaw projecting like an awl and the upper one having the appearance of being broken off; food-fishes: pike-like Sphyraenas; squirrel fishes (I lolocentrus) of the brightest and most beautiful colors\u2014scarlet, rose- color and silver, and yellow and blue; surmullets ( /and /Vw/- Hjh'Hrtix) of various shades of yellow, marked with bluish lines from the eye to the snout; parrot-fishes (Scarus), with large scales, parrot like beaks, and intense colors, some of them a deep greenish blue, others looking as though painted with (due and pink opaque colors; variega- rtnuwt->/*); trunkfishes horns cardinal-fishes (Ajmtjott fttseia- ius) striped from head to tail with bands of black and flesh color; hideous looking, warty toad fishes. ^ armed with poisonous spines, much dreaded by the natives; and a black fish (Monoceiuni tuar- {jmafitx), with a spur on its forehead. As many young fish unfit for food are destroyed by this process, the Spanish Government forbade this method of fishing; but since the American occupation of the island the practice has been revived. In the mangrove swamps when the tide is low hundreds of little fishes with protruding eyes may be seen hopping about in the mud and climbing among the roots of the lihizophora and Bruguicra. These arc the widely spread Pertophthtdniktx k<wlre>rteri. belonging to a group of fishes interesting from the fact that their air-bladder has assumed in a measure the function of lungs, enabling the animal to breathe atmospheric air.

On the western coast of the island there are broad fringing coral reefs and level platforms, covered even at high tide with only a few feet of water and at low water bare over considerable areas. Ilerc a collector in a boat or wading, with his feet protected from the sharp spines of sea-urchins and the rough branches of the coral, can always get abundance of material. When the reef is cov- ered with a foot of water and there is no breeze to ruffle the surface the bottom appears like a garden, the corals and marine annelids expanding like beautiful rayed composites. On I he bottom lie fungia corals, like huge inverted mushrooms, with pale green tentacles expanding from their radiating lamina*; indigo-blue, live-lingered and holothurians. latter creep about like huge brown slugs. If one attempts to pick them up they thrust one of their extremities between the branches of coral or into a crev- ice of the rock, and by forcing water to that part of the body distend it and wedge it so tightly that it can not be removed without being torn in two. A long translucent holothurian (Synapta) moves through the water so rapidly that it is caught with difficulty. When lifted from the water it hangs limp and helpless, like a skin full of water, its internal organs showing distinctly through the body wall. As soon as it. is dropped back into its native element it makes off at a great speed and soon finds shelter in some hole in the reef. \" I am indebted to Miss Mary J. Kathlmn, uf the U. 8. National Museum, for revis- ing the names of the crustacean* mentioned below. 90 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. Among the mollusks are a number of handsome olives, cones. an<l many small cowries which evidently teed upon the coral. There are also naked mollusks that protect themselves hy spurting forth clouds of purple fluid. Filc-lishes, tetrodons, and other fishes are always seen nibbling at the coral. Sometimes a great sea porcupine makes for them, and ofl they all swim as though afraid for their lives. The natives cat manv kinds of marine animals, hut thev do not depend upon the reel' to the extent that the Samoans and Caroline Islanders do, having become, essentially an agricultural people, and few of them find it to their advantage to neglect their fields for fish- ing. In former times several governors found it profitable to collect and dry certain kinds of holotliurians, called \"trepang,\"1 or \"beches de mer,*' and ship them to Manila or Canton:\" but these animals are no longer sought in Guam, and are seldom eaten by the natives. Crabs of several kinds abound, most of them of wide distribution in the Pacific. Some of them(\"\"alimasag'*) have shells brightly decorated with orange-red spots {Zoaitnttx <trnctix (L.)), others are covered with spines, and others, when they fold in their claws, look like smooth, water worn bowlders. Scrambling over rocks along the shore are (irttjmu* (jr<(pxux trun/mi.status (Ilerbst.), of a dee]) red color, speckled and striped with yellow. Spiny lobsters or crayfish (l'anulirus), with long antemwc and carapax covered with spines, abound at certain points along the coast; and in the fresh-water streams on the islands are delicate semitransparent prawns (Bithynis), which move about the pools in a stealthy ghostlike manner, and are almost invisible to the casual observer. Both the spiny lobsters and the prawns are valued as food. Among the land crabs is (hrdt*<>))<it. r(4undnm Q. & (x, which bur- rows in the ground and does great damage to gardens. This is caught in traps made of bamboo by the natives. It visits the sea at regular intervals to deposit its eggs, going after nightfall in straight lines and climbing over all obstacles in its way. Among the hermit crabs are Anivulux (uuchIhh (Ilerbst.), with a red carapax with deep .Ihtnfanmt inuietnhttttx (Olivier), prettily marked with 1)1 ue ocelli with white centers. The most interesting of all the n land crustaceans is the well-known Bir<fti.s latro (L.), or robber crab, called \"avuyu,\" which is kept in captivity by the natives and fattened on coconuts for the table. INSECTS. h The insects of Guam have never been systematically collected. Many of those now occurring on the island have undoubtedly been introduced \"(/liaiiiisso, Tagobnrh, p. 243* M am indebted to I)r\\ \\V, II, Aslmicta<l, of the U. S.

Roth the plant and the insect, although of American origin, now occur on many islands of the Pacific Ocean. Among the night-flying lepidoptera there is a large sphinx moth (7'/v>/o/>\"/vvj ccteus Hbrt.), the larva of which feeds on the tobacco plant and resembles very closely the tobacco worms of America. It is possible that this insect may have lived on the island before the introduction of tobacco, feeding upon some solanaceous plant, but it is probable that it came to (iuam with the tobacco. Possibly its eggs were brought on dried leaves of the plant. Among the other pests introduced by the foreigner are clothes moth* {Thtnt jx-HttmrlJa L.). In the zoology of the Freycinet expedition several butterflies collected in Guam, includ- ing an Argynnis and two species of Danais, were described as new. Among the hymenoptera there are several interesting species of wasps and ants. One wasp, probably a species of Polistes (/J, hrhnwux Fabr. 4), is social in its habits. During the greater part of the year it frequents open fields, building its nests in bushes a foot or two from the ground, attaching them to a limb by a peduncle with the mouth of the cells pointed downward, and not covered by a papery wall, as in our hornets' nests. In these cells the eggs are laid and the larva) are fed. When about to undergo transformation the larva1 spin a covering which seals up the cell. The males differ from the female in appearance and are stingless. Resides the males and perfect females there are workers. Both the females and the workers sting-, but their stinir is not verv severe. These insects o n i are very abundant all over the island, especially in abandoned clear ings grown up to guavas and other low bushes. It is almost impos- sible to cross such a Held without stirring up a nest or two, and one of the commonest occurrences on an excursion is to hear a loud outcry on the part of your guide, whose naked legs are covered with the stings of the \"sasata,\" as they are (railed. In revenge he usually finds a dry leaf of a coconut, which he converts into a torch and burns the nest. These wasps are not very pugnacious, and will only sting when they think their nest is attacked. After it has been burned they fly round and round the place without attempting to take vengeance. In the winter time (the month of December) they flock into houses in great numbers and settle upon some prominent point on the ceiling or on a chandelier, clinging together in masses like swarminji' bees. There thev remain for a month or two in a state of IJ 4- torpidity. They are disagreeable guests, as they have a habit of drop- ping to the floor from time to time, and it is not unusual on getting out of bed in the morning to step on one of them, too stupid to fly but 92 USEFUL PLANTS OF (H AM. lively enough to sting. On one of the Government vessels, which had visited Guam in January, wen1 found some of these wasps after her arrival in San Francisco. Thev had sought an asvlum while she lav i- ~ * ft in the harbor of Aprs}, and remained hibernating during the return voyage of the vessel. Another species found on board was a solitary wasp, a species of Odynerus or an allied genus. The mother had made a series of mud-like cells in a pamphlet, which had remained rolled up, and in each cell she had deposited a small green caterpillar, the larva of one of the smaller moths of the island, laying an egg and scaling up the cell and then making another cell on top of it and repeating the operation. In Guam these cell-making wasps are very common. Every hole in the wall of a house is plastered up by them; rolled-up magazines or newspapers lying on the table, bamboos, empty car- tridge cases, even gun barrels\u2014everything which is tubular in shape is tilled by their cells. Their sting stupefies the caterpillar, but does not kill it, and their lame in eating their animal food are much more active than those of pollen-feeding species, turning their heads from side to side and living for some time after having been taken from their cells. Among the ants (\"otdot,\"or \" utdut\") there is one {$ol<no}>s/s sp.'{) of which the workers are verv small and stin\" severe!v. The females are considerably larger. These little creatures, when out on foraging expeditions, travel in lines and sting every animal that crosses their path. Sometimes young chickens are killed by them. They arc com- mon in houses, and it is not unusual on turning in at night to tind a line of them crossing the bed. In another species belonging to the same family (iMyrmicidae), probably of the genus Pheidole, there is a form with enormously developed cubical heads and strong jaws, called \"soldiers.\" It is verv interesting to watch these insects swarm. Thev ft.- come out of the ground in great numbers. Both the males and females are winged. The females are very much larger than the males and the workers are smaller. The soldiers, which are very conspicuous, are sometimes called \" workers major,''and the common small-headed form \"workers minor.\" Soon after swarm inn- the sexes mate. Thev then I J ftj lose their wings and establish now colonies. Another stinging ant, much larger and of a black color, is called \"hating.\" Leaf-cutting ants, the pests of many tropical countries, are happily absent from Guam. Consequently, gardens do not need to be pro- tected from them, and the green turf and luxuriant herbage of the island offers a most pleasing contrast to the bare earth and canal- protected gardens of Central America and Brazil. The diptera are represented by several species of flies and at least two mosquitoes. It has been asserted that the early natives blamed the Spaniards for having introduced both flies and mosquitoes to TNSEOTS. 93 Guam.\" This is probably false, since the vernacular name** of those insects in Guam are etymological lv identical with the names of the *.

On the other hand, it is probable that Heas and bedbugs weir introduced, as there are no Cha- morro words for these insects. In Samoa the flea is called \"Fijian louse. In Codrington's comparative vocabulary of the Melanesian languages it is not given. It is interesting to note in this connection that in Hawaii, where the approximate date of the introduction of the mosquito is known, there is no Hawaiian name for it, and in New Zealand its name is of independent origin and is quite distinct from the common Mala van and Polynesian forms. Mosquitoes arc very troublesome both day and night in Guam. The day-flying species avoids the sunlight, but makes life a burden in the shade. All Europeans sleep under mosquito nets, and the natives habitually make a smudge in their houses after dark to smoke out the night-flying species. This is effective if the lights in the house are first extinguished and not relighted. Fleas are not common; the climate is probably too damp for them to flourish. The author passed a year on the island without seeing either a Hea or a bedbug. Neither do lice appear to be abundant. This may be owing to the habit of the natives of frequently washing the hair with soap oranges and bergamots. miseres de maladies, quo depuia Uis inosquites, et tons ees autres petits auimaux, Hont converties a la religion Chretieuue, p. 141, Pane, 1700.> 94 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. Among the Hemiptera besides lice there are plant lice of several kinds, large water bugs (Belostoma) in stagnant pools, and swarms of Plotercs, which skip over the surface of the water. Several varieties of roses have been introduced into Guam, but happily the rose aphis (Siphonophora) has not reached the island. Among the Neuroptera are several handsome dragon flies, one of which is bright red. Termites, or \" white ants,'* called \"anai'' by the natives, arc pests. They do great injury to books and furniture and to the woodwork of houses, often building covered galleries of mud along the walls of a room. In construction wood must be chosen which will resist the attacks of these insects. It is not an uncommon occurrence for a chair or table to collapse, and to find that it has been honeycombed by termites. Sometimes they form continuous galleries through a whole shelf of books or a pile of manuscript. These insects do not confine their attacks to dead wood; they attack living trees and are among the insects injurious to the cacao.\" Among the Coleoptera may he mentioned the weevils, which destroy great quantities of corn, rice, and other farinaceous food. Grain must be thoroughly dried in the sun and then stowed in earthen jars for protection against these pests The Orthoptcra are represented by several species of grasshoppers, which furnish excellent food for chickens and turkeys, and which do not seem to -ause much injury to the crops of the island. Mole crickets (Gryllotalpae) are very common. SCOK1MONS, Sl'IDKKS, AND CENTIPEDES. A small scorpion is common in Guam. Its sting is painful, but not dangerous. Among the spiders one of the most interesting is a large dark brown species, probably belonging to the Kpciridae, which car- ries about with it a white disk-shaped membranous case tilled with eggs. There arc no tarantulas nor other dangerous spiders. Wood ticks (Aearina) are great pests and sometimes infest cattle to such an extent as to cause them to sicken and die. Centipedes, called \" saligao \" by the natives, are common. They inflict a very painful but not dangerous bite. They are usually found in damp places under stones or rotten wood, the mother often sur- rounded by a brood of brightly colored young, similar to her in form. Like spiders and crustaceans they cast their skins in growing. The jaws arc modifications of a pair of legs. They are sharp, prehensile, and fang-like, and are perforated at the tip so as to in ject their venom into the wound inflicted by them. Their body is flattened, so that they can force their way into small cracks, under stones and bo in-nth the \"See Hanks, Report ut the Philippine Commission, 14)03, PL 'J, p. 605, iigs 160 to 169.

The natives were remarkably free from disease and physical defects, and many of them lived to an advanced age, im for among those alone who were baptized the first year of the mission there were more than 120 who were past the age of a hundred years; owing perhaps to their rugged constitutions, inured from their infancy to distempers which afterwards do not affect them, or to the uniformity and natural- ness (naturalidad) of their food without the artifice which gluttony has introduced to waste the life which it sustains, or to their occupations necessitating plenty of exercise without too great fatigue, or to the absence of vices and worries\u2014which arc roses and thorns whose prick- \" The information regarding the aborigines of (mam is derived from tho narratives of early navigators and from contemporary accounts of the Jesuit missionaries who first settled on the island.

In the narrative of Legazpi's expedition it is also stated that, \"palm-leaf\" mats were used by the women for aprons, the rest of the body being left uncovered.

HOUSES OF THE AliORHJINKS. 97 teeth were stained black for the sake of ornament and they bleached their hair u\\vith divers washes.*1 Houses.\u2014According to the testimony of early writers their houses * 1 were high and neatly made and better constructed than those of any O lr- t aboriginal race hitherto discovered in the Indies. I hey were rectan- gular in shape, with walls and roofs of palm leaves curiously woven. They were made of coconut wood and palo maria {('alopftt/lhim ht- ophylhm) and were raised from the ground on wooden posts or pillars of stone. In one of the narratives of the Lcga/pi expedition it is said that some of the houses supported on stone pillars served as sleeping apartments; others built oil the ground were used for cooking and other work. Besides those there were large buildings that served as storehouses for all in common, wherein the large boats and covered canoes were kept. These were very spacious, broad, and high, and worth seeing.\"\" As described by the missionaries some of the houses had four rooms or compartments with doors or curtains of mats, one serving as a sleeping room, another as a storeroom for fruits, a third for cooking, and a fourth as a workshop and boathousc/' Gaspar and Grijalva described one boathouse near the watering place as being supported on strong stone pillars and sheltering four of the. largest canoes of the natives. Many of these stone or masonry pillars arc still standing arranged in double rows. Thev are called \" latde ' or n ci i- \" casas de los antiguos\" by the natives, who regard them with super- stitious dread. Much has been made of the pillars on the island of Tinian, shaped like the rest in the form of a truncated pyramid and capped by hemispherical stones, but in all probability they are nothing more than the remains of large houses which served the same purposes as the \"arsenals,\"' described in the narratives of the Legazpi expedi- tion. These large houses mai be compared with the kiala of Florida and Isabel islands in the Solomon group, one of which is described as 100 feet long by 50 feet wide and 50 feet high. In these great houses \"the large canoes are kept, men congregate and young men sleep, strangers are entertained,\" and in some islands the skulls of the dead, called \" mangiti ^ (in all probability corresponding to the word \"aniti\" of the Chamorros) were suspended.' The dwelling houses of Guam also resembled those of Isabel and Florida islands, which differ from typical Mclanesian houses in being raised on piles, and in their neater construction. They are excellent dwellings, square in shape, with the side walls and the floor formed of split bamboos flattened and interlaced and the roof thatched with coconut leaves. The houses were grouped in villages located either on the beach in \"Jilairainl Koltrrtson, The ridli;n\u00bbme Islands, vol.

Those oil the beach were composed of 50 to 150 houses, those in the interior of from 20 down to a half dozen. The principal town was A^adfia, on the west coast of the island, where a line river, having' its source in a great spring called ** Matan-hanom,'\" emptied into the sea. In all the larger villages there was a \"^ great house \" frequented by the 4t urritao,\" or bachelors, in which unmarried men and women lived together. The houses contained little that could be called furniture. There were common Moor mats, diagonally braided, and sleeping mats, some of very fine texture, made from the leaves of the textile Pandanus. The water vessels were not coconut shells, as in many Polynesian J fc. v islands, but sections of large hollow bamboos, about 5 or 0 feet long, which were inclined against the wall. There were coarse bags of Pan- danus matting holding dried breadfruit, and every native carried a finely woven bag of the same material containing betel nut. Coarse baskets were made of fresh coconut leaves, as required, to be thrown away when dry and useless, Baskets of better construction were f ft. woven from strips of bamboo (piao). In the kitchen there was a hole in the ground and a pile of stones for an oven. Food.\u2014They subsisted principally on fruits, yams, taro, and fish. They ate coconuts prepared in various ways, sugar cane, bananas, plantains, and breadfruit. The last was in season only about four months of the year, but after it yams became mature. In the times of famine following* hurricanes they resorted to the woods forfadang,\" or nuts of Cycttx ctrchutl/*, the poisonous properties of which they removed by soaking and repeatedly changing the water, after which the macerated starchy substance was ground in cavities of convenient * o stones and baked. For relishes they ate certain seaweeds. Terminalia nuts, and the kernels of Pandanus seeds. Pandanus drupes, which are an important food staple on many islands, did not enter into their domestic economy, and the widely spread '\"Polynesian chestnut\" (lifWHi edttlis) was absent from the island. They had neither sweet potatoes nor maize until after the discovery, nor did the yam bean (Cacara) occur on the island. Kice was cultivated by them and sold to visiting ships. They regarded it as a luxury and kept it for their feasts. They did not practice cannibalism. Indeed the early navigators said that they could not be induced to eat meat of any kind. Although they had pigs at a very early date it is probable that these were introduced after, the discovery. They also had fowls and kept doves in captivity, but we have no evidence that they ate them. They could not be induced to eat eels, and spoke disparagingly of some of the early missionaries for eating them. The creamy juice expressed from the grated meat of ripe cocoanuts entered into the composition v FOOD OK THE ABORIGINES. 99 of several of their dishes. As was nearly the universal custom throughout the tropical Pacific, they cooked in pits in the earth in which they built lires and heated stones, covering their food with hot stones and leaves somewhat after the manner of a New England clambake. Cooking in this manner thev called ^chahan,\"* To cook n v on the embers they called \"pe-ha.\" Few articles of their food could be eaten raw. Fish called \" mafiahag\"\" were caught in great quanti- ties at certain periods, dried in the sun, and stored for future con- sumption. Breadfruit was cut into thin slices and dried. It could be kept for a long time and eaten during the season when the fresh fruit was lacking. The dried slices could be eaten without further prepara- tion, or they could be prepared in various ways for food. At their feasts a sort of broth or stew was made of rice. Taro was not made into poi, as in the Hawaiian Islands. They did not eat to excess nor did they use wine or other intoxicat- ing liquor. It was not until the Spaniards brought Filipinos to Guam that the natives learned to ferment, tuba from the sap of the coconut and to distill it into aguardiente. Water was their only beverage'' besides the milk of unripe coconuts. Narcotics.\u2014The custom of betel chewing was universal, and has survived to the present day. Around a fragment of the nut of the betel palm {Arcca cathecu) is wrapped a fresh leaf of betel pepper (Pij>er hctlc) and a pinch of lime burned from coral rock is added. This stains the saliva red and discolors the teeth. An aromatic fragrance is imparted to the breath, which is not disagreeable. Kava, an infu- sion of the root of iiwthysiictt.iu, of wide use throughout the greater part of the Pacific islands was, unknown to them.

Lsing Padre (iarcia's statement as a theme, Pere Charles le Gobien, rej>eats it with elaborate variations, though he does not give his authority for his information. Having read Pigafetta's narrative of Magellan's expedition, Le Gobien dates back their introduction to fire to the time of his discovery of the island, when he caused a number of houses and boats to be burned. \" What is most astonishing.\" %ays Le Gobien, \"and what one win find hard to believe, is that they had never seen lire. This element so necessary was entirely unknown to them.

The natives made excellent houses and were skillful canoe builders. They furnished themselves with spears and slings for fighting, stone adzes or gouges for working in wood (PI. XVII), and lines, hooks, and nets for fishing, and they planted and cultivated their gardens and rice fields. They were not wood carvers nor engravers, nor did they possess the art of weaving by looms, as did the Caroline Islanders, the natives of Santa Cruz, and some of the Philippine tribes. Their mats they braided diagonally after the manner of the Polynesians and Melanesians. The men made the houses and boats, the women braided the mats for beds and for boat sails. Pottery was unknown. Fish 4- were caught by hooks from the shore (etupog*) or by trawling from canoes under sail. They were also speared on the reef, attracted by torches (sulo) and caught with a net at night (gade). stupefied by sink- ing narcotics in holes in the reef, and trapped in pounds of bamboo wickerwork (guigao). Fishhooks (haguct) were made of mother-of- pearl and tortoise shell. NA V Hi ATI ON, Their wonderful \"flying praos\" were the admiration of all the early navigators. Descriptions of them were given by Pigafetta (1521), they saw it for the first time when Magellan landed in one of their islands, where he burned about 50 houses in order to punish these islanders for the trouble they had caused him. They regarded the fire at lirst as a kind of animal, which attached itself to the wood, upon which it fed. The lirtt who approached it too closely hav- ing burned themselves, marie the others afraid of it, and only dared look upon it afterwards from a distance for fear xairi they of being bitten by it, and lest this terrible animal might wound them by its violent breath, for this was the idea they first, formed of the flame and the hesit. This frivolous fear did not last. They saw their mistake, and they became accustomed in a short time to see the fire and to use it as we do.\" (Charles leGobien, IILstoire des Isles Marianes, nouvellement conver- ges ii la religion Chretienne, etc., p.

BOATS OF THK ABORIGINES. 101 Jampier's description is sis follows:'4 The natives are very ingenious beyond unv people in making boats, or \"proes,\" a Mi they are called in the Kast-Indies, ami therein they take great delight. These art\\ 1 milt sharp at lioth ends. The bottom is of one piece, made like the bottom of a little canoa, very neatly dug and left of a good substance. This bottom part is instead of a keel, ft is about or lis foot long. The under part of this keel is made round, but inclining to a wedge and smooth, ami the upper part is almost flat, hav- ing a very gentle hollow, and is about a foot broad. I rom henee both sides of the boat are carried up to about 5 foot high with narrow plank, not above 4 or 5 inches broad, and each end of the boat turns up round very prettily. But what is very singular, one side of the boat is made perpendicular, like a wall, while the other side is rounding, made as other vessels are, with a pretty full belly. Just in the middle it is about 4 or 5 foot broad aloft, or more, according to the length of the boat. The mast stands exactly in the middle, with a long yard that peeps up and down like a mizzen-yard. One end of it reacheth down to the end or head of the boat, where it. is placed in a notch that is made there purposely to receive it and keep it fast. The other end hangs over the stern. To Ibis yard the sail is fastened. At the foot of the sail there in another small yard to keep the sail out square and to roll up the sail on when it blows hard; for it serves instead of a reef to take up the sail to what degree they please, according to the strength of the wind. Along the belly side of the boat, parallel with it, at about (> or 7 foot distant, lies another small boat, or canoa, being a log of very light wood, almost as long as the great boat, but not so wide, being not above a foot and an half wide at the upper part and very sharp like a wedge at each end. And there art1 two ham hoes of about 8 or 10 foot long and as big as ones leg placed over the great boat's side, one near each end of it, and reach- ing about (i or 7 foot from the aide of the boat, by the help of which the little boat is made firm and contiguous to the other. These are generally called by the Dutch and by the English from them \"out layers.\"^ The use of them is to keep the great boat upright from oversetting * * * and the vessel having a head at each end, so as to sail with either of them foremost (indifferently) they need not tack, or go about, as all our vessels do, but each end of the boat nerves either for head or stern as they please. When they ply to the windward and are minded to go about lie that steers bears away a little from the wind, by which means the stern comes to the wind, which is now become the head only by shifting the end of the yard, This iMtat is steered with a broad paddle instead of a rudder. T have been the more particular in describing these boats, because f do believe they sail the best of any boats in the world. I did here lor my own satisfaction try the swiftness of one of them. Sailing by our log, we had 12 knots on our reel, and she run it all out before the half-minute glass was half out; which, if it had been no more, is after the rate of 12 mile an hour; but 1 do believe she would have run U4 mile an hour. It was very pleasant to see the little boat running along so swift by the other's side. The native Indians are no less dextrous in managing than in building these boats, liy report they will go hence to another of the Lad rone Islands about SO leagues off and there do their business and return again in less than 12 hours. I was told that one of these boats was sent express to Manila, which is about 400 leagues, and per- formed the voyage in 4 days time. There are of these proes, or boats, used in many places of the .East-Indies, but with a belly [curve] and a little boat [outrigger] on each side. Only at Mindanao I saw one like these, with the belly and little boat only on one side and the other Hat, but not so neatly built. \u00abNew voyage, pp. 2W8 to iKX), 1717. 6Or \"outriggers.\" 102 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. Alison, who in his narrative gives a figure of a flying prao of Guam, diti'ers from Dumpier in correctly .stating that the flat side is always kept to the leeward and the outrigger to the windward. He describes the outrigger as a log fashioned in the shape of a small boat and made hollow, the sail made of matting, and the mast, yard, and thwartship pieces connecting the outrigger, of bamboo. In his figure, however, the sail is shown incorrectly. It should be of lateen or triangular shape with the upper yardarm projecting well aft beyond the stern/' Besides the large praos they had small canoes, which were very swift, light, and pretty, \"for they painted them with a costing made of red earth from the island of Guam, mixed with lime, with coconut oilas a medium, which beautified them greatly.\" b Pigufetta, in speaking of their canoes, says that they were all painted; some black and others red. They had paddles of the form of bakers\" shovels, which could be used either for steering or propelling the canoes. MKN'TAI, ANI) MORAL CIMKUTKIirSTKK. In counting they used a decimal system, the names of the numerals corresponding with those of Malay o-Polynesian languages. Different forms of numerals were used in counting living and dead objects, and in expressing measurements/' They were a happy, careless people, fond of festivities, dancing, singing, story telling, and contests of strength and skill, yet suffi- ciently industrious to cultivate their fields and garden patches, build excellent houses for their families, braid mats of fine texture, and con- struct canoes which were the admiration of all the early navigators. They were much given to buffoonery, mockery, playing tricks, jest- ing, mimicry, and ridicule, offering in this respect a striking contrast to the undemonstrative Malayans. Legazpi, who visited the island in 1565, speaks of the loud laughter of those who surrounded his ship/. In selling rice to passing ships they would often increase the weigh! and bulk of the packages by stones and leaves. For each nail.\" says Legazpi, \"they gave measures of rice containing half a fancga/'more or less.'1 When straw and stones at the bottom of the packages were discovered by the Spaniards, the natives seemed to regard the decep- tion as a huge joke; they \" clapped their hands in glee and laughed long and loud, going from that vessel to another and playing the same trick. Then again they would take nails and fly without giving any- thing in return/1 On the other hand, the Spaniards gave them in exchange for rice and fruits\u2014the most valuable possessions of the \" See Alison, Voyage Round the Worhl, p. 340, 1748. & Garcia, Vidn y Martyrio de Kan vitores, p. 198, 16X3. c For numeral system and calendar of the aborigines, wee Safford, \\V.

On the other hand, the missionaries spoke of the remarkable intelligence shown by the children in learning the Christian doctrine, the moderation of the natives in eating, and the absence of intoxicants. Their sense of hospitality was very marked. Women were treated with consideration, and had greater authority than in almost any other land hitherto know n. It is certain that the natives distinguished between right and wrong. An upright man was called : ''tunas,\" or '\"straight.\" and the abstract quality of right or rectitude was called \" tininas/' or \"* straightness,\" A bad man was called \"abale,\" which signifies evil or immoral, in distinction from the word i \"tailaye/* which lias more the sense of worthless\" find is also applied to things, \"As to their customs,'\" says Padre Garcia, \" 1 feel called upon to say that although they have been called \" ladrones,' on account of the pilfering of a few pieces of iron from our ships, they do not deserve the name, for though they leave open their houses it is very seldom that anything is missed.\" They were very courteous on meeting or in passing before one another, saying **ati adingnio.\"' which signified . \"Met me kiss your feet/\" A traveler in passing by their houses wa* always invited to stop and partake of food. One of the first mani- festations of ill will on the part of the natives toward the early missionaries was their discontinuance of this courtesy.\" It was also customary to offer betel nut and leaves ot betel pepper to visitors. It was considered a mark of politeness to take the hand of another and gently pass it across the breast. They held poetry in high esteem and regarded their poets as men of supernatural endowments/'1 They were \" Garcia, Yida y Martyrio ilt? Sanvitores, p. 224, 1683.

They attached great importance to caste, and had sharply defined lines between families of high, low, and middle extraction. This led the early fathers to imagine that they must be descendants of some polite nation. '\"Thus it is seen/' says Padre (iarcia, \"how Pride, banished from Heaven, dwells in all parts of the earth, going in some nations clothed and in others naked/1\" Under no consideration could a Chamorri, or noble, marry a girl of common caste, though she might be rich and he poor. In ancient times it was even customary for kinsmen to kill a noble who for love or for grain should disgrace his family by such a marriage. People of low caste were not permitted to eat or drink in the houses of nobles or even to come near them. Tf thev wished to communicate with them, thev must do so from a distance. This custom was especially marked among the nobles living at Agana, where, on account of the excellence of the water and for other advantages of the site, lived the nobles of the highest rank. They were regarded by all the rest of the island with fear and respect. In this town there were 515 houses in which the nobilitv lived. The rest, about a hundred and lifty, belonging to the common people, occupied a position apart and were not considered as a part of tin* town or of the court. The prejudice of caste was one of the tirst difficulties encountered by the early missionaries. The chiefs did not consider it seemly that people of low caste should share with them the beneiits of baptism, saying that so noble an institution as the fathers taught them to regard it should be enjoyed only by the nobility and not by plebeians; and, indeed, the fathers had great difficulty in over- coming the fear of the common people, so I irmly rooted was their feeling of abasement in the presence of their betters.* son a Tj txwtititioxs and ri ktoms.

Adultery on the part of a man was punished in various manners. Sometimes the injured wife would call together the other women of the village, and putting oil their husbands1 hats and arming themselves with spears, they would go to the house of t he adulterer, destroy his growing crops, and. making a demonstration as though about to spear him, they would drive him from his house. At other times the injured wife would punish her husband by deserting him, whereupon her relations would assemble at his house and carry away all the property, leaving \"Garcia, Vida y Martyriode Kamitores, p. 199, 1683.

If a woman wsis unfaithful the husband might kill the adulterer, but the wife would receive no punishment.\" Divorce was frequent and might take place, for any cause of discon- tent on the part of either the husband or the wife. The most frequent cause was jealousy. In all cases the children accompanied the mother, and should she remarry they looked upon her new husband as a father. Concuhinagk.\u2014It was customary for the urritaos, or bachelors, to live in a \"great house/' often in companionship with young women whom they purchased from their parents or hired for a certain time. This did not injure the clranees of either for marriage. As in other islands of the Pacific where a similar custom prevailed, it is probable that the girls obtained from their families in this wav came from other n villages, and not from that in which they were to live. Certainly degrees of relationship we re respected in such cases as scrupulously as in marriage. Sexual relations between kindred were considered n infamous. After marriage, fidelity was expected and as a rule was observed on the part of both husband and wife. In cases of true marriage presents were also made by the groom to the father of the bride. A disregard for the marriage customs of the natives on the part of the early missionaries was one of the causes of complaint of the natives and finally led to bloodshed and war.'' In the first regularly appointed governor, Don Francisco Trisari y Vivar, shortly after his arrival in Guam, wishing to punish the village of Talisai for the pride of its inhabitants, who had remained away from the fiesta of Corpus Cristi. celebrated by the missionaries with processions, dances, and contests of the children in reciting the cate- chism, marched upon it during the night, and at daybreak fired upon the unsuspecting inhabitants; several of them were killed and others escaped to the woods badly wounded. The house of the urritaos was burned and three babies were carried to the mission and baptized. Shortly afterwards several marriages were, solemnized by'the. padres between girls educated at the mission schools and Spanish soldiers. In the school at the village of Orote there was a young girl who wished to marry a Spaniard. Pad re Sebastian de Monroy, the mis- sionary stationed at that village, performed the ceremony secretly, without the consent or knowledge, of the girl's parents. While the party were still in the church the bride's father came in a great rage protesting against the marriage of his daughter with the Spaniard, and attacked both the- bridegroom and the priest. The newly wedded couple were sent for safety to Agana, and the padre, to console the aGarcia, Vida y Martyrio de Sanvitures, l(iS3, p. 202. & p. 534. f 106 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM enraged father, told him to calm himself, that he would not be a loser in consequence of the marriage as the padre would give him as much as he could have gotten for his daughter if he had sold her to an urri- tao. This only made matters worse and final!v led to the burning of the entire mission and the assassination of Hie padre and all of his com- panions. Property.\u2014The nobles owned entailed estates of coconut groves, banana plantations, and other choice lands. These were not inherited by a man's son at his death, but by his brother or nephew (probably by the son of his sister, as in many other islands of the Pacific), who on coming into possession of the property changed his name and took that of the founder or most illustrious ancestor of the family. The children belonged essentially to the mother. They inherited the property of their mother s brothers, A man did not dare to dispose of any property of his family, except, perhaps, a canoe, knife, spear, or fishing tackle made by himself or land reclaimed by him from the bush. Tortoise shell was used for money. % Governmknt.\u2014They had no king nor defined code of laws, nor was* there a ruler for the island in general nor for any village. The nobles of each village formed a kind of council or assembly, which, however, had 110 real authority over the rest; but everybody did pretty much what he pleased, unless prevented from doing so by some one stronger than himself. The head of each family was the father or eldest rela- %- tive, but his authority was so limited as to call for little respect on the part of the sons, who obeyed it only when forced to do so. Children were seldom chastised by their parents. Offenses were punished by war if they were against a community, or by private revenge if* they were against an individual. Owing to this lack of organization no community felt itself responsible for the misconduct of one of its members. When hostages were taken by the Spaniards to insure good treatment of their people ashore, or to exact certain promises from the natives, the immediate family of the hostage alone seemed to feel responsibility or concern for him. The rest continued as before; nor could they understand the justice of the Spaniards\" burn- ing whole villages and many boats for the act of a single individual, who might or might not belong to the village or bo allied to the owners of the boats. Wakfakk.\u2014Their weapons were slings and spears, liows and arrows were unknown to them, nor had they swords, war clubs, or shields. They relied upon their quickness and agility to protect them from the blows of their adversaries.

The wounds inflicted hy them often caused death; but, as. in the case of the weapons of natives of other Pacific islands reputed to he poisonous, it is probable that their virtue was attributed by the natives to some supernatural influence of the dead mail from whose body the bones were taken, and the frequent deaths were due to lockjaw or blood poisoning from natural causes. The sling stones were of oval shape, fashioned out of stone or made of some sort of clav and baked. (PI. XVII.) These were thrown with remarkable force and precision, as far, states one observer, as an arquebus can shoot, and with such swiftness as to embed themselves in the trunks of trees. The natives practiced with these weapons from their earliest childhood and consequently became very skillful in their use. They carried on a primitive kind of warfare, \"being easily roused and easily quieted, slow to attack and quick to flee.\" A village would prepare for war with another village with great bustle but without a leader or any sort of organization or discipline. After war had been declared the two parties would often be two or three days in the field without making an attack, each watching the movements of the other. After engaging they very soon made peace; for a party considered itself vanquished if one or two or three of its men were killed, and ambassadors were went to the other with offerings of tortoise shell, which wa* the sign of surrender. The victors would then celebrate their victory with satirical songs, vaunting their valor and scoffing at the vanquished. In their fights with the Spaniards they sometimes resorted to fire, burning the vegetation adjacent to the fort of the enemy and hurling flaming darts upon the thatched roofs of their buildings. They often selected inaccessible places for their villages for the sake of security, and in wars with the Spaniards constructed trenches in which they protected themselves, carrying with them the sacred skulls of their ancestors to counteract the power of the crucifixes of their opponents. They also strewed the roads and parses with sharp spines (puns) to serve as caltrops. The use of these and the manner of constructing intrenchments they may have learned from the Spaniards themselves. Sfokts.\u2014One of their favorite sports was sailing in their wonder- ful canoes, wives accompanying their husbands and vying with them in swimming and diving. As already noted, they were fond of gayetv and festivities and took great delight in jokes and buffoonery. The men united together to dance and had contests of spear throwing, run- ning, jumping, wrestling, and exercising their strength in various ways. In the midst of their sports they would recount with great peals of laughter their myths and fables and refresh themselves and their guests with cakes made of rice, fish, fruits, and a kind of gruel # 108 * TtSEFtTL PLANTS otf (itlAM made of rice und grated coconut.

At funerals the demonstrations of grief were very extravagant, accompanied by much weeping, fasting, and sound- ing on shell trumpets. The waiting continued a week or longer, according to the affection and esteem in which the deceased was held. The people assembled, dolefully chanting, around a mound which they raised over the grave, or near it. decorated with flowers, palms, shells, and other things esteemed by them/' The mother of the deceased usually cut off some hair :is a souvenir of her grief, recording the O nights that had passed since his death by knots in a cord worn around her neck. These demonstrations we re greater on the occasion of a hudi chiefs or (Jhamorri's death and at the death of a matron of distinction, for in addition to the. ordinary manifestations of grief they would *- r\"1 ^ cover the streets with garlands of palms, erect arches and other devices expressive of mourning, destroy coconut trees, burn houses, break up boats, and raise before their houses the tattered sails as a sign of their grief and sorrow, and to their songs they added elegies no less eloquent than sorrowful, which grief would teach to the rudest and most barbarous among them, exclaiming with many tears, that thence- forth life would not be worth living, lie being gone who was the life of all, the sun of their nobility, the moon which lighted them in i> \" the night of their ignorance, the star of all their deeds of prowess, the valor of their battles, the honor of their race, of their village, of their land; and thus they would continue far into the night, praising the deceased, whose tomb they crowned with paddles as a symbol of one celebrated as a fisherman, or with spears as a device for the brave, or with both paddles and spears if he were both a brave warrior and an expert fisherman/ Garcia, Villa y Martyrio de Karwit-urea, pp. 20rt201, ''Chiefs were sometimes buried called (debajo de unas casas que Hainan grainier) ((iarrin, ]>. 220.) ^ The recitation or chanting of elegies was called a word which is now used for the verbs \"to read \" and \"to pray.\" The corresponding nouns and \"lecture\" AUOKIOINAL INHABITANTS. 109 KELIGIOX AMI Nt'l'EKKTlTlOXS.

Those dying a natural death were supposed to descend to a paradise in the underworld, where there are bananas, coconuts, sugar cane, and other fruits of the earth. In determining the future destiny of the soul good and evil conduct apparently had no part. The souls of the dead, especially of ancestors, were looked upon as demons (aniti) and venerated. The spirits of the dead, like the lares of the Romans, were regarded as natural protectors. They were called aniti, and were thought to be powerful for evil if not duly respected and propitiated. In times of distress they were called upon and their aid was invoked to keep away evil and to bring good luck to those for whom prayers were offered. The natives held the aniti in dread, and they sometimes paid them homage for self-protection; \"for,\" says Padre Garcia, \"the devil, in order in some fashion to retain this respect and servile fear, is wont to appear to them in the form of their fathers and ancestors and to terrify them and maltreat them.\" They had no temples, sacri- fices, idols, nor defined creed/' They had, however, certain supersti- tions, especially in connection with their fisheries, during which they kept profound silence and practiced great abstinence for fear or for flattery of the aniti, lest they punish them by driving away the fish or visit them in dreams to frighten them, which the natives reallv believed W 7 k they had the power to do. These aniti, it thus appears, were of an unkindly disposition rather than beneficent, and may be considered rather as demons than as divinities. To this dav there is among the natives a superstitious dread of theaniti, who are supposed to dwell in the forest. Sometimes benighted travelers going through the bush arc seized by the throat or scratched with sharp claws; sometimes stones are hurled by unseen hands, and sometimes in solitary places by the shore a headless figure may be seen sitting motionless fishing in the sea. The aniti are supposed to lurk among the many trunks of the numi or banyan tree (7vVv/\u00ab sp.) and haunt the sites of ancient houses (casas de los antiguas)/' \"Gimua, Yi<hi v MartyrioSutivitoruK, p. 205, p. 204. c Sec p. 97. t 110 UtUSfUL PLANTS OF GUAM. A similar belief is still found among certain native tribes of the Philippines, who have the same name for the spirits of their ancestors. Semper, in speaking of the religious faith of the 1 ray a and Catalangan tribes inhabiting the western part of Isabela, northern Luzon, near the seventeenth parallel of latitude, says: The faith of lx>th tribe*, however, ha*, in spite of manifold variations, so much of similarity that we may feel safe in assuming in the few recognizable traces, which are also common to all the remaining wild tribes of the land, that we see the remains of a religious faith a-s it may have prevailed in the purely Malayan period before the arrival of the Mahometans. Besides a few pairs of gods, concerning whose relations and attributes I was not able to 1 become quite clear, tliev venerate <jnite particu- larly the souls of their ancestors, which they place in the rank of their lesser gi\u00bbds under the name of \"anito.'' They are house gods, true lares and penates. Here stands in a corner of the house interior a kind of jar, which would have in itself nothing striking about it, but it in easily to be seen that the members of the family treat this corner with great reverence. In the jar one of their anitos has its seat. The space under the house, which ordinarily serves also as a place of burial, is con- secrated through various signs to other anitos; likewise the small spot before the ladder, which is in front of the entrance and l\u00bbeneath the overhanging roof of the house; the hut in which the forges are; and above all certain places before the house which are distinguished by altar* resembling little houses. Moreover, the harvest is consecrated to their anitos, to whom the iirst fruits are offered in great general feasts.\" Myths.\u2014In accounting for the creation of the world they say that Puntan, a very ingenious being, who lived in an imaginary place before the creation of heaven and earth, as he was a)tout to die, called to his sister, born like himself without father or mother, and gave directions for the disjjosal of his body. He transferred to her all his powers, so that at his death she should make of his breast and back the sky and the earth; of his eyes the sun and the moon; of his eyebrows the rainbow, and so on with the rest of his body; not without some analogy to the less and greater world, like that which poets make daily, and this they took not symbolically, but literally, as scripture and gos- pel, singing it in certain verses, which they knew by heart. Yet with all this, no sort of formal worship, invocation, or prayer was offered to Puntan or his sister to indicate that they were regarded as divini- ties. Other myths and ancient fables and stories of the feats of their ancestors were related and sung in their feasts by those who took pride in their learning, vying with one another as to who could recite the most couplets.'' In accounting for the origin of man, they said that everything in the world was derived from a certain earth on the island of Guam, which first became human, then a stone, which gave birth to all men. From this island they were scattered all over the world, and as they separated * Semper, Die Philippine!! und ihre Bewohner, p. oti, Martyriu de Sanvitores, p. 20:S-i;U4, 1683. ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS. Ill from the people and place of their origin they forgot their language. On this account the people of other nations knew no language and talked like fools without understanding one another nor knowing what they said. Thus they attributed to the ignorance of the foreigners their own inability to understand a language strange to their ears.\u00ae The particular spot from which the first men originated was a rock situated on the west coast of the southern portion of the island, at a place called Fuuna. a short distance north of Umatag. It rose (5 or 8 fathoms from the sew. From its summit vessels going and coming could be seen at a great distance. It was washed by the sea on three o sides, on which it was inaccessible; on the east-southeast, at the point where it connected with the mainland, it could be easily fortified. On this rock the missionaries established themselves and built a church, which they dedicated to San Jose, and they sooif succeeded in convine- *- * ing the people of the falsity of the myth concerning Fuuna, the alleged mother of the human race/' Sokcehkhh.\u20141Their priests, called makahna, were supposed to have the power of communication with the spirits of the dead, to cause sickness and bring health, to produce rain and bring good luck in fish- ing. To accomplish a desired object they invoked the favor of the deceased, whose skulls, inclosed in baskets, were kept in the dwellings of their descendants. At the time of the arrival of the early mission- aries some of the natives showed veneration for the bones and skulls of their ancestors, and represented their images on the bark of trees and in carvings of wood. Garcia attributed this custom to the inftu- once of a Chinaman who had been shipwrecked on the island and who had gained ascendency over the natives. He was probably wrong in this, since he compared the tnakahnas with Indian bonzes, who carried on the worship of the devil for their own interests. After describing the veneration or worship of the aniti. he says: This is the most that the devil has been able to obtain from these poor Marianos; not temples, nor sacrifices, imr idols, nor profession of any sect whatever\u2014a condi- tion of affairs which greatly facilitates the introduction of the faith; for it is easier to introduce a religion where none exists than to abolish one and introduce another. The makahnas naturally opposed with all their might the introduc- tion of Christianity and put every possible obstacle in the way of the missionaries, who tried to bring them into disrepute, and each party declared that the other were charlatans and impostors.' 111 their excess of zeal to overthrow the religious practices of the islanders some of the missionaries adopted radical measures. Padre Luis do Medina, \"in order to root out once for all the superstition of these Marianos,*' \"Unrein, Vida 4()S\u2014i(59. cittern,, p. 204. 112 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. when lie bapt ized them took away from them their ' idols\" or figures of their ancestors, to which they paid certain veneration, and burned them, \" ill order that by the light from these tires they might see more clearly the truth of our holy faith.\" On his first visit to Guam he caused a goodly pile of these little idols (idolillos) to he hurned before the holy cross on the day of its triumph, July Hi, Hi(>K. and for this victory which the cross gained over the devil he named the village, which before was called Pigpug (Pegpog), \"The Triumph of the Cross.\"' lie made them burv the skulls of their ancestors in order that, thev misfht be considered people of God.\" By his zeal there were established on tlie island of Guam the customs and Christian ceremonies of solemn masses, sermons, processions, offices of holy week, and the oilier prin- cipal feasts of the year, according to the capacity of the villages. Thus he availed himself of all the means and attractions possible to win the love of the Mariunos for the Christian faith. In order that they might go the more willingly to mass and to school for instruction in the doc- trine, he gave them some slight presents, so I hat not only the people of the village of Agana but many others of outlying villages flocked to him. At Christinas lie made an altar of the nativity, and people from nearly all the villages of the island came, attracted by curiosity, and he allowed them to see it on the condition that thev should sav the creed, % a- the commandments, the act of contrition, and other prayers; and the same father testifies that he reaped much fruit from the Christmas ceremony. On the death of Kipuha, the chief who received them 011 the island, the father determined to give him a solemn funeral; he con- quered many difficulties in order to bury the dead chief in the church, going for him to his house with a trumpet and the banner of San Ignacio and San Francisco Xavier, and he said his vigil (wake) and chanted mass and caused to be performed for him the ceremonies which were wont to be performed for one of the Society of Jesus, which pleased the people of Agana, who at first were opposed to the new manner of burial, so that thev now asked whether when thev 7 * * should die thev would be buried in the same wav.7' *-' 4- Ski'Kkstitions. -The natives took care to spit when no one was looking, and they would not, spit near the house of another nor in the morning, which seemed to be connected with some superstitious fear,' This superstition was probably of the same nature as that of other islands of the Pacific and of the ftast Indies, where it is feared that some evil charm can be worked upon a person by one getting possession \" See also Garcia, Vida y Marty riode Kanvitores, p. 221, 1W3. Some of the natives resented the desecration of the hones and images of their ancestor.*, threatening to kill the fathers and their assistants with their spears; hut this did not deter them from burning the images amid the jeers of other natives, who did not share in their veneration. &Idem_, p. 408,409. c Idem,, p. 198, AHOKIOIXAL INHABITANTS. 113 of his .spittle, a bit of his hair, nails, refuse of his food, or other thin# intimately connected with him.\" LWor'AOE. The language spoken by the natives of Guam is called theChamorro. It belongs to the great Malayan family, which includes the languages spoken by the aborigines of Malaysia, portions of Cambodia, the Pacific Islands from Formosa and Hawaii to New Zealand and Easter Island, and the great island of Madagascar, situated in the Indian Ocean, on the coast of Africa. Some idea of the vast area oyer which this group of languages extends may be formed when it is borne in mind that Formosa and Hawaii are on the border of the North Temperate Zone, and New Zealand and Faster Island are wholly within the South Temper- ate Zone, and that the language extends in longitude from Madagascar across the great Indian and Pacific oceans to Easter Island, its eastern limit, the longitude of which is east of the meridian of Salt Lake City in the State of Ctah. On examining the vocabularies of the various languages included in this widely spread family a wonderful correspondence will be found in the names of many common objects, <uch as tiro and water, earth * J and sky, tish and fowl, many parts of the body. the personal pronouns, and the numerals. In addition to those arc the names of a number of useful plants and trees. All of these languages have certain characteristic features in common, such as the absence of a copulative verb, two forms of the plural of the first personal pronoun, one including, the other excluding the person addressed. Thus the adjective \"sick\" may be regarded as a verb kbto be sick,\" and the nouu ** father\" may be considered as a verb to be a father.\" each of them requiring only a simple subject to declare a fact. The languages of the family naturally group themselves into two groat divisions. The first, which is characterized by simple verbal forms and separate possessive pronouns, together with attributive adjectives preceding or following their nouns without an intermediate ligation, or ligature, to connect thorn, includes the languages of Poly- nesia proper, viz, the Hawaiian, Satnoan, Tongan, llarotongan, Tahitian. Faster Island, and the Maori of New Zealand. The second is character- ized by the addition of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes to the verb, together with reduplication, to express the various tenses and numbers, and to distinguish transitive verbs with a definite object from intransitive verbs, so that the original root or primitive word is often difficult to detect at first sight. Possession is indicated by appending possessive \u00abIn the Hawaiian Islands the high chiefs made use nf spittoons, which were riuv- fully carried out to sea :ui<l emptied. 9773\u201405 \u00ab 114 USEFUL 1'LANTS OF GUAM particles to the noun, which become united enclitieally to it, as \" tata-ho,\" my father; tata-mo,\" thy father; \"tata-na,\" his father; \" ^ our father (including the person addressed); 4 tatan-mame11 (excluding the person addressed), etc. To this division belongs the Chaiuorro lan- guage of Guam. One feature of the Chamorro language, which hay led to much con fusion in the various vocabularies of that language appearing in the reports of scientific expeditions, is the modi heat ion of tonic vowels of nouns and adjectives when immediately following the definite article. Thus 4*a\"\" (like *'a,! in father) becomes \"a'* (very much like \"a\" in hat), 4-ov becomes \"e,\"1 and \"\"u1' becomes \"i.\" We have *'lahe,\" man, but. u i labe,\"' the man; guma, house, but i gima,\" or \"i guna na loka,\" the high house. It also possesses the characteristic, common to the group to which it belongs, of uniting an attributive adjective to its noun by means of a ligature {\"na'7) as shown in the preceding example,\" The plural of a few nouns is formed by reduplication of the tonic syllable, the plural of all adjectives and a certain class of nouns is formed bv prefixing the particle \"man'\" to the word: as \" maul eg i liihe,\" good is the man; \"maninaulcg arc the men; \"aniti,\" ghost, 'mananiti,\" ghosts.'* The plural of most nouns, however, is indicated by placing after them the word \" si ha,\" which is the plural of the third personal pronoun, as ''guma si ha\" houses. For a more complete account of the Chamorro language of Guam the reader is referred to a scries of papers by the author in the Amer- ican Anthropologist, new series, volumes o, (>, and 7, 1908-5. In the two following tables a number of (iuam words are compared with corresponding words in the Polynesian, Philippine, and Malaysian languages. In the column of Philippine names \"T.\" indicates the Tagalog language; \" V.,*'the Visayan; \"I.,\"'the Ilocano, and \"P.,\"' the Pampago. In the column of Polynesian names \"S,\"1 stands for Samoa, 11.\" for Hawaii, and \"N. Z.\" for Now Zealand. The words given in these tables are selected from among a great number which do not show such close correspondence. It would be misleading to give the impression that the Chamorro language bears a very close resemblance to the Polynesian dialects or that it may be considered a Philippine dialect. Certain words, it is true, are closely allied to both the Polynesian and Philippine names for the same thing, but on the other hand there are words much more nearly like the primitive Malayan than either the Philippine or Polynesian forms, and in no one language of the Philippine Archipelago is there a close corre- spondence either in the vocabulary or in the verbal forms with those of the Chr.morro. \"This feature will Ik* soon in many Philippine plant names.

Of the common origin of the aborigines of Guam with those of Poly- nesia, the Philippines, and many of the islands of the Malay Archi- pelago there can be no doubt. This is shown especially by their language, their arts, social organization, and superstitions, as well as by the physical appearance of the natives themselves. It is not prob- able that the population was purely Malayan; there is evidence of certain affinities with the Melanesians or Papuans. These may have been the result of conquest or of the amalgamation of Melanesians settling upon the island. Certain customs of the ancient Chamorros were very similar to those still existing on some of the islands of Melanesia, such as the living together of the bachelors in great houses and the prevalence of the custom of concubinage before marriage. An affinity with the natives of many of the islands known as Micro- nesia is also undoubted, but this is much more remote. Unlike the Melanesians and Papuans, the ancient Chamorros were ignorant of the manufacture of pottery and of the use of the bow and arrow in war- fare, nor did they possess the art of carving in wood. Their canoes were without other ornamentation than painted designs of red amd black. Unlike the Micronesians, they were ignorant of the art of weaving with looms. Their mats were plaited or braided diagonally like those of the true Polynesians. In their art of tire making and cooking they resembled the latter, and their canoes, provided with out riggers and pointed at both ends, were of the general shape of those found in the Eastern Pacific. In their use of slings for fighting they resembled the aborigines of many Pacific islands, and their adzes or gouges of stone were scarcely to be distinguished from those of many Melanesia!) and Polynesian tribes. The elaborate system of forming derivative words from verbal roots by the use of prefixes, suffixes, and infixes joined encliticallv to the Cftnlr. Hi^rb., Vol. IX Plate XVIII. ORIGIN OF THE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS. 117 primitive word, as well as the use of possessive particles appended to the name of the object possessed, and the sharp distinction between transitive verbs having1 a definite object from intransitive verbs and verbs of which the object is not definitely specified are features of their language which at once separate them from the Polynesians of the East- ern Pacific and ally them with the inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago, the Philippines, and Madagascar. Their use of the betel pepper and areca nut as narcotics instead of kava pepper is another feature connect- ing them with the Philippine Islanders and the Malayans, and their possession of rice in prehistoric times bearing the same name as in the Malay Archipelago and Madagascar is another bond between them and the inhabitants of these islands. On the other hand, they did not pos- sess the paper mulberry, which is so important in the economy of the natives of the Eastern Pacific islands as the source of bark cloth or tapa. Other trees of importance in the economy of the true Polyne- sians which were absent from (Juam are the candle {Aleiiritex moluc- cUiHt) and the Polynesian \"chestnut\" {liocoa niidis).

And it is probable that they did not leave the cradle of the race until after the adoption of the habit of betel chewing, which was introduced from India long after the departure eastward of the settlers of eastern Poly- nesia. who took with them yams, taro, sugar cane, and coconuts from their former home. TflK MODERN INHABITANTS, mutiix Axi) Assertions have been repeatedly made that the Chainorros, as the Marianne Islanders are called, no longer exist as a separate people;\" that \"at the present day not one of the original race survives, and that the islands are peopled chiefly by Tagals and Bisayans from the Philippines, with a few Caroline Islanders, and numerous half-breeds, but also by the mixed descendants of natives of South American tribes.\"\"/' It is also asserted that the present inhabitants are able to speak Spanish, which is gradually supplanting the native language, \"a Micronesian dialect nearly allied to that used by the Tagals of the \"Oinittn Trotter in is made l>y Guillemard, in Stanford's Compendium of Geography and Travel (new issue), Australasia, vol. 2, j>. 554,1894. 118 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM Philippines.\"\u00ae In the classification of the In<lo-Pacific races of man, by S. J, Whitmee, the natives of the Marianne Islands are not even mentioned/ In Tregear's Maori-Polynesian Comparative Dictionaryc (1891) two distinct sets of references are given to words of the Cbamorro language, evidently compiled from separate vocabularies, neither of which have the words properly spelled. Thus, under the word for stone the Chamorro word \"achu\" is cited as \"Guaham, ashou; Cha- mori, atju,\" as though these were two languages; and no mention is made of the resemblance of the Chamorro \"guatr' to the Polynesian \"air1 (lire), \"guihan\" to \"ika\" (fish), \"iiehan'* to \"ua\" (rain), Malayan words \"api,\" \"ikan,\" \"hujan,\" and \" jalan\" are cited. As a matter of fact the Chamorro language is not a Micronesian dialect, nor is it closely similar to that used by the Tagals of the Philippines. One need only compare the words given in the preced- ing lists with Micronesian vocabularies to be convinced of this fact, and to note the difference between the Chamorro \"guma\"1 (house) and the Tagalo \u00a3; babai,\" the and \"palaoan\" (woman) and the dissimilarity between the corresponding verbs, prepositions, adverbs, and adjectives of the two languages. Pure-blooded Chamorros are no longer found on the island, it is true, but in every native family of Guam the Chamorro language is the medium of communication/' and though the men of the original stock were nearly all killed off by the Spaniards in their efforts to \"reduce\" them, yet many of the women were married to Spanish, Mexican, and Philippine soldiers brought by the Spaniards to the island to assist in the conquest, as well as to mariners of Great Britain and France who settled in the island. Few foreign women have found their way to Guam, and it was from their Chamorro mothers that the children learned to talk. Thus the Chamorro language has survived, though it has become modified by the introduction of many Spanish words and idioms, just as the Hawaiian and Maori languages have been influenced by the English, and the Tahitian and Malagassy by the French. The entire system of numeration has been replaced by the Spanish. The Spanish indefinite article \"un\"\" has been adopted, as well as the prepositions \"para\" (for), \"con*1 (with), and a number of other words. It should be noted, however, that where Spanish nouns, adjectives, and verbs have entered the language they are made to con- form with the grammatical features of the Chamorro; thus the plural a Encyclopedia Tiritannkra, vol. 14, ji. 200, 1K82. 6Idem., vol. 19, pp.422-428,1885. f Under Whatn, p. 617. <*See Safford, Natives of the Island of Guam, American Anthropologist, n. vol. 4, p. li>4, 1902.

The various races have amalgamated thoroughly. Among the prin- cipal families on the island are found the names of Anderson,\" Robert, Wilson, and Millechamp, as well as those of Torres, Palomo, Martinez, Cruz, Perez, llerrero, and others of Spanish and Mexican origin, names all prominent in the archives of the island. In these archives arc copies of official orders of the captain-general of the Philippines directing that all foreigners be sent away from Guam and, in reply, petitions from a number of worthy men stating that they had adopted this little island for their home and begging the captain-general that they might be allowed to remain with their wives and little ones. Some of them even went to Manila arid were granted permission to return, becoming useful members of the community and rendering- great assistance to the governor as interpreters, captains of the port, and pilots. Many of their dependents inherit their sterling qualities, but are true Chamorros in language, in manners, and in heart. As for the Caroline islanders, their entire colony has been sent to the German islands of the group. They never intermarried with the Chamorros. but retained their own language and customs, living like savages in small huts with only a few leaves spread upon the ground to serve as a floor and bed. subsisting on fish, wild y an is, and fruits, and resisting all attempts to christianize them. There are no records of people of South American origin having settled in Guam, but in the northern islands of the group the census of 19012, taken by the German authorities, shows that there are 15 persons of American origin, recorded as \" Chilians, Peruvians, and Mexicans.\" CilYSK'Ali ClIAKAf'TKHISTICS.

The disease described by Dumpier, though possibly one of the forms known* as \"lepra,\" was certainly not Ltpm aiiaexthexhica. a later introduction, which is characterized by absence of sensibility of the surface, comparative smoothness of the skin, and ulceration and loss of the fingers and toes. The latter disease is not nearly so prevalent on the island as it was at the time of the visit of Frevcinet, and it is * constantly decreasing. One reason for t his may be the change from a fish diet to one almost entirely vegetable, with occasional indulgence ol beef, venison, pork, and fowls; as it is a well-known fact that a fish diet renders every symptom of the disease worse. During the inter- regnum which followed the seizure of the. island by the United States, all but one of the patients in the leper hospital at Asan escaped and were cared for by relatives In various parts of the island. A leper colony was established by Governor Scaton Schroedcr on the shore of * % Tumhuni Hay, and the few natives suffering from leprosy have been segregated there. They are attended by nurses and are treated by the naval medical officers stationed on the island. \"\" f \u2014\u2014 \"Dampier, New Voyage, (1th ed., vol. I, pp. 1717. & Idem., p. 334. THE MODERN INHABITANTS, 121 Several eases of ichthvosis have been noted by our doctors, nil of I' t them congenital. Jn this disease the skin of the patient has the ap- pearance of being composed of small scales like those of tishes. Though tlie disease is apparently incurable, the patients do not appear to suiter and their general health is good. Among other skin diseases is that known in the Eastern Tropics as \" dliobie itch(Tim-a cirrinatn). a kind of ringworm which, if unchecked, spreads over the skin in large areas. This was very common unions our own men. A good D ^ * 1 remedy for skin diseases is the \"ringworm shrub\" (Ilrt-jhtinf itiuhf). inlioduced into (fuam and the Philippines from Mexico, and called by the natives \"acapulco.\" Another ex< eHent remedy is an ointment made of 4 per cent of chrysarobin with vaseline. Chrysarobin. known also as '\"goa powder,\" is obtained from the longitudinal canals and inter spaces of the wood of Atuh'nf a Brazilian tree belong no- to the Leguminosae. The most prevalent disease among the natives is hereditary syphilis. During the tirst. years of the American occupation of the island no primary or secondary cases were observed. The most frequent symp- toms of this disease are ulcers and hard lumps on various parts of the body and destructive joint and bone lesions. It is not uncommon for a young man or woman, or even a little child, of apparently line phy- sique to be afflicted with an ulcer in the palate or nose, which often spreads over the face and sometimes destroys the eves. Syphilis, like leprosy, was probably introduced into Guam by diseased convicts and laborers, some of whom were Chinese, sent to the island from the Philippines at the request of some of the early governors. One governor's report, to which reference has already been made, describes the condition of some of the convict laborers sent to Guam, who were afflicted with scurvy and skin diseases and foul ulcers. After under- *- going medical treatment for a short time they were distributed over the island.\" It is probable that many others previously sent, of whose importation we have no record, were also diseased in like manner, and that little or no etl'ort was made on the part of the authorities to prevent the contagion from spreading. On the arrival of the Americans at (iuam. the natives Hocked by scores to our medical officers for treatment. In the, report of the Surgeon-General of the Navy for 10OO, attention is called to the extra ordinary success attending the treatment of hereditary syphilis, nearly every case of which responded immediately to potassium iodide or to mercury, administered either in large or in small doses. Another source of disease was the frequent visits of whaling vessels and the establishment on the island of a hospital for the treatment of a \" LU'fzaron -1 enfermos, tin* liiilij>|>ine!s ined,, October 17, 1851.) 122 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. diseased seamen. It was sometimes impossible for those in charge of the hospital to keep the patients under control, and their disorderly behavior caused much worry to the Spanish officials. Among the many wise and benevolent acts which characterized the administration of Governor Sehroeder was the establishment of a civil hospital. The corner stone was laid by Mrs. Sehroeder on the 1.0th of June, 1900, and the building was dedicated by the Reverend Father Jose Palomo.\" One of the principal causes of the stationary condition of the population, as shown by the census of the island, was the death of new-born infants and of women in childbirth. A school for the instruction of mid wives was accordingly established, and all women on the island employed in this capacity were obliged to undergo a course of instruction before receiving license to continue their profession. The doctors reported typhoid fever to be endemic. Diseases of the eye were not very common, though several cases of conjunctivitis and iritis were treated. Malaria is apparently absent, though mosquitoes abound. Among the parasitic diseases are tapeworm and lumbricoid worms. In one year 17 deaths from the latter were reported, and in the preceding year 5 cases of the former were successfully treated. Tuberculosis exists on the island, but is not widely spread. It is not strange that the early inhabitants complained that the Spaniards brought curses to their islands without bringing remedies for their cure. The last serious epidemic was that of smallpox brought from Manila in March, lS5(i, by the schooner h\\ L. and lasting until the following November. More than two-fi fths of the popula- tion perished, and in some cases whole villages were wiped out of existence. In the summer of IttlW the Spanish transport Elcmio brought to the island a disease thought at first to be cerebro-spinal meningitis, but afterwards believed to be anterior poliomyelitis. In some respects it resembled beriberi, but it was not attended with dropsical symp- toms. The victims, all adults, were suddenly stricken when in appar- ently perfect health. Frequently death ensued in three or four days. If the victim survived, paralysis either in the arms or legs was sure to follow, and the muscles of the afflicted parts became atrophied.b The disease was chiefly confined to the village of Sumai, on the shore of the harbor of Apra. It would be interesting to know whether this epidemic could be traced to the importation of moldy or damaged rice, which in Japan and the Philippines is supposed to be the, cause of beriberi. a Report <>f the Secretary of the Navy for the year 1901, ji.

Dkens.\u2014-The natives dress verv much after the manner of the people of Manila. The men wear cotton trousers, and shirts outside of the trousers, either white or of some striped material. Some of them wear white jackets which tit closely about the neck, fastened with buttons or silver studs. They wear either imported hats of straw or felt, or hats of pan dan us woven 011 the island. When fishing on the reef or when at work on their ranchos many of them content themselves with a breeeheloth and a straw hat. They wear shoes, slippers, or sandals, or. if engaged in work which does not require the feet to be protected, go barefooted. As is the case in Japan and at Manila it is the custom while sitting in the house to slip off the shoes. At church the women usually take them off and kneel upon them. The ordinary dress of the women is an ample skirt of print or bright-colored gingham with a short chemisette of thin white material, cut low in the neck and provided with wide flowing sleeves. Stockings are worn by few except on feast days and Sundays. \\\\ omen of the better class follow the Manila fashions and wear garments of more costly materials. Some of them have begun to wear corsets. A few wear European hats; the remainder go bareheaded or content them- selves with handkerchiefs tied over the head. Nearly all of them wear kerchiefs across the bosom and a rosarv about the neck. Some of the native costumes are very prettily ornamented with lace or embroidery, and the handkerchiefs are often of fine texture, with a colored border. It is considered unseemiv for the older women to % wear bright colors or fancv laces. Flowers are scarce!v at all worn by the natives, but that they have a love for beauty is shown by the decorated altars in their houses and the bright-colored foliage plants and flowers in their gardens. Dwellings.\u2014-With the exception of a few families living in ran- cherias, the natives live in villages mid go to their tineas, or country places, for the purpose of feeding and watering their stock or for cul- tivating their fields. The town houses are well constructed. They are raised from the ground 011 substantial, durable posts (PI. XX), or built of masonry with a basement or \" bodega\" which is used as a storeroom or cellar (PI. XIX). Some of them are surrounded by bal- conies, inclosed bv shutters or hv windows with translucent Placuna 7 shells for panes. The roofs are either of thatch or tile, the best thatch being that made of the leaflets of the nipa palm. Many of the houses are provided with vegetable gardens in which dome-shaped ovens may be seen. Under the eaves, so as to catch the drippings from the roof, are rows of bright-colored Phyllaurea and variegated Acanthaceae. Ornamental Araliaceae are also planted, some with finely divided leaves {Notlwpanax frutivmiwi), others with leaves shaped like saucers {N. 124 rSKKI'I, PLANTS OF GUAM. aiul others prettily variolated with white (Aralia tfut'l- jot/?t?t). Besides fruit trees, such iis lemons, limes, pomegranates, soursops. and sugar apples, there are shrubs, vines, and trees prized for the fragrance of their flowers such as Lawsonia. Telosma (Pergu- laria), and ilangilang, kanchos vary in size from simple huts, intended for the temporary shelter of one or two persons attending to adjoining patches of culti- vation, to well built permanent dwellings large enough for a whole family. A plat of ground after having been cultivated for four or five vears is often abandoned and aUcwod to lie fallow a few vears. I'nder these conditions it would not pay to erect permanent habitations on tho mesa. The usual form of a small rancho is (hat of a shod with walls of woven reeds, coconut leaves, or split bamboos and a coconut- thatched roof with oaves projecting sufficiently to keep the rain from coming in through the cracks. Half the hut is taken up by a plat- form of split bamboo, raised about '2. foot from the ground. This is the family bod. Beneath it are penned up each night the youngest broods of chickens with their mothers, to protect them from rats, cats, and lizards. The larger fowls ||y to the, spreading limbs of a neighboring tree (the site for a rancho is always selected near a suitable roosting tree), or upon the ridge of the roof, or perhaps on some convenient perch in the hut itself, where there are always four or tivo setting hens in baskets hung on the posts. Sometimes the whole family remain* at the rancho during the week, returning to town on Saturday so that their owners may be ready for early mass the next morning. On Sat- urday evening a procession of ox carts a mile long may be seen en route to the capital. They have little furniture. In homes of the better sort, are usually V L- found tables and benches of i HI wood, cane-bottomed beds, a few chairs, and almost invariably an altar with the imago of a saint enshrined above it, before which a light of cocoanut oil is kept burning. A few homos have handsome beds, tables, and chairs from the Philippines left behind by Spanish officials. Homes of the poorer kinds are desti- tute of bedsteads or tables, the natives sleeping and sometimes eating from mats on the floor. i'SlOI'T I. ARTS. Though it may be said that all the natives of Guam are essentially farmers, yet many of them show decided aptitude for various kinds of handiwork. In Agana there are excellent blacksmiths, silversmiths, carpenters, cabinetmakers, tanners, and shoemakers, and fairly good masons. In other parts of the island there are men skilled in lime and charcoal burning. A number of the women are adepts at weaving mats and hats of excellent quality from pandanus leaves; men twist string and make nets of pineapple fiber and ropes from hibiscus bark. Co-.;:.

Some of the natives are remarkably versatile, being called upon to practice various callings, as occasion may require. One of the Spanish governors, who elsewhere speaks somewhat disparagingly of the Chamorros, writes as follows: The late master armorer of the post, Dmi Vicente l'angelinan, worked with greater or less perfection an armorer, locksmith, blacksmith, wood carver, cabinet maker, car|>enter, silversmith, lathe turner. IK'wan well (itted to perform clerical work, having been employed an clerk in the Ireasurv, assisting with the local accounts as well with the college fund in cases of urgency; speaks and writes Spanish fairly well and speaks Knglish, and remaining after all these accomplishments a person of simple life and modest hearing. The successor and son-in-law of I>011 Vicente, the present armorer, also works as gunsmith, locksmith, blacksmith, silversmith, turner, carver, in layer, clock repairer, and tortoise-shell worker. He is also a thrifty rice grower, and attends personally to his plantations. One of the most interesting sights is to see him take a condemned musket and convert a portion of its barrel into a knife blade, welding in the steel spring for the edge and litting to it u handle of buffalo horn inlaid with mosaic designs of silver, mother-of-pearl, or tortoise shell. All of this he does with most primitive appliances. With equal skill and apparent pleasure in his work he converts an old piece of iron into a fosifio or scuffle hoe or into a plowpoint. The husband of one of Don Vicente's granddaughters is the principal silversmith of the island, lie makes spoons, forks, ladles, cups, or bowls well shaped and Hnelv finished, and he imitates models furnished him remarkably ? * well, melting up worn coin and silver pesos for his material. The principal cabinetmaker, a Filipino by birth, is also a rice planter. Me makes beautiful wardrobes of ililwood, carving .them in designs of his own invention and finishing them beautifully. Not many chairs arc made in Guam, as the natives prefer benches or settees. The ordinary tables, benches, and other furniture bear a close resemblance to the forms now popular in the United States known as \" mission furniture.\" Canopies for beds and tops of ward- robes are often carved, and show Philippine influence, the forms resembling those used by the Malayan people. The beds are usually provided with woven bottoms of rattan, like our cane-bottom chairs. There are men in Guam who make these bottoms, but tliev get their r i- O \"behuko.\" as they call the rattan, from the Philippines. Boards for the sides of houses and for Moors are sawed bv hand with large two-handled ripsaws, the logs being inclined against a raised platform, so that one man may stand on a stage above and the other on the ground. Serviceable carts are made with tough elastic USEFUL PLANTS OF CiUAM. shafts and with solid wooden wheels of Calophyllum wood, which are inclosed in iron tires usually made from old gun barrels. rT Leather of excellent quality is made from the hides of cattle and buf- falo and from deerskins. The principal tan bark used is that of I*Uhe- cofohituti a leguminous tree of Mexican origin. Shoes are com- monly made without heels, after the Philippine fashion, the uppers of yellow deerskin, ornamented with red leather, and the soles of cow skin or buffalo hide. Very good shoes are also made after European styles. Ordinarily while working on their farms the people wear sandals, for making which a piece of sole leather is kept on hand in each family. Each individual cuts sandals to the shape of his foot, as he may require them, securing them by thongs passing backward on each side of the foot from between the first and second toes. As a rule, the masonry work on the island, chiefly stone walls and the basements of houses, is substantial but crude. In squaring the stones and in laying them horizontal the mason frequently depends upon his eye, though he may have both square and level at home. The result is, as may well be imagined, that frequently the corners of buildings supposed to be square are by no means right angles, and stone steps and terraces intended to be horizontal are far from it. On having his attention called to such defects the workman may excuse himself by saying, ' Ay, senor, I am not a master mason. I didn't know you were so particular about having it square. I'll go home and get my level and square; or will you send your boy to borrow Don J uaii's I\" The source of both the stone and the mortar used for building is chiefly coral rock. Coral fresh from the reef is not used, as it contains salt and remains moist for a long time, and the mortar it yields is also salty, with a tendency to remain soft and sticky. Coral hummocks for building are taken from the reef and allowed to weather for a long time, and the best of lime is burnt from coral rock and limestone of the ancient reefs composing the greater portion of the island. Preparation of food.\u2014The principal food staples of the natives arc maize, rice, breadfruit, yams, taro, sweet potatoes, leguminous pods and seeds, and several species of Cucurbitaceae. They often eat fish of various kinds, venison, pork, and chicken, and less frequently beef. Wild ducks (vtwrwf oii.staletl) are highly esteemed. The sport of trawling under sail forbonito and other game tish has died out, and fish are caught only in tide pools and with cast nets along the beach. Most of the cooking is done in kitchens adjacent to the dwellings, raised like the latter from the ground and connected by means of a bridge or a solid terrace of masonry tilled in with earth, in the kitchen there is a raised shelf at the end opposite the direction of the prevailing wind covered with earth which is retained by raised slabs along the edge. Stoues are arranged in pairs at certain dis- G\" V. N.f Hr h V.ii IX. Plate XXI Fig. 1.\u2014A Mooeun Oven, Island of Guam. V 'A 1 - * *^r- , ' .

The cooking of the present day is very much after the manner of that in Mexico. The excavated ovens of the aborigines are little used except on ranches, and baking is done in dome-shape ovens of masonry which were probably introduced from Mexico. (PI. XXI, fig. 1.) Bread and breadfruit are baked. Yams and taro are baked or boiled or first boiled and then baked in ashes. Venison and beef are fried or broiled, and tish is cooked in various ways. Coconut, oil. when fresh, is used in cooking and is a good substitute for lard and butter. Coconut custard, expressed from the grated meat of ripe coconuts, is used in various combinations, giving a pleasant rich flavor to the dishes into which it enters. Arrowroot of Tttcra pnt mttifida is used for certain sweetmeats, and preserves or dulces are made of soursops, citrons, and fruits of various kinds. Maize is made into a paste and baked in the form of tortillas, after the Mexican fashion. Tender leaves of taro and other greens are used in place of spinach and asparagus. Coffee and chocolate are ground upon the stone used for making tortillas. Bread of excellent quality is made from imported wheat flour, fer- menting coconut sap being used to leaven it. This sap, when boiled fresh, is converted into sweet syrup and brown sugar. When the fer- mentation is allowed to continue it yields vinegar of excellent quality. Salt is evaporated from sea water in iron kettles. (PI. XXI, fig. %) Nearly everv native is addicted to the use of tobacco and to the habit ** ^ of betel chewing. Fermenting tuba (coconut sap) is a refreshing drink like cider, and is the common beverage of laborers. Formerly a kind of rum called aguardiente, or aguavente,\" was distilled from it on the island. The distillation of this liquor is no longer permitted. The use of opium is unknown. SI HNTA I. AMI MOKAI, CUAHACTKItlNTUH. Though the natives of Guam are naturally intelligent and quick to learn, little has been done for their education, and many of them are illiterate. The college of San Juan de Letifin was founded by Queen Maria Anna of Austria, widow of Philip IV, who settled upon it an annual endowment of pesos. Through misappropriation and dishonesty the annual income of the college gradually dwindled to about 1,0*H) pesos. The greater part of this was absorbed by the rector, who was usually the priest stationed at Agana, and by the running expenses of the school, which were the subsistence and wages paid to janitor, porter, steward, doctor, and the lightingof the building. A head herdsman was employed with two assistants to look out for the cattle belonging to the school. All of these men were paid salaries, so that there remained for actual expenses of instruction only 1!>2 pesos a year, 1)8 pesos of which were paid to the head master, 4b' pesos 128 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. to his assistant, and 4K pesos tor the minor expenses attending the education <)!' \"poor children.\" The education dispensed was of the most elementary nature. At times it consisted of a course in \"music and primary letters1\" and in giving\" to a few hoys sutlicient instruction to serve as acolytes for the priests, Many of the governors disapproved of the higher education of the natives. Don Francisco Villalobos suggested to the captain- general that the college he abolished and that the funds he applied to \"general education, to repairs and ornaments of the churches, and to the improvement of government, buildings and priests\" residences on the island/ He also recommended that the schoollioii.se be converted into an inn or guest house for the entertainment of strangers, and that the tixed income therefrom be applied to government purposes. The uupils, it was asserted, were injured rather than benefited by their eu cation and rendered unfit for future usefulness. On entering .(college they soon forgot the misery and poverty of their homes, and during their stay of five or six years became accustomed to good food, clothing, and lodging, without learning any trade by w hich they might afterwards earn a living and without forming habits of industry. The discipline was declared to be bad, and everything tended to make the students incompetent to earn their living, discontented with their lot, and, the more quick-witted among them, thorns in the side of the governor, who was often obliged to impose b 1 correctional punish- ments\" upon them.\" Another governor, Don Felipe de la Corte, recommended that the education of the natives be limited to the merest rudiments, to avoid their acquiring a. superficial knowledge of the more advanced branches of learning, which would lead to pretensions on their part to be men of education. Such persons. In; declared, gave more trouble to the authorities than any other class and were a disturbing element among the natives. In spite of Don Felipe's recommendation the captain- general at Manila did not see lit to divert the fund from its original object. From these and other extracts from the archives it is easilv seen *_ that the Spanish governors of the island of (!uam discouraged the higher education of the natives not because ihev thought them inca- pable of receiving it, but because they believed they would be more tractable if thev remained ignorant. SOCIAL INKTI'PI\"T1 ONs AND (TSToMs. Marriage.-\u2014The natives marry at a comparatively early age, and the young couple, though they may continue to live with the family of the bride or of the groom in the town residence, usual I v enter into Cj- % \" Don Francisro Villalobos, an\u00abl February tt, 18X3. THE MODERN INHABITANTS 129 possession of property which the parents of both have been gradually accumulating for their benefit. A would-be purchaser of a plantation of young coconuts or perhaps of some lumber observed lying under a house will probably meet with a refusal, the owner saying that he has cleared and planted the eocal for little Juan or Maria, or that he is accumulating a number of good posts so that Pedro may have a house of his own when he marries. Old bachelors and unmarried women arc not common in Guam. Most families have several chil- dren, differing in this respect from the Samoans, where there arc often only one or two, or where many of the women are barren. Hut before the American occupation the laws of the island did not per- mit divorce and remarriage, so that new alliances which might be formed by those who had separated could not be legalized. In con- sequence of this such un legalized alliances have been held up as examples of the shocking immorality of the island, whereas, in reality, in most cases observed bv the writer tliev were to all intents and pur- poses marriages in which the husband and wife were mutually faith- ful and the children in all cases well cured for. At the time of the American occupation prostitution was almost unknown on the island, though there were many cases of couples living together without hav- ing been married by the church or civil authorities. These alliances were looked down upon by the more respectable element, but as a rule illegitimacy was not considered a serious misfortune, and an unmarried mother was treated with pitying kindness by her neighbors. Relations hetwekn parents and children.\u2014The carefulness of parents to provide for their children has already been referred to. There are perhaps few countries in the world where greater attention is paid to the establishing of a young couple in life, though of course in Guam their wants arc comparatively few on account of the simplicity of their surroundings and their mode of living. One of the \"most striking features to a stranger is the conscientious way in which ille- gitimate children are provided for. While registrar of property on the island, the writer was struck in many cases by the earnest desire of fathers to secure legal titles for their illegitimate children to houses and plantations especially prepared for them, and the records show that some of the best estates on the island were the creation of unmar- ried parents for their children. On their part sons and daughters show the greatest respect and affection for their parents, recognizing their authority as long as thoy live. It is not unusual for a man or woman of 40 or f>0 years to ask permission of his parents before engag- ing in a business transaction, and the spectacle of old women, aban- doned and forgotten by their children, acting as water carriers, etc., so common in Samoa and among our Indian tribes, is unknown in Guam. Parents are tenderly eared for in their old ago, treated with deference even when in their dotage, and depart this life accompanied 1)77:5\u201405\u2014w 130 rsKFUL PLANTS OF GUAM by the prayers of all their family, all of whom leave their occupations and come from the most distant parts of the island to be with them during their last moments. One of the most touching- examples of filial piety witnessed by the writer was the case of a middle-aged mar- ried man who had been sued by his sister for the possession of sonic property. He made a clear, manly, straightforward statement to the court, but when his old mother testified against him he burst into tears, saying he could not contradict her because she was his mother, though it was found afterwards that the old lady had been influenced by her daughter to testify falsely. Respect for the laws.\u2014In referring to the law-abiding spirit of the natives Governor Schroeder writes as follows: I have had occasion at various times to note and to mention to the Department that many little actions on the part of the natives of the island indicate a friendly feeling for the American Government, its flag, and its representatives here. This feeling is quite unmistakable and will, I hope, Income well founded. * * * Jt is hoped that in time one prime difficulty will he removed, vi%, the dread by this peaceable and law-abiding people of complaining and testifying against those who maltreat them. To preserve law and order among the ] people themselves is a matter of no difficulty; the little company of [native] insular artillery, which forms the constabulary, although inefficiently armed, is an excellent body of respectful and reliable soldiers, with whose support alone there could be no hesitation in under- taking the government of the island.\" Feasts and cehkmoxies.\u2014On the evening before a wedding, fan- dangos, or dancing parties, are given at the homes of both the bride arid groom. Refreshments are served and betel nuts and cigars arc passed to the guests. The guests attend both entertainments, going in parties from one house to the other. The music for dancing is furnished o either by a violin and guitar, an accordion, or a piano, if there be one. Waltzes and square dances are performed, and occasionally a Spanish \"fandango.\" The wedding is solemnized in the church the next morning at early mass, and there is always a wedding breakfast, to which the family and special friends of the bride and groom arc invited. The usual church feasts are celebrated, especially those of Corpus Christi and of holy week. The ceremonies at funerals are very impressive. It is customary for all the relatives and friends of a dying person to assemble at the house, which is often too small to hold them. The custom of offering refreshments, betel nuts, and cigars recalls the death-bed scenes of the olden time described in the history of England and other European countries, when it was not unusual for thrifty persons in making their wills to ask that there should be no expendi- ture for spirits at their funeral.

The body in accompanied to the church and to the cemetery by the men, who go on foot, the women remaining* at home. As a rule the coffin is carried by four bearers, four others walking behind them to relieve them. At the cemetery the body is either placed in a boveda, or vault, the entrance to which is closed f>\\ a stone and sealed with mortar, or it is buried in consecrated ground. Usually the niche in the boveda is rented for a certain period of time, at the expiration of which the bones are removed and buried, Si'OETR and pastimes.\u2014Sunday is observed by all as a holiday. Nearly everybody attends mass in the morning. Before the arrival of the Americans it was customary to have cockfights in the after- C7 noon, and the government received a regular income for its share of the receipts of the cockpit. Sunday cockfights were abolished by a general order of the governor, and thus a check was given to the passion of gambling, which with some of the natives amounted to a vice The natives have no other sports except hunting for deer with dogs and guns. The boys amuse themselves with various games of Philippine origin. Kiteflying is popular, especially in the trade-wind season. In this sport some of them are experts, causing their kites to fight one another in the air, like fighting cocks. INDt'KTllIAi, SYSTEM. Mannkh of securing livelihood.\u2014The people of Guam arc essen- tially agricultural. There are few masters and few servants on the island. As a rule the farms are not too extensive to be cultivated by the family, all of whom, even the little children, lend a hand. Often the owners of neighboring farms work together in communal fashion, one day on A's corn, the next on D's, and so on, laughing, singing, and skylarking at their work, and stopping whenever they fee 1 so inclined to take a drink of tuba from a bamboo vessel hanging to a neighbor- ing coconut tree. Each does his share without constraint, nor will he indulge so freely in tuba as to incapacitate himself for work; for experience has taught the necessity of temperance, and everyone must- do his share if the services v.re to be reciprocal. In the evening they separate, each going to his own rancho to feed his bullock, pigs, and chickens. After a good supper they lie down for the night on a pandanus mat spread over an elastic platform of .split bamboo. None of the natives depends for his livelihood on his handiwork or on trade alone. There are men who can make shoes, tan leather, and cut stone for building purposes; but such a thing as a Chamorro shoemaker, tanner, stone mason, or merchant, who supports his family by his trade k unknown. In the midst of building ;i stone wall the man who has consented to help do the work will probably say; Kxcuse me, Senor, but I must go to my rancho for three or four days; the 132 USKKl'L PLANTS OF UUAM. weeds are getting ahead of my corn.'1 And when lime i.s needed, the native to whom one is directed may say: \"After I have finished gathering my coconuts for copra I will get my boys to cut wood and gather limestone to make a kiln. Never fear, Senor, you shall have your lime within six weeks.*1 On one occasion a blacksmith was delayed two weeks in making a plow, owing to the fact that tho man from whom he got his charcoal had been so busy supplying visiting vessels with fruits and vegetables that he could not find time to burn it. Ahsenck of 1'ovkkty.\u2014The result of this condition of society is that when a father dies the wife and children are not left destitute, as would be the case if they depended on the results of his handiwork alone. The crops continue to ripen and are gathered in due time by the family; the weeds and worms are kept out of the tobacco; the cotlee bushes bend each year under their weight of berries; the coco- nuts, us usual, yield their annual dividend. Indeed, in most cases the annual income in provisions is amply sufficient- to keep the family supplied with its simple clothing, some flour and rice brought by the traders from Japan or America to exchange for copra, and perhaps a few delicacies, a ribbon or two, or a kerchief to go over the head, and a new saint to place in the little alcove of the side room, where the light is always kept burning. Ahskxck OF wf.altii,\u2014Very few of the natives have accumulated money or property of value. Some of them own fine coconut groves, rice fields, and coffee plantations, and a few own small herds of cattle and buffalo. At first sight it seems an impossibility that poverty should exist where food can be produced in such abundance; and indeed were it not for the frequent hurricanes which sweep the islands there would be little necessity for accumulating capital. In spite of the dearth of food which invariably follows hurricanes, the majority of natives arc not inclined to cultivate larger crops than are absolutely necessary for the immediate subsistence of their families. They say that corn and rice will become moldy and spoil, or will be infested by weevils if kept a long time, and that all their extra labor in planting and reaping will be lost. This demonstrates the necessity for capital, and capital not in perishable rice and corn, but in the shape of good indestructible and divisible money having intrinsic value. In this way surplus food could be converted into money at the end of a good harvest and reconverted into food (imported rice or flour or tinned meats) in times of scarcity. As it is, when crops are ruined and the natives see starvation staring them in the face, the traders will not furnish them with supplies in return for the superfluous rosaries and trinkets they have accepted in exchange for their copra and other marketable products, and they have to go to the woods for cycas nuts and wild yams in order to keep themselves alive until succor comes from abroad. THE MODERN INHABITANTS 133 Peonage.\u2014Before the arrival of the Americans in Guam it was the practice of certain enterprising citizens of the island to encourage the natives to go into debt, advancing them goods or money for the use of their families or for the payment of funeral expenses and masses for the dead, in order to engage in advance as much copra as possible or to secure labor for their fields. As a rule very poor wages were paid; the employer by managing to make further advances from time to time increased rather than diminished the debt and kept the debtor in continuous servitude. A written contract was always drawn up before the first loan would be advanced, by means of which the debtor promised to work for his creditor until his indebtedness should be canceled.\" Shortly after the American occupation complaints were received by our officials that certain servants had \"escaped,\" and atten- tion was called to the system by which improvident or unfortunate natives were virtually made slaves, having sold themselves into bond- age. By order of the governor all contracts binding natives to labor in consideration for money advanced to them were declared void and the natives were permitted to work where they could get the best price for their labor, and to pay their creditors in money. Barter, or exchange of produce for imported goods, was also forbidden; so that the natives were not obliged to accept articles of which they really had no need, but were paid in money, and thus might begin to accumu- late capital to serve them in time of necessity. Not only was this a l\u00bbenetit in itself, but it allowed them to spend their money where they could do so to the best advantage, whereas under the old order they were obliged to accept what the traders, to whom they had mortgaged their crops, chose to give them. Labor.\u2014The natives of Guam have often been accused of laziness because they will not voluntarily raise large crops nor work as day laborers for others. Don Felipe de la Corte, one of the wisest and best of the Spanish governors, says, however, it does not follow because they did not cheerfully obey orders to plant excessively large crops for the benefit. of others that they are naturally indolent. Not- withstanding the fact that they had at times produced more food than could possibly be consumed, there was no provision for storing it, and when hurricanes laid waste their fields they found themselves as before, without resources, and consequently they thought it was better for them \"to work little than to work in vain. Owing to this they are accused of laziness, which they are far from manifesting when they clearly see the good accomplished by their labor.\" Governor Schroedcr, in his oflicial report to the Navy Department, says: s In the study of this question [exploitation of the unoccupied public; land] account must be taken <rf a noticeable trait of the Chainorro character, viz, tlie pride and \" See Plunl Wurld, voL T, p. liMH. 134 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. happiness in the possession of land, which results in the community being composed of il large number of small landowners. The effect of this is, of course, to minimize the amount of labor that, can be hired, with the direct consequence that, large holders are rare and that application of capital would be handicapj>ed by the dearth of labor. While this seems to offer something of a barrier to material productiveness, it is a very wholesome trait, which it is to be hoped will hold its own against outside influences.\" Means of communication.\u2014Transportation is effected by boats as well as by means of oxen, cows, and buffaloes. (PI. XXII.) Owing to the difficulties met with in crossing* the mountainous interior of the southern portion of the island, especially in the rainy season, when the roads are slippery and dangerous, transportation from the vicinity of lnalahan, on the east coast, to Agafia, on the west coast, is often car- ried on in boats, the small bay of Hahahyan, at the southern end of the island, being used as a landing place for that region. This bay can be entered only by boats of moderate size. The journey from Agana to Merizo is also much easier by sea than by land, and boats are used whenever articles of considerable bulk are to be transported between the two points. There are only three good roads on the island. The best is that leading from Punta Piti, the landing place of the port to Agana, the capital, which continues northward to Apurguan, the site of the late village of Maria Cristina, inhabited by Caroline Islanders. This fol- lows the west coast of the island throughout its entire extent and is almost level. Another road leads from the landing place at Apra, on the south shore of the harbor of San Luis, to the village of Agat, and from this road there is a third branching off to the village of Sumai, on the peninsula of Orote. There is a road across the island at its narrowest part, from Agana to Pago, which can be traversed only on foot or on the backs of ani- mals. During the administration of Don Pablo Perez, who made use of convict labor to carry on the public works of the island, this road was for the first time made passable for carts, which fact is duly recorded on a tablet in a small shed erected on the crest of a hill about halfway across the island. Now it is impossible for a cart to cross the island by means of this road, and in the rainy season parts of it are so boggy that it is almost impassable with pack animals. The road from Punta Piti to Agat, which passes around the margin of the harbor of San Luis, is so bad in places that it is frequently impassable on horseback. For crossing boggy places and passing muddy fords oxen and buffaloes are found to be much more efficient steeds than horses on account of their natural propensity for wading. From Agat to Merizo, the village at the southern extremity of the island, the road is interrupted in several places by abrupt headlands, which must either be rounded by entering the sea or crossed bv very steep \" Governor Schroeder'e report, in Report of the Secretary of the Navy for the year 1**01, pp. 82-83. Con'r, / .\"\\V,v , : h ^ 5 \\ * $ i s Yf k. '.ij FJ BO ADS OK THE ISLAND 135 p ths. From Merizo to Inalahan, around the southern end of the island, several marshy places intervene, ho that cart traffic between these villages is impossible. Going\" northward along the cast coast, from Inalahan to Pago, the road encounters the mouths of several rivers, two of which must be crossed on rafts or \"balsas,\" composed of several layers of large bamboos. There is a trail crossing the island from Inalahan to Apra, which in many places is precipitous and is slippery and dangerous where the soil is of heavy red clay devoid jf vegetation. Where this trail descends to cross a river the path has become so deeply worn that its vertical sides are as high as a horse's head. The road leading from Agana to the fine agricultural districts of Yigo, Santa Rosa, Mataguag, Mogfog, and Finaguuyog may be traversed by carts, but it is far from good. As Governor Schroeder has said in his official report * on the economic conditions in Guam, \"Lack of good means of transportation is one of the chief drawbacks to the develop- ment of the island.1' In speaking of the most important agricultural and grazing region, which lies to the east ward and northward of Agana, Governor Schroeder expresses the opinion that good cart roads, capable of withstanding the heavy and frequent rains, would probably lead to the acquisition of more public land by private persons. Individual efforts [he says] should Ik1 encouraged fully us much as collective cooperation, affecting, as it does, the entire community, and to this end it is projx)sed to lay out one arterial route, tapping in general plan, the middle of the region, and build a good road there as soon as may be. The country being Hat, no difficulties should exist beyond having, in Home parts, to carry the material for roadbed and surface some distance. With this thoroughfare created in place of the present mis- erable bog^y trail, it is believed that the present and future owners <if neighboring ranches will build small roads leading to it, and that agriculture will receive an impulse. This proposed road will I* some 15 miles in length. The cost of an entirely new road there is estimated at about 45,000 peso#, but a few short stretches of rock here and there will diminish the cost. The expenditure of 30,000 pesos, spread over two years, should produce very useful results. Later on, in after years, per- haps, cart-road communication should be established between towns on the south- east and southwest coasts and the harbor of San Luis de Apra and Piti. This will best l>e done by a shore-line road around the south end and up the west coast. In many part* this will require causeways to be built in the water around high project- ing points, which now have to be climbed; but as the water is very shallow this work should not be sis expensive as would first appear, and as the shore is protected from the sea by a barrier reef it would not l>e liable to injury by the sea except during hurricanes of unusual violence. A limited amount of attention could be profitably given to the present hull paths or trails across the mountainous interior of the island, but I am convinced that for the purpose of traffic on any useful scale direct routes over the mountains would best l>o eschewed in favor of the shore-line route. Each able-bodied native is required to contribute ten days each year to work on the roads of the island, or in lieu of this to pay a personal tax of $8, A tax of I per cent was levied on all real estate, but during \u00abIn Report of the Secretary of the Navy for the year 1901, part 1, pp. 82,83. USEFUL plants of git am. the past year, in consequence of the poor financial condition of the natives, half of this has been remitted. The proceeds of this tax go for the benefit of the schools and roads of the island, and the natives do not complain of the taxation. Present conditions.\u2014From a letter recently received from one of the most intelligent and enterprising- of the residents of the island the information in the following three paragraphs is taken; Government employees receive salaries twenty times greater than under the administration of the Spaniards. Simple laborers receive more than a dollar a day (silver) and carpenters and masons $3 a day. Servants will not work for less wages than 20 pesos (silver) a month. Notwithstanding these high rates money is by no means plentiful in the island. Employees of the island government are paid from the island funds. In cases where work is performed for the naval author- ities they are paid from federal funds, but these cases are rare. The only money coming to the people from the outside, in addition to that paid in wages to servants and laundresses, is what they receive from visiting ships and officers stationed on the island for fruit, eggs, and fowls. No other money is brought to the island; for copra, the only article of export, is paid for in clothing, sugar, flour, rice, candles, and kerosene. On the other hand, the Japanese and American trading companies collect all the money of the island and send it home. In March, 1904, rice was $25 per sack; flour, #13 per barrel of 100 pounds; 37\u00a3 a gaiita;\" chickens, $1.25 apiece; eggs, 6\u00a3 cents each; meat, 25 cents a pound. The result is that the natives are compelled to depend more and more upon the island products for their subsistence. In the civil hospital the sick are cared for by medical officers of the Navy, and medicines are dispensed free of charge to all those need- ing them. A number of marriages have taken place between Ameri- cans employed by the government and native women. Most of these marriages have proved happy, but there are several cases in which American marines have abandoned their native wives and left the island at the expiration of the term of their enlistment. The natives are very anxious for the establishment of a civil government on the island, citizenship for themselves, and public schools for their chil- dren. A supply of pure drinking water is sorely needed in Agafia, where all the wells are polluted, and a system of sewers is necessary for the health of natives and officials.

SOILS.\" The strand.\u2014The beaches are composed of fine coral sand and are especially well adapted to coconut plantations. Specimens of this soil examined by the Bureau of Soils, United States Department of Agriculture, were found to contain considerable organic matter, though not of such a nature as to be readily decomposed, and for this reason it might be well to apply manure to it. Considerable organic matter is constantly being added to the stretches of beach in the form of decaying vegetation and animal matter from fragments of fresh coral and shellfish cast up by the sea and dispersed by the wind. From prehistoric times extensive coconut groves have been continuously growing along the west coast of the island without apparent exhaus- I am indebted to Mr. Milton Whitney, chief of the Bureau of Moils, for much of the following information. 140 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. turn of the soil. On the oast const, which is exposed almost constantly to still' winds from the eastward, no coconut groves occur, and almost the only tree found growing near the waters edge is the Polynesian iron wood, Casuarina ef/ut'stjt{fo/ia. At a short distance from the beach, however, in places more sheltered from the wind, tine coconuts are produced. Bananas, plantains, eggplants, peanuts, garden vegeta- bles, and several kinds of fruit trees are grown by the natives along the beach, and great breadfruit trees and mangoes are also found growing in what appears to be nearly pure sand. Near Agana great stretches of sandy beach arc covered with beds of seaside daffodils {Pancratium. Uttoralr), and the goats-foot convol- vulus {Ipotnoeu and several leguminous plants. These must all contribute humus to the soil and serve to increase its fertility. Marshes.\u2014Marshes of sufficient elevation to admit of drainage are planted in rice. Where the water is stagnant and the soil is sour rice can not be grown. Several attempts have been made to cultivate the large swamp, or \"cienaga,'' near Agana, but they have not as yet proved successful. This swamp is but a foot or two above the level of high tide. It was once a lagoon and from its general level a few hillocks rise like islands, which are covered with coconuts and shrub- bery. Patches of the cienaga are cleared each year of the reeds which cover it (Trieboon) and are planted in taro, and in a number of places along the margin are groves of cocoanuts. Near Matan-hanoin, at the upper end of the cienaga are small plantations of cacao and thrifty abaka, or \"manila hemp\" plants. The latter grow without care and are not utilized. Swamp land is plowed with the aid of buffaloes. It is divided by low mud banks into fields of moderate size. It contains considerable organic matter from the rice stalks, which are turned under after the crop has been harvested. In the southern portion of the island there are a number of low, damp tracts of land at the mouths of streams. The soil covering them is deep and black, and has evidently been deposited by slowly-flowing currents. Where this land has been allowed to lie idle it becomes solidified like adobe, and in the dry season is crossed in every diroc- tion by deep cracks. Such an area may bo seen in a tract on the west side of the Maso River, near Topungan, which was formerly the prop- erty of the Sociedad Agricola de la Ooncepeion, With proper irriga- tion there is no reason why it should not be made to yield good returns. Other low-lying tracts are planted in sugar cane, but this industry has nearly died out in Guam. Fine tillable tracts lie near the mouths of the Asan, Sasa, Laguas, Aguada, Guatali, and Atantano rivers, and on the side of the island near Inalahan. Inthriok VALLEYS.\u2014In low-lying interior valleys, sheltered from the winds which constantly sweep the island, are a number of fertile tracts. On the east side of the island the vallev of CL a: O 5 < <3 \\- J-y W tr O U_ < X < -1 Q SOILS 141 is especially rich. During the rainy season it is for the most part flooded, but in December it becomes sufficiently dry to admit of cul- tivation, and yields a harvest of corn at a time when corn can not be grown on higher and drier land. In the northern part of the island the regions known as Santa Rosa, Mataguag, and Yigo arc famous for the excellence of their products. These regions have been less cultivated than those in this center and south of the island, owing to the fact that there are no sources of water supply for man or animals with the exception of one or two small streams in the immediate vicinity of Mataguag and Santa Rosa, where the platform of porous coralliferous limestone is pierced by volcanic outcrops. An analysis of the best soils of this part of the island shows that they consist largely of heavy reddish clay, and are comparatively rich in nitrates. Where the land is uncultivated it is covered with forest growth. When the forest is cleared (IM. XXIII) it is first planted in land taro, bananas, and plantains, and when the stumps are burned and the land sufficiently clean coconuts, cacao, and coffee are planted. Oranges of excellent quality arc produced in the Yigo and Santa Rosa districts, and in sheltered places fine cacao is successfully grown. The coffee of these districts is also of excellent quality. The determination of the water soluble plant food constituents in these soils, which was made by the Bureau of Soils, United States Department of Agricul- ture, shows that they compare very favorably with tropical soils in general. All are relatively high in lime, due to their coral origin. The amounts of potassium in the samples examined are large as com- pared with the soils of the United States, and the large amount of nitrates in the Yigo and Mataguag soils is especially noteworthy, characterizing them as very productive. Tiirc mksa.\u2014The northern half of the island consists almost entirely of a raised platform of coralliferous limestone called the \"mesa'' or \" mescta.'' Its surface is covered with a laver of soil often on I v a few inches in depth, of a reddish color from the presence of oxide of iron in the decomposing coral of which it largely consists. Beneath the superficial layer the subsoil is of rotten coral, and beneath this is a solid mass of the hard coral composing the ancient reef, cemented together by carbonate of lime formed by the action of water upon the oxidized surface limestone. Where the me seta lias been cultivated for a long time its productive power is small, and the natives declare it to be \"cansada/' or tired. Much of the mesa produces excellent tobacco, sweet potatoes, and maize, though no effort is apparently made to fer- tilize it artificially . Abandoned tracts on the mesa soon become over- 4 grown with scrubby bushes, including cassia, indigo, sappan wood, and other leguminous plants. The natives understand the economy of allowing them to lie fallow for a period of time sufficient for the undergrowth to form a thicket, and in selecting a tract for planting 142 HSKKUL PLANTS Of GUAM. they arc guided by the richness of the growth of hushes, which they are careful to hum upon the site. The leguminous shrubs undoubt- edly net as nitrogen store I'd. Peanuts could he cultivated with advan- tage for this purpose, and would be useful as a erop to alternate with maize and tobacco. Savannas.\u2014On the higher parts of the island there arc stretches of land almost hare or covered with .sword grass, called \"neti\" (Xip/ta- tjrostixfloridufa), a few weedy labiates, and a sprinkling of iron wood trees The boundary between the savannas and the wooded region is very sharply marked. All savannas are characterized by absence of drainage. The soil is a red clay, which becomes sticky and paint-like when wet, so that during the rainy season the roads across the savannas in the southern portion of the island become dangerously slippery and impassable. An analysis of savanna soil showed it to be almost devoid of organic matter, free from gravel arid coarse sand, and consisting almost entirely of clay and silt. Although it is rather low in nitrates it is possible that this deficiency might be remedied by cultivation and the application of manure. Though the amount of water-soluble phosphate contained by it is lower than in the soils examined from other parts of the island, yet, accord- ing to the report of the Bureau of Soils, it is as large as that in many productive soils of the United States, and it is<|uite possible that some savanna grass good for forage may be found to replace the coarse, sharp-leaved neti, which is of little economic value except for thatching. Cahcajo, ok (iuavel.\u2014The subsoil of the mesa and the cliffs forming the sides of the plateau consist in many places almost entirely of coral gravel. This is excellent road material and the streets of Agana arc formed of it. When first removed it is soft and crumbling, but it becomes hard and compact on exposure to the air. It consists largely of calcium carbonate. Similar material is used in the Philippines for road building, but it does not stand heavy travel for a long time and must be renewed at intervals. According to the report of the Bureau of Soils, material of this kind gradually decomposes into a red clay exceedingly high in iron compounds, and when organic material is present frequently becomes converted into black waxy fertile soils resembling, in many respects, the adobe soils of the southwestern United States. INDKiUNOl'H AND HJ'ONTANROIW ECONOMIC I'LANTS. Among the plants growing without cultivation on the island are (Jymtt circinalis, the nuts or seeds of which furnish the natives with food in times of famine; the wild fertile breadfruit thickets; the betel-nut palm (A/'ecu cafJtMu), which is abundant in some of the rich valleys in AGRICULTURE. 143 the southern part, of the island; aiul PurHl tih'acu.-ittn, which furnishes the natives with cordage.

(VLTIVATEI> POO It AM) S't'tMI'LAXT PLANTS. Garden plants.--In addition to their small farms nearly all the natives of Guam have a town house. Adjacent to many of these are gardens in which grow perennial eggplants, red peppers, bananas, plantains, various kinds of beans, squashes, gourds, watermelons, melons, peanuts, tomatoes of a small and inferior kind, balsam pears, mustard, and perhaps yams and a few vines of betel pepper. Among the fruit trees in gardens the most common are lemons, limes, the sugar apple, and the soursop. Pomegranates are grown more for orna- ment than for use, although a very refreshing drink is made from the acidulous pulp surrounding their seed. In some of the gardens giant taro (Alocasia) is grown for the sake of its leaves, which are used instead of paper for wrapping up meat and lish. Banana and plantain leaves deprived of their stiff midrib are used for the same purpose, and for cordage strings are stripped from their stem, or the leaves of the textile Pan da mis are used, a plant of which is sometimes grown in the garden for convenience. Radishes, onions, garlic, and lettuce are sometimes planted, but they do not thrive. (See under (ianlcnx in catalogue. Ckkkalh,\u2014The onlv cereals cultivated in Guam are rice and maize. The natives cultivated rice in considerable quantities before the dis- covery. It was among the supplies furnished to Magellan and Legazpi. The Dutch navigators, who came after them in Uioo and 1(>2L, complained that the bales were increased in weight by the addi- tion of sand and stones. These bales weighed on an average from 7(1 to 80 pounds. At present not sufficient rice is grown on the island for the use of the natives, though there are several localities well suited for its cul- ture. The methods followed are very much like those of the Filipinos. Buffaloes arc used for plowing. The plow is of wood with an iron point, usually fashioned by the blacksmith of Guam out of an old gun barrel. It has but one handle. Many of the best rice growers on the island within recent years have been Filipinos. At present rice is imported from Japan, Manila, and the United States. This would not be necessary if a litt le greater effort were made on the part of the planters. As a rule, they plant only enough for their own use and do not lay by a surplus. The result is that when the crop is ruined by a hurricane or a drought, which not infrequently happens, there is a 144 UHKKUL PLANTS OF GUAM. dearth of rice on the island. One reason for the small size of the cropa is the difficulty of obtaining labor. Nearly everybody has a ranch of his own, and prefers* to reap all the benefits of his own labor rather than to share them with an employer. Maize was introduced from Mexico at a very early date/' and soon became the principal food staple of the early missionaries and the soldiers sent to assist thein in the conquest of the islands. With maize came the Mexican nictate and mano, a low inclined stone slab supported on three legs on which tortillas are prepared, arid a stone rolling pin, cylindrical in shape with the ends slightly tapering. Maize is now the most important crop. On the higher land it is planted at the beginning of the rainy season. In the lowland, as in the valley of the Talofofo River, it is planted at the beginning of the dry season. As soon as it is harvested it is shelled and spread out on mats in the streets to dry in the sun. Then it is stored in earthen jars as a protection against dampness and against rats and weevils. In places where the soil is deep enough the land is prepared for maize by plowing. On the higher land the weeds and hushes are cleared, dried, spread over the field, and luirncd. This process serves to kill many weeds and at the same time to fertilize the land. Theonlv instrument of cultivation used in such places is the fosifio, or scuffle hoe, which consists of a wide transverse blade, placed T-like on the end of a long slender handle, the stem of the T being a hollow socket into which the end of the handle tits tightly. This is thrust ahead of the laborer, and serves to clear away bushes and to cut the weeds. After the corn is once planted, the surface is easily kept clear of weeds with the fosifio, the natives usually covering at one thrust a space of (! feet in length and the width of the blade. The use of this implement is universal. Even the women are adepts, and tiny fosmos are made for the little children. Edible roots.\u2014Among the edible roots of the island are taro (Calndtum voloemm) and yams {Dioscona spp,), both of which are cultivated by the natives and arc a resource for them during the periods of famine, which usually follow hurricanes. Taro is cultivated either in swamps (PI. XXIV) or in newly cleared ground. Certain varieties, the best of which has purplish stems and is called Visayan taro, u sunin visaya,\" are grown on hillsides and are of line consistency and flavor. The closely allied Alocasta indwa and A. tuaerorrhh<t arc not so commonly cultivated, but grow wild in many places. They arc very acrid and are only eaten in cases of necessity. The cultivated yams are probably varieties of Dlomorea aiata, J). mtiva, and D. aculmta.. Closely allied to the last is the wild gado or nika cimarron {Dim&n'ea xptDosa), which forms thickets in many \"Siie p. 21. Corv N i* Natural Size. C 1 1 \" r N it H, rr, V I ' X Plate XXVI.

Yams are moro difficult, to cultivate than taro, and are therefore not planted so commonly by the natives. Sweet potatoes are far superior to the best varieties of yams and of taro. The natives grow them principally to supply visiting ships. Several varieties occur in Guam. Unlike the yams and taro, which grew on the island before the discovery, sweet potatoes were intro- duced by the Spaniards. One variety was brought from the island of Agrigan, where it had been introduced by settlers from the Hawaiian Islands. Among other plants with starch-bearing roots arc the indigenous T(U'.m or Polynesian arrowroot; the true arrowroot which yields cassava and tapioca. Starchy fruits.\u2014The principal starchy fruits are those of the sterile breadfruit (Artoearpm com>n mi PI. XXVII), called \" lemae\" natives, well-known plantain {Mum para- dUhwd). Of the plantain there are several varieties. The fruit differs from that of the banana in being starchy instead of sweet, and it must be cooked before eating. When baked it has somewhat the taste and consistency of a potato, but is inferior to it in flavor. As both the breadfruit and plantain are seedless they must be prop- agated by suckers. This is readily done with both plants. They both grow with little care and produce abundantly in Guam. As the breadfruit is in season only during certain months of the year, some of the natives lay in a store of it for the rest of the year by slicing it and drying or toasting it in ovens, making a kind of biscuit of it which they call \" biscocho de lemae.\" If kept dry this will last indefinitely and may be eaten either without further preparation or cooked in various ways. It is tine food for taking on a journey, as it is light and conveniently carried. Squashes and pumpkins are grown, but they do not occupy a promi- nent place in the economy of the natives. The nuts of the Cyats ctrchmUx, called \"fadan\" by the Chamorros and \" federiko\" by the Filipinos, yield a nutritious starch. As these nuts are poisonous in their crude condition, there has been considerable prejudice against them on the part of some of the Spanish governors of the island. In other countries, however, a tine sago, or arrowroot, is made from them, which is declared to be superior to that made from the pith of sago palms. It is remarkable that the \"Polynesian chestnut\" {Bocoa edidi#), so widely spread over the Pacific, is not included in the Guam flora. Tree fruits. The principal fruits arc oranges, bananas, mangoes (PL XXVIII), and sugar apples {Annona squmnmom), all of which arc of tine quality. In the vicinity of Agat and the harbor of San Luis de 9773\u201405 10 146 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM Apra there arc inferior varieties of oranges, but in the districts of Santa Rosa and Yigo, in the northern part of the island, and in Yofia, on the eastern coast, the oranges are excellent. Lemons and limes produce continuously in great quantities all the year round. Among the introduced Annonaceae the sour sop (/I. m ttri- cata) is used for making jellies and preserves, and the bullock's heart (A. reticuhtta) is eaten as a fruit, but it is inferior to the sugar apple above mentioned. Citrons, pomelos, shaddocks, and bergamots are abundant. Averrhoa ca.raiubola, improperly called \"bilimbinos\" by the natives of Guam and the Filipinos, bears a translucent oblong fruit with the cross section of a five-pointed star, which has a pleasant acidulous flavor. Guavas grow spontaneously and produce abundantly. Little use is made of the fruit, however, owing to the scarcity of sugar on the island. Among introduced trees are the cashew (Ana- LXVT), neither of which have spread upon the island, but which are found only near villages or on the sites of ranches either in cultivation or abandoned. Coffee and cacao.\u2014Coffee and cacao have been introduced and thrive well in Guam. Coffee receives little care. It will grow in various situations and in almost any soil, and yields abundant harvests. Often most of the houses of a village, as at Sinahaiia, arc seen sur- rounded by coffee bushes, and the fresh seeds sprout spontaneously beneath the parent plant or if thrown upon the surface of the soil in a shady place. There are no large plantations in the island, each family planting enough only for its own consumption. The berries arc gathered, pulped, and hulled by hand. The cultivation of cacao is more difficult. The plants are very tender. They have a long taproot which is easily broken, and the plants do not bear transplanting well. They are very sensative to violent winds, and must be planted in sheltered valleys. Both coffee and cacao must be protected from the sun when very young. The use of shade trees is not necessary in Guam, though, in starting a cacao or coffee plantation, the intervening space between the rows of plants is usually planted in bananas, which yield fruit and at the same time serve to protect the tender young plants from the sun. Narcotics.\u2014The principal narcotics cultivated on the island are the betel palm and the betel pepper, which grew on the island before the discovery, and tobacco, which was introduced by the Spaniards from America. The betel palm, although frequently planted by the natives, also grows spontaneously. Thousands of young plants may be seen in the rich valleys of the southern part of the island where seeds have fallen from the palms. The betel pepper is a vine with glossy green leaves closely resembling the common black pepper {Piper a 'tyruni). It occurs only in a state of cultivation, but requires little care, the Cor.'r. M-tt. Ht'rh.. PLANTS. 147 natives propagating it very easily from cuttings and allowing it to creep upon stone walls and to climb over trees. (See Plates XXXV and LXIII.) Toddy, or tuba, is a fermented drink made from the sap of the coconut. Before the arrival of the Filipinos brought by the early Spaniards to assist in the conquest- of the islands the use of tuba was unknown. Until the arrival of the Americans an inferior brandy was distilled from fermented tuba, but its manufacture has been prohibited. Nearly every family on the island lias its tobacco patch, each raising barely enough for its own consumption. The seeds are germinated in nurseries and transplanted to spots near the plantations, where they are kept shaded by canopies of muslin, and then are set out in fields, each plant shaded by the segment of a coconut leaf. All hands assist in its cultivation\u2014parents, children, and grandparents\u2014and it requires constant attention and no little effort in fighting against weeds and tobacco worms to make the crop a success. Oil-yielding plants. \u2014The coconut is the principal source from which the natives derive oil. Coconut oil is used for cooking, light- ing, and anointing. In taking the place of lard fresh coconut oil imparts an agreeable flavor to many articles of diet. Nearly every house on the island has its patron saint enshrined in a niche or side room, with a light of coconut oil burning before it. The oil is con- tained in a goblet half filled with water, which keeps the glass cool. The wick is supported on a float. Oil used for massaging the body (a custom which Guam shares with many Pacilic islands) and for anointing the hair is often perfumed with flowers of various kinds (p. 210). Dried coconut meat, or \"copra,*1 is exported from the island. Most of it is used for oil which enters into the manufacture of candles and soaps, and is an ingredient of a number of medicines. Among other oil yielding plants are the castor bean the physic nut (Jntroph<f a wens), and the the candle nut {Aleuritcx tnohfc- atn<(), which has been sparingly introduced. These plants are all members of the Euphorbia family. Their nuts and oil are drastic purgatives if taken in quantity, and are poisonous if taken in too great doses. The candle nut, called i*kukui'\"> in Hawaii and \"lama ^ in Samoa, derives its name from the custom of the ancient Polynesians 4 of stringing the roasted kernels on the rib of a coconut leaflet, the tip of which is set on fire and burns like a candle, the flame consuming the oily kernels as it descends. At all luaus, or native feasts, in the Hawaiian Islands, chopped kukui kernels mixed with seaweed form an indispensable dish, which takes the place of a relish. In many tropical countries illuminating and lubricating oils are made from the castor bean and the physic nut, and both\" of these oils are important medicines. An oil like that derived from the almond mav be obtained from the 4 nuts of Terminalia cutajypu. The seeds of Mochija- mvrlnja are the 148 VSKFUli PLANTS OF GUAM. source of the ben oil of commerce, which is much prized as a lubricant by watch makers and is sometimes used in the West Indies as a salad oil, Dilo oil is derived from the fruit of ValopJnjlfiuit inophylluw, and peanuts and sesame are well known oil-yielding plants. An acrid, oily liquid called \"cardol*' has been derived from the shells of cashew nuts {Annvardt.nm. oveidentnL). It is used to varnish furni- ture and books as a protection against white ants and other pests. These oils are not prepared by the natives of Guam. TKXT1LK AMI! THATCH l'LANTN, Fiber plants.\u2014Among the monocotyledons yielding fiber are the coconut {Ciww ntwiferti), from the husks of which is derived the coir which is twisted and braided into cords and sennit; the pineapple {Ananas atuiJHix), the leaves of which yield a beautiful, fine, silky fiber, which the natives of Guam twist into thread for making the finer fish nets; the abaka, or manila hemp (Mtum te.iiilix), introduced from the Philippines, and growing without care on the part of the natives, but not utilized by them on account of the labor and skill necessary to extract its fiber; and a species of Agave, called lirio de palo,\" evidently introduced from Mexico, the leaves of which yield an excellent fiber, which in Guam is utilized only for wrapping cigars. In addition to these, a palm called \"cabo negro\" has been introduced from the Philippines. This species, which is known to commerce as the \" gomuto,\" is S(\u00abj*uirwi -phumtux. Its stem when young is entirely covered with sheaths of fallen leaves and black, horsehair-like fibers, which issue in great abundance from their margins. As the tree increases in age these drop off, leaving a columnar stem or trunk. In the Malay Archipelago the thickest fibers are used by the natives as styles for writing on leaves of other palms. The finest fibers are known in Eastern commerce as gomuto or ejoo fiber, and arc much used for making strong cordage, particularly for cables and standing rigging of vessels, whence the name \"cabo negro,\" or \"black rope\" is given it in the Philippines. The ropes made of this fiber are not pliable enough for running rigging or for fine cordage. The fibers need no preparation but spinning or twisting. Cabo negro ropes are said to be more durable than any other kind when subjected to repeated wet- ting. At the base of the leaves there is a woolly material suitable for calking the seams of vessels. The species grows well in Guam, but on account of the abundance of other fibers it is not utilized by the natives. Among the dicotyledons the principal fiber plants belong to the Malvaceae, Tiliaceae, lTrticaceae, and Moraceae. The chief of all is Paviti f a tree widely spread over the tropical regions of the world, from the inner bark of which ropes and twine are twisted. Its use for this purpose is so extensive in Guaiu that there is scarcely a Cc*v. Mit. Hi-'n. : X Plate XXX. Cvr FEE N FULL B1.00V. KIliER PLANTS* 149 family which dors not possess a rope-making apparatus similar to the simpler forms of those used in rope walks elsewhere. On the east coast of Guam, in traveling* from Pago to the southern extremity of the island, it is necessary to cross the mouths of several rivers. Iialsas, composed of several layers of bamboo, are used for this purpose. The cables by means of which they a re pulled across are made from the fiber of Pariti tiliacvum. Though this Hbcr is not easily worn out in its natural condition, its strength and durability are increased by the application of tar, such as that used on board ship. Among other members of the mallow family are several species of Sida, called uescobilla\" by the natives. They grow without cultivation on the island, in waste places and along the roadsides. They yield a good, strong fiber, but on account of the abundance of other material the natives do not use it. Allied to those in general appearance and use are several species of Tiliaceae, including Trhimfetta procu//t7)ens, which is called \"masigsig\" by the natives, allied to the species which produce the jute of commerce, so extensively used in the manufacture of gunny sacks, matting, and carpets. They are not, however, utilized in Guam. The principal member of the tTrticaceae, or Nettle family, is the celebrated rhea fiber plant {llwhim-riti, ienacixshtui). In Guam it grows to the height of a shrub or small tree, though in many other parts of the world it is herbaceous. Though allied to the nettles in appearance and inllorescence, it is not armed with stinging hairs. The closely related lioehnteria win a, which yields the China \"grass cloth\" fiber, is a plant of temperate regions, the lower surface of the leaves being covered with white down, like felt. The leaves of the Guam plant, though pale beneath, arc not coated with felt. This plant, though of great importance in other parts of the world and growing in Guam ran My and without care, is in this island not utilized at all, except for medicine. The last species I shall mention is the principal member of the Moraceae, the breadfruit tree {Affinwrpttx vomnuoux). In addition to its importance as yielding the principal staple of food, excellent wood, fodder for animals, and a gum suitable for paying the seams of canoes and for use as a medium in mixing paints, it yields a tough leathery bark, which in the olden times was made by the natives into aprons or breech cloths. Tapa cloth, which is made from it in other islands of the Pacific, was apparently not made by the aboriginal inhabitants of Guam. The paper mulberry, 1 (fhou^onrttu) /wy>///7/v7v/.v, the tapa plant so widelv spread throughout Polynesia, does not occur in Guam. I L \" f Mat and hat wants. At least four species of pandanus occur in Guam, two of which, called \"pahong1* and kafo\" by the natives, are widely spread in the forests, and furnish food to the fruit-eating bats 150 USEFUL PLANTS OF HIT AM. and wild rats. The third species furnishes leaves which, when young iind hinder, are cooked with vegetables as a flavor!ng. The fourth spe- cies is called ^aggag.\"' Its leaves are remarkably strong- and pliable. They are used for lashing together the parts of a house or hut and for string; and when divided into narrow ribbons they are braided into hats, sleeping mats, mats upon which corn and other seed arc dried, and bags for holding corn and rice. Only one sex of this plant occurs in Guam. It is propagated by cuttings, limbs when cut off taking root readily in almost any kind of soil. The leaves of the other spe- cies are inferior and arc scarcely at all used. A coarse kind of mat is made by weaving or wattling the stems of a reed which grows in marshy places {Triehoon roxhurghii)* called \" kar- riso\" by the natives. These mats are often used to cover the walls of lightly constructed houses and are sometimes coated with a kind of c la v. fe.- Thatoii pi,ants.\u2014The majority of houses in Guam are thatched with coconut leaves, but those of the 1 tetter class with the leaves of Xyjxt frutwanx, an interesting trunkless palm introduced from the Philip- pines, which has established itself at the mouth of every stream of importance in the island. When there is a dearth of coconuts and nipa, sword-grass, or \" ncti^ (Xi]>ha{jrostix jl<>ri<luht)^ is used. Coconut leaves to be used for thatching are gathered, dried and split down the midrib, the two halves being placed together in reverse direction and the leaflets interwoven diagonally. Women arc usually employed in this work. Leaves thus prepared arc lashed to the frame- work of the roof with strips of pandanus leaves, beginning at the eaves and ending at the ridgepole, the leaves being placed so close together that they form a thick imbricating thatch. Coconut thatch is not very durable. As a rule it lasts only three or four years. In preparing the leaves of the nipa palm the leaflets are detached from the midrib or rachis, cured by drying, and attached to reeds in the form of a fringe. These are laid on the timbers of the roof frame in the same way as the coconut leaves, but closer together. Neti is prepared in the same way. The thatch thus formed is more homo- geneous, compact, waterproof, and durable than the former. KOItAGE PLAXTS. As garden patches are not inclosed, cattle, horses, buffalo, and pigs can not be allowed to run at large. They are kept tethered and conse- quently require to be cared for, fed, and watered. Often the avail- able pasturage in the vicinity of a town or village is exhausted and it is necessarv to take the animals a considerable distance before a good * ~ grazing place can be found. Usually forage is gathered and brought to the animals. Besides several species of grasses the best forage plant is the breadfruit {Artocarpux vojinnunix), great quantities of the leaves FOR AUK PLANTS. 151 of which :uv gathered for this purpose. Tim brunches of several leguminous shrubs and of Mt>vn\\<j<i morin<ja arc much relished by cattle, and the plants of the cultivated Plutxeahix mnntju atidof peanuts form excellent forage. Attempts have been made to cultivate alfalfa (Mrdlcmjo mtiva), but this plant evidently flourishes best in dry cli- mates where irrigation is practiced. It does not thrive in Guam. The nearest approach to clover on the island is the tiny MrifamrUi tri- jftrt'n, which grows close to the ground and forms a thick sward in places where the grass does not crowd it out. Cattle and hogs are very fond of the fruit of Artoctrjmx commiinix. After hurricanes, when the ground becomes covered with breadfruit, hogs eat great quantities of it and become very fat. The sweet pods of PHheeolohhun. ditfee are also eaten by animals. J^'oxopix julijf.oru, which is an important forage tree in the Hawaiian Islands, has not yet become established in Guam. Cattle and horses feed upon its foliage as well as upon its pods, and there is no reason why it should not thrive on the island. Among the grasses the most nutritious is Bermuda grass { Cuprhila called ugrama\" by the natives. It grows luxuriantly in the sandy soil of the lowlands. DochjUictdnhun and .ft!rwhit: hullcti are edible, but coarse and not much relished by horses. Stalks of green maize and the leaves of ripe maize are excellent for food. Many of the coarser grasses growing in damp places which horses and cattle will not eat are eaten by buffaloes. Heeds {Trtchoon voxhurghii) are often collected for fodder, and are especially relished by buffaloes. They arc rather coarse when old for cattle, but the young shoots are eaten by them. Among the plants elsewhere reputed to be injurious to animals is Leuciitiui ijlawn* an introduced shrub, which is very common in the Bahama Islands. Mr. L. H. Dewey, of the United States Department of Agriculture, while on the island of New Providence was shown horses, without manes or tails, which had lost them, it was declared, as the effect of eating this plant. WEEDS. The number of tropical weeds which have found their way to Guam is remarkable. In waste places, along the roadsides, on the borders of rice fields, and among growing vegetables, nearly all the weeds are of species widely spread over the warmer regions of the world. Some of them, like the malvaceous Urena and tiliaceous Ti'iumfetta have prickly, bur-like fruits spines; others like the milk- weed {Ascf</)o(.s <>{/<fs.vt/vVw) have silky pappus attached to the seed, which provides for their dispersal by the wind. There are also com- posites (Glossogync) with retrorsely seal >r id bristles attached to their achenes, and marsh plants with seeds which readily adhere to the feet 152 USKtTL l'LANTH OF GUAM. or feathers of birds. These peculiarities undoubtedly account for the wide dissemination of many of the weeds. Many of the marsh birds and shore birds visiting Guam are migratory, and it is very probable that they have brought with them seeds or fruits from other regions. It is pleasant to note the absence of the troublesome sensitive plant (Miwma pudlcu) and the Lantuna cam am from the flora of Guam. Other shrubby plants of wide distribution occur in Guam, however, especially the guava, the two common species of indigo, Leucaena If/atwu, and several American species of Cassia. Nearly all the com- posites on the island are introduced weeds, belonging to the most serious injury to growing crops is caused by the deer, which overrun the island. They often destroy whole fields of corn, garden patches, and tender young coconut plants, approaching villages by night and eating watermelons, squashes, and other succu- lent fruits on the vines. Rats occur in great numbers and attack many vegetable products, especially corn and cacao, and Hying foxes cause considerable damage to certain fruits. Weevils get into the gathered corn and rice, which must be kept in earthen jars well closed as a protection against them: termites destroy living trees as well as dead wood; and tobacco patches are infested with the larvae of a sphinx moth. Few garden patches are inclosed by hedges or fences, so that serious injury is often caused by hogs and cattle running at large. Horses and cows are especially fond of the foliage of the breadfruit, and will injure young trees if unprotected. Among the staple food plants there arc fewer diseases and insect pests than in most tropical countries. I'IjAXT XA.MKS. Classes of names.\u2014The common names of (iuam plants may be classified under three heads: First, vernacular names applied to plants which grew in the island before the discovery, such as \"far\" (rice), \"pugua\" (betel nut); second, East Indian and American names of plants which have been introduced since the discovery, such as \"mafigga\" (mango), \"kamote\" (sweet potato); and a third class including names applied by the natives to plants brought to the island either from other parts of the Pacific or from more remote regions, as \"baston de Sun Jose'1 (St. Joseph's stall), applied to \"ki,\" of Polynesia, and \"cadena de amorv (chain of love), applied to the Mexican Antiyonuu Uptopux on account of its racemes of TUR1H VMUXACl'LAK NAMKS. It is easy to trace the names of most of the plants introduced since the. VERNACULAR NAMES OF I'LANTS. discovery. In most cases they are identical with the common name applied to them in the regions from which I hey have heen directly obtained, or have heen somewhat modified to correspond with the genius of the language spoken by the natives of their new environment. Of greater interest to the student of ethnology and of the origin of cultivated plants is a comparison of the common names of plants dis- seminated in prehistoric times throughout the entire range of their cultivation. From such a comparison it has been possible to determine the origin of a number of the more common food staples, such as sugar cane, the coconut, the winged yam {Dioxcoi'ea (data), the common names of which are etvmologicallv identical from the eastern limits of % o * Polynesia throughout the islands of the Pacific, the Philippine Islands, and the Malay Archipelago. Some names extend even to the continent of Asia and to the island of Madagascar, on the edge of Africa. That most of these plants have been spread through human agency is evi- dent from the fact that they do not grow spontaneously, but need the help of man for their propagation. Some of them even, such as the banana, plantain, breadfruit, sugar cane, yams, and taro, seldom pro- duce seed and are propagated asexually by means of cuttings, off- shoots, or tubers. In addition to garden products a number of trees bear the same or similar names in many groups of islands, such as Harrinyionhi KjmnmH* h)Uia1j{j>uj<i, and Par'til tUiaeeum, all of economic value to the natives. This is especially striking when we consider that some of these plants have the same names on islands so remote that their inhabitants have had no intercommunication within historic times. We have sonic light upon the method by which the more important plants were spread in the traditions of the Ilawaiians, which tell of voyages to distant island groups for the purpose of obtaining breadfruit and other useful plants. Some of the widely spread species bear one name throughout the islands of eastern Polynesia, but are known bva different name in the islands of the western Pacific and of the Malay Archipelago. Among these are the breadfruit, screw pine, kava pepper, taro, and iron wood (Qt8uarr)i(i equhi'tifolia). In a few eases a name is applied, not to the same plant, but to a plant more or less similar. Thus the name \" gabc \" is applied in the Philippines to the taro plant (Oaladlnm t'ofocasia); in Samoa, Karo tonga, Tahiti, Hawaii, and Easter Island to a species of Alocasia (kape, or 'ape); and in the Caroline Islands to a yam (kap)\u2014 all plants having starchy, edible roots. The Philippine name for Alo- casia (biga), which becomes' \"piga11 in Guam, reappears in Fiji as \" via.\" The etymological identity of these words is undoubted, for the changes which the consonants undergo follow the same law in many other words. On the island of Guam several important plants were cultivated by the aborigines which were unknown in eastern Polynesia - such as rice. 154 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM I lie betel pepper, and tin* arcca palm. These are undoubtedly of Malayan origin and bear Malayan names. They probably found their way to the Malayan islands after the departure of the people who spread over the eastern Pacific islands, but before the separation of the settlers of Guam from the parent stock. Jt is interesting to note that the Guam name for rice (fae, or fai) is more closely allied to the Java name (bai) than to the Philippine (palai). Besides rice, the betel pepper, and the areca palm the natives of Guam took with them a textile screw pine (Pttndmutx tretnriux), which has to be propagated by cuttings, as only one sex occurs on the island, and it consequently does not fruit. On the other hand, the eastern Polynesians took with them n number of plants unknown to the ancient Chamorros, such as the paper mulberry, the kava pepper, the candle nut, and the so-called chestnut of Polynesia (litmm edulix), all of which are of East Indian origin. Endemic names.\u2014One of the most striking facts connected with Guam plant names is the occurrence of some which are, as far as can be ascertained, quite different from those of any other region. Such are the names of the several forms of yam (nika and dago), bananas and plantains (chotda), Cycas (fadang), bamboo (piao), and the various species of screw pine (aggag, pahong, kafo). The name for breadfruit (leniae) hears no resemblance to that used by the Polynesians (ulu), and the name for the taro plant (suni), which I have been unable to tind elsewhere in the Pacific or the Philippines, 1 believe to be identi- fied with \"sunge,1\" or \"songe,\"' its name in the islands of Madagascar and Reunion.

Anson.\u2014No book ever met with more favorable reception than Lord Anson's Voyage Round the World, which, though printed under the name of his chaplain, Richard Walter, was composed by Benjamin Robbing, under the inspection of Anson himself. During his visit to the group, in 1742, Anson gleaned much interesting information regarding the island of Guam, its inhabitants, and its products. His geographical, hydrographic, and botanical descriptions arc remarkably accurate and exceedingly interesting, though his picture of the island of Tinian is perhaps a little too highly colored. rSKFirt.

DESCltl l'TION. Among the most important works describing the island of Guam may be mentioned Dampier s Voyages and Freyci net's Narrative, to which references have already been made, and the following works: Don Felipe de la Corte's Memoria Coronel, ex-Gobernador Politico Militar, Manila, 1887. A description of the island was also given in a paper by the author published in the Ameri- can Anthropologist, n. s., vol. 4, 190%, and afterwards republished in the Report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution for 190:>. See also the description of Alexander Agassiz in his coral reefs of the Tropical Pacific, 1903. LITERATI'KK. HISTORY. The most important historical work relating to the island is Garcia's Vitla v martvrio dc cl venerable Padre Diego Luis de Sanvitorcs (see below). This work was dedieated by tlio author to the Kxcelentisima Sefiora Dona Maria dc Guadalupe, Duchess of Aveyro y Ma<|ueda, Duchess of A rows, si nee it was by her generosity that its publication was rendered possible. It is made up almost entirely from the annual reports of the Jesuit missionaries living on the island of Guam and was published very shortly after the events it records. It forms the basis of all subsequent histories. In the year 1700 there appeared at Paris a little book entitled \" His toire des isles Marianes, nouvcllemeiit converties a la religion Clue tienne; et de la mort glorieuse des premiers missionaires qui y out preehe la Foj*,\" par le Pore Charles le Gobien, de la Compagnie de Jesus. The greater part of this work is almost a literal translation of the preceding, though in the introduction the name of Padre Garcia is not mentioned. Pere le Gobien continued the narrative from l(i.xi to 1694. In conformity with the decrees of Pope Urban VIII, and of other sovereign pontiffs, Pere le Gobien protests at the beginning of the work that he does not pretend to attribute the title of saint, apostle, or martyr to the apostolic men of whom he speaks in the his- tory. In his work he has used on several occasions simple statements of Padre Garcia as themes for elaborate variations, giving speeches of natives in the form of direct discourse and sometimes exaggerating in a most misleading manner, as in his account of the sensations of the natives of Guam when first beholding fire.\" In Burueys Chronological History of the Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean, to which reference has already been made, there is a resume of the principal works referring to the Marianne Islands. Hurney's work is most interesting and is characterized bv a broad humanity and sympathy for the simple natives of the islands of which he writes and hatred for injustice and oppression. Don Luis de Ibafiez y Garcia, in his Historia de las Islas Marianas. 1886, repeats the historical information given by Pere le Gobien. His account of the social institutions, religion, and superstitions of the aboriginal inhabitants (chap. 10, p. 73), has nothing to do with the natives of Guam, who were ignorant of the gods, the bloody sacrifices, and disgusting practices of which he speaks. He tells of crocodiles, hogs, and other animals, which were unknown in Guam, and relates myths which he had evidently gleaned from some of the Philippine tribes. \"See pp. 99,100, above. 158 IJKKFUL PLANTS OF (tilAM. LANGUAGE. A grammar of the language of Guam, of which three party have already appeared, is now in process of publication in the American Anthropologist. See \"The Clianiorro language of Guam/' by William Edwin Satford, in vols. 5, 6, and 7 (1903-5) of that journal. See also the \"Christian Doctrine\" entitled ''Devocion a San Fran- cisco en Marianas. In tliis little work the creed, prayers, and instructions are printed in Span- ish and Chamorro in parallel columns. A small Spanish-Chaniorro dictionary by the same author was published in Manila in 1865, also a text book for teaching Spanish grammar to the children of the Mari- anne Islands. This work is entitled \" Gramdfiea Ch<tmorrabut it is simply a translation of a grammar written by Luis Mata y Araujo, and is dedicated to the schools of the Mariannes for the purpose of teaching Spanish to the native children. It does not in the least treat of the grammar of the Chamorro language. As far as is known to the author, no grammar of the Chamorro language has hitherto been published. NATURAL HISTORY. In addition to the publications of the scientific expeditions a)ready referred to, attention is called to the following works: Les mammiferes et les oiseaux des lies Mariannes, par M. E. Oustsilet, published in the Nouvelles Archives du Museum dUistoire Nature lie, troisieme serie, tomes U et 7, 1895-9(i. On the Birds of the Marianne Islands, by Ernest Hartert, in Novita- tcs Zoologica*, vol. 5, 1898.

Pacific island floras.\u2014The principal works relating to the vege- tation of islands in the Pacific Ocean are Schumann und Lauterbach's Flora der deutschen 9, 1887); Thomas Powell, Various Samoan Plants and Their Vernacular Names (SeemamTs Journ. of Botany, vol. 0, 18HS); F. lieinecke's Samoa-Inseln of H AL do la Polynesie ISlfO). In addition to these may be mentioned the publications of results of the scientific expeditions of Malaspina, Romanzofl', Freycinet, and Dumontd'Urville, already referred to, and the botany of the (_'h<ilhn<jrr expedition. Othkk tropical floras. \u2014 Since iiiaii\\ of the plants of (iuam are of wide distribution in the Tropics, it is interesting to compare its flora with those of other tropical countries. The principal works used for comparison have been Padre Blanco's Flora de Filipinas: Hooker's Flora of Nederlandsch Indie; Gri.se I well's Flora of the British West Indian Islands; Secniarm* Flora of the Isthmus of Panama, in the Botany of the Voyage of Martini (pie), par le K. P. Duss (in Annales de 1 Institut Colonial de Marseille). Many of the botanical descriptions included in the Descriptive catalogue of plants have been taken directly from Padre Blanco, Hooker, arid Trillion, and a few from Hillebrand, Grisebach, and Seemann. Geographical distribution and ecology. The following are tlie more important works consulted: Grisebach s Geographische of Cultivated Plants; and Wallace's Island Life. The attention of those interested in the dispersal of plants by ocean currents is called to the works of Ilemsley and Guppy, given in the list below, and the works of Treub and Sellimper, already cited. Systematic e tra nettarii estranuziali; and Darwin's Power of Movement in Plants and Effects of Cross and Self Fertilization, are among the principal works consulted. TROPICAL AGRICULTURE AND ECONOMIC PRODUCTS. Among the most important works on tropical agriculture consulted are Firminger's Manual of Gardening for Bengal and Upper India; 160 rSKFl!L PLANTS OF GUAM perhaps the most useful to :in English-speaking colonist is the work of Nicholls. A translation has been made of it into Spanish by Prof. II. Pittier and published at San Juan do Costa Rica in 1901. In addition to these are Cook and Collins1* Useful Plants of s Extra- tropical Plants; Maiden's Useful Native Plants of Australia; and Major Drury's Useful Plants of India, More comprehensive works are Watt's Dictionary of the Economic Products of India; Spoils1 Encyclopedia of the Industrial Arts, Man- LIST OF WOHKS COKSI LTED.

In the following catalogue the Guam names and those of the Hawaiian and Sainoan Islands are taken chiefly from the manuscript notes of the author. His list of the vernacular names of the plants growing in Guam is supplemented by the lists of several Spanish governors of the island in official reports to the captain-general of the Philippines, copies of which were found in the archives of Agana, and also by the names cited by Chamisso and Gaudichaud in the reports of the botany of the expeditions to which they were attached. The list of Hawaiian names is supplemented by a number taken from Hillebrand1s Flora of the Hawaiian Islands, and that of the Satnoan names from Rev. Thomas Powell's list of Sainoan plants and their vernacular names published in Seemann s Journal of Botany, IMS, and Rev. George Pratt's Grammar and Dictionary of the Samoan Language, 1893. The Philip- pine names have been taken from Pad re Blanco's Flora de Filipinos and Padre Mercado's Libro de Medicinas, supplemented by Mr. Merrill s Dictionary of the Plant Names of the Philippine Islands, 1JH)3; the Fijian names from Seemann s Flora Vitiensis; the Tahitian names from Drake del Castillo's Flo re de la Polynesie Fram/aise; the Mexican names from I.)r. Kdward Palmer's manuscript notes and from Dr. Jose vulgar y cientilica de las Plantas Mexieanas, 1W)2; the Panama names from Seemann's Flora of the Isthmus of Panama, published in the Botany of the Voyage of the Herald, 1852 to 1857; and the Porto Rico names from Cook and Collinses Economic plants of Porto Rico, supplemented by the lirst part of Urban s Flora Portorieensis, in Symbolae Antillanae, 1903. The Guam names are pronounced in general according to the conti- nental method, the vowels having more or less resemblance to those of the German and Italian languages, and the consonants being like those of the English. It must be observed, however, that g is always hard, as in the English word \"go,\" except in the combination ng; h is always aspirated, even at the end of a syllable, very much like the German ch in uach\" (\"ahgao,\" the name of a tree, is pronounced \"ahh-gao\"); n is like the Spanish letter in the word \"canon,\" or ni in the English word \"onion;\" ng is like ng in the Knglish word \"song\" (not like ng in \"linger\"); y is always a consonant, pro- nounced like the English letter j (\"hayo\" or \"hayu\" (wood), corre- sponding to the Malayan \"kayu,\" is pronounced \"hajyu\"). The Chamorro vowels e and i are frequently confused by the natives, as in the name for taro, \"sune\" or \"suni;\"1 and the same is true of u 170 Nat.

PRONUNCIATION OK GUAM NAMES 171 and o, as may be seen in the name for sugar cane, written \"tupu\" by some authorities and \"tupo\" by other*. The diphthong ai pronounced like the English i is also frequently confused with ae, the name foi bread fruit being written either 44 lemae\" or \" lemai.\" The circumflex accent placed over a vowel indicates that it is pronounced gutturally. For a more complete account of the language of the island the reader is referred to The Chamorro Language of Guam, by William Edwin n fj ' v Salford. Reprinted from the American Anthropologist, new series, vols. f>, 6, and 7. LiH)4, and 11)05. In Samoan names the apostrophe (') before a vowel or between vowels marks the position of an original Polynesian k, and is indicated in speaking by a break in the continuity of the vowel sound. Thus the Tongan \"kavar uu-tht/ntJnnn) and \" muka,\" an adjective applied to tender young leaves, become in Samoan \" ava ' and \"mu'a;'' and the Tongan \"faki,'\" signifying \"\"to break off fruit from a bunch,becomes in Samoa \"fa'i,\"* the name for 1,4 banana.\" Except where otherwise indicated in the text, the matter given under references,\" including the critical notes, is the work of Mr. W. V. Wight, and the authorship of the new names is therefore to be accredited to him. Aaban or A&bang ((inani), A species of Kugenia, Mir hard, close-grained* durable wood of which is much ust^l in construction on the island of Guam. Abaca or Abakd (Philippines), See Aftitw h .rtilix. Abas (Guam). Local name, derived from annual plant, indigenous to the West Indies, but introduced in cultivation into all tropical and subtropical countries. Stems hairy; leaves alternate, cordate, toothed, .H to 5-lohcd, scabrous on both sides, petioles; pedicels than the petiole; calyx surrounded by an involucel of 9 to 12 linear decidu- ous leaver; petals yellow, with reddish claws; capsule oblong-lanceolate, hairy, 5-celled; cells many-seeded. The young green mucilaginous capsules are used for thickening soup and are pickled like capers, Like many other Malvaceae, the plant yields a strong, silky fiber, and this is used in certain parts of India in the manufacture of cordage, sacking, and paper. See USEFUL OI'AM. A twining vino with alternate, abruptly pinnate loaves; leaflets small, linear-oval, obtuse at apex and base, in X to 20 pairs; flowers pale purple to white, in axillary racemes; legumes oblong, compressed, containing 4 to 0 hard, glossy, scarlet seeds market! with a black spot- Very common in thickets throughout the island. Like many other leguminous plants it is very sensitive to changes in the intensity of light, the leaflets hanging down vertically at night, as though asleep, and rising with the dawn. These move- ments are also caused in a measure by the overclouding and clearing of the sky. When ripe the pods burst open, displaying the pretty, bright-colored seeds, which are very conspicuous in the tangled undergrowth of the forest.. The plant is of wide distribution in the Tropics. It has evidently been introduced into Guam, where the native name \"kolales \" (also applied to A(h'nantherapmonhui) is the Chamorro pronun- ciation of the Spanish \"corales,\" signifying strings of corals or beads. f< Ilalom-tano\" signifies \" in-land \"\u2014that is to say, \"growing in the forest \"\u2014an adjective specifying many plant* to distinguish them from allied species growing in cultivation or on the seashore. In India the seeds are used by jewelers and druggists as weights, each seed weigh- ing almost exactly one grain. The plant derived its former specific name \"preca- torius\" from the fact that rosaries are made of the seeds. The Germans call them \" Paternostererbse.\" In many tropical countries they are made into necklaces, bracelets, and other ornaments. The seeds, known in pharmacy as jequirity beans, contain two proteid poisons, which are almost identical in their physiological and toxic properties with those found in snakes' venom, though less powerful in their effects.\" In India the seeds are ground to powder in a mortar, into which the natives dip the points of their daggers, and the wounds inflicted by daggers thus prepared cause death. When a small quantity of the powdered seeds is introduced beneath the skin fatal results follow; less than 2 grains of the powder administered in this way to cattle cause death within 48 hours. One of these poisons, called \"abrin,\" is a tox-albumen. It is easily decomposed by heat, and in Egypt the seeds are sometimes cooked and eaten when food is scarce, though they are very bard and indigestible. The root has been used as a substitute for licorice. Rkkkhunces: /I Arm shrub with soft velvety leaves and orange-colored flowers, introduced into Guam and now common in waste places. Leaves cordate, somewhat lobed, unequally toothed or entire; jointed near the flower; capsules truncate, carpels 11 to 20, acute, truncate or shortly beaked. The plant is of wide tropical distribution. It yields a fairly good fiber, which might lie used for cordage. Its leaves contain mucilage, and are used in India in the same manner as those of the marsh mallow in Europe. The seeds are laxative, and in India the root is used as a remedy in leprosy.

A shrub or small tree bearing yellow globular heads of fragrant flowers, and bipin- nate leaves. Pinnae 4 to 8 pairs; leaflets small, narrow-linear, 10 to 25 pairs; peduncles 2 or 3 in the older axils; pods almost cylindrical, indehiscent, at length turgid and pulpy. The leaves are peculiarly sensitive to changes of weather. When a cloud obscures the sun the opposite leaflets close together and so remain until the aky brightens. They also close at night, the plant appearing to sleep until the sun rises*. The petioles have gtipulary thorns, with a gland al>ove the base and another usually between the uppermost pinnae. This species is widely distributed in the Tropics and in warm temperate regions. It has established itself in Egypt, India, Australia, Hawaii, the Philippines, and tropical Africa. It is common in the West Indies, and is spread from the Gulf region of the United States to the Pampas of Uruguay and Argentina. It yields a gum similar to that of the closely allied Anicitt which the natives of Guam sometimes use in the same way as the gum arabic. In south- ern France it is grown for perfumery, its flowers being known in commerce as cassie flowers. In Hawaii and on the Central American coast its perfume is often borne by the land breeze to vessels more than a mile from the shore. In some parts of India the bark ami the pods, called ''babla,\" are used as dyest tiffs and for tanning. Its hard, rose-colored wood is of considerable value. Rhkkkkncek: Indian m kkciry. Fam y Ku phor 1 (Philippines); Mookto-joori (Bengal). A low, herbaceous, nettle-like weed growing in waste places and in crevices of stone walls, easily distinguished by the cup-shaped involucre which surrounds the small greenish flowers. Leaves ovate-cordate, 3-ncrvcd, acuminate, serrated, on long petioles; spikes axillary, male flowers above, female below ; stamens 8 to 16, styles 3, capsules of 3 carpels, each one-seeded. In India the root of this plant bruised in hot water is used as a cathartic and a decoction of its leaves as a laxative. The leaves mixed with salt are applied exter- nally in scabies. 1753. Acanthaceae. Acanthi's family. This family is represented in Guam by two ornamental shrubs, introduced from the Philippines\u2014the well-known \"caricature plant,\" <inrptopht/tfunt pichun, and an Eranthemum with dark-purple foliage. Both arc common ill gardens, and arc often planted by the natives in a row under the eaves of their hotfses, so that they may be watered by the drippings from the roof. Ac&nthophora orientalis.

A species widely spread throughout the warmer regions of the globe. In Guam it is a troublesome weed; the vernacular name, signifying \"tick,\" if- given on account of the property the fruit haw of sticking to the clothing. In Samoa it is thought by the natives to have healing properties, and is called \"circumcision plant.\" In India the leaven taken fresh and rubbed to a pulp are applied externally to the stings of scorpions. A decoction of them is used an a diuretic, and the seeds are used as a remedy for hydrophobia and snake bites. Reference^: Achyrmithen aspera L. Sp.

The tree is a native of the Mast Indies, where the jewelers use the seeds for weights, each weighing almost exactly 4 grains. The heartsvood of the larger trees is of a deep red color. It is hard and durable and in India is sometimes used as a substitute for red sandal wood. It yields a dve, which the Hrahminy of India use for DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE. 175 marking their foreheads. It has long been growing in Guam, and is pretty well distributed over the island. Its vernacular name is an imitation of the Spanish \"coralrn\" (coral brads), and is likewise applied to the smaller-seeded Ageratum, often viscous, with heads of flowers in panicles or corymbs. Leaves opposite, or the upper alternate, varying in shape from linear to broadly ovate, tubu- lar, regular; tulie short, limb cam pan u late, 5-toothed; anthers truncate with a glandular tip, base obtuse; style I (ranches elongate, dilated above; achenes obtuse, 5-ribbed, glandular.

Steins herbaceous, erect; leaves odd-pinnate; leaflets sensitive, small, pairs, smooth; semisagittate; 1'ew-llowered; pods smooth, linear, compressed, transversely jointed, one seed in each joint. This plant is closely allied to Indian \" shola \" {Acxchynomoie axpera), the stems ot which yield the pith used in making helmets. From it are also made artificial flowers, .models of temples, and various toys. In Guam there are a numl>cr of small images of saints very cleverly carved from pith, evidently obtained from this or an allied plant. Refekenceh: Acscfiynottimc indica L. Sp. PI. 2:713.1753.

Frequently planted near the houses of the natives and along the roadsides. The flowers and green pods are eaten as a salad or potherb. They are said to be laxative. The bark is astringent and is used in India as a remedy in smallpox. The leaves and young shoots are sometimes gathered as fodder for cattle. Rkkerencus; An Agave of Mexican origin, now spread in the Philippines and India, bearing bulbs which sprout before falling to the ground. It haw been introduced into Guam, where it is called by the natives the \"tree lily.\" The leaves resemble those of Agar*' but have few spines on the margin. The flower scape grows to the height of 4.5 meters. From the leaves the natives get a fiber with which they wrap their cigars. In the Philippines it is sometimes used for making violin strings,\" and in India it is used for cordage and twine. liliKEREXCES: Agave riripitra L. Kp. PI.

The candlenut. tree is widely spread over Polynesia, a great part of Malaysia, and the Philippine Islands. It is remarkable that it has not established itself in Guam. Only a few specimens grow on the island, which are called either by the Philippine name \"lumbang,\" or the Caroline Island name \"raguar.\" The natives say the nuts were brought here from the Caroline Islands. They have not come into use in Guam. Throughout Polynesia the nuts, strung on eocoanut-leaflet ribs, served the natives for candles to light their houses. In Hawaii they are masted, chopped up, mixed with seaweed, and served at native feasts as a relish. They yield an oil which is very fluid, of an aml>er color, without smell, insoluble in alcohol, readily saponifiable, and quickly drying. This oil is a mild cathartic, acting in the same manner as castor oil, but causing no nausea nor griping, and having the further advantage of a nutty flavor and of being more prompt in its effects.

It hangs in long bunches below the dark-green leaves. In Guam this species is found in abundance growing in damp woods and along 1 he margins of streams. The nut is held in great esteem by the natives, who chew it together with the leaf of the betel pepper ( Pijn r hrtlr ), a plant having properties akin to those of PijHt im'thtjMirum, the fatm plant of Polynesia. The nut is divided and a piece of it is wrapped in the pepper leaf, together with a pinch of quicklime. It imparts a red color to the saliva, so that the lips and teeth appear to be covered with blood and in time become blackened. It injures the teeth and sometimes almost destroys them. Children begin to chew it at an early age. Old men and women are frequently seen with their teeth reduced from its habitual use to mere blackened snags. The odor im[\u00abirted by it to the breath is aromatic and not disagreeable unless tol>acco be mixed with it, a custom practiced by some natives, but not a common one. The nut is called either \" pugua,\" or by its Taga- log name \"boiiga;\" the leaf is called \"pupulu,\" or bv the Visayan name \"buyo,\" and the packet made up for chewing is called \"mamao.\" In Guam betel chewing is a matter of etiquette at all wedding assemblies, fandan- gos, and funerals.

This fruit is oval or spheroid ill shape, about the size of a child's head ur of a melon. It is fnrmcd by the female flowers, which are very numerous, and are grouped in a prickly head upon a spongy receptacle. In the fertile typical form the fruit is covered with short hard projec- tions, but in the cultivated breadfruit, which is seedless, it is much smoother and reticulated. The male flowers grow in dense, yellow, club-shaped catkins. The leaves are very large, leathery, ovate, wedge-shaped and entire at the base, the upper part 3 to 9-lobed or pinnatifid, dark green and glossy, and paler beneath. The fruit is at first green, becoming brownish when imperfectly ripe ami yellow when fully so. It contains a somewhat fibrous pulp, pure white at first, but becoming yellow at maturity. It is attached to the small branches of the tree bv a short, thick stalk, V ami hangs either singly ur in clusters of two or three together. It is eaten before it becomes ripe, while the pulp is still white and mealy, of a consistency intermediate between newbread ami sweet potatoes. In iiuani it was formerly cooked after the manner of most Pacific island aborigines, by means of heated stones in a hole in the earth, layers of the atones, breadfruit, and green leaves alternating. It is still sometimes cooked in this way on ranches; but the usual way of cooking it is to boil it or to bake it in ovens; or it in cut in slices and fried like potatoes. The last method is the one usually preferred by foreigners. The fruit baked or boiled is rather tasteless by itself, but with salt and butter or with gravy it Iw a palatable as well a# a nutritious article ol diet. Ovens were introduced into Guam by the Mexican soldiers who were brought by the Spaniards to assist in the <( reduction \" of the natives.

The dried slices may be eaten either jus they are or Masted, or ground up and cooked in various wavs. The Caroline Islanders, a colonv of whom lived until recent!v on * * the island of (iuam, follow a custom widely spread in the Pacific of preserving bread- fruit in pits, where it ferments and is converted into a mass resembling new cheese, in which state it gives forth a very disagreeable odor. The fermented paste is made into cakes and baked, and is then palatable and nutritious. This method of pre- serving breadfruit is also followed by the Sanmans, who call the cakes ma#i/3 a name now applied by them to ship biscuit and crackers.

Besides using the latex in calking boats, the natives of (iuam 11 ml it, when fresh and viscid, an excellent medium for mixing paint, and it is a good sizing for white- wash. The usual pigments were a red ferruginous earth and lampblack made by burning coeoanut shells. The Caroline Islanders still use it with various pigments for painting their canoes, and it resists the action of water pretty well, though for this purpose it is inferior to oil. The wood is of tine yellow color. It is not very hard, but it has the virtue of resisting the white ant, and if kept dry it. is durable. In Guam it is used for cup- boards, shelving, furniture, and for partitions between rooms. It is also used for canoes, but as these are not well eared for by the natives and moisture injures the wood, they do not last very long. In Samoa the framework of the roofs of all the best houses is made of the curved liiul>s of the breadfruit, beautifully rounded and scarped together and wrapped at the joints with coconut sennit. Thigtlny, the \"breadnut,\" or seeded variety of the breadfruit, grows everywhere in (iuam\u2014in the woods, on rocky cliffs, and in low, sandy soil. It is the chief source of timber and of gum, the seedless leniae being too valuable as a fruit tree to lie used generally for these articles. The fruit of the dugdug is inferior to that of the leniae, than which it is softer and more sweetish, It is seldom eaten, but its seeds, called \"nangka\" (the name in the Philippines for iutiyrl/ofia, the \"jack-fruit\"), are rich in oil and are relished by the natives They are eaten roasted or boiled and are much like chestnuts. SAmue, being sterile, is propagated from the shoots which spring up around the base of the trunk. They readily take root. The dugdug is grown from the seed, though it. occurs in such abundance on the island that it is not much planted. There are a number of varieties of breadfruit recognized by the natives, The species grows so readily that it might prove profitable to plant it for the manufacture of starch or \"arrowroot\" from the fruit. Horses and cattle are very fond of the leaves and bark, so that young trees must be protected from them. When pasture is scarce breadfruit leaves are gathered and fed to stock; and the fruit is .so abundant that it is fed to cattle, horses, and pigs. The breadfruit season begins in June and lasts for about live months. This accounts for the fact that Pigafetta and several other early navigators who visited (iuain during the time of the year when it was out of season fail to mention it among the fruits which they obtained from the islanders. Magellan visited the island in March, Legaspi in January, and the Nassau fleet also in January. In the narrative of 1 he latter expedition the cultivation of rice is mentioned (see tjuotation under Ort/:a mitirtt), and a food staple so important as breadfruit would surely have been men- tioned had it come within the notice of the Dutch. The first to record the lircadfruit as a food staple of the Marianne Islands was Dam pier, who has given the following accurate description of it in his New Voyage Round the World: The Bread-fruit (as we call it) grows on a large Tree, as big and as high as our largest Apple-Trees. It hath a spreading head full of hranches, and dark leaves. The fruit grows on the boughs like Apples: Jt is as hig as a Penny-loaf, when Wheat is at five shillings the Bushel. It is of a round shape, and hat h a thick tough rind. When the fruit is ripe, it is yellow and soft; and the taste is sweet and pleasant. The Natives of this Island use it for I bead: they gather it when full grown, while it is green and hard; then they bake it in an Oven, which scorcheth the rind and makes it black: but they scrape off the outside black crust, and there remains a ten- der thin crust, and the inside is soft, tender and white, like Ihe crumb of a Penny Loaf. There is neither seed nor stone in the inside, but. all is of a pure substance like Bread: it must he eaten new, for if it is kept above *24 hours, it becomes dry, and eats harsh and choaky; but'tis very pleasant before it is too stale. This fruit lasts in season 8 mouths in the year; during which time the Natives eat no othyr PKSCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE 191 sort of food of Broad kind. I did never see of this Fruit, any where but here.

Foreigners are warned against eating the uncooked fruit, the natives declaring that it will cauett hiccoughs. Tarts made of it have very much the flavor of rhubarb.

Ita heart wood yields a line ml dye, which is extensively used in India, ami it is exported from Ceylon. The bark and the root are also used for dyeing. The wood is an astringent and contains taunic and gallic acids. It is used medicinally in India. In Guam the natives make little use of it, as it requires considerable labor to separate the heart from the rest of the wood. It could be grown with success on the island, as it spreads there of its own accord and requires little or no attention. Owing to the case with which it grows and its thick habit of growth, it is used for defining the bonndaries of land. The wood takes a line polish and does not warp nor crack. In preparing the wood for dyeing it is cut into chips, which are pounded and boiled for several hours in water. It yields a red color, which is intensified by alkalies. For dyeing cotton tannin and alum are used as mordants, lor wool :i mixture of alum and cream of tartar. In India it is combined with indigo to produce a purple dye and with turmeric and sulphate of iron to produce a rich maroon. A dye is extracted from the bark of the trunk and roots by boiling, and the pods are used, like those of several other allied species, together with the protosulphate of iron, to make an ink or black dye.

This plant, which both in Guam and the Philippines 1 tears its Mexican name, was probably brought from Mexico. It id now common in the woods, climbing among the bushes and trees and twining about everything with which it comes in contact. The young root is much like a turnip in sha^x: and consistency, and is easily peeled like a turnip. It is usually eaten raw, and may be prepared with oil and vinegar in the form of a salad. According to Dr. Edward Palmer it is extensively cultivated DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE. 205 in Mexico, where the natives pinch off the blossoms and seed pods, giving iwa reason that if the seeds an1 allowed to mature the roots are not good. In Mexico the roots are much eaten raw, but are also pickled, 1 Killed in soup, and cooked aw a vegetable. As they come from the ground they are crisp, sweet, juicy, and of a nutty flavor. They are nourishing and at the same time quench the thirst, so that they are much liked by travelers. One way of preparing the raw roots in to cut them in thin Alices and sprinkle sugar over them. They may also be boiled and prepared with batter in the form of fritters, and in Mexico they are often minced or grated, and with the addition of sugar, milk, and eggs, and a few lig leaves for flavoring, made into puddings. The identity of the Mexican, Guam, and Philippine plants seems certain. Other form* of Cacara, which, like the present species, have been referred by authors to C. mw/, differ very much in the shape and size of the root. The Fijian sjKH'ies, DC./' has rootw 6 to 8 feet in length and the thickness of a man's thigh. Roots of Cacara bought in the Chinese market of San Francisco, and referred to (mwi, were analyzed by Mr Walter C. lilasdale and were found to contain an abundance of nutritive materials. Besides a large percent- age of starch, considerable cane sugar was found, as well as protein. Ijong-continued boiling of these roots failed to render them tender. Their principal use by the Chi- nese of San Francisco is for the preparation of starch, which is said to l>e of a superior quality. As far as could lie learned, the Chinese obtain their comparatively large supply of roots entirely from Canton. & From this description it is evident that the roois imported into San Francisco by the Chinese have very different properties from the crisp, succulent tuber* of Mexico and Guam.

This plant grows spontaneously in the Sudan, and is cultivated in India, Mada- gascar, New South Wales, Jamaica, Malabar, Brazil, and other warm countries. The seeds are nutritious and are eaten either green or dry, like peas. The plant will live several years, and in good soil begins hearing the first year. It was introduced into Guam in 1772 by the French ship < lux/rim, whence its local name, which signi- fies \" French lentil.\" It is planted at the beginning of the rainy reason.

Several varieties of taro are cultivated in Guam, some of which were growing on the island before its discovery. The petioles are stout, 90 to 120 em. long, green or violet; peduncles solitary or clustered and connate, much shorter than the petioles; spathe 20 to 45 cm. long, caudate-acuminate, erect, pale yellow; female inflorescence DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE. 207 i as long as that of the neutral stami nodes, male inflorescence longer. Like the sweet l>otato, ginger, and many other plants propagated by cuttings or suckers for the sake of their roots, the taro seldom flowers. In one variety growing in wet places many suckers are sent out from the base of the stem, and the leaves and petioles are more or less purple; in another variety, growing in the cicnaga, or swamps, the petioles are green; in a third they are red- dish. The favorite variety, planted in newly cleared land and on hillsides, has a purplish area at the junction of the petiole with the blade. It is called \" suni Visaya/' The natives recognize at least eight varieties of suni. The large-Leafed, coarser, cau- lescent plants called L<piga\" are varieties of Alocasia, a genus which is distinguished from Caladium in having the terminal appendage of the spadix marked with reticulate furrows, and having few and basal ovules, while those of Caladium are many and parietal. Suni was one of the principal food staples of the aboriginal inhabitants of <Juam. Not only are the farinaceous tuberous rootstocks eaten, but also the young, tender leaves, which, when * ookcd, taste somewhat like asparagus. All parts, but especially the leaves are extremely acrid, owing to the presence of sharp needle-like crystals of oxalate of calcium, called raphides (see Pis. XI, Xilt and XIII), and to destroy this quality Wth leaves and root stock must he thoroughly cooked,\" When the crop of taro is gathered the tops of the rootstocks are cut off and replanted at once. They quickly take root and mature in about a year. Taro is cooked in various ways in (itiam, but is never made into poi (fermented paste) as in Hawaii, band taro, together with bananas and plantains, is the first thing to be planted in newly cleared ground. The climate of Ouani seems to be admirably suited to its cultivation. Taro is a food staple in all island groups in the Pacific and in many other parts of the tropical world. In Samoa many savory dishes arc pre- pared with both the rool stock and the young leaves of taro combined with the rich, creamy juice expressed from grated kernels of ripe coconuts, as well as with other ingredients. The roots are characterized by a high [percentage of carl H)hy drat es, of which starch is the most important, and by a low percentage of fat, protein, and crude filter. They have the consistency of a sweet potato, and a microscopical examination shows that the starch of which they are principally composed is in the form of very small grains. The crude protein of an albuminoid nature is in somewhat greater propor- tion than that found in the potato. Though offering no especial advantage over other farinaceous roots, taro is a very good substitute for them, and Europeans living in the Tropics soon acquire a taste for it, though at first it strikes them as insipid. In Hawaii taro prepared in the form of poi is very popular with the white residents. Taro is imported into the United States from Canton and the Hawaiian Islands, and in sold in large quantities in the Chinese markets of San Francisco. It is successfully grown in southern California, but it there requires an abundant artificial supply of water. The Florida Experiment Station has also succeeded in growing it, and reports (Satisfactory results*In tropical countries where potatoes can not be grown and where the cultivation of yams is attended with care and labor, taro in its various forms is a great blessing to the inhabitants. It grows almost spontaneously both in swamps and on dry land, and it yields an abundance of wholesome, nutritious food, which, with the occasional addition of meat, legumes, or other nitrogenous foods to supply protein, is quite sufficient to sustain life.

This tree is widely spread throughout Polynesia and occurs on the tropical shores of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is often planted near habitations and is valued for its wood, for an aromatic glim which exudes from incisions made in its trunk and limbs, and for a medicinal oil obtained from its nuts. Seeds of this species were among those collected by Doctor Guppy in the Solomon Inlands in the drift of the beach, having probably been carried there by ocean currents. When the leaves are put in water an oil rises to the surface. This is used in some parts of India as a remedy for sore eyes. In southern Polynesia and India the dark green fragrant oil expressed from the nuts, called dilo oil or domba oil, is used as a lamp oil and is an external remedy for bruises and rheumatic pains. The resin DKSCRIPT1VE CATALOG UK 20^ yielded by the trunk is one of the tacamahac gums of commerce; it is agreeably aro- matic, and is used as a scent by the Tahitians. It in of a yellowish-green color and is soluble in alcohol. Its wood is hard, strong, and cross-grained, and very hard to split. In Guam it is used for the solid wheels of the carts drawn by bullocks and carabao. It is durable in water, but is so rigid that it can not be bent. In Samoa it is much used for build- ing large canoes. Its strong crooked branches furnish excellent knees for boats, and are used also for stein and stern posts.

Its introduction into Guam is comparatively recent; but the fruit-eating pigeons are spreading it gradually over the island. The natives sometimes use its flowers to perfume coconut oil. In Samoa it is very highly esteemed. Its fringe-like flowers are there strung into wreaths and garlandfe by the natives, together with the drupes of Pandanus and the scarlet fruit of Capsicum. 9773\u201405 14 210 USEFUL PLANTS OK GUAM, Ilangilang trees may be readily propagated either by cuttings or steeds. These should be planted in orchards or groves H meters apart. They thrive well on most tropical islands and countries with warm, moist climates. About the third year the flowers appear. They bloom continuously, so that flowers and fruit may be always found on the same tree. From the flowers a pleasantly scented volatile oil is derived, known in commerce as the oil of ilangilang. In the Philippines ami the luist Indies this is sometimes adulterated with an oil extracted from the flower!? <\u00bbf MiHtt'liit rhomjxico. Ilangilang oil is obtained by steam distillation. Tn this process steam is generated in a small l>oiler and passed into a closed vessel containing the flowers. The mixed water and oil vapor as it leaves this vessel is condensed, and the oil separated from the water by decantation. In the Philippines (ierman distillers have obtained it in the ratio of alxmt 25 grams from 5 kilograms of flowers (0,5 per cent). It finds a ready market in Paris, Nice, and (irasse, and is used also by perfumers in London, Leipzig, Berlin, and Frankfort. The best quality of oil is perfectly clear and very fragrant. The second quality is yellowish and turbid. A perfume is also derived from the blossoms by the method known as enlleurage, as with jasmines and other fragrant flowers, By this process the fragrant oil is almorhed by refined fats, butter, or oil spread over trays, on the surface of which the flowers are sprinkled. These are changed at frequent intervals and the fat \" worked \" so as to present a fresh surface each time to the new flowers laid upon it. Finally it is scra|>ed off the tray, melted, strained, and poured into jars in the form of a pomade. When oil is used in this process layers of cotton are steeped in it, spread upon trays, and the flowers sprinkled over the surface, after which the oil is pressed out. Care should be taken to use fresh oil. Ooconut oil is liable to become rancid very soon. The method used by the natives to extract the perfume is very simple. The flowers are put into coconut oil and allowed to remain there for a short time, after which they are removed and replaced by fresh ones. The process is hastened by heating the oil. To avoid excessive heat the vessel used for the process in partly filled with water and the oil poured upon it. This prevents the temperature rising above that of boiling water, and the lower specific gravity of the oil keeps it separate from the water. The \"Macassar oil\" of commerce is coconut oil, in which Ilangilang blossoms have been digested together with those of MirhdUt Ilangilang oil is becoming an important article of export from the Philippines. From the commercial monthly summary, published by the Bureau of Insular Affairs (May, 1904), it appears that the amount exported is steadily increasing.

Cananga was proposed for a different genus by Aublet in 1775, and can not there- fore he used as a valid name for the above genus.

Those growing in Guam are small and inferior to the varieties cultivated in countries where they are used as a food-staple. They contain a great number of dark-brown seeds, which turn black in drying and have a mustard-like pungent flavor. The fruit developes so rapidly that buds of flowers and ripe fruits are often seen on a tree at the same time. The papaw is a native of tropical America, but it has ltecome established through- out the entire tropical world. Jn Guam it appears spontaneously in waste places. Little attention is given to it by the natives. Though they eat it if other kinds of fruit be scarce, they do not appear to esteem it as an article of food. References : Carica papaya L. Sp.

This tree occurs on nearly all the larger islands of the tropical Pacific and in the Malay Archipelago. It has been introduced into Guam comparatively recently and is by no means common. In Hawaii, Samoa, and Fiji it is very highly esteemed by the natives, more for its beauty than for its fruit. The ancient Hawaiians made their idols of its wood, and the tree figures in the myths of the Fijians. The etymological identity of the Fijian, Samoan, Tabitiau, and Hawaiian names of this tree is interest- ing, indicating, as it does, an acquaintance wit h it before the separation of the various divisions of the Polynesians or its introduction from one group of islands to the others, together with its name.

When the wind blows the pendulous pods strike together and make a rattling noise. This tree is said to be a native of upper Egypt ami India, whence it has been introduced into nearly all tropical countries. It has been growing in Guam at least a century, but, like the tamarind, does not reproduce itself here spontaneously. The wood is hard and heavy, but the natives do not utilize it. It is found growing in many places on the sites of abandoned ranches. In Honolulu it is one of the principal shade trees and is highly prized for the beauty of its (lowers. The pulp is a valuable laxative, and is much used in medicine. It is apt to Income Hour if long exposed to the air, or moldy if kept in a damp place. It is extracted from the pods by bruising them and then boiling them in water, after which the decoction in evaporated.

The genus to which the plant belongs, though formerly classed with the conifers, is now recognized as the only known genus of a distinct family. The flowers are unisexual, the staminate in cylindrical terminal spikes and the pistillate in dense heads borne in the axils and ripening into a cone, which is corky and buoyant and incloses winged seeds (see p. 75). The wood is heavy, strong, and very hard, of a red color when fresh, but turning a dark brown with age. It is excellent for fuel. In Samoa the natives make spears and war clubs of it. In Guam it is scarcely at all utilized, as it is hard to work. In the Hawaiian Islands it has been planted along the sea Iteach and grows rapidly and readily. It loves sandy soil, and will grow in brackish localities. The natives of Samoa prize it so highly that they often plant it near their dwellings. There a large tree is seldom seen, and the young trees are straight and spindling. At VVaikiki, near Honolulu, there is a beautiful avenue of it, planted within comparatively recent time. There the trees grow straight. In Guam it is abundant along sandy 1 teaches, especially on the east shore of the island. It also grows on the high \"sabanas,\" where it is usually the only tree, but it never grows within the forest. All the Guam trees have twisted and gnarled trunks, from the effect of hurricanes. The species is of wide tropical distribution. It. is indigenous in Australia, on the Malayan Islands, and on the eaat side of the Bay of Bengal, and occurs on many islands of the Pacific, extending eastward to the Marquesas and northward to the Mariannes. It is cultivated in many warm countries, including the Hawaiian Islands, southern Florida, California, and Uruguay. Rkkerencks: Ccmiari n a eq u Iseiifol Heputine. Caulerpa.

Citrullus citrullus. See Gardens. Citrus. Oranges, Citrons. Lemons. Limbs. The existing classification of the fruits belonging to the genus Citrus is far from satisfactory. So many intergrading varieties of oranges, citrons, lemons, limes, pome- los, shaddocks, and their allies occur that it is difficult to delimit them and impossible to determine their origin. Thus the lemon, lime, and citron are by some authors con- sidered distinct species and by others subspecies or varieties of the same species (Citrns medica L.). They are very different from one another and grow perfectly true to seed; so that, if they are simply varieties of the same species, they have probably developed under widely different conditions and in regions remote from one another. The cultivated forms of the true citron closely resemble the shaddock in their thick rind, while the acid lime, which is spherical in shape and smooth- skinned more nearly approaches the orange, differing radically from the lemon which resembles the typical citron in its oblong shape and in having a nipple at the 9773\u201405 15 226 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. apex of the frnit.

The shaddock, which often grows to a great size. See Citrus decumana. For the citrus*like shrub called \"lcmoncito\" see orange of Guam is identical with the \" moli\" of Fiji and Samoa, and, as in those island groups, it is apparently indigenous or of prehistoric introduction. It is not edible. The saponaceous fruit is used by the natives of Guam not only for washing the hair, as in several other Pacific islands, but also as a substitute for soap in washing clothing. The macerated leaves also form a lather with water. They are fragrant, and may l>e used, as in Fiji, for washing the hair. Seemann '' desig- nates this orange as Citrx# atfynrix Kisso, and says that it is called the \" bitter or Seville orange \" by the white settlers. It can not, however, be identical with the cultivated variety known under this name, which is identified with Citrus bigaradia Duhamel, and called by Kngler e the subspecies of Citrus aurantium L. That recognized form, the //'i/iicninze of the Germans, is the source of orange marma- lade and of the fragrant Neroli oil, so extensively used in perfumery. Tn noting the distribution of the subspecies anntra Kngler does not mention the islands of the Pacific Ocean; and in Schumann and Lauterhach'' the species is not mentioned, though the authors are careful to note other plants occurring in the Marianne Islands, and they could not fail to know of the occurrence of an indigenous orange identical with that recorded bv Seemann from Fiji and by Reinecke from Samoa.e The petioles of this wild orange are usually broadly winged and the leaves are aromatic.

Nearly all the orange trees in Guam are seedlings. The fruit usually supplied to visiting ships, grown in the vicinity of Agat and Sumay, is inferior. Good varie- ties are produced in Mataguak, Yigo, and Finaguayog, in the northern portion of the island, and in Yofia, on the highland near the east coast, They are apparently free from disease and insect pests. Navel oranges were imported by the writer from Cal- ifornia, and were left by him in a thriving condition. The climate and the calcare- ous soil of the island seem to be very favorable for all varieties of citrus fruits. Oranges are easily propagated by cuttings or by layers, but the most satisfactory method is by budding. For this purpose seedlings of lemons or bitter oranges, which grow spontaneously-on the island and are free from disease, may be used for stocks. They should be about a year old. February and March appear to be the best months for this purpose in countries with a climate like that of Guam.\" Two crops of oranges are usually produced each year. The blossoms of the first, crop appear in February, and the fruit is fully ripe the first part of November. The tree again flow- ers at the beginning of the rainy season, in midsummer, and the fruit is ripe in March and April. Systematic orange culture has never been attempted on the island, but nearly every native has a tree or two on his ranch. There is now a ready market for all the good oranges that are grown. More extensive cultivation of this fruit would surely l>e profitable and would require little care and labor. References: Citrus aurantium sincmis L, Sp. PI. 2: 783. 1753. Citrus sinensis Ters.

In Guam several varieties of shaddocks are to be found, varying in size and shape and in the color of the pulp. The natives make little or no use of them. They are eaten by Europeans, but their flavor is not especially good. Some of the varieties have a very thick skin like that of the citron, and are called ''eidra,\" or \"setla\" by the natives. One variety has pink pulp. They are all inferior to the thin- skinned forms sold in our markets as \" grape-fruit\" and \" pomelos,\" which do not occur in Guam. This fruit owes its common English name to Captain Shaddock, who introduced it into the West Indies from China. References: Cilrnx denunana (L.) Murr. Svst. ed. Hi. 580. 1774. Sp. PI. 3: 738. 17n.'{.

DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE. 231 This tree was first described from specimens collected by Gaudichaud in Guam. It closely resembles the manono, common weed with clammy stems, 3 to 5-folioIate leaves, and yellow 4-petaled flowers, wi<Iely spread in the Tropics. Stems covered with simple viscid-glandular hairs; leaflets ovate or obovate, equaling nr shorter than flowers raceme* 1, petals sessile on disk; ovary sessile a short gynophore; style short or wanting; capsule glandular-puliescent, 5 to 8.5 cm. long, striate, nar- rowed to the tip, the two valves separating from the seed-bearing placentas; set'ds small, granular. The seeds are sold in the bazaars of India, where they are used by the natives in their curries. They are also used medicinally, powdered and mixed with sugar, to expel intestinal worms, and externally as a rubefacient in the form of a poultice, bruised with vinegar, lime juice, or hot water, for the same purposes as a mustard plaster. The whole plant lias a sharp taste not unlike mustard and in some parts of India is known as \" wild mustard.\" It is sometimes eaten boiled with red peppers and salt. In Guam the natives call it \"pigeon pea,\" from ita resemblance to Phaseolus mungo. It was first collected on the island by Lesson, botanist of the Astrolabe, in branching, often rambling, evergeen shrub, common near the coast, bearing clusters of white, tubular, honeysuckle-like flowers with ex sorted stamens. Leaves opposite, fruit some- what enlarged, suhtruncate, closely embracing the base of the drupe; corolla white, tul>e long and slender, limb 5-fid, drupe separating into 4 woody nutlets; seeds oblong. This plant is widely spread in the Western Pacific, the Malay Archipelago, the Andaman Islands, India, Ceylon, and tropical Australia, its Stnnoan name signifies \"seaside Prentna.\" The wood, the root, and the leaves are bitter, and are used by the natives of Guam, the Philippines, and Samoa us a remedy for intermittent fevers.

The endosperm when young is of the consistency of the albumen of a soft-boiled egg and surrounds an opalescent fluid composed principally of water and sugar. As it grows older it becomes firmer and finally assumes a hard and almost horny consistency, the inclosed water thickening and becoming gradually absorbed. Outside of the shell there is a thick, fibrous meso- carp (husk), which yields the \"coir\" of commerce, the surface of which is covered with a smooth, thin, hard, tough epicarp. In germinating, the inner end of the embryo, an extension of the cotyledon, is developed into a special absorbing organ (the \"apple\"). From the outer end of the embryo, situated below one of the openings at the aj>ex of the shell, grow the plu- mule and the roots. The speciali^ed cotyledon at first attacks and proceeds to digest the part of the kernel adjacent to the embryo. It continues to grow until it fills the entire cavity of the nut, the kernel of which becomes soft. The roots push forth and enter the soil before the kernel is totally absorbed, and finally the union between the young plant and the cotyledon is broken and it logins an independent existence. The function performed by the husk is protective. It is of low specific gravity and keeps the nut afloat if it falls into the sea, so that the nut may be transported from shore to shore bv ocean currents.\" As shown by Cook, the coconut is, in all probability, of American origin, & but it became widely distributed throughout the warmer regions of the Pacific, the Malay Archipelago, and the East Indies in prehistoric times. <' Tt is of very wide distribu- tion in the Tropics. It flourishes best near the seashore and requires plenty of sun- shine and free circulation of air. Dense plantations of coconuts have been growing for centuries in the same spots on the coast of Guam (PI. I), while groves planted in the interior sooner or later exhaust the soil and become spindling and unproductive. These seaside groves yield abundantly; and while good results are obtained from plantations in the interior, yet the soil will not continue to produce there indefinitely ''See Winton, anatomy of the fruit of the Cocoa nucifera, Am.

At the time of the discovery of the island, Magellan noted the occurrence of \"cocchi,\" the oil of which, together with that of \" giongioli,\" was used by the natives to anoint their bodies and their hair. (Pigafetta's Narrative.) Dampier compared the coconut palm with the \"cabbage tree\" (probably Jioi/ntonca obrocea) in its general appearance. He speaks of the large groves growing on the west coast of the island, and gives the following quaint description, which is marvelous for its accuracy: The Nut or Fruit grows at the head of the Tree, among the Branches and Clusters, 10 to 12 in a Cluster. The Rraneh to which they grow is aWut the bigness of a Man's Arm, and as long, running small towards the end. It. is of a yellow colour, full of Knots and very tough. The Nut is generally bigger than a Man's Head. The outer Kind is nearly two Inches thick, before von come to the Shell; the Shell itself is black, thick, and very hard. The Kernel in some Nuts is very thick, sticking to the inside of the Shell clear round, leaving a hollow in the middle of it, which contains about a Pint, more or less, according to the bigness of the Nut, for some are much bigger than others. This Cavity is full of sweet, delicate, wholesome and refreshing Water. While the Nut is growing, all the inside is full of this Water, without any Kernel at all; but as the Nut grows towards its Maturity, the Kernel begins to gather and settle round on the inside of the Shell, and is soft like (\"ream; and as the Nut ripens, it increaseth in substance and becomes hard. The ripe Kernel is sweet enough, but very hard to digest, therefore seldom eaten, unless by strangers, who know not the effects of it; but while it is young and soft like Pap, some Men will eat it, scraping it out with a Spoon, after they have drunk the Water that was within it. 1 like the Water bent when the Nut is almost ripe, for it is then sweetest and briskest. When the Nuts are ripe and gathered, the outside Kind becomes of a brown rusty colour; so that one would think that they were dead and dry; yet they will sprout out like Onions, after they have been hanging in the Sun 3 or 4 Months, or thrown about in a House or Ship, and if planted afterwards in the Earth, they will grow up to a Tree. _ Before they thus sprout out, there is a small spungy round knob grows in the inside, which we call an Apple. This at first. is no bigger than the top of ones finger, but increaseth daily, sucking up the Water till it is grown so big as to fill up the Cavity of the Coco-nut, and then it begins to sprout forth. By this time the Nut that was hard, begins to grow oily and soft, thereby giving passage to the Sprout that springs from the Apple, which Nature hath so contrived, that it points to the hole in the Shell, (of which there are three, till it grows ripe, just where it's fastened by its stalk to the Tree; but one of these holes remains often, even when it is ripe) through which it creeps and spreads forth its Branches [leaves]. You may let these teeming Nuts sprout out a foot and a half or two foot high before you plant them, for they will grow a great while like an Onion out of their own Substance. After describing at length the products obtainable from the sap, the kernel of the nut., the liber of the husk, and the shell, Dampier concludes: I have been the longer on this subject, to give the Reader a particular Account of the use and protitof a Vegetable, which is |>ossibly of all others the most generally serviceable to the conveniences, as well as to the necessities of humane Life. Yet this Tree, that is of such great use, and esteemed so much in the /vis/-liuiien, is scarce regarded in the for want of the knowledge of the benefit which it may produce. And 'tis partly for the sake of my Country-men, in our J \u00bbtfrtVn\u00bb Planta- tions, that I have spoken so largely of it. For the hot Climates there are a very proper soil for it; and indeed it is so hardy, lx.\u00bbth in raising it, and when grown, that it will thrive as well in dry sandy ground as in rich land. I have found them grow- ing very well in low sandy Islands (on the West of Smtnttnt) that are over-flowed with the Sea every Spring-tide; and though the Nuts there are not very big, yet this is no loss, for the Kernel is thick atul sweet; and the Milk, or Water, in the inside is more pleasant and sweet than of the Nuts that grow in rich ground, which are commonly largo indeed, but not very sweet. These at (iuutn grow in dry ground, are of middle size, antl I think the sweetest that I did ever taste.h *See Lyon, Thecoeoanut, etc., Bureau of Ajir. [Philippines], Bull.

COCOS NUCIFEBA. * 235 In the vernacular of the island a different name is applied to the coconut for every stage of its development: Niyog, etymologicalIv identical with its name throughout Polynesia, is its general designation. D&dig, a young coconut the size of a betel nut. Aplog, a young coconut in which water has l>egun to form. Manha, a\" coconut full of water lit for drinking, called by the Spaniards \"coco- nimlo.\" M&sdn, a coconut not quite ripe. Gtafo, a coconut perfectly ripe. Pontan, a coconut which haw fallen to the ground. Nag*ao, a coconut in which the water has become entirely absorbed, Jaigtie, or HaigHe, a coconut which has sprouted (pronounced very much like \"highway\"). Cancitfn, a variety of which the young nut has a sweet edible rind. From experiments conducted by Kirk wood and (Ties'1 it was found that the fresh meat contains 35 to 40 per cent of oil, 10 per cent of carbohydrate, only 3 per cent of proteid, 1 per cent of inorganic matter, and nearly 50 per cent of water. The chief constituent of the \"milk\" of the central cavity, aside from water (of which there is 95 per cent), is sugar. The meat of the ri]>e coconut, though agreeable to the taste, is seldom eaten by the Pacific inlanders. Tt is fed to domestic animals of all kinds, even to cats and dogs, and is very fattening. In Guam it is rasped or grated and fed to chickens, but they do not lay so well when living upon a coconut diet as when fed with corn. From the grated meat a rich custard, or \"cream,\" is expressed, which is extensively used throughout Polynesia as an ingredient for native dishes. One of the most savory of these, in which it is cooked with tender young leaves of (hladiitm colocasia, ia in Samoa called \"palu-sami.\" This cream contains much oil, as well as carlxihydrate and proteid, and is consequently very nourishing as well as pleasant to the taste. In Guam the natives combine it with rice in various forms, and sometimes prepare it like a simple custard. It makes an excellent broth when boiled with a fowl or with other meat, and in the early days of long voyages nuts were carried to sea and used by the sailors for making rice-milk, a dish which they had learned from the natives to prepare. '> The water contained in the central cavity, though \" sweetest and briskest\" when the nut is almost ripe, as described by Dampier, is at that stage unwholesome, and can be drunk only sparingly, as it is strongly diuretic and is apt to produce an irrita- tion of the bladder and urethra. The milk of young nuts, on the contrary, is harm- less. On some islands it is the only beverage of the natives. From jjersonal exjjerience the writer can testify to its refreshing, grateful properties, and to a continued use of it throughout his stay in the island without disagreeable consequences of any kind. On the other hand, a number of cases came under his observation of the evil effects of drinking the milk of ripe coconuts. Immoderate use of the fruit is said to cause rheumatic and other diseases.c This applies, in all probability, to the ri|>e nut, which the writer hits never seen used as a food staple. The soft pulp of the young nuts, which furnish the natives with drink, is very delicate and is eaten like blanc- mange, with sugar and cream. The principal way of preparing the meat of the rij>e nut for food is to grate it and combine it with sugar for sweetmeats and with custard for making cakes and other kinds of pastry. Another use to which the natives of Guam apply the meat of the coconut is the fattening of the \"robber crab\" {Birgus latro), which they keep in captivity until fit for the table. It has often been asserted that this singular animal climbs trees in quest of coconuts, detaches them with his claws, \"Chemical Studies of the Gocoanut, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club, vol. 29, pp. 321 ff., 1902. Dampier, A New Voyage Round the World, p. 294. <*Gies, Nutritive value and uses of the cocoanut, Joum. N. Y. Bot.Gard., vol. 3, p. 169, 1892. 236 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM, letting them drop to the ground, and then proceeds to tear off the husk and open them. On making inquiries among the natives, I was unable to find anyone who had eeen an \"ayuyu\" climb a tree, but was told that the animal feeds upon nuts which have already fallen. It can nut open a nut unassisted, but if an opening has been started it will succeed in getting at the kernel. Crab hunters carry coconuts to the sites frequented by the \"ayuyu,\" and, after having made an incipient opening in each nut, leave it as bait. A crab soon discovers it, and is caught while engaged in opening it. The primitive way of making coconut oil is to rasp the fresh or dry kernel into a pulp, macerate it in a little water, place it in bags, and subject it to pressure. The expressed juice is cooked and the clear oil which collects on the surface is skimmed off. The kernel may lw boiled before it is rasped or grated. In Guam the rasp used consists of a flat iron blade set in a wooden footstool. The best oil is prepared from fresh kernels and is used in cooking. It is at first odorless, and with a slight flavor which is agreeable to the taste. It soon turns rancid, however, and in this condition is unfit for food. Coconut oil is perfumed by macerating in it the blossoms of the ilangilang (Canangium odor a turn) or other fragrant flowers or substances, In the South Seas the natives, though preferring fresh and perfumed oil for anointing the head and body, do not hesitate to make use of rancid oil for these purposes. In Samoa certain kinds of tapa, or l>ark cloth, are always treated with oil before they are suitable for wearing as clothing, so that to those who have cruised among the islands of the Pacific the smell of rancid coconut oil always brings to the mind visions of brown-skinned natives and thatch-roofed huts nestling beneath groves of coconut palms. The natives of Guam still use coconut oil for anointing the hair; but with the custom of wearing clothes that of anointing the body has died out, and the oil is used only for massaging the body in case of sickness. Though the use of jietroleum is now general on the island, coconut oil is still sometimes used for illuminating. Until recently certain people paid their taxes partly in oil, which was used for light- ing the tribunal. Nearly every house on the island has its little shrine, where before the patron saint a lamp of coconut oil is always kept burning. This lamp consists of an ordinary drinking glass half tilled with water, upon which the oil is poured. A wick projecting from a float is fed by the oil, and the water keeps the glass cool. In many of the Pacific islands the shell and the fiber of the husk play an impor- tant part in the daily economy of the inhabitants. In Samoa coconut shells are the only water vessels of the natives, and are used as vessels for oil. The open eye serves as an orifice, and a small grommet is passed through the other two eyes by which the nut is suspended. To remove the kernel, the natives, after having poured out the water through the open eye, immerse the nut in the sea, where the kernel soon putrefies and is eaten up by marine animals. It is then thoroughly cleanned and the outside is frequently j>olished. Both in Samoa and Hawaii the shells are made into cups, in which kava is served.\" These are often highly polished and become lined with a beautiful pearly enamel from the deposit gradually made by the kava. In many islands the natives also make scions, dishes, Wads, and finger rings of coco- nut shell, and use broken shells for keeping up the fires in their houses by night. In Guam the shells are not much used, joints of bamboo taking their place as water vessels. No use is made of the fiber in Guam, while in Samoa it is used universally to lash together the framework of native houses and the parts of canoes. At every council in Samoa the chiefs may be seen sitting in a large circle, each one engaged in braiding sinnet of coconut fiber; and it is only necessary to refer to a dictionary of the Samoan language to realize how important a part is played by \"afa,\" as the sin- net is called, in the economy of the natives.

In .Guam in place of coconut sinnet the natives use the leaves of the \"aggag\" {Pcndanus tectorins) for lashing together the framework of their houses, fences, and the like. TODDY. The custom of making a fermented drink from the sap of the coconut palm, of which the Polynesians are ignorant, was introduced into Guam by the Filipinos brought by the Spaniards to assist in reducing the natives. Before the arrival of the Spaniards the aborigines had 110 intoxicating drink. The a pa the of the young inflorescence is wrapped with strips of the green leaf to prevent its bursting and allowing the branches of the spadix to spread. The tip of the flower cluster is then sliced off with a sharp knife and gently curved, so that the sap may bleed into the joint of bamboo hung to receive it. Thin sap is collected at regular intervals, usually every morning and evening, and poured into a large bamboo, all of the septa but the lowest of which have been removed. The sap flows most freely at night. When the flow of sap becomes reduced owing to the healing of the wound, another thin slice is cut off the tip, and the flow of the sap begins afresh. Toddy, or \"tuba,\" as this liquid is called in Guam, is very much like cider in taste and con- sistency. At first it is sweet and may be converted into sirup or sugar by boiling, but it soon begins to ferment and acquires a sharp taste, somewhat like hard cider, which is very agreeable if the receptacle has been kept thoroughly clean and free from insects. The natives, however, are apt to be careless and do not cleanse the bamboos each time they are emptied, so that the tuba is apt to have an offensive odor and flavor from putrefying organic matter. Care is taken in gathering the tuba not to spill it on the leaves and flower clusters of the tree, as this invites the attacks of insects. In some countries it is customary to coat the inner surface of the receptacles with whitewash of lime to prevent fermentation if the tuba is intended for sugar making. If tuba is desired for drinking purposes, the bamboo receptacles should be scalded out daily. The natives of Guam use fermenting tuba for yeast in making bread. This is made from imported wheat flour, and is snowy white and light, if the fermentation goes on unchecked the tuba is converted into vinegar, which is of an excellent quality. Under the usual conditions after having fermented four hours, tuba contains sufficient alcohol to be intoxicating. AGUARDIENTE. From the fermented liquid a kind of rum is distilled, called \"aguayente\" (aguar- diente) by the natives of Guam and \"arak \" in the East Indies. The distilling of aguayente was the only industry in Guam up to the time of the American occupation. It has t>een prohibited by an official order on account of its evil effects upon our men. By double distillation almost pure alcohol was obtained. Good aguayente compares very favorably with Mexican mescal, and tuba is far more agreeable to the taste of the uninitiated than pulque, the fermented sap of Agave. Aguayente was seldom drunk to excess by the natives of Guam, but according to Padre Blanco its immoder- ate use by the Filipinos caused great harm, resulting in sleeplessness, loss of appetite, premature old age, extraordinary obesity, and diseases resembling dropsy and scurvy \u00ab Pratt, Grammar and Dictionary of the Samoan Language, ed. 3, p. 65, 1893. 238 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM Some of those who are addicted to it lose their intellectual faculties, arc seized with trembling, or l>ecome stupid, absent-minded, or even insane.\" SixiAR.\u2014In making sugar the fresh tuba is poured into kettles, lieneath which a lire is kept burning, dried fronds, husks, and shells of coconuts lieing used for fuel, as well as mangrove and other hard woods. The sap soon turns brown and Incomes thicker and thicker, until it assumes a semiviscid consistency, forming what is in the East Indies known as \"jaggery\"\u2014a kind of coarse, moist, brown sugar. If the jag- gery is allowed to drain in baskets the more fluid part wilt drain into pans placed to receive it, in the form of sirup or molasses. The remaining sugar is dried and the lumps broken up. In this form, combined with grated coconut meat, it can be made into sweetmeats. Coconut sugar is not made so extensively in Guam at the present time as formerly, before copra was in such great demand; but there are natives who still make it rather than buy imported sugar from the stores, and many families use the sirup (\"almibar de tuba dulce\") in their daily economy. I.EAVES. The roofs in the majority of houses in Guam {PI. xx) are thatched with coconut leaves (higae). These are split down the midrib, the two halves placed together end for end, and the leaflets braided diagonally. I/mg mats are woven (pupung) to cover the ridge of the roof, and secured in place by wooden pins passing through them below the ridgepole and projecting on each side. The higae. are thoroughly dried before being lashed to the roof timbers. The pupung are put on green. Coconut thatch is not so durable as that of the nipa palm; a roof of coconut leaves lasting but four years, while one of nipa will last from ten to twelve. Neti thatch lasts even longer. l> In Samoa the sides of the houses are inclosed by coarse Venetian blinds made of coconut-leaf mats, which may be triced up or lowered at will. In Guam the walls of the houses are stationary and are sometimes composed of woven reeds (saguale) of Tr'tchoon roxlnirgkii (PI. XX), which are also used for ceilings and partitions. Coconut leaves are not sufficiently durable for this purpose. Baskets made of them are only serviceable when fresh, Incoming dry and brittle in a few days. The whole leaves are used to keep the thatch from blowing in windy weather, by tying the tips together and allowing the heavy petioles to hang susj>eiided over the ridge. In Samoa, though the houses of the natives are thatched with wild sugar cane, coconut leaves are always used for the side mat*. The ribs of the leaflets are slender, strong, and somewhat elastic. They are fre- quently tied in bunches and used as brooms for sweeping alwjut the fireplaces and ovens, and in Samoa are used as forks in eating. Indeed, in those islands the word \" tua-niu \" (coconut leaflet rib) is applied to forks in general, and is also used fur wire and as the name of certain pinnate ferns which have a slender stiff midrib. Skewers, knitting needles, and toothpicks are also made of tua-niu, and in the early days the oily kernels of the nuts of AfeiirUex violurmmi were strung on them, like pieces of meat on a brochette, and served the Saiuoans and other Polynesians as can- dles. On many of the Pacific islands tua-niu, neatly smoothed and pointed, were made into combs both for use and fur ornament. Throughout Polynesia dry coconut leaves are used as torches. It is a common occurrence when a boat is attempting a landing by night, for the natives on shore to indicate the passage through the reef by holding up a burning coconut leaf; and on making a trip over a stony or difficult path after dark the traveler is preceded by a guide with a wupply of these leaves, one after another of which he lights, as may be necessary. The natives of Guam often use these improvised torches for burning wasps' nests, with which the thickets of the island are infested. \u00abBlanco, Flora de Filipinas. Gran Edirion, vol. 3, In some countries the root is occasionally used instead of Areca nut by betel chewers, but in Guam, where the betel-palm grows spontaneously, there is never a dearth of nuts. The terminal bud, or \" cabbage,\" like that of many other palms, is edible; but as the removal of the bud kills the tree, the natives of Guam indulge themselves in eating it only on occasions of festivity, when they prepare it as a kind of cabbage or raw salad. They either select for this purpose a tree which is comparatively sterile or one which too closely crowds a neighbor. The flowers of the coconut are frequented by several insectivorous birds, especially by \"\u00a3gige\" (Myzomehi rubratra), a pretty little red and Mack honey eater, with a slender, curved beak and a cleft, brush-tipped tongue. When the tree dies its crown is a favorite nesting place for the Guam starling, Aplonix kittlitzi, a bird with glossy black plumage, called \"sali\" by the natives. This bird also frequents the flowering spathes in quest of insects. WOOD. In many islands of Polynesia the strong elastic trunks of old coconut palms are used to bridge streams. For this purpose usually sterile trees are used. In com- merce the wood is known under the name of \"porcupine wood.\" It is hard, hand- some, and durable, and is used for many purposes, for furniture, cabinetwork, walking sticks, and especially for veneering.\" In Guam the wood is used only for burning in limekilns. COI'HA. From a commercial point of view the coconut is the most important product of Polynesia. Its dried meat, called \"copra\" or \" coprac,\" is the only article of export from Guam. From this island the greater part goes to Japan. A hundred trees may be expected under favorable conditions to yield from 25 to 30 quintals per year. For every ounce of it there is a ready market, and traders vie with one another to secure their crops from the natives by advancing them goods or money beforehand. The current price is 4 pesos per quintal (102 Knglish pounds). The nuts when fully ripe are split open and allowed to dry for a short while. Then the kernel is cut out and dried in the sun either on mats or on raised platforms. It is easily transported on the backs of animals or in carts and shipped in bulk by the traders. There are two regular harvests of copra per year, the principal one of which is in April, May, or June. If cocoanut oil were manufactured by the natives, great difficulty would attend its transportation, as the only receptacles on the island are bamboo joint# and \"tinajaf,\" or earthenware jars, from Japan and China. There is not a cooper on the island, and the leakiness of barrels containing oil is proverbial. Another reason for transporting the product of the nut in the form of copra is the economic value of the refuse remaining after the oil is extracted. For a description of the methods followed in Samoa in cultivating the coconut on an extensive scale and of preparing copra by means of drying apparatus, so that it remains perfectly white, assumes a hard, brittle consistency, and is free from ran- cidity, the reader is referred to Doctor Reinecke's work on Samoa, '> extracts front which have been published in the Journal d'Agriculture Tropicale in 1903 and 1904. PRODUCTS. Copra is used extensively in France, Germany, Spain, and England, chiefly in soap making, but also in the manufacture of certain food products resembling butter. This \"cocoa butter,\" or \"cocoaline,\" should not be on the Cocoanut Palm, 1888. t>See list of works. 240 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM butter\" made from cacao (Theobromn mrno), the source of chocolate, which is also an important commercial product.\" The process of manufacture of coconut butter has been kept secret. The main difficulties to overcome were the tendency to ran- cidity of the fat and its liquid consistency. The credit for carrying on exj>ermients which finally led to success is due to the firm of Rocca, Tassy & do Roux, of Mar- seille, who have also erected a plant in Hamburg. Magnan Frcrcn have more recently succeeded in making a satisfactory butter by independent experiments, and some German houses are now doing the same thing. \"The effort to extract an edible grease from an oil produced upon so vast a scale and formerly available only for the manufacture nf soap gave promise of valuable returns if successful; and that this promise wan not delusive may be judged from the circumstance that the factory of liocca, Tassy & de Itoux, which produced 25 tons of butter per month in 1900, now (1902) turns out 600 tons per month. * * * The butter is not at all a by-product of the manipulation of the oil, as in the factory of Messrs. Rocca, Tassy & de Roux, 7,200 tons of butter are obtained from ft,000 tons of oil per annum in a year of maximum result*. The butter is styled 'vegetaline* and 'cocoaline,' the greater demand being for the former. The first named melts at 26\u00b0 0. and the latter at 31\u00b0 C., being by that fact better suited for warm climates. * * * The activity of the manufacturers in trying to establish their private marks and in advertising their product as one of pure copra oil proves that the main object is to serve the constantly increasing public demand for comestible vegetable greases. In the United States the principal manufacturers of food products from coconut oil are the India Refining Company, of Philadelphia. They have a process by which the rancidity of the oil is eliminated, so that it is sweet, neutral, and adapted for fam- ily use and for manufacturing purposes by bakers, confectioners, and perfumers. One brand, called \" kokorcka,\" consists of the stearin of the coconut oil, having a melting point of about 27.3\u00b0 C. This is used by manufacturing confectioners in combination with or in place of cacao butter. A lighter brand, called \" ko-nut,\" is used for baking and domestic purposes in place of butter and lard. It haw a melting point of about 23\u00b0 0. Specimens of these products, submitted to the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department of Agriculture for analysis, proved to l>e remarkably free from fatty acids, the ''ko-nut\" containing 0.13 per cent and \"kokoreka,\" the harder substance, only 0.04 per cent. The material from which this company manu- factures its products is East Indian coconut oil. Though they are prepared to press oil from copra itself and have a perfectly equipped oil mill, it lies idle for want of material. There is no reason why America should not offer a market for all the copra produced in Guam, the Philippines, and Samoa. In a letter from Albin (larrett, president of the India Refining Company, he says: When we consider results of the development of the coconut industry in the island of Ceylon, with an area of 25,000 square miles and a production of coconut products of 76,210,370 pounds in 1893, and risen to 206,035,384 pounds in 1903\u2014a period of ten years, it would seem that, with American methods and enterprise intro- duced into the Philippines, with 41,000 square miles of territory in the island of Luzon alone and 116,000 in the group, with a very enormous coast line, which is what counts in coconut production, a great field is open there for development. As we believe this city is the largest market in the world for manila hemp and has the only plant for handling copra in this country, it would seem that the lines will oi>en if the button could be properly touched. In consequence of tests made by Dr. Theodor Ternes, of the Royal Imperial Hospital of Vienna, an official report was made, stating that coconut butter meets all hygienic requirements; that it is superior to animal fat and butter; that it is <*See Listoe, Cocoa Butter in the Netherlands; and Skinner, Copra Products at Marseille; Advance Sheets of Consular Reports, October 15, 1902. \u00ae Official Report of U.S. Consul-General Robert P, Skinner, September 18, 1902. COCOS NUCIFERA 241 easily digested and is particularly well adapted for the use of patients suffering from impaired digestion.\" The copra industry is becoming more important year by year. Thus far very little copra has found its way to the United States, but coconut oil is imported for various purposes, especially for soap making. The chief sources of coconut oil in this country are Ceylon and the Madras Presidency, India, especially the district of Cochin, where it is the principal product. Soap made from coconut oil is more soluble in salt water than that made from other oils or fats, and is consequently much used on seagoing vessels. One objectionable feature of soaps made from this oil is the disagreeable rancid odor which they usually leave on the skin after wash- ing with them. The most serious difficulty encountered by soap makers is the elim- ination of fatty acids contained in it. To remove these the oil is heated with lye, an emulsion is made, and the oil extracted from the mixture by means of a separator and receiver.6 Coconut oil alone is not usually employed in soap making, but is added to other oils for the purpose of producing quickly solidifying soaps containing a large proportion of water.c FtHEK. Coir, or the fiber of the husk of the coconut, is another product of commercial importance. It is imported into England and America in the form of coir yarn, coir fiber, coir roj>e, and bristle fiber, and is used principally in manufacturing matting and brushes/' In (iuam no effort is made to utilize it, and hundreds of tons go to waste each year. Fiber suitable for cordage must be taken from husks or nuts not yet thoroughly ripe, but the coarser, harder fiber of ripe nuts could be used for brushes. In Samoa, where the fiber plays so imjxjrtant a part in the economy of the natives, a particular variety {'ena, or niti afa) occurs having long nuts with fiber especially adapted for making sinnet (afa). This variety is rare, and is highly valued by the natives.' The sources of the best coir of commerce are the Laccadive Islands and the neigh I wring district of Cochin, on the Malabar coast of British India. This coir is known commercially as Cochin or Madras coir. The primitive if ay of preparing the fiber is to soak the husks thoroughly in salt water, beat them with heavy wooden mallets, rub them between the hands, and remove the coir by hand. It is then twisted by hand into two-stranded yarns./ This process has been replaced in many districts by improved methods, in which the fiber is extracted from the husk, either wet or dry, by means of machines. The busks are crushed in a mill, con- sisting of two adjustable fluted iron rollers. The pressure here exerted flattens them and prepares them for the \"breaking down,\" or extraction of the fiber, performed in an \"extractor\" composed essentially of a drum or cylinder whose periphery is coated with steel teeth that catch in the fiber and tear it from the husk. The machine is covered with a wooden case to prevent the fiber being scattered. It is then \"willowed\" or cleaned, graded, and baled for shipment.? PRODUCTION'. Nearly every family of Guam has its coconut plantation. The best sites are the lowlands, especially the sandy beaches of the west shore.

There are also good plantations in the district of Yofta and in the vicinity of Agat. Though coconuts do not thrive in swampy places as a rule, yet there are good plantations near San Antonio, across the river from Agafia, and near Punta Piti, where the trees grow on hummocks almost on a level with the water's surface when the rivers are unobstructed. Coconuts are fond of sunshine and ocean breezes; but it is evident that they can not stand exposure to repeated hurricanes, from the fact that on the fine stretches of sandy beach along the east or windward coast of the southern portion of the island not a coconut tree is found, while near by, in more sheltered sites of Pago and the valleys of lligand Talofofo, line groves are met with. Great damage to the coconuts of the island is caused by baguios, or hurricanes. Both ripe and green fruits are whipped off and the leaves are destroyed. It is from the axils of the petioles of the old leaves that the young Hower clusters issue; and when the leaves are killed these I become aborted and it takes at least two years for the tree to recover. During the year which followed the hurricane of 1900 not a single ton of copra was exported from Guam.\" All enterprising natives on the island are now planting coconut trees, as there is a ready sale for all the copra that can he produced. Clearings are made in the forest, the undergrowth removed, and the tree trunks gradually gotten rid of with the aid of fire. (PI. XXIII.) This requires hard work, and few white men coining to the island are either able or willing to clear land for themselves. Land taro and bananas may then be planted until the stumps are removed, after which coconuts are planted in regular rows. As the natives have plantations of their own they naturally prefer to work for themselves rather than for another; so that it is almost impossible to obtain laborers on the island. Moreover, the natives will not part with a coconut grove in good bearing condition or a thriving young plantation at any price. A fairly good yield for a coconut palm is 25 to 30 pounds of copra a year, though there are many trees on the island which produce double this amount. In the process of clearing, taro, yams, and bananas are often planted in the new ground. The nuts selected for seed are taken neither from very young nor very old trees, but from trees at least 15 years old. Many of the natives pay no attention to seed selec- tion, but plant sprouting nuts indiscriminately; others, however, realize the advan- tage which results from planting seed taken from trees yielding the greatest amount of copra. The tendency is to plant large nuts; hut these may have been produced by young trees or trees bearing few nuts and yielding less copra than trees bearing nuts of smaller size. Nuts selected for seed should lowered to the ground, not thrown down or dropped. Nursery planting is not practiced in Guam. The ripe nuts are simply collected in piles in the shade of trees or in the corners of inclo- sures and left to sprout, without further care. When the sprouts are about 60 cm. high they are ready for permanent planting. If the roots have in the meantime penetrated the ground and are broken off in removing the nuts, they should be neatly cut off with a sharp knife, so as not to leave ragged ends. It is the practice in Guam to plant coconuts in rows 5 to 6 meters apart, but this is too close. From 7 to 10 meters is a good distance. Holes about 60 cm. deep are first dug, and they are sometimes arranged so that the holes in one row will be opposite the intervals of the next. On some plantations coffee, cacao, or bananas are planted between the rows, but this custom is not recommended.

The cacao did not thrive and was removed, but the coconuts grew with remarkable rapidity. The natives say that the trees are too far apart, but the fact that many of them began to bear when 3 years old, while in other good localities they do not War until 4, o, or H years old, speaks for itself. On the mesa, or table-land, coconut trees fre- quently are 8 to 10 years, or even 15 years, old before they begin to l\u00bbear. In Yigo and Santa Rosa they begin to hear usually when 5 or 0 years old, and in Yofia when 7 or 8 yearn A coconut palm is in its best Waring condition from the age of 10 years on. It will continue to bear until SO years old. Catch crops maybe planted Itetween the rows while the trees are young. These are far less exhausting than the weeds which would otherwise cover the ground, and the soil is benefited by the cul- tivation, especially if nitrogen-storing leguminous crops are grown. The common practice in Guam is to keep off the weeds from an area about 6 feet in radius about the trees by means of a thrust-hoe (fusifio or foziiio), and throughout the rest of the plantation to cut the undergrowth from time to time with a machete. Attention is called bv Lvon\u00ab to the excellent methods of coconut cultivation practiced bv the h- at J \u00bb German colonists in German Kast. Africa and in the South Pacific islands and by the French in Congo and Madagascar, who practice modern orchard methods. Mr. Lyon recommends planting coconuts at distances of not less than {) meters, and, in good soils, preferably 9.f> meters. The former distance will allow for 123 and the latter lor 111 trees to the hectare, lie recommends annual plowing of the planta- tion and the cultivation of green manures and crops to keep tip the fertility of the land. In Guam plowing is impracticable in many localities, owing to the thinness of the soil covering the coral substratum; and the prevailing system of keeping the plantations clear of weeds by means of the thrust hoe, by which the roots can not possibly be injured, seems to be a good one. Manuring is never practiced in Guam, and it is to this fact that the absence of the beetles which, in their larval stage, are so injurious to coconuts in other countries, should be attributed. The boundaries between plantations on the island of Guam are usually indicated by lines of coconut trees, either single or double. It is the common practice to cut notches in the trunks to facilitate climbing. This practice is condemned by many writers, but in Guam the trees do not appear to l>e injured thereby. Sometimes a hole is cut near the base of the trunk to serve as a water reservoir. This seems to cause decay and should not be permitted. As a rule the natives do not plant, coco- nut trees near their dwellings for fear of accidents during hurricanes. Kverv family selects one or two trees for a supply of toddy, and many of them keep small groves to furnish thatch for their houses, which must be renewed at intervals of about three years. The extraction of tuba does not injure the trees in any way, but the cutting of leaves causes injuries from which it takes years to recover. The inflorescence which forms in the axils of old leaves becomes aborted when these leaves are cutoff. Young plantations are frequently injured by the deer with which the island abounds, and care must be taken to prevent cattle from entering them. To keep out the deer the natives simply inclose a field with a ribbon of pariti bark (P. lilian'tnn), through which they say the deer will not pass. Coconut trees are free from disease in Guam, and very little harm is done to them by insects. RekkkE-MEs: Coots nttrifertt Bureau of Agr. [Philippines], Bull. No. S, 1903. 244 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM.

The inflorescence of this genus has not yet been described. In some of the Solomon Islands the natives prepare sago from the pith of the species growing there. It is said to keep well and not to lie injured by salt water, so that it is a valuable food staple to take with them on Ruhiaceae. Local namw.\u2014Krife (Guam); Kahaua (Mindanao, Lolo, Philippines). A shrub with glossy green leaves, fragrant, white, jasmine-like flowers and red berries, like small cherries, which contain two seeds, commonly called coffee. The leaves are opposite, rarely in threes, alwut 15 cm. long by 6.5 em. broad, with wavy tedges, and a long narrow point; flowers of short duration, with the fragrance of a tuberose, in dense clusters at the bases of the leaves; calyx tube short, limb5-parted, persistent; corolla tubular, limb salver-shaped, 5-parted; stamens 5, fixed around the top of the tut>e and protruding beyond it; ovary 2-celled; style filiform, smooth, 2-cleft; ovules 1 in cell, peltatelv attached the septum of the cell; seeds planoconvex, grooved ventrally. In Guam coffee is one of the commonest plants, growing about most of the dwell- ing houses as lilac bushes grow in America, and nearly every family has its cultivated patch The climate and soil of the island seem well adapted to it, and it produces fruit abundantly from the level of the sea to the tops of some of the highest hills. Plants are obtained by planting seed at a depth of about 4 cm. in beds, or by taking up seed- ling plants from under cultivated trees, where the seeds readily germinate without attention. They are easily transplanted, differing in this res[>ect from the seed- lings of cacao, which are often killed in transplanting. Seeds fresh from the pulp should be planted in the sementeras (nurseries) about 8 cm. apart, in rows. In preparing the ground it is thoroughly pulverized and dry brush is burned over it shortly after the weeds begin to sprout. This saves a great deal of subsequent weed- ing. Little watering is necessary in Guam. In transplanting crowding is avoided. The plants are set out in straight rows at a distance of from 1.5 to 2.5 m. apart. On hillsides they may be closer, aljout 1.5 by 1.5 in. Coffee trees planted too close together lose the use of their lower branches, which l>ecome interlaced and shade one another, so that only the top branches continue to grow and bear fruit. If the coffee is planted in newly cleared land the brush is either left to decay between the rows or burned. In places where the soil is shallow above the coral rock, holes are made and filled with good earth brought from the forest.

The plants are shaded at first by sections of coconut leaves stuck in the ground in a slanting direction. If rains are not sufficiently frequent after planting, the plants are watered every evening. In Guam it is not usual to plant shade trees to protect coffee. Sometimes the young plants are shaded by alternating rows of bananas, which easily take root and grow quickly. These are cut down when the plants are well established, as the mature coffee plant is a sun lover and becomes spindling in the shade. Catch crops of taro or maize may also be planted for the first two years. As with other plants, the weeds must be kept down. They are allowed to lie on the ground and ml, so as to enrich it. Weeding is accomplished by the fosifio, or thrust-hoe, an expert weedcr being able to cover an area 1.5 in. long and the width of his hoe at every thrust. In order that the trees may not grow too tall for convenience in gathering the berries, they are topped after reaching a suitable height. This causes them to spread out their branches and offers a smaller target for the heavy winds which sometimes prevail. The plants are kept free from shoots or suckers sprouting out from their stems, which are removed when young. In Guam coffee seems to be remarkably free from disease. The berries are some- times eaten by rats, which infest the island; but these animals are not so injurious to coffee as they are to cacao, of which they are immoderately fond. As soon aa the berries are ripe they are gathered. In Guam the whole family turns out to pick berries, and there is more or less jollification, as on the occasion of a picnic. The removing of the flesh from the seed or pulping is accomplished by hand, and the sticky, mucilaginous material surrounding the seeds is removed by washing, after which the coffee is spread out on mats to dry in the sun. In this condition it is covered with a thin membrane or hull, which can be removed at will by pounding in large wooden mortars with wooden j>estles. The coffee should be thoroughly dry before attempting to take off this hull. The chaff is gotten rid of by winnowing, which consists in pouring the seed from one receptacle to another in a current of wind. Enough coffee is not produced in Guam for exportation; indeed, there is scarcely enough for the use of the natives, all of whom are coffee drinkers. The product is of excellent quality. In preparing it the beans are roasted, as with us, and ground on a stone \"nictate\" with a cylindrical \"tnano,\" like a tapering Liuerian coffee. A few plants of Siberian coffee were introduced quite recently into Guam from the Honolulu botanical garden. When I left the island several of them were in a thriv- ing condition on a ranch near Sinahafia. Hefekbmks: Coffea lilwrim Iliern, Trans. Linn. Soc.

An account of their remarkable mode of fecundation has already been given.a Both the fruit and the starchy pith of the trunks of many Cvcadaceae are utilized for food. In Japan and in the Moluccas sago is obtained from the pith of Oi/cas revolutn and from that of Cyms cireinoUtt; plants of the genus Encephalartos yield the \" caffre-bread \" of Africa; Itioon eduJe produces the \"cabeza de chainal\" of Mexico; in Central America, Florida, and the West Indies a kind of arrowroot is prepared trom species of' Zinnia, and in Australia the nuts of Cycas media and of several species of Macrozaniia are eaten after having lieen pi winded, macerated for several days in water, and roasted. A gum resembling tragacanth exudes from wounds in Cycas cirfinidis and other Cycadaceae. In Guam the seeds of Cymx circinali*, called \"fadang\" or \"fadan\" in the vernacu- lar of the island, and \"bitogo\" or \" federico \" by the Filipinos and Spaniards, were an important food staple of the al>onginal inhabitants. As in other members of the family the trunk contains sago, but in (iitam this has never been utilized. As pre- pared now by the natives, the endocarp of the seed is either grated or broken into small pieces and soaked for several days in water, which must be changed from time to time. When fresh the seeds are so poisonous that the water in which they are steeped is fatal to chickens if drunk by them. The poisonous principle contained in the seeds has not yet been ascertained. After having tieen thoroughly soaked the fadang is dried in the sun and put aside for use In preparing it for food the natives grind it on a stone slab (met ate) with a cylindrical stone rolling-pin (tnano), mix it with water, make it into a thin cake, and bake it on a slab or griddle, like a tortilla of maize. If eaten continuously for any length of time it is injurious. The natives now resort to it only when maize is scarce, or in times of famine following hurricanes, wThen almost all other fruits are destroyed. In the old letter books at Agafta I find copies of reports of several Spanish governors to the captain-general of the Philip- pines, in which they complain of the unwholesomeness of this food and the injurious effects it has upon the natives. As far as my personal experience goes it is palatable and not injurious if eaten occasionally and in small quantities, although it is inferior to maize in every respect. Starch is sometimes made of the seed, but this is not very white and has a disagreeable odor. It is good for paste, however, and is avoided by insects. These seeds are used as food in the southern islands of the Philippine group, and the bracts and fruit are an excellent vulnerary. Cycas circincdix is abundant in the woods of (iuain, especially in rocky places. On the shores of Orote Peninsula, at the entrance to the bay of San Luis de Apra, the beautiful fern-like crests of this plant are distinctly visible to those on board ships entering the harbor and lend a peculiar charm to the landscape. Though usually only 1.2 to 1.5 meters high, the trunks reach the height of three meters in certain localities. On the promontory of As Kiroga, near TalofMo, the growth of Cycas trees, with their cylindrical scarred trunks and luxuriant fronds, strongly recall ideal pictures of the vegetation of the Carboniferous age, in which the Cycadaceae formed so important a part.

In the face of so many conflicting authorities it is hard to decide as to the specie or recognized varieties cultivated in Ouain. A thorough study of the yams of this island is especially desirable, since most of the varieties were cultivated by the natives before the discovery// The species of Dioscorea can not he understood from herbarium specimens alone. The food-yielding varieties must he studied in the localities where they are cultivated, and should be represented in herbaria by photographs of the growing plants, together with their tul>ers, and, if possible, by typical tubers of each variety preserved in formalin or some other liquid. It is only in this way that specimens from Polynesia, India, the Malay Archipelago, Africa, Australia, and America can be compared. Plants belonging to the genus Dioscorea art! herbaceous perennials with tleshy tuberous roots and twining stems, which, as a rule, die down each year, allowing the plant to rest, through the dry reason. Leaves having several longitudinal veins, either entire, lobed, or digitately ft to 5 foliolate, the petiole often angular and twisted at the base.

The natives of tuiam distinguish a number of varieties all of which are known as 44dago,M with roots of different sizes and shapes, varying in color from white to pur- ple and differing in time of maturity. Yams are left in the ground for a short while after the vine has turned yellow and died down. The tops of the tubers are then cut off with the vines attached and buried in the ground, piling the earth up around the base of the vine. After several weeks another yam is produced which contains a number of eyes or buds. This is cut up into pieces each having an eye from which the new plant grows. Yams are usually planted in small hillocks arranged in a large cir- cle, sometimes with a tree or high pole at the center. In each hill a slender pole is thrust and inclined toward the center of the circle, the poles forming the sha^te of an Indian tent, or all are inclined against the central tree. The ground is kept free \u00ab Flora Vitiensis, OF GUAM, from weeds ami is hilled up from time to time around the base of the plants. In about eight or nine months the yams are ready for digging. They are dug and stared |\u00bby the natives, who pick them over from time to time, taking out any that show signs of decay, so that the rest may not )>e affected by them. In the meantime the heads are forming new eyes and the ground is prepared for the new crop. As the cultivation of yams requires more labor and attention on the part of the natives than that of taro, they are not so extensively planted as the latter. They are very nutritious; more so, it is claimed, than the common potato.a They are eaten either haked or boiled, and in many of the Pacific island* are combined with the rich creamy juice expressed from the meat of the coconut to form dumplings of various kinds. In the days when whaling vessels visited Guam in great numbers great quantities of yams and sweet potatoes were supplied to them in exchange for codfish, salt meat, sugar, flour, and textile fabrics.

These plants, which are cultivated, are climbers, on which account the Indians place stakes so that they may climb upon them. Their root, which is the part most valued in them, forms many tubers, some of which reach 5 in. or more in thickness. This root is not poisonous, nor needs any anterior preparation to be eaten boiled or fried in olive oil or lard.

The following is a translation of Warburg's description and discussion of this species: Stems climbing, terete, finely ferruginons-villoup, sparsely prickly, the prickles commonly erect, small; leaves long-petioled (the petiole angled, pubescent), broadly cordate, with the sinus at the base deep and verv broad, the apex shortly acuminate, above smooth, IkiIow trifid; male racemes simple, axillary, many-flowered, as long as the leaf or longer, the peduncle pubescent, the bracts small, acutely ovate, hairy; than tube; stamens 6, glabrous, shorter than the divisions of the perianth, the filaments attached to the base of the divisions, the anthers all fertile, introrse; rudiment of the style (pistillode) smooth, short, irregularly sub- pyramidal. The petioles are 5 to (i em. long, the leaves themselves 7 to 8 em. long and W to 10 em. broad. The prickles differ very much in length. They are sometimes trian- gular and sometimes slender; at the base of the leaf there are prickles almost twice as long, somewhat eurved. The male inflorescences vary between 10 and 40 cm., but are never branched; the bracts are 1.5 mm., the perianth nearly 3 mm. long, the style scanty perceptible. This hitherto overlooked species stands very near to IK avuU'uio. I,, but differs sdKive all in the simple male inflorescences and the sessile blossoms; also, the broad, relatively not deep sinus of the base of the leaf is noteworthy. The plant grows wild on Little Key. I also found sterile branches evidently of the Fame species in Ccram-Laut and Hatzfeldhafen. This is probably the species of yam which is chiefly cultivated there by the natives, and which, together with Cotocusia antitfttorwn [Caladhim culocntiia'}, even to the pres- ent day represents the most important cultivated plant of Papuasia.

Ah considerable work is necessary to dig the wild yam, the Guam people do not eat it when there is enough of other food. The Caroline Islanders, however, who until recently have been living on the island of Guam, and who are in no sense an agricultural people, resorted to the forest habitually for it, and often brought it to the houses of the Chamorros to exchange lor other things.

Ficus sp. Banyan. Plate viii. Family Islands). Among the species of Ficus indigenous to Guam is a giant banyan, In'longing to the section t'rostigma and allied to Fh'.nx iwhco, Ficnx iH'tigfutleimi.*, and Ftcitx rrVu/in^t. Like its allies, the Guam species usually begins its life aa an epiphyte from seeds dropped by birds on the limbs of other trees. It sends down snake-like, aerial roots, which embrace the host and ultimately strangle it. After entering the ground the roots enlarge into what looks like a compound trunk. The branches also send down roots, at first thread-like and swinging, but at last entering the ground and becoming thick supporting props, so that a single tree often resembles a dense grove. These trees were considered by the ancient Chamorros sacred to the aniti, or spir- its of the departed, and they are still regarded with superstitious dread by the natives. It is? interesting to note that the Tahitiana and Samoans have the same superstitious awe of the allied aoa trees of their islands, which in ancient times were sacred to the aitu, or wood spirits. Even at the present time few natives of Guam will linger near a 11111111 tree after dark. The latex of the nunii is astringent, and is used for stopping the flow of blood. The wood is useless.

Among the few species collected by Gaudichaud on the island are Attriaiiaria fntricnhi-jiulne belong- ing to the Agarieaceae. From the results of observations on other islands it is eerlnin that a collector of Fungi would have a fine lieltl in the Marianne Islands. Fungi abound everywhere, on the ground, on decaying wood, on tree trunks, on the leaves of water plants, grasses, and forest trees, and upon rotting fruit. Some of them are like great solid masses of gingerbread, others arc as delicate as coral, and others appear as microscopic rusts, molds, or mildew. One of the most common is brightly luminous in the dark. Futu (Samoa, Tonga). See Barringtoniit sptciosa. DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE 279 Gabgab, Gap gap, or Gaogao (Guam).

A species of Phyllanthus. Gardens. Settlers in tropical islands are apt to be disappointed in their first attempts at hor- ticulture. Many take with them a supply of seeds of vegetables and fruits which grow in temperate regions, and plant them only to find that the seed fail to germi- nate, or that the plants, though apparently thriving, fail to produce fruit. The causes of disappointment in many cases are the loss of vitality of the seeds and not planting at the proj>er time of the year. There are, however, certain plants which require a cool temperature and can not possibly Ih? propagated in a tropical climate at the level of the sea. Tims it is useless to expect Irish potatoes or cauli- flower to grow, and apples, pears, plums, and quinces arc out of the question. All tomatoes, introduced eggplants, and beans should be planted toward the end of the rainy season or at the beginning of the dry season, say November or December. Introduced watermelons, muskinelons, pumpkins, and squashes should be planted after the dry season has set in, and watered if necessary. The red peppers, Legu- minosae growing naturally in the Tropics, bananas, plantains, and the perennial eggplant found in the island of Guam may be planted in the rainy season, which is also the time for transplanting cacao, coffee, orange, and other trees, for setting out hedges, and planting maize on the uplands. During the summer months the rainfall is sometimes so excessive that the surface of the land remains inundated for a day or two, so that such plants as squashes, melons, tomatoes, and lima beans are killed outright. Provisions should be made for drainage. During the rainy months the atmosphere is frequently saturated with moisture and all organic substances, including living succulent plants, are subject to decay. Tomatoes planted by the writer at the lbeginning of the rainy season grew well at first, but the fruit rotted while still green, and melons planted at the same time were attacked by some fungus disease and failed to reach maturity. Certain plants appear to thrive best if planted iirst in boxes raised from the earth and protected from insects. Beets, col lards, and lettuce should be planted in this way, and set out in the garden when they have four or six leaves. Tobacco is invariably planted Iirst in sementeras (seed beds), then transferred to larger beds, shaded with muslin or branches, where the individual plants have room to grow, and finally set out in the fields. Plants with a taproot, like radishes and beets, must be 280 USEFUL PLANTS OF (IIIAM. transplanted while very small. To prepare the ground for :i garden it is cleared of brush and weeds. When new weeds begin to spring up the dry brush is spread over the surface and burned, which kills the young seedlings and at the same time enriches the ground with the ashes. The only implement used by the natives, a souffle or thrust hoe, called \"fusifio,\" or \" fozifio,\" is well adapted for clearing the ground and keeping it free from weeds. It consists of a broad transverse blade provided with a socket into which a long handle is lilted. The iron part is T-shaped, with the socket in the stem of the T and with one arm of the letter longer than the other. In Guam it is usually made by the village blacksmith from si musket barrel\u2014an almost literal example of heating \"swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks\"\u2014a practice which was undoubtedly carried out among primitive people in more than one region of the world. All the natives\u2014men, women, and children\u2014are skilled in the use of this tool. Many plants will grow in almost pure sand; others require the ground to be enriched. For manure cow dung is best. The soil is also benefited by turning under weeds, by planting velvet beans and oile r nitrogen-gleaning leguminous plants, which may either be fed to cattle or turned under as green manure. An occasional crop of peanuts is recommended, which may be utilized either as forage for animals or as food for man. Wood ashes are always available, and are recom- mended for the sake of the potash they contain. Nitrate of soda, if it can l>e obtained, makes an excellent fertilizer; but care must be taken not to apply it too strong; half an ounce to a gallon of water is recommended for potted plants and one ounce I\u00bber gallon for garden patches. Hedges are the most economical inclosures. They may be made of lemoncito, lime, lemon, physic nut, or lead tree. The lemon, lime, and lemoncito grow densely, sending up sprouts from their roots. They have the advantage of yielding fruit, but they need to be trimmed and held in check. The physic nut. and Leucaena take root readily when freshly cut stakes are thrust into the ground. Both are poisonous and arc immune from attacks of animals. Henna is also recommended. It grows readily from cuttings; but the odor of its flowers, though delightful from a distance, is too rank at close range to be agreeable. For surrounding large garden patches remote from dwellings aappan wood and lemoncito are recommended. Among the animal pests which infest gardens are white ants, mole crickets, and in some localities land cralw, which are herbivorous. The Held adjacent to the palace at Agafia is riddled with their burrows. Insects are held in check by the use of scalding water. Crabs are often caught by the natives in traps of bamboo placed at the entrance to their burrows. In the climate of < Juam seeds are apt. to die if left unprotected for any length of time. Ordinary garden seeds should be thoroughly dried before storing and should Ik1 kept in glass jars or tin cans sealed with paraitin or soldered. The same precautions should l>e taken in the transportation of seeds. Corn, onion seed, and seed of lettuce sent from the United States to Manila in paper wrappers were found to Ik1 quite dead - after having been kept for a few months; and the failure of the seed of lettuce, onions, and of several other vegetables brought by us to < juam may have been owinj; to carelessness in packing. On the other band, certain seeds must be kept fresh, as they lose their vitality in drying. This is true of the mango, avocado, mangosteen, and many other tropical fruits, the seeds of which are usually packed for transporta- tion in moist charcoal, to prevent drying and the attacks of fungus.*1 The vegetables available for cultivation in Guam and their proper treatment are shown in the following list: Artichokes.\u2014Not successfully grown in (Juam.

Beans.\u2014Lima beans will grow, but they do not thrive well. Introduced varieties should be planted at the beginning of the dry season. The purple- flowered Dniicfios lablab grown in nearly every garden, together with an interest- ing bean railed \"seguidillas\" (Hotor teimyouolvba), the pods of which are winged with four longitudinal frills and are eaten when green.

The pods are <]uite tender when young and are on iked likestring beans. The mature seeds are edible, but are inferior to those of the common phaseolus, or French bean, which is also some times cultivated on the island. The yam-bean, Ointra erom, a plant of Mexican origin, is cultivated chiefly for the sake of it# sweetish, turnip-like mots, which may be eaten either raw, made into salad, cooked as a vegetable, or grated and made into puddings, For list of bean species see Beam. Beets.\u2014The climate of Guam is too moist and warm to be favorable to beet culture. They can, however, be grown. It is recommended to plant, the seed in pans and transplant them into beds when the plants have four leaves. They should be planted at the beginning of the cold season. There are several distinct tvpes. One, with the root of a whitish color and cylindrical form, is called \"acelga.\" Another, of a deep red color and turnip-shaped, or fusiform, is called \" remo- laeha.\" The tops may be eaten as a pot herb. Cabbage.\u2014Can not be cultivated. As a substitute several kinds of mustard are now grown from seed from Japan brought to (Iuain by the little schooners of the Japanese commercial company which has established a store at Agaiia. All attempts to grow cauliflower have proven failures, Georgia collards are recom- mended. Tender seedlings of crucifern are subject to the attacks of termites and other insects. Attempts should l>e made to grow them in pans supported on benches with their legs standing in water, When they have four or six leaves they can be transplanted. Carrots.\u2014Attempts to cultivate carrots have failed. Celery.\u2014Will not grow. Chick peas.\u2014Grow well. Cress.\u2014There is a species of Nasturtium or Cardamine which grows spontane- ously. It has the taste of the common watercress and makes an excellent salad. Poppergrastf (f^piiliinn xaticiim) may tic cultivated. The seed should be sown at the end of the rainy season in shallow pans tilled with good light noil. Cucumbers.\u2014A variety of Cumuli* xntinis grows simultaneously in waste places. The natives usually eat it cooked. Attempts to grow plants from American seed have proved failures. They germinate, but. soon sicken and die. Introduced seed should be planted at the I beginning of the dry season. Eggplant.\u2014This is one of the most important garden vegetables of Guam. The fruit is large, of a dark purple color, and of excellent quality. The plants grow vigorously and with little care, almost like the common Datura. It. is usually prepared for the table by stuffing it with chopped meat and roasting it. It is called by its Spanish name \"berenhena.\" Garlic.\u2014Grown with difficulty and only in small quantities. Grams or \"Monj^gos.\"\u2014Grow well.

Mustard should be planted at the beginning of the dry season (November). Okra.\u2014Grows fairly well in Guam. It should be planted at the beginning of the rainy seaaon. The green mucilaginous pods are used in soujw anil are also cut. into slices and fried. Onions.\u2014The onions grown by the natives are small and rank. Attempts to introduce varieties grown in the I'nited States have not been successful. Seed kept for any length of time should Ik* thoroughly dried and protected from moisture in air-tight jars. It will not retain it* vitality long; seeds brought to Guam from San Francisco and kept for three months were found to be quite dead. Onions should be obtained from visiting ships and planted for seed at the end of the rainy season. When the seed matures it should be gathered, dried, and stored in bottles sealed with paraffin, to be planted the following ()ctol>er, November, or December. If trouble is exjK'rienred when planting the seed in the garden, sow it in seed pans and transplant. The introduction of Bermuda onions is recommended. Parsley.\u2014The natives of Guam esteem parsley very highly and often have a few plants growing in pots, like flowers, pinching off a few leaves from time to time as they may be needed. It does not succeed well when sown in the garden. It should lx) planted in seed pans, sheltered from the sun and heavy rains, and planted out in a shaded bed when about !i inches high. The transplanting should take place immediately after a good rain, and the plants should be watered frequently until they are well established. Parsnips.\u2014Will not grow. Peas (g-uisantes).\u2014Grow with difficulty; seldom mature. They should be planted at the beginning of the dry season. Peanuts (kakhuates.).\u2014Common in gardens; grow well and need little care.

See Vuhviium co!ocaxi<t. and Afac.uxi\u00bbt macrorrhizu. Tomatoes.\u2014Two varieties of small size grow with little or no cultivation. Seed from the I'nited States planted in my garden grew well, but the fruit decayed before it reached maturity and was attacked by the larva of some lepidopterous insect. Tomatoes should be planted at the beginning of the dry season. Turnips.\u2014Do not grow on the island. Velvet beans.\u2014May be grown to renovate the soil. They should be fed green to cattle. Watermelons.\u2014These should be planted at the end of the rainy season.

Seldom seeds in cultivation. In India the Mowers are used to black shoos, and paper colored with the petals is used in the place of litmus for testing. The plant is easily propagated by cuttings. These should be removed with a piece of the old wood adhering, placed in water until roots begin to make their apjtearance, and then planted. In this way it is pos- sible to have a fine hedge under way in a very short, time, which begins to bloom immediately if flowering twigs have been selected for cuttings.

The heartwood of this tree is very hard and heavy, but not elastic. It is cross- grained and hard to work. It is very durable and is used for the posts of the best houses. The pillars of the church of Agafia are the trunks of ifil trees cut very near the site of the building. At first the wood is yellowish, then it turns rust-color, and assumes a dark color with time, resembling that of black walnut. Although of rather coarse grain, it takes a very fine polish. Nearly all the better houses of the island have tables and settees made of it, and even floors, which are kept beautifully polished by rubbing them with grated coconut wrapped in a cloth, through which the oil oozes. The wood has the virtue of resisting the attacks of termites or white ants. Trunks 9 meters long and 1 meter in diameter are sometimes found, but they usually vary from 2.5 to 5 meters in length and from 30 to 60 cm. in diameter. Houses made of newly sawn ifil are not whitewashed or painted until the wood has had time to dry and season, on account of the brown coloring matter, which discolors the surface. When old the wood becomes so hard that holes must be bored in it for nails. The trees are becoming scarce in the vicinity of Agafla, but are still compara- tively abundant in the forests of the northern part of the island. Rkkkkences: httaia bijuga (Colcbr.)

There are several varieties of sweet potato growing in Guam, differing from one another in shape, color, and quality of the root, and in the shape of the loaves. One of these was brought to the islands from Hawaii and is still called by the natives \"kamutes de Guahu\" (Oahu). Some of the earliest navigators mention \"batatas\" among the supplies received from the natives of Guam, but it is certain that they applied this name to the yam. In picturing the privations of the first missionaries in establishing themselves in Guam, Padre Francisco Garcia mentions that they were obliged toi'jit certain routs like sweet potatoes, but without the Huvor of theCamotcs of Mexico, Sweet potatoes were introduced, however, at a very early date by the 298 USEFUL PLANTS OF mi AM, Jesuits. They were much more to I ho taste of Kuropeans than the yams of the inland and were auitmg the supplies most prized hy the whalers visiting the island. The natives seldom grew them for their own use, hot contented themselves with yams, exchanging the sweet potatoes for fabrics and other tilings brought hy the ships, Sweet potatoes grow very well in Guam. They are among the crops which will thrive on the high land or \"mesa\" in places where the soil is too much exhausted (\"cansado\") for (Samoa).

Leaves smooth, broad-cordate, entire or 5-angled, long-pet ioled; panicles terminal or from the axils of the leaves, cymose, many-flowered, the male flowers at the extremities of the ramifications on short articulated pedicel*, the female flowers in the forks with pedicels not articulated, flowers yellow or greenish; calyx with 5 sepals, which are often petaloid; petals 5, cohering as far as the middle; corolla tube of male flower hairy within; stamens many; perianth of female flower similar to 2 to 4-eel led; styles cohering below, in each cell; capsule divided into 2-valved cocci; seeds very oily. The branches of this shrub take root very quickly when stuck in the ground. For this reason and from the fact that cattle will not eat the leaves it is a favorite hedge plant in many tropical countries. The seeds, though agreeable to the taste, are purgative, and, if eaten in considerable quantities, poisonous. The taste is very much like that of beechnuts. They are more drastic than the seeds of the allied castor-oil plant and milder than croton-oil seeds. The oil is used in the Philippines and in India for illuminating. Padre Blanco says it lasts longer than cocoanut oil used for this purpose. The viscid juice of the plant, when beaten, foams like soapsuds. Children often blow bubbles of it with a joint of bamboo. On evaporation it yields a reddish-brown resin. The juice is applied to wounds and ulcers. It prevents bleeding by forming a film like that of collodion. A decoction of the leaves is used as a wash in eczema and for ulcers. In the Philippines the plant is sometimes used for stupefying fish; hence, according to Padre Blanco, its vernacular name \"tuba,\" signifying liquor which intoxicates; but for this purpose it is inferior to Barringtoida speciom. The oil has been used in England for soap making, as a lubricant, and us a medium for mixing paint.

In Bengal, where the climatic conditions are very similar to those of Guam, the seed is sown at the beginning of October. It sometimes remains in the ground a month or two before all of it germinates. As it is liable to l)e destroyed by insects it should be sown in large shallow seed pans, supported on flower pots standing in vessels of water. The noil is kept, moist and shaded by muslin or by an inverted pan of the same size as that containing the earth. Firminger recommends that the plants l>e pricked out when four leaves have formed and planted in beds at about eight or ten inches apart. \"If two or three plants be reserved and allowed to rnn to seed, the seed thus saved may be sown almost immediately and a supply of plants secured which, if grown in a spot tolerably sheltered from the sun and excessive wet, will come into use during the hot and rain seasons.\"\" In Guam the best plants grown thus far have been Japanese varie- ties.

In Guam the best grass lor lawns is the introduced Bermuda grass (Capriola dac- t if Ion). Another grass, Stmotaphrum mfmfatum, which is indigenous and grows either on the sandy seashore, on the edge of the forest, and even in the shade, is also good. It has creeping rootetocks and a prostrate creeping habit of growth, and never Ijecomes coarse or hard. Both of these grasses are excellent for fodder and are especially useful for covering bare land and binding drift sand and river banks. They also successfully compete with most of the tropical weeds. They are easily propagated by cutting into small pieces the creeping rooting stems. The most expeditious method of preparing a lawn of Bermuda grass is to clear and level the plot of ground selected for the purpose, plow it up, or spade it, and prepare it as for a garden. Then spread over it a layer of wet earth, of the consistency of mortar, with which the chopped-up grass has been mixed. Each little joint will take root, and in a short time a lawn will be established. Throughout the greater part of the year there is sufficient rain to water the plot, but it is best to prepare it at the l>eginning of the rainy season. In drier climates the plot must be watered from time to time until the grass has established itself. Only a few tufts of Bermuda gnus- are necessary to cover a large area. It will grow either on low, moist, sandy soil near the sea or on the upland regions of the island. Once established it is hard to eradicate, and it is apt to become a pest in cultivated fields. In establishing a pas- ture the grass should l*e planted at intervals of 50 cm. in rows 1 meter apart. It spreads rapidly and in a short time will cover the entire surface. In Guam it is cut and fed to cattle as green forage. It can, however, be dried, if necessary, and made into excellent hay. Lawaonia alba. Same as Lawsonia inermis. Laweonia Khenna (Egypt); A1 khanna (Arabic). A shrub bearing very fragrant flowers, with round branches, sometimes armed with spines, and opposite entire lanceolate leaves. Flowers rather small, white, rose- colored, or greenish; calyx-tube very short, limb with 4 ovate lobes; petals 4, obo- vate, wrinkled, inserted at the top of the calyx-tulw; stamens usually 8, inserted in pairs between the petals, sometimes 4 only or 8 not paired; ovary free, 4-eelIed; style very long, leathery, breaking up irregularly, ultimately 1-celled; seeds many, angular, pyramidal, smooth, packed on a central placenta. Introduced into Guam on account of the fragrance of its flowers. It is readily propagated from cuttings, grows in tin* form of a bush sending up shoots, and is suitable for hedges. When kept clipped it is not unlike privet. Its odor at short range is rank and overpowering, but from a distance it is like that of mignonette. On the shores of Central America the land breezes frequently waft the odor nut 1o sea. This species is the \"sweet-smelling camphire\" of Solomon. It is ;i native of western Asia, Egypt, and the African coasts of the Mediterranean, mill now grows DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE. 307 wild in some parts of India. It is also cultivated in many countries. It has been a favorite garden plant in the East from the time of the ancient Egyptians to the present day. The Egyptians used the flowers for perfuming the oils and ointments with which they anointed the body and for embalming the bodies of their dead. The Jews also derived a perfume from the flower?, which they employed in their baths, ami in religious ceremonies, and they sprinkled the flowers on the garments of the newly married. From the most ancient times the leaves have l>een used in the East for staining the lingers, nails, hands, and feet, and for dyeing the hair. Egyptian mummies have been found with their nails stained by it. In India its use is still universal among Mohammedan women and has spread among the Hindoos. In southern China, where it is common, it is also used for the same purpose. To dye the nails, the freshly gathered leaves and young twigs are pounded with lime or catechu, mixed with hot water, and applied to the fingers over night. For dyeing the hair a paste of the powdered leaves is applied to it and it is bound up with leaves, wax cloth, or oilskin. After a half hour or more the preparation is washed off and the hair is found to be of a bright red color. A second application is then made of the powder of the indigo plant made into a paste with water and allowed to remain three hours. This turns the hair a jet black. Ointments are used to make it glossy. The process must be repeated frequently, as with other dyes, on account of the growth of the hair. By certain classes of Mohammedans the process is stopped at the first stage, leaving the hair and beard red; and in Persia, Arabia, and northern India the manes and tails of horses arc sometimes colored red by the same process.\u00ab References: Ldiraonin inemnh L.

The genus Lobelia as established by Limwus in the Species Plantarum 2:929. 175/} and Genera Plantarum ed. 5. 401.1754, contained 25 species, only one of which belonged to the Lobelia of Plunder from whom Linmrus adopted the name. This sjH'ciee, Lobelia phimierii, was the first to be referred to a new genus, Scaevola, under the name Scarrofa fobeli <1, proposed by Linna*us in 1771, and thus became its type species. This treatment has been followed by most modern authors, but in the application of the names in accordance with the principle of generic types the course of several well-known authors who wrote soon after the appearance of the species Plantarum seems to indicate a more careful regard for the correct application of generic names. Notable among these was Miller, who, in the seventh edition of the Gardener's Dictionary, wisely restricted the name Lolxdia to the original of Plunder and the type species of the genus as established by Li mucus, and adopted the Tournefortian name Rapuntium for the species which modern authors (Otto Kuntze, 1 think, alone excepted) have allowed to remain under the name Lobelia.

There are few trees on the island, but these produce fruit of the finest quality. Guam mangoes are large, sweet, fleshy, juicy, and almost entirely free from the fiber and the flavor which so often characterize the fruit. The trees grow to great size and appear to be thrifty; but nearly all on the island have been blown down by baguios, or hurricanes, and con- tinue to grow, as it were, resting on their elbows. The cause for this, I think, is the shiillowness of the noil, the hard coral rock not allowing the roots to penetrate to any great depth. Those which remain standing are in low, protected places, where the soil in comparatively deep. The natives value the fruit more highly than any other food product of the island. Indeed, the presence of a mango tree on a rancho enhances its value. During some seasons no fruit is produced. The natives fre- quently cut gashes in the trunk and build fires beneath the limbs, thinking that the tree will be induced thereby to produce a good crop. Frequently one portion of the tree will bloom or send out fresh foliage, which is reddish and tender when new, while the rest of the tree remains dormant, and it often happens that the fruit is perfectly ripe on certain limbs, while on others it is still green. The trees are prop- agated by seed, and the fruit of the seedlings appears, in Guam, to be identical with that of the parent tree. The seeds must be planted when quite fresh. The young plants are tender, and are killed in transplanting if the root lie injured. Grafting and inarching is not practiced, though it could be done with good advantage from limbs of mature trees producing especially fine fruit,\" and it could 1h: carried on with espe- cial facility with the prostrated trees, which still continue to grow vigorously and bear line fruit. The tree is in Guam entirely free from disease or injurious parasites. In view of the excellent quality of its fruit and the danger of bringing diseases and parasitic insects with specimens from abroad, importation of living mango plants should be forbidden. The failure to produce crops each year is probably owing to tlii; fact that the dry season in Guam is not sufficiently marked to cause the trees to \u00ab Grafting should not be performed during the rainy season nor in the midst of the hottest part of the year. Inarching of the herbaceous parts is most successful. See Baltet, L'art degreffer, p. LW, 1MI2. 816 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. hear, or it may be that pollination is prevented by rains. In Burma the earth around the tree is removed each year and the roots left exposed for a space of two or three weeks, so as to create a dry season artificially- This is done in November. In December the roots are supplied with manure and covered with new earth. During the month of April, when the fruit is swelling, copious drenchings of the soil around the stem with water or liquid manure is of great advantage. When con- tinued wet weather prevails during the time of flowering, the flowers are apt to drop off without setting fruit. HEFKJtKNrEH: Mangifera indica L. Sp. PI. 1: 200. 1753. Mangle.

The vernacular name for an unripe coconut which is full of water, in Spanish called \"coco mudo.\" Man\u00a3 plant, which is of tropical American origin, ia cultivated by many of the natives of Guam, but it is not of much importance in the economy of their daily life. It grows as a shrub, with knotty stems containing pith, palmately divided, long- petioled leaves without glands, and flesh y tuberous roots (PI. X X VI, p. 145). In Guam it is not known to flower. It is very easily propagated by cuttings made of the thicker branches, which take root readily and grow with little care. There are two principal varieties recognized, which though not having distinct specific characters are very different in the properties of the root. The first, called \"sweet cassava,\" may he used as a vegetable without special treatment; the second, called \"bitter cassava,\" contains an abundance of prussic acid, which renders the juice very poison- ous, but which is fortunately volatile and is rendered harmless by heat. The roots are gathered at maturity and must be immediately utilized, as they will not keep like sweet potatoes. As the climate of Guam seems well adapted to the cultivation of this plant, and as it is very productive, it would well repay more extensive cultivation. The roots yield meal, starch, aiul cassava, or tapioca. The meal or harina (called '* farinha\" in Brazil) is made by peeling and grating the root, expressing the juice, drying the pulp, removing the fibrous matter by sifting, and dissipating any vestiges of prussic acid by heating. In preparing meal from sweet cassava the root is j>eeled, sliced or CASSAVA 317 grated, dried in the sun, and ground into powder. In this state it may lie used for thickening Koups, making gruel, and as an ingredient in puddings. Starch is made from cassava very much in the same way as from potatoes. The roots are rasped or grated to a fine pulp, mixed with water in a tub or vat and run through strainers to separate the solid particles from the milky liquid. This liquid is allowed to stand for some time and the stan h settles at the bottom. The water is then drawn off without disturbing the sediment. Fresh water is poured upon this sediment and after vigorous stirring it is passed through a finer sieve, allowed once more to settle and the clear liquid drawn off. The starch is then spread out in thin layers and dried in the sun. Cassava will yield nearly double the percentage of starch obtained from an equal weight of potatoes,\u00ab and in a country like Guam, where potatoes will not grow and the climate and soil are we]I adapted for cassava, its culture can not fail to be profitable. It is now cultivated in Florida and other Southern States and factories have Wen established for the manufacture of cassava starch. The starch produced has been sold to cotton factories for sizing. For laundry purposes the starch is said to Ik* 1 tetter than that made from corn or pota- toes, \"giving a smoother surface and a finer gloss than can be obtained by the use of either.\" 6 Tapioca is made by washing and peeling the roots, grating them to a fine pulp and expressing the milky juice. This is collected into a flat-bottomed tub or vat and allowed to stand for eight hours. A considerable quantity of very fine starch will be deposited. The clear liquid is carefully drawn off and the starch is spread upon wicker frames and dried for two or three hours in the sun. It is then placed upon sheets of tin or in flat iron pans and well stirred with an iron rod to prevent scorch- ing. The starch grains swell up and burst and become agglutinated together into small, irregular, transparent, jelly-like lumps, which harden on cooling, and which form the tapioca of commerce, one of the most important exports from Brazil. The roots of sweet cassava are much relished by cattle, horses, hogs, and poul- try. In a country like Guam, where animals are always kept confined and where food must be gathered for the majority of them, it would be profitable to raise cassava for forage. The greater part of the cassava grown in our Southern States is fed to animals, which are said to thrive on it much better than when confined to dry feed. It is less watery than potatoes, yams, sweet potatoes, or turnips, while its yield is much greater. The roots must be fed in a fresh condition, but they will keep for a long time if left undisturbed in the ground; so that during the periods of famine which inva- riably follow hurricanes in Guam, when nearly all vegetation and all crops are blasted and destroyed, they would be especially valuable. In the farmers' bulletin already referred to % cassava roots are specially recommended as food for milch cows and for fattening stock. It does not affect the flavor of the milk or butter and imparts a richer color to both. In feeding to cattle the roots are cut or broken into small pieces to prevent choking, but this is not necessary when feeding to horses or bogs. It is the custom of some farmers to crush the roots with a mallet before feeding, and as the fresh roots are crisp and brittle, this can l>e easily done. Others put them in a box and chop them with a spade. In feeding to hogs the animals are sometimes turned into the field and allowed to gather the crop for themselves. This, however, is wasteful. It is a good plan to turn hogs into a field where cassava has lieen grown and gathered,\" as many broken roots will be found remaining. Cassava is very fatten- ing. It is too carbonaceous to be fed exclusively to animals, and with it there should be some nitrogenous food to form bone and muscle. This is also the case \"See Wiley, The Manufacture of Starch from Potatoes and Cassava, U. S, Dept. of Agr., I>iv. of Chemistry, Hull. No. 58, p. 44, 1900. ''Tracy, Cureavu, I'. S.

This plant has been introduced into Guam, and attempts were made to cultivate it on the island by several governors and by the Sociedad Agrfcola dc lit (\\mcepcion, in lKt>7, during the administration of Don Francisco Moscoso y bam. It grows well; a fine patch of it may still be seen on the border of the \"Oienaga,\" near Matan-hanom, the source of the Agafia River; but the preparation of its fiber required too much work on the part of the natives. They have.other plants suitable for cordage, which require little trouble to pretire them for their uses; and the cultivation of this species, though quite possible in Guam, has never been an industry of the island. Unlike the allied banana and plantain, the fruits of iftimi trjlilix are fertile. The plant may be propagated from the seed, but it is usually propagated from suckers, as in I he case of the banana and plantain. When the plants are cut down at maturity they are replaced by suckers which spring up from the root, so that the plantation is constantly renewing itself. When the flower bud makes its appearance the plant is ready for the harvest. The stalk is cut close to the ground. The fiber isYontained in the long leaf sheaths which surround the stem. These are split into strips two or three inches w ide. The inner portion of the middle parts, which are thicker than the marginal, is pulpy and cooperatively useless, so that only the outer portion is used. The fiber should lie extracted while the strips are still fresh, since they become quickly discolored if left in the sun, and the quality of the fiber is injured if they are allowed to ferment. In the Philippines the fiber is extracted by drawing the prepared strips of the leaf-sheath between the edge of a large knife or machete and a block of hard wood. This is usually done under a tree or a thatch-covered shod.

See under Tobacco was introduced into Guam by the Jesuit missionaries very shortly after their arrival. The natives soon became very fond of it, learning to smoke the leaves in the form of cigars, and some of them chewing it either alone or in combination with their areca nut and betel pepper. So popular was its use that the wages of the natives working for the missionaries and for the government were paid in tobacco leaves, as the archives at Agafia will show. Though it is cultivated in a variety of situations, on the lowlands, on the coral plat- form or mesa, and in alluvial valleys, yet the natives recognize that the best results are obtained from tobacco planted on recently cleared land. The regions known as Santa Rosa, Yigo, Youa, Mataguag, Finaguiiyog, and Maga are all celebrated lor their H32 rSKFUL PLANTS OF GUAM. It in* tobacco crops. Both the soil and Ihe climate of tin1 island seem well adapted to its culture. After a spot of land has been cleared fur a \"scmillero,\" or seed 1>ed, the brush is allowed to dry, and when the weeds have sprung up it is spread over the surface and burned, thus destroying weeds and injurious insects and larva*, and enriching the ground with the ashes. The seed is planted during the months ol' August and Sep- tember in small beds. It is sown over the surface of the finely pulverized ground and raked in. They soon sprout and intiuam require little watering. The beds are carefully weeded and the seedlings are ready for transplanting in a few weeks, gen- erally in October and November. They are then planted in nurseries, in parallel rows, near their ultimate destination, and are usually shaded with canopies of muslin or interlacing branches or cocoanut leaves. This {fives the roots a chance to {trow without too great crowding, as would be the ease if they were left to develop in the seed beds. Finally, in the months of December, January, or February, they are planted in the lield, the time selected for this purpose being after a good rain. Care is taken not to injure the roots of the young plants in transplanting. They must be watered at intervals, if the rain is not sufficient and must be protected from the sun by segments of cocoanut leaves set in the ground at an angle and the ends of the leaflets tied together so as to form a sort of cone. The natives take great care to keep their lields free from weeds and go over the plants daily to destroy the larva of a sphinx moth which feeds upon them. About one month after planting in the field the flower buds make their appearance and are immediately pinched off, leaving only a few of the finest plants to llower in order to secure seed for the next season. Tobacco is so prolific that the seed from one plant is sullicient to plant a field of considerable size. Suckers or aide branches are removed as fast as they appear, as the nourishment must go to developing large leaves. When the leaves are sufficiently mature the whole plant is cut off near the base, and the leaves are allowed to dry on the stem. The plants are tied in bundles and taken under cover, for cutting a dry day is selected, and the plants are allowed to wither before being taken under cover. In drying two or three plants are hung together, the bunches being far enough apart so as to leave space for free circulation of the air. When the midribs are perfectly dry the process is finished. After undergoing a slight fermentation the tobacco is made up either in the form of loosely rolled cigars wrapped with pineapple or agave fiber, or in bundles {\" palillos\") of ten leaves each. The use of tobacco is general among the natives, Ixttli male and female, of the lower classes, but very few ladies of the better class make use of it, and these appear ashamed if seen smoking. So necessary is it to most of the people that they appear to suffer as much from its lack as from a dearth of food. As a rule they prefer their own tobacco to imported kinds; but. when their supply gives out they will use what they can obtain from the storekeepers. On snch occasions they will bring eggs or chickens to give in exchange, when they refuse to sell these for money. Khfejieni'ks: Nicutimut lubdcinn L. Sp. PI. (titiani).

This family is interesting, stemless, unarmed palm with pinnate leaves often growing to a length of 20 feet. Flowers momccious, axillary, inclosed in a spat he; fruit a one- seeded drupe growing in clusters as large as a man's head. This plant was introduced into Guam from the Philippines for the sake of its leaves, which make excellent thatch. It has established itself at the mouth of nearly every stream in the island where the water Incomes brackish, its graceful giant leaves rising from the water's edge forming a striking feature of the landscape. The plant is of interest, to the geologist from the fact that fossil nuts of an allied species are found in Kngland in the tertiary formations at the mouth of the Thames, where they once floated about and embedded themselves in the mud as they now do in Guam and the Philippines. For thatching, the leaflets are stripped from the rachis and formed into a thick fringe (tagon) on a reed. After having lieen thoroughly dried the thatch is secured to the framework of the roof by lashings of pandanus leaves split up the middle and deprived of their stiff keel. Two men work at a time on each reed, Ix'ginning at the eaves and working toward I he ridge, which is covered with a sort of braided matting secured in place by pins passing under the ridge-pole and projecting on each side. The nipa is far superior to and more durable than eocoanut thatch, and is used for the Ixttter houses of the island. Preparations are made for thatching very much as for a corn-husking with us. The housewife begins saving up dulces and other good things months before- hand. The nipa leaves ary collected, made into fringe, and allowed to dry. Pandanus lea vets are collected and cured and stripped of their spiny-keeled midrib.

The wood is hard, heavy, fine-drained, and durable, It is very highly prized by the natives of Guam, who use it for posts and beams in the construction of their houses. Sometimes the trunks yield logsn meters long and 30 cm. in diameter. As the tree grows old red heart-wood is developed which at length takes up a great part of the trunk. From this a dye somewhat like that obtained from sap pan-wood is obtained, but at the present time, when imported dyes are easily obtainable, the natives do not go to the 1 rouble to prepare it for use. The tree usually grows in rocky places near the shore. It is especially abundant on the Peninsula of (Prole and also on A papa Island.

See East Indies).rt Rice whs a food-staple of the native before the discovery of Guam. It is among the products of the island mentioned by Magellan (1521), Legazpi (l.%o), Oliver van Noort (1H00), and others. According to tlie accounts of the early navigators it was cultivated in many places oil the island by the natives, who sold it to visiting ships in parcels weighing 70 to HU pounds each. The Dutch complained that the natives were dishonest in their dealings, for not one parcel of rice bought from them was found which had not been increase I in weight by the addition of stones and sand. The aborigines had three kinds of rice, red (agaga), coarse-grained (basto), and a fine fragrant variety, brought from the island of Rota, called by the Spanish settlers \"palay aronisttieo.\" According to Don Antonio Martinez, one of the principal rice- growers oh the island, rice was formerly cultivated both in the flooded marshes and on dry land. Xow it is cultivated only ill the marshes. In addition to the three kinds already mentioned two Philippine varieties are now planted, called \"palay bianco\" (white paddy) and \"mala<|uid.*' It is interesting to note the identity of the < luani name for rice with names used throughout the Malay Archipelago, which is shared by the Kant Indian word \"paddy.\" Cooked rice is called \"puga,\" or when preceded by the definite article, \" piga.\" This word is probably allied to \" buns\" of the sea-gypsies called Bajau,'J a roaming tribe of fishermen met with in all parts of the Malay Archipelago. At present rice is cultivated in (iuam very much as in the Philippines. The land is generally prepared during the month of August or September or in the early part of Ootoljer, and at the same time the seedlings are grown and gotten ready for trans- planting. Transplanting takes place in October, November, or December and the grain matures about five months later. As the water supply conies from rain-fed streams the cultivation of rice is attended with considerable uncertainty. It is not unusual for droughts or blasting winds to cause the loss of the entire crop. As the time of the harvest approaches the prevailing winds are from the north, and they sometimes cause great damage to the rice fields which are exposed to them. Near Inaluhan they are protected by the mountains to the northward. On the Inalahan vega the planting may be postponed even until .January, so that the grain may form at the end of March, when the northerly winds have somew iat subsided. The lietds are leveled by means of a scraper (rastra). It is unnecessary to puddle the soil, as it will retain the water without dilliculty. The area to be cultivated is divided into small lields separated by banks about a half meter high, to confine the water. Where the land slopes it is formed into terraces, arranged in such a manner as to govern the flow of water. The seed is soaked in water for twelve hours, alter which it is taken out and left three or four days, when it begins to sprout. It is then planted in a semi Hero, or nursery, which is surrounded by a ditch of water to protect it from ants and other crawling insects. When the seedlings are about (i or 8 inches high they are transplanted into the lields, or squares, prepared for them. The plants are set out \u00abThe vernacular names here given are applied to the unhusked rice. Throughout the Malay Archipelago and in India distinct names are applied to rice after it is husked and to cooked rice, just as in Knglish we distinguish between maize, hominy, and pone. &See Wallace, Malay Archipelago, pp. (>2l and (507, IKliU. 340 USEFUL 1'LANTH OF (} IT AM in groups <>f ;} or 5 in straight- rows about a foot apart. Rice is never sown broadcast in Guam. A limit two kabanes of seed are requmnl for each hectare of land. The weeding is done by hand. The weeds are buried in the mud. They soon decay and servo to enrich the noil. In Guam the fields are kept flooded until the grain if completely developed and well filled out. The water is then drawn off the fields. Ah there in no provision in Guam for storing water in reservoirs for irrigation or pumping it from wells, the season for rice growing depends upon the water supply from the streams. As ji rule there is but one rice harvest per year. The plants arc not pulled lip, but are cut with a sickle at a convenient height, leaving the stalks, which sometimes produce a second crop. The gathered crop is exposed to the sun only while the reaping is going on. It is carried to sheds the evening of the same day and placed under cover. Rice is thrashed either by treading it under foot or by l>eating the stalks over a pole or bamboo grating. The grain is separated from the straw very easily by the latter process, which, in Guam, is preferred to the former. It is then winnowed. It is kept in store in ita unit (tiled condition, small quantities being hulled as required in a large wooden mortar (pi Ion) made of a log with a cavity at the upper end holding from a half gantn to a ganta of grain. The pestle is also of wood, having an oblong thickening at each end and slender in the middle, so as to Ik1 easily grasped by the hand. Asa rule rice grown in Guam is inferior to that imported from other coun- tries. The best rice brought to the island comes from Japan, selling at 10 pesos ($o) a picul. American rice sells for 10 cents a pound. Rice was formerly brought to Guam from the Philippines and from Saigon, Cochin China, but importation from these sources luts stopped. When the rice harvest of the island has been fairly good the unboiled paddy is sold at <i pesos a kaban. In the time of Don Felipe de la Corte its usual price was 3 pesos a kaban. (See value of picul and kaban under \"Meas- ures,\" p. I lit).) In time of scarcity Japanese and American rice is sold as high as 20 jm'Sos u sack ($10) containing 1 picul. Unsuccessful attempts have been made to cultivate rice in the large marsh near Agafia, called \"la Cienaga,\" and Don Felipe de la Corte tried to cultivate upland rice on the island, but failed.\" The labor required to keep the rice fields free from weeds is so great and so exacting, and failures of the crop are so frequent, that rice culture is gradually being abandoned in Guam, except in sites especially favored. The natives are directing their attention more and more to maize, their principal food staple, and to cocoa nut planting, the only commercial industry of the island. According to Don Antonio Martinez, the yield of rice per hectare of land is, in good years, as much as 100 kahanes. Laborers in rice fields are, subject to sick- ness which they call \"pasmon manengheiig,\" especially those working in drained fields. This is probably of a malarial nature (\"manengheiig\" signifies cold). Land varies greatly in fertility. In some places the same field is cultivated for a number of years in succession; in others the soil somi becomes exhausted. In the latter case it is allowed to lie fallow for one or two years. Weeds grow up, and their leaves falling and decaying serve to enrich the fields anew. When the rice is ripe the fields are visited bv doves and wild ducks, which cause considerable loss to the farmer. * r Rkkkukn<KS: Onjztt mtira L. Sp, IN. 1: 1 11) * frarttn tt Sp* Oxalidaceae.

Pandan (Philippines). See Pawhttms h-fioriu*. lai ig (Philippines). Much confusion exists ill the nomenclature of the Pandanaceae, owing to insntVi- cient material in herbaria. In this genus the male and the female flowers are borne on separate plants. The leaves are long and narrow, tough and leathery, and are armed along the keel of the midrib and on the edges with sharp recurved prickles. They are arranged in triple spiral series toward the ends of the branches, forming dense tufts or crowns; it is from their resemblance to the leaves of the pine- apple that the name of the screw pine is derived. The trees are remarkable for their prop-like aerial roots, with large, cup-like spongiolcs on their tips. The male inflor- escence consists of a compound spadix, made up of a number of short catkin-like spikes, each of which bears an immense number of little naked flowers with indefi- nite stamens. The female inflorescence is a globular or oblong head consisting of very numerous, closely packed ovaries, each containing a single ovule. The fruit consists of a number of wedge-shaped clusters of drupes, congregated into oval or cone-like heads.\" At least three species of Pandanus occur in (.Juain, the most important of which, the <l aggak,\" is represented by only one sex, and must be propagated by cuttings. It is probably tniur'nt* Parkinson (/'. fi(hirnlin Jungh.); but it can not )>e identified with certainty, as there are many closely allied species. Pandanus A tree growing to the height of A to 7 meters, with very broad, stiff, long, coarse leaves, which are crowded at the ends of the branches. The drupes composing the large head each terminate in a point at the apex, giving to the fruit the appearance of the head of an enormous Fijian war club, studded with many blunt projections. The leaves are not strong. They are normally stiff, but may be made more flexible by heat, and may l>e woven into coarse mate, but they are inferior in every way to those of the aggak. The kernels of the seeds are sometimes eaten by the natives as a relish, but they are not a food staple.

The trunks are often used for building temporary ranches or farm dwellings; they are not very durable. Advantage is taken of the dichotoinous branching of the limbs to make supports for platforms. Water troughs are made of straight trunks of specimens from the forest, but they soon decay. Along I be roadsides and near dwellings trees of kafo are seen with their trunks notched in such a manner as to make a reservoir for the rain water which is caught by the leaves and drains down I he trunk. Often the presence of a good tree ot this kind determines ihe place where a raneh shall be built. The limbs are also line chicken rousts, not an unimportant matter in the domestic economy of the natives. In the forests the trunk sometimes rises to a height of 7 meters, straight and smooth, before branching.

Only one sex occurs on the island, so that it must he propagated by cuttings. These hike root readily; indeed, a branch lying on the surface will often send out roots which pene- trate the ground, The natives frequently plant this species in hedges, which serve the double purpose of defining their boundaries and of furnishing material for cord- age and for mats, hats, and bags.

In Guam it is very extensively cultivated. Cuttings take root readily. An old lady, who made a business of selling betel leaves, brought the writer several cuttings and planted them in his garden. She removed all the leaves but two or three, twined the lower part of the cutting into a hoop-like loop, and covered it with a few inches of soil upon which she laid a flat stone to retain the moisture, leaving the tip of the cutting projecting from beneath the stone. Following her directions I watered my cuttings daily for about, a week. New leaves soon began to push forth, and in a short time I had line vigorous plants climbing up my lemon and lime trees and running over my garden wall. The fresh green leaves (mainaon) are chewed by the natives wrapped alKmt a fragment of Areca nut together with a pinch of quicklime. They art* agreeably pungent and aromatic, the nut and leaves together tasting somewhat like nutmeg, and giving a spicy odor to the breath. In Guam the betel takes the place of t*ipcr wiiht/xtU'ttHt, the root# of which, after having been chewed or grated, are made by the Polynesians into the infusion called \" kava\" or \"ava.\" The kava pepi>er does not grow in Guam, hi islands where it does occur its leaves are occasionally used in place of those of the betel pep]>er for chewing.

The fruit of this species is not eaten in tiuaiu. In some countries it is prepared by boiling, and ashes are applied to neutralize the bilter taste, alter which it is baked and eaten The bark is used for tanning, and yields a chocolate-colored dye. The sap is used for preserving Jish nets. The wood is excellent for fuel, especially for baking. On the Malay peninsula mangrove swamps are sometimes leased to woodcutters, who supply fuel to steamers and factories. The heart wood is of a dark red color, with dark rings of growth, and is durable, very hard, and heavy. It is, however, very brittle, and warps and cracks so easily as to unlit it for cabinet use. The sapwood is of a bright yellow color. The wood is durable in water and under- ground, and would be suitable for foundations of bridges and wharves.

Its vernacular name is etymologicalIv identical in many islands of the Malay Archipelago, the Philippine?, and Polynesia; and the variety in Guam fnmi which the natives make sugar, with short internodes and of a yellow color, is like that found by Captain Cook in Tahiti. Another variety, called \"cana niorada\" by the Spaniards, of a purple color, is also grown on the island, but it is too watery and not sweet enough for sugar-making. The variety \"amarilla\" grows to the height of 7 or H feet; the \"niorada\" grows much higher. The cultivation of sugar cane is not now carried on so extensively as formerly, as the manufacture of sugar demands no little labor, and requires the use of animals and machinery, and imported sugar can be bought of the traders at a comparatively low price. There art; families, however, who retain the customs of their ancestors, holding it to lie wrong to buy anything which they themselves can make. These not only make: their sugar from cane or from the sap of the cocoamit, but eva|>orate sea water in iron kettles to get their salt, counting as nothing the lal>or of their fam- ilies or the value of the fuel consumed. The climate of Guam is well adapted to the cultivation of sugar cane, and in many low-lying situations, where it is not very wet, the soil seems well suited to it. Though the cost of a sugar mill is considerable, yet one mill would answer for the crops of many farms, and the natives could carry their cane to the mill just as with us the farmers carry their wheat or corn. The cane is propagated by cuttings, consisting of two or three joints of the upper part of the stem. These are selected from vigorous, healthy plants. They are placed in thy ground with only an inch or two of the cutting projecting above the surface. In alnmt two weeks from planting the \"eyes\" at each node will send forth shoots, and roots will grow from the nodes themselves. As the shoots develop, the parent SUGAR DANK. 307 stem decays and the you 11% plants produce mots of their own. In Guam the plants mature in about nine months, when thrv are cut close to the ground and the leaves stripped off, spread over the surface of the field, and burned. Ratoons (retoftos) spring up from the old stoles, or \"stools,\" which yield more abun- dantly than the original plants. The ojieration is repeated, and a third crop, per- haps a little less liberal than the second, is gathered. After the third crop, when the cane shows evidence of deterioration, the old stalks are uprooted and burned and the land cleared. As sugar cane soon exhausts the soil, the land would become \"cansado,\" or barren, if measures were not taken to restore its fertility. It is there- fore allowed to lie fallow for several years. In some countries the planters grow indigo or other leguminous plants between the rows when the canes arc first planted and turn them under while they are still green and succulent.\" This process has a very beneficial effect. It could easily be practiced in (Juani, where indigo grows spontaneously, together with a numljer of cassias and other nitrogen-gleaning legumi- nous plants. In Mauritius rotation of crops is practiced. In that island, after the land has produced cane for two seasons, it is planted in maize, arrowroot, mandiocat or peas, allowing a period of three years between the cane crops. In Guam moriggos (Phaxeolu# mungo) may be used for this purpose. Cane does not thrive either on the elevated mesa or in situations where only pure sand is found. This is owing, in the former case, to the porosity of the coral which forms the subsoil, allowing the water to filter through immediately after each rain. Don Felipe tie la Corte, who, during his administration as governor, tried earnestly to develop the resources of the island, hoped to succeed 011 the mesa with the \"morada\" variety, thinking that it might there \"prove less watery and sweeter, as in the case of the sweet potato and other plants grown there, as compared with the same plants grown on the lowlands.\"'' lie accordingly started a cane plantation on the mesa, on the tinea (farm) belonging to the Colegio de San Juan de Let ran; but his experi- ment proved a failure. Its site is now occupied by cornfields, and the foundations of the sugarhouse alone remain as a monument to the zeal of this good governor. After the cane has been gathered and stripped of its leaves it is carried to the mill (trapiche), in which it is crushed lietween rollers. The juice is then strained and lime is added to purify it. The lime neutralizes any acids resulting from fermenta- tion and combines with any carbonates present, forming an insoluble precipitate, which carries down with it the impurities in the juice. The juice is then boiled in kettles, as in the case of the sugar made of coconut sap, and the scum is removed as it rises to the surface. Only the crude, brown, moist sugar, called \"panoche,\" is made in (luam. The natives are very fond of it and use it in various ways to make sweetmeats. The sirup which drains from the panocha is used as molasses, or \"almibar,\" and serves instead of sugar for preserving fruit. Notwithstanding the advantages which (iuam offers as to soil and climate and the absence of enemies of sugar cane, it is not probable that the production of sugar on the island would be profitable from a commercial point of view. For, in order to compete with sugar produced in other parts of the world, its cultivation and manu- facture would have to be carried on on a large scale, and would necessitate the employment of labor which it is impossible to get 011 the island.

They are not pliable enough for running rigging or for fine cordage. They need no preparation but spinning or twisting. No ropes of vegetable filler are so imperishable when subjected to repeated wetting as those made of cabo negro fiber.

This is obtained in great abundance by cutting the spadiees of the (lowers in the same way as those of the coconut palm are cut in (iuam for the same purpose. (See (W'cm xtirifern). When fresh the sap is like sweet cider; bv fermentation it Iwcomes intoxicating, and is then distilled into a rum or brandy resembling the aguar- diente of (iuam.

The young shoots and panicles are tawny-vel vety; leave* trifoliolate; leaflets tawny-pubescent ovate-orbicular, shortly acuminate or apiculate, stamens combined into a tube; stigma divided into 5 lobes; fruit about the ni%e of an orange, containing 5 one-seeded nuts. The fruit has a fleshy acid pulp. It may be eaten raw and makes very good dulces, but has a peculiar odor. In Manila it is sold on the streets and served at hotel tables. The root, bruised with vinegar and water, is said to be a good remedy in diarrhea and dysentery.a This tree has been introduced into (iuain from the Philippines, but has not yet become well established. A line tree is growing on the ranch of Don Jose de Leon liuerrero, in the locality called Lalo. It is a native of Hurmaand has spread through southern I ml hi, the Philippines, and many other tropical countries. The wood when burned gives forth an aromatic odor. It is durable and is suitable for the construc- tion of houses and l>oats. The heartwood is red and close-grained, and takes a fine polish. Rekkhexces: ,S<wdoricitnt ind'tcmti Oav.

The genus Achras (L. Sp. PL 2: 1HMX 1753; L. (Jen. PL ed. 5.45*7.1754) was based by Linna'iis on Plunder's genus Sapota, but only one of Plunder's two species enumerated by Liumeus iu 17r>3. This species, Achrn# znpota^ being the only Achras in the first edition of Lindens' Species Plantaruni. is the type of that genus. An unfortunate confusion of names was introduced by l,inn;ens in the second edition of his Species Plantarum, in 17H2, when he changed the name of his Aclmtx ytpofu of 175% to ,IrAnfx mfntuttosa^ transferring the former name, Achnix zapofut to another species under a modified spelling Achnix sttjMfa* The nomenclatorial misunderstand- ings thus originated are easily and definitely dispelled by an application nf the rule of priority and the principle of generic types. The name Arhnt# Zfrpfttn is restored to its original use, and since the second species, called . Irhntm Mtpofa7 does not belong to the same genus as the lirst, a new generic name must he found.

An annual plant which haw been introduced into Guam, and is cultivated in sonic DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE 373 of the gardens of the natives for the sake of its oily seeds. The axillary tubular flowers have a 5-cleft calyx an<l a 5-parted corolla, the lowest lobe of which is pro- longed; stamens 4 (2 pairs of unequal length), with the rudiment of a fifth; capsule oblong, quadrangular, 2-valved, many-seeded. In Guam this plant is not of much economic importance. The seeds yield an abundance of fixed oil, which is clear and nearly tasteless, and may be used like olive oil. The best oil for fond purposes is expressed from the cold seed.\" The parched seeds are used in many countries to give a flavor to cakes, sweetmeats, and salads, and when parched and pounded they arc made into a savory soup. One of the chief advantages of this plant consists in its tpuek return of produce. It does not thrive so well in moist tropical countries where the rainfall is continu- ous as in regions where the rainfall is regular and riot excessive, or where the crop can be irrigated. It will not. grow in localities incapable of drainage, but thriven in alluvial sandy soil. The seed is sown at the In-ginning of the rainy season. The plant blooms in two months and at the end of three or four months the seed is ripe. The plants are then cut or pulled up and piled in heaps until the leaves have shriveled and fallen off. They are then bung up to dry in the sun. The jhkIs burst open and the seeds are allowed to fall on mats or cloths placed to catch them. The bunches are also beaten so as to cause the remaining seed to fall. The seeds may be bulled by gently pounding them in a wooden mortar with a wooden pestle. The bulls contain a yellow coloring matter. The kernels are white and tasteless. When parched they have a nutty flavor. A very good candy is made by melting sugar, as for peanut brittle, [muring it in shallow pans, and sprinkling over it sesame seed. The heat of the melted sugar is suflicient to parch the seeds and to give them a rich aromatic flavor. In South Carolina, where sesame Is cultivated by the negroes as a catch crop in cotton fields, candy of this kind is made by the confectioners. Three varieties are recognized, distinguished by the color of the seeds. Yellow and white sesame seeds are used in Japan for oil-making, while the black seeds are used for cooking, either whole or ground into a coarse jHjwder.'' References: Semnnnm orieninh Costa (Cuba).

As with the yams, the tubers are mature when the plants die down. They are then dug up and are ready for conversion into starch or arrowroot. Tliev are rasped or grated into a fine pulp which is put into a tub of water. This becomes milky and is strained through a coarse cloth or sieve to remove the coarser particles. On standing for some time the starch settles on the bottom and the clear liquid is care- fully poured off. The fresh root is very bitter, but by repeatedly pouring off the water and replacing it by fresh water the bitter principle is removed. When the starch is thoroughly washed it is dried in the sun after the manner of common arrowroot and cassava starch. In 1 locos and Zamhales, of the Philippine group, where it is abundant, the natives prepare the starch by rasping the roots on a rough stone ill water.

Jn Samoa the natives make fringed skirts (tfti) of the leaves, which they wear in fishing on the reef and in rainv weather. The leaves are also much used bv the Polynesians * * (r for wrapping fish and other food before putting it into the native ovens to bake. The leaves are free from any pronounced taste. They are excellent for fodder for animals, and are often used in native feasts, together with leaves of bananas and plantains, as plates or trays upon which food is spread. In Guam the natives use it only as an ornamental plant. Rhkkiiencks: Taelsta fer>ni >mfi* (L.)

The acid pulp makes a very pleasant, cooling drink when mixed with water and sweetened. Jn India it is a favorite ingredient of curries and chufneys, and the seeds are eaten by the natives, the outer skin being first removed by masting or soaking, and the seed then boiled or fried. They are also made into a. flour after being dried and ground. The tender seedlings are eaten as a vegetable, and the leaven and flowers are also eaten. Nearly every part of this tree is utilized in India, and it plays an important part in the economy of the natives. The wood is highly prixed, but is hard to work. It is used for mallets, rice pounders, wheels, etc. The leaves, flowers, and fruit are used as mordants in dyeing; and the fruit is a valuable laxative and antiscorbutic.\" Jn (iuam the trees grow well, but as they do not spread spontaneously they are found only near villages and houses where they have )>een planted, and on the sites of al>andoned ranch oh.

This plant is a great favorite with the natives. They plant it in their gardens, propagating it by cuttings, which readily take root. I have never seen it form fruit on the island. It takes its local name from the great, distance to which the aromatic odor of its flowers is carried. On going home 1 could always tell at a distance of two blocks whether nr not there was a boquet of Jfi. 1790-93. None of the species currently referred to the genus Pergularia was contained in the original Pergularia of Linmcus.

Leaves alternate, clustered toward the ends of the branches, short-j>etioled, ohovate from a cordate but very narrow base, 1\"> to 20 cm. long, usually softly hairy when voting, glabrous or hairy when adult, with 2 glandular depressions near the base of the midrib on the under side which are often obscure or wanting; petiole t> to IN mm. long; flowers small, spicate; spikes .solitary, axillary, simple, gray or rusty tomen- tose, the upper flowers male, the lower hermaphrodite, the bracts minute at the base of each flower, soon deciduous; calyx tul>e produced alwivc the ovary with valvatc triangular lobes, .simple; fruit- 2.5 to 3.N cm. long, ellipsoid, slightly compressed so as to show two ridges, finally glabrous. A very common tree in Guam, often growing near the shore, but also found inland. The kernels of the fruit are of a fine almond-like consistency and flavor. The crows (Cort'tts biibaryi) are very fond of them, and the natives cat them as delicacies either fresh or candied. The bark and leaves are astringent, and contain tannin. In India they are mixed with iron salts to form a black pigment, with which the natives in certain localities color their teeth and make ink. This species is an excellent shade tree. It is of wide tropical distribution and is often planted for ornament and for the sake of its nuts. It has been introduced into Hawaii and the natives have applied to it the Polynesian name for Odopiti/llu/n iiwphyllum (kamanu, or kamani) owing to the appearance of its foliage, which from a distance looks somewhat like that of the latter species. It is easily propagated from the seed. The wood is hard and of a reddish color, the sap wood lighter colored than the heart wood. In Guam it is used for troughs, carts, and posts, and if \"daog\" wood (Cnlnpfoilfum inophifllitm) can not be obtained it is used for making cart wheels, though it is inferior to that species in toughness and durability.

It is a small tree with a bare stem which generally rises to a height of about 2 meters before branching, and reaches a height of 5 or 6 meters. Sometimes, however, under good conditions of moisture, soil, and situation it grows higher. The tree is cauliflorous; that is, the flowers spring forth from the trunk and older branches. 9773\u201405 25 386 USEFUL PLANTS OF GUAM Leaves large, undivided, smooth, broad, pointed, ami of u thin texture; of a reddish color ami hanging limp from the 1 tranches when young, but soon tinning green and Incoming firm; flowers produced from adventitious buds under the Itark, usually at the \"eyes,\" or joints marked by the scars of fallen leaves, small, growing in clusters or solitary, usually only one of a cluster developing into fruit ; calyx 5-parted, often of a pinkish color; petals 5, yellowish, concave at the base and having a strap-like appendage at the tip; stamens 10, united at the base into a cup, 5 without anthers and the other o alternating with them bearing 2 double-celled anthers each; style thread-like, terminating in a 5-cleft stigma; fruit somewhat like a cucumber in shape, 15 to 25 cm. long, yellow or reddish, longitudinally ribbed, the rind thick and warty, leathery and tough, not splitting when ripe, 5-celled, and containing many seeds in a soft butter-like pulp of a pleasant sweetish-acid flavor; seeds compressed, some- what almond-shaped, with a thin, pale, reddish-brown, fragile skin or shell, cover- ing an oily, aromatic, bitter kernel, which consists mostly of the crumpled cotyledons. If taken from the pod the seed soon loses its vitality. It is consequently difficult to transport it to distant countries unless in a germinating condition or in rijie jxkIs, which, if kept cool, will l;ist ten days or perhaps two weeks. Cacao must be grown in sheltered situations. The best soil is that of valleys made by the decomposition of volcanic rocks and containing organic matter, as at Santa Rosa, Yigo, and Mahiguag in the northern part of the island of Guam, and alluvial deposits along the banks of streams, as in the valleys of llig and Tarofofo, on the east coast. Considerable depth is necessary, as the tree has a long taproot. The trees will not bear exposure to the brisk trade winds, which are almost constantly blowing in Guam. Whole plantations are sometimes blasted by the bagnios, or hurricanes, which visit the island. The seeds are planted fresh from the pods in semcnteras, or nurseries. They are taken from the I test and largest pods, which are picked from the hest-hearing trees jKM'fectly ripe and kept for a week or ten days. On opening the pod it is not unusual to find that the seeds have already begun to germinate. The best pods are those growing on the trunk, and from them the largest see*I should lie selected. They are placed in the ground ahuut 1 inch Indow the surface, so that the point where each seed was attached to the placenta is lowermost, thus avoiding a crooked stem and taproot, which are very delicate and easily injured in transplanting. The rows are about 25 cm. apart, with the seed set at intervals of about 10 cm. They sprmit in a few days and in a few weeks' time they are ready for transplanting. The best time for transplanting is the beginning of the rainy season. Great care must then l>e taken, as a slight, injury to the taproot will kill the plant. The plants given to the writer by Mr. David I laughs in Honolulu were grown from seed planted in pots. A very good way to propagate them is to plant them in bamhoo joints, which may be filled with good tine earth am I sunk in the ground. When ready for transplanting the bamlioo is split and the ball of earth surrounding the tender roots left intact. Sometimes'the seeds are planted on the site chosen for the plantation, so that trans- planting will not be necessary. In this case the ground is cleared and straight rows 4 to 5 meters apart marked out by lines. The rows may lie a little closer together than this in places where the cacao docs not send out very long branches, and (> meters apart where the soil is deep and rich, taking care to plant the seeds in one row opposite the middle of the interval of the row next to it. The position of each hill is indicated by a stake, around which 3 or 4 seeds are planted about 20 cm. apart. All the seeds may grow, yet only the most thrifty one is allowed to remain, the rest being either pulled up and thrown auay or carefully removed with ft ball ol earth attached to the roots and planted in the places where seeds have failed to sprout, or set out in another field, as in the case of plants grown in sementeras. In clearing land for planting cacao a few trees are sometimes left for shade, except in moist valleys, where they are not necessary. :V. - N , H. J ,X Pi ATE LXVII. THEUtiHOM A CACAO, CHOCOLATE PLANT. ( iliancwtt anp-pah) grows readily, and soon forms hedges or thickets of a good height, which servo as excellent wind-breaks. The plantation must Ik; kept free from weeds. especially while the plants are still young. In Guam the weeds are kept down with a thrust hoe, or fusiiio.'( Rows of taro or bananas are often planted between those of the cacao, and left while the plants are still young. The bananas not only produce fruit, but, growing readily and rapidly, they act as shade plants to the tender young cacao. As the cacao matures, these plants are removed. The custom of planting shade trees, called \"madre-cacao,\" in not so prevalent in Guam as in America;'* but in exposed situations trees of galtgab (I'Jiyfhrma quick-growing trees\u2014may be planted to shade the plants, care being taken to keep the lower boughs cut off, so as not to interfere with the growth of the cacao. In many parts of the island where the soil is thin, with a substratum of coral, or where the soil is poor, the cacao should be planted in holes 2 feet in depth and in diameter, filled with good rich soil. This method is called \" holing,\" and is used in many tropical countries for other plants as well as for cacao. Dead weeds and the refuse from the pods after the seeds have been taken out form an excellent manure, and should lie placed about the trees or buried near their roots. This practice, how- ever, should not be followed if any pods show evidence of disease. Jn such an event all infected pods should tie carefully burned. Only one stem is allowed to grow until the tree barf reached the height of a meter, after which three main branches are allowed to remain. The plant should lie kept free from suckers, which sometimes sprout out even after the main branches have appeared. In about three years from planting the trees will flower, but it is best to remove the flowers from young trees, as it is injurious to them to bear fruit before the fourth or fifth year. In Guam the trees bear fruit almost continuously, but there are two principal crops each year. The fruit is then gathered in quantities, some of the best pods selected for seed, and the rest of the seeds are dried and stored or made at once into chocolate. .No cacao is exported, except, perhaps, a little sent by natives to friends in Manila or given to people leaving the island, as is the custom in Guam. In gathering the pods the stalks should V>e cut halfway between the pod and the tree, care being taken not to tear the bark, as is often done if the pod be removed by twisting; for it is in the bark, at the base of the old i>eduncle that the adven- titious buds push forth which produce the crop of the following year. The beans are freed from pulp and gummy matter, dried in the sun, parched, and ground on stone slabs called \"nictates\" with a cylindrical stone rolling-pin called a\"mano,\" just as maize is ground for making tortillas. The ground paste is formed into balls or lozenge-shaped disks, each large enough to make one cup of chocolate. Chocolate as made in Guam is thickened with Hour or arrowroot. It is of fine flavor and is not adulterated in any way, except by the addition of sugar and flour. The natives scorn imported chocolate, saying that it tastes like medicine. The custom of chocolate drinking is universal among them. They drink it in the late afternoon, serving it quite hot, and offering it to visitors as a matter of etiquette, often accompanying it with sponge cake or poundcake, which they have been taught to make by foreigners, and which they call \"keke.\" Cacao beans are sometimes kept in jars and allowed to \"sweat\" or undergo a sort of fermentation, which improves their flavor, but this custom is not universal. Many families, after having dried the beans in the sun, keep them until required for use, when they toast them as we do coffee, grind them on the family metate, and make them into chocolate. Chocolate made from the newly ground bean is especially rich and aromatic. \u00ab Roe Gardens. ftSee Cook, Shade in Coffee Culture, U. S. Dept. Agr., Div. Botany, Bull. No. 25, p. 8, 1901. 388 USEFUL PLANTS OF 01!AM* The cacao plantations of Guam suffer greatly from the ravages of the brown, or Norway, rat (Mux rftru/fKmus), which overruns the island and is a great pest. Them; animals are immoderately fond of the Wans, and sometimes destroy whole drops. The trees are comparatively short lived, often beginning to die at the top when 10 years old, and are subject to the attack of boring insects. On this account and on account of the sensitiveness of the trees to hurricanes, which are not rare in Guam, cacao is not cultivated extensively, the natives preferring to devote their energies to clearing land for the longer-lived and hardier coconutw, which yield good and certain returns. In places where conditions of soil and moisture are favorable for cacao culture, it is recommended that belts of forest W left as a protection from wind. Where the forest has been destroyed, artiJicial wind-breaks may Ik1 formed by plant- ing trees and wild yams, which quickly form a solid matting of vegetation. If leguminous trues are planted they will undoubtedly be a benefit to the soil a.* storars of nitrogen. 1{ K l'\"Klt Majagua do Florida (Cuba); Palo de jaguera (Porto Rico).

It is one of the commonest trees of Guam. This tree is of very wide distribution. It ranges from tropical Asia, Africa, and Madagascar across the Pacitic to Hawaii and Faster Island, and also occurs in tropical America and the West Indies. The identity of its name in islands so widely separated as Rarotonga and Hawaii is interesting. References: Thcitpcsia populnea (L.) Roland.; Ann. S. /. \u00a3. 1807.

Indian corn is now the principal food staple of the natives of Guam. It was brought by the Jesuit missionaries from Mexico nearly two centuries ago, It imme- diately Itecame the principal source of food for the mission and the soldiers/' and in a few years was adopted by the natives. It is now planted by every family on the island. Two crops a year are produced upon the island. The first, called \"law primcras,\" planted after the first showers of April, or in May or June, is harvested in August, September, or Octol>er. The second, called the \"aventurero,\" planted in September, Octo)>er, or November, is harvested four months after planting. Low and moist situations must be selected for the aventurero, as well as for all other plantings except the primcras; for as a rule crops planted on high land in the dry season suffer from drought and are lit for nothing but forage. In certain low valleys which are flooded during the rainy season and Income dry in December maize is planted in January, February, or March and harvested four months later. Immediately after having been gathered it must be shelled and dried in the sun, to prevent molding. At times the streets of Agafia are so thickly covered with mats of drying corn that it is dillicult to make ones way through them without step- ping on the corn. After having been thoroughly dried the grain is stored in earthen jars (tinajas) having a capacity of about 10 gantas (48 liters). This is necessary on account of weevils which infest the island. Under good condition (>0 tinajas of shelled corn are obtained from one hectare of land,& which is approximately equiva- lent to 38 bushels to the acre. Only one variety of maize is successfully grown on the island. It is soft-grained and white, resembling that which is most common in Mexico. Attempts have Wen made to introduce sweet corn, pop corn, and several varieties of Held corn from the United States, but they have been failures. Maize is usually prepared for food in the form of tortillas, after the Mexican manner. The grain is put to soak overnight with a certain quantity of lime, which softens it ami loosens the husk. It is then washed in cold water and rolled uii an inclined stone slab called \"metate\" to a paste, by means of a stone rolling-pin called a \"niano.\" Iioth the metate and mano are Mexican intrusions, having found their way to Guam with the maize itself, and are also used for grinding cacao Wans and nuts of O/wm rircinal/V, in making choco- late and tortillas or fadan. The tortillas are like very thin Hat cakes. They are baked on a griddle or iron plate and are browned on both sides. When fresh they are very palatable, having a flavor of parched corn and a crisp consistency. When cold, however, they become tough and leathery, and are only tit to feed to animals.
