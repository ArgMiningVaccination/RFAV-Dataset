My goal is to help people recognize how their bodies communicate internally and externally. I teach yoga and meditation to help you transform stress and anxiety in your body while promoting strength, flexibility, and balance. I believe that a regular yoga practice combined with meditation and mindful living will help develop a state of well-being and improve health. I have seen many people dealing with auto-immune disorders, cancer, and aging take their bodies back and enjoy the simple joy and freedoms of everyday life. They learn to relax and experience those \"deeper dimensions\" of themselves and connect with that compassionate and loving source. I have seen their confidence and enthusiasm return and their lives become more fully integrated. I have been teaching yoga since 1994. In the past eleven years, I have taught group classes and worked privately with cancer patients as they rehabilitate from surgery and treatments. Trauma Recovery I am a part of the \"TIMBo Collective,\" a collective of mind/body teachers, yogis, educators, mental health professionals, and activists working through partnerships with local and global organizations to create transformation from the inside out for women suffering from trauma and or experiencing stress, anxiety, and depression. TIMBo is the pathway any and all of us can follow as we journey back to our true selves. The TIMBo method empowers women from all walks of life. We educate and provide women with tools and knowledge to create change in their families, communities, and work space, and we support TIMBo change-makers in making the impact they are passionate about in their world. TIMBo Trauma Recovery Group Classes - The TIMBo classes are taught online via Zoom. This format brings women together from around the world. - Each participant will receive the TIMBo workbook that will be used exclusively in the first two modules, 1.0 and 2.0. - There are 8 classes in each of the modules. - Each class is 1.5 hrs. - It is not unusual for women to repeat the modules going ever deeper into their own personal experiences. - The cost of each module is $350. The workbook book is an additional $15.00 + shipping. Note: shipping costs are higher outside the United States and can take longer to receive. *Note: There are sponsors for women in treatment for cancer in certain areas of the country as well as private sponsors for those needing financial help. Please let me know if you need assistance. TIMBo - What to Expect The classes involve reading, discussions, journaling, breathing exercises, yoga, and deep relaxation. All participation is voluntary and women are not expected to participate in anything they feel uncomfortable doing. For instance, some women may choose not to read or share, they may not want to close their eyes, or do a certain movement in yoga. We understand that everyone is different and we honor their personal needs. The format is predictable and emotes a feeling of empowerment and safety. The Importance of Conventional Medicine and Natural Healing There is a very good chance that, if you clicked on this page, you or someone you know has been diagnosed with a condition or illness that needs medical treatment. You may still be in the discovery stage of your health diagnosis and what should be done about it. Or you might be further along in your treatment and wondering what else you can do to help your body support the healing process. You may have come through your healing journey and your goal now is to do all you can to stay healthy. Wherever you find yourself right now, it is important to take into consideration your \"Whole Person.\" The definition of healing is \"to Become Whole.\" I am talking about more than just conventional medicine. In fact, conventional medicine has been conducting many studies on why some people heal and live long and healthy lives while others with similar health profiles do not. They experience re-occurrences and have totally different outcomes. Studies have shown that, rather than isolating patients during their treatments, bringing them together so they feel connected and can learn from and support each other has a much more positive effect. They found that support groups and centers for healing that offer alternative therapies, exercise programs, art therapy, prayer groups, meditation, sound healing, and large doses of nature made a profound difference in an individual's recovery and continued health. That is why surrounding yourself with healing support and believing that healing can happen is very important to achieve homeostasis. But you might ask, can this help my recovery? Finding out that you have a major health challenge can be very stressful ... some might even say traumatic. The mind can perceive this as a threat to our life. This activates our fear response and makes our nervous system send us messages that we are in danger. The fear of an uncertain future can cause anxiety which is a form of fear. This can cause our fear response to get stuck on high. We feel or sense this fear response in our bodies. It can make our legs and arms shake, our bowels feel weak, and give us knots in our stomach. Fear can make our chest feel tight and our heart pound. It can create tension in our neck, jaw, and shoulders. We may feel like it's all too much to take in and we can't think clearly. Fear can make us feel that all we can do is curl up and sleep or fear can make us lie awake at night, unable to sleep. This is the body's response to what happens when our sympathetic nervous system (fight-flight-freeze) is activated or stuck on high. The most important thing to understand about our bodies is that the best healing happens when we are in a relaxed or a \"parasympathetic\" state which supports health, growth, and restoration. This is why it is so imperative to incorporate activities and modalities that help reduce stress and tension. They help soothe the sympathetic nervous system and help to de-activate or regulate the body back to a parasympathetic response. Activities such as walking, exercise, Qi Gong, Yoga, meditation, Tai Chi, breathing exercises, chanting, and Energy Medicine (tapping) can help the body self-regulate. Healing modalities such as massage, reflexology, Reiki, acupuncture, vibrational sound therapy, facials, and healing touch have long-lasting positive effects on our whole person. Regular participation in these activities and services will help establish neurons and neural pathways that like, seek, and respond more quickly to self-regulation.
