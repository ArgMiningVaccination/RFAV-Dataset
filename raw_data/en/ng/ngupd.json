McMillen1*, Lindsay K. Campbell1, and Erika S. Svendsen1 Planting trees to mark the passing of events and people is a longstanding tradition around the world. To better understand the contemporary practices of memorialization through planting, we examine livingmemorials created in response to the events of September 11, 2001. As an extension of the U.S. Forest ServiceLiving Memorials Project, we reviewed existing data (n \u00bc787 sites) and identified 223 sites where stewards mentioned planting 102 kinds of flora. Oaks ( Quercus spp.) were most commonly mentioned (17% of sites), while 75% of plants/trees were named at only 1% or fewer sites, underscoring their diversity. We also visited 21sites to document their flora and conduct interviews with stewards (n \u00bc34 stewards from 33 sites; 13 interviews were conducted by phone). We find that the symbolism of flora plays a role in continuing to keep memories alive at living memorial sites through flora traditionally used in death and memorial contexts; throughmore localized symbols particular to the sites as conveyed through the meanings of color, habit, and number; andthrough a newer symbol we identify, the callery pear (Pyrus calleryana) survivor tree. We also find that the community-based planting practices in public space are meaningful themselves, as they can serve as amechanism to promote healing and recovery for communities and sometimes also promote the co-recovery ofsocial-ecological systems . Keywords: living memorial, ethnobotany, 9/11, New York City, survivor tree Introduction Since ancient times, flora around the world have been imbued with potent symbolism of life and death (Russell 1981). Across cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries, their planting, harvest, and use marks life-stage events and connects people to a world beyond their own. Flora also serve as importantmarkers of memory, such that they have ''become a landscape requirement in contemporary popular cultures of commemoration'' (Sather-Wagstaff 2015:236) and memorial plantings have a complexrelationship with time. They encourage us to look toward the future since they are expected to grow, but at the same time they reflect the past, evoking memories. Here, we focus on flora in living memorials, landscaped spacescreated to honor and remember individuals, places, and events (Svendsen andCampbell 2010). 1USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station, NYC Urban Field Station, 431 Walter Reed Rd, Bayside, common flora in memorials worldwide; however, their meanings can vary cross-culturally and over time. For example, Plumeria rubra (plumeria) is traditionally associated with death in Central America, its native region where it is commonly planted in cemeteries and its fragrant blossoms areused in funerary rituals. In Hawai 'i, where the tree is introduced, Plumeria was also planted in cemeteries until the 1940s, when the growth of the tourism industry expanded its use into celebratory and performance contexts (Staples and Herbst 2005). Its blossoms are fashioned into lei(garlands) which are worn by hula dancers and they are also given as symbols of appreciation, aloha (love), and honor. The act of planting itself can be symbolic without reference to a particular species. In the post-disturbance context (e.g., floods, earthquakes, terrorist attacks), tree planting can be an expression of recovery (Fisher et al. 2015; Tidball 2014) and ''an important part of 'memory work''' (Svendsen and Campbell 2014:342; see also Young 1994). Although some research describes the symbolism of plants in ritual funeral settings and cemeteries today (Dafni et al. 2006) and in the past (Dreslerova \u00b4and Mikula \u00b4s 2010), very little research identies the plants used in contemporary memorial contexts and even less is written about the reasons for selecting particular flora (cf. Sather-Wagstaff 2015). This is surprising considering the widespread practice of creating living memorials across space and time (Young1994), especially given the hundreds of memorials created in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S. (9/11) (Svendsen and Campbell 2010). The work presented here is an extension of the Living Memorials Project(LMP) created by the U.S. Forest Service following 9/11. Our purpose here is to understand the role of flora in contemporary memorialization through examples from LMP. Flora Traditionally Associated with Death, Afterlife, and Memorializing Long-lived, Coppicing, and Evergreen Flora Trees that are long-lived, large, and/or that coppice have traditionally symbolized the continuation of life after death and a means to maintain connections to the deceased in multiple cultural contexts. In the nal path the dead body and the tomb; these spiny succulent shrubs are said to ''grow with the spirit of the dead'' (Teng \u00a8o and von Heland 2014:336). In South India, middle-caste Nayars bury urns containing their relatives at the foot of jack-fruit trees ( Artocarpus heterophyllus ) which represent the life-span of the family (Uchiyamada 1998). Across the Han empire, ancient memorial ancestral shrines were engraved with a tree, likely birchleaf pear or sweet pear tree ( Pyrus betualaefolia ), which represented long life (Brashier 2005). In the Celtic region, ancient (Hooke 2010) and recent associations of the European yew ( Taxus baccata ) regard it as ''one of the most powerful symbols of resurrection and eternal life'' because of its ''seeming ability to come back to life after dying'' (Drury 1994:102). The yew is also widely featured in twentieth century ChristianMcMILLEN et al. 2 Vol. 37, No. 1cemeteries (Gough 1996). In England, the evergreen bay tree ( Laurus nobilis )i s another tree ''long regarded as a symbol of resurrection, probably because anapparently withered tree has the capability of reviving from its roots'' (Drury1994:102). Pine trees ( Pinus spp.), which are evergreen and also have long life, large stature, and coppice, have similarly long been associated with vitality and life after death. In Scotland, burials of ancient chiefs and warriors are often foundunder pine trees (Cockerell 2008). Given the association of coppicing with eternallife, it follows then that the cypress ( Cupressus spp.), which does not coppice, is a symbol death (Whittick 1960). Mediterranean cyprus ( Cupressus sempervirens ) are planted in Muslim cemeteries of Northern Israel as a symbol of mourning(Dafni et al. 2006), a symbol that may date to pre-Christian times, as suggested bytheir presence in the tomb gardens of Pompeii (Jashemski 1979). Mighty Oaks Oak trees are also large in stature, long-lived, and coppice; however, they stand out in their widespread symbolism and use across Asia, Europe, and NorthAmerica. The broad distribution and elaborate species differentiation (approx-imately 600) of the Quercus genus likely influence their importance across the northern hemisphere. Logan (2005:21) unequivocally states that ''no tree has been more useful to human beings than the oak.'' In addition to being important forlumber, shade, and food, Western cultures strongly associate these iconic treeswith virtue and majesty (Hageneder 2005), ''sacred[ness] ...strength, longevity, and endurance'' (Sather-Wagstaff 2015:246). Lore from Ancient Britain and Germany associates the oak with ''kindness and nurturing but also the ability toght when needed'' (Hageneder 2005). In ancient Indo-European cultures, oakwas most commonly associated with temples (Cusack 2011). Over the ages, oaks have been used in funerary and cemetery settings. People were buried in oak cofns in the Bronze Age and they were buried in oak ships inthe time of Vikings (Logan 2005). In the 1800s, gravestones in rural U.S. cemeteries began featuring oak trees to represent immortality and acorns to represent life and renewal. At the same time, heroes' groves (rather than burials)in Germany featured one oak tree for every fallen soldier (Sather-Wagstaff 2015).Today, war memorial oak groves in the U.S. are found in Texas (Angelo State University 2015), Louisiana (Louisiana State University 2015), Kentucky (Kentucky Department of Travel and Tourism 2015), and Illinois (Oak RidgeCemetery 2009). Oaks also continue to be featured in civilian memorials(Williams 2010), including the National September 11 Memorial in New YorkCity (NYC), dedicated in 2011 (Figure 1). Although the National September 11 Memorial & Museum's website explains that the oaks were selected for their shade, durability, and leaf color (National September 11 Memorial & Museum 2015a), the oaks are also powerful symbols. The oak tree has been recognized as an icon of American heritage since it wasdesignated as the national tree in 2004 (Arbor Day Foundation 2004), and itssymbolism continues to be reinforced and expanded. The museum's online store features molded leaves from the memorial's swamp white oaks ( Quercus bicolor ) fashioned as souvenir key chains and that ''serve as graceful andJOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY 2017 3hopeful symbols of life and longevity'' (National September 11 Memorial & Museum 2015b). Tree Architecture and Growth Habits The architecture and growth habits of trees can suggest death and mourning. In ancient Hindu mythology, strangler gs ( Ficus spp.) are portrayed as death trees (Russell 1981), likely due to their aerial roots that eventually envelop and often kill their host trees. The weeping willow tree ( Salix babylonica ) has multiple associations, but most commonly represents mourning. Willows ( Salix spp.) are featured in multiple legends, Shakespearean tragedies, and biblical references\u2014 including Psalm 137 about the captive Jews who remembered Zion, wept sittingby the rivers of Babylon, and hung their ''harps upon the willows.'' Willows were also popular in English grave monuments and funerary plaques in the mid- nineteenth century due to wilting branches and mournful demeanor'' (Gough 1996:73). Willows continue be popular representations of mourning today (Halamish and Hermoni 2007). Contemporary Living Memorials: Their Roots and Branches The roots of contemporary living memorials can be traced in part to memorial groves. Some feature specic trees to help narrate the events being memorialized, often on or near the grounds where people perished. New Zealand's World War II memorial, opened in 1953, is an elaborate assemblagethat symbolizes the diverse battle sites where members of the 19th Battalion died: Figure 1. Memorial Grove of 400 swamp white oaks ( Quercus bicolor ) at the September 11 National Memorial in Manhattan, NYC. (McMillen)McMILLEN et al. 4 Vol. 37, No. 1Atlantic Cedars from the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, Spanish Pines from the coastal Mediterranean, Olives portraying Greece, Crete, andItaly, and the Black Pines of Central and Southern Europe. Clumps of local native species represent the 19th men now on New Zealand soil. (Cloke and Pawson 2008:115) The Oklahoma City Memorial, established in 1997 to memorialize the lives lost in the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, includes a ''rescue orchard.'' Its trees represent the diversity of rst responders to the bombing, from the native redbud or Oklahoma state tree ( Cercis Canadensis ), to introduced varieties including the ) and al. 2011:176). Contemporary vernacular memorials are relatively small landmarks, often identifying the site where a loved one died due to a vehicle crash or drowning. These can be seen as branches that differentiate contemporary memorialization practices. Family members and friends typically create and steward these roadside and waterfront sites, which have a home-made aesthetic often featuring flowers (live or plastic) and/or a cross that may be embellished with the name of the deceased and artifacts (e.g., stuffed animals, statuettes, candles). Like shrines, the sites are respected as sacred and they venerate loved ones, in some cases with a hero or martyr-like status. Research on roadside vernacular memorials in the United States (Doss 2010) and Australia (Collins and Opie 2010) primarily highlights sociopolitical aspects of geography and identity, not botanical aspects. As seen in formalized settings such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. and in spontaneous, informal settings such as the roadside site in Paris where Princess Diana died in a vehicle crash in 1997 (Doss 2010), and the Place de la Republique in Paris\u2014which was adorned to commemorate the victims of a terrorist bombing in 2016\u2014shrine-like, vernacular memorials and offerings for the victims of 9/11 flourished in Union Square and other locationsthroughout Lower Manhattan immediately following the plane crashes at the Figure 2. Commemorabilia placed at 9/11 memorial wall bearing names of deceased at the Shrine of St. Joseph in Edison, NJ. (McMillen)JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY 2017 5World Trade Center. Many visitors to 9/11 living memorials today continue to leave commemorabilia\u2014personalized offerings to their loved ones (Figure 2). Another potent symbol that emerges in 9/11 memorials includes the ''survivor tree.'' Because of the extreme disturbances they have endured, these trees become compelling symbols of recovery for communities seeking to respond and reconnect following a tragedy. They are found on battleelds(Gough 1996), atomic bomb sites (Conti and Petersen 2008), areas affected bynatural disasters (Matsuda 2011), and terrorist attacks (Veil et al. 2011). TheOklahoma City Memorial features an American elm ( Ulmus americana ) survivor tree as the site's ''most profound symbol of spirituality and hope'' (Veil et al.2011:178). The online gift shop offers seedlings from the tree that can be ''plantedas personal symbols of survival'' (Veil et al. 2011:175) and commemorativeornaments molded from its leaves serve ''as a reminder that the spirit of the cityand this nation will not be defeated; our deeply rooted faith sustains us''(Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation 2014). This survivor tree inspiredthe 9/11 Memorial Director of Design and Construction to ''repatriate'' the 9/11survivor tree to the 9/11 Memorial plaza (Vega 2015) (Figure 3). Although thiscallery pear ( Pyrus calleryana ) is not marked, visitors seek it out amidst the uniformity of the 400 oaks. In both Oklahoma City and NYC, the survivor trees are seen as symbols of surviving and thriving despite the terrorist attacks. Beyond the symbolism the trees have for their respective memorials, the propagation and exchange of survivor trees across sites of tragedy representsmutual support and unity. Both memorials propagate their survivor trees, haveexchanged them with each other, and distribute them to other survivors oftragedy. The propagation and exchange of survivor trees emerges as a compellingmetaphor for new life and tenacity, a topic worthy of further discussion butbeyond the scope of this article. We now turn toward community-based livingmemorials to 9/11 to better understand the roles of flora in contemporarycommemoration. In what ways are flora co-creators of memory? How do the Figure 3. Visitors to 9/11 National Memorial listen to staff recount the story of the survivor tree. (McMillen)McMILLEN et al. 6 Vol. 37, No. 1memorials call upon traditional symbols and/or inspire the creation of new symbols? What other factors influence the creation and stewardship of livingmemorials? Methods To honor those affected by 9/11, LMP was initiated by the U.S. Forest Service at the request of Congress. Initially, the project included funding to support communities in creating their living memorials, but has since become a longitudinal research project to document the creation and evolution of livingmemorials and to deepen a social-ecological understanding of community- managed green space. The work we describe here draws from our LMP database of 787 living memorials and in-depth data gathered from 2002-2004 (n \u00bc117 sites) through semi-structured interviews, site observations, and photographs. These document the social and biophysical characteristics of memorialsincluding: purpose, the events held on site, if the site is considered sacred and why, the approximate number of trees on site, the approximate number of new trees planted or planned, and names of trees. (For full results from the 117interviews, see Svendsen and Campbell 2010.) Here we report on follow-up ethnobotanical research conducted in two phases during 2015. To strengthen the rigor and reliability of the research, we triangulate existing data (described above) with follow-up interview tran- scripts, eld notes, and photographs. First, we created a list by reviewing the LMP database for all mentions of flora planted and the reasons for selecting them. Existing interview transcripts and photographs provided additionaldetail and context for the resulting summary lists of trees and plants. Second, following procedures of prior informed consent, we conducted site visits and interviews (July-October 2015) on site at 21 living memorials and via 13telephone interviews with stewards from an additional 12 sites (September- October 2015) located primarily in the NYC metropolitan area (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut) and one in Maryland. Researchers invitedparticipants based on in-depth and long-term relationships among stewards and researchers (14 years in most cases) and stewards (n \u00bc34) participated based on their availability. These relationships and the existing data provide astrong foundation for understanding the signicance, meaning, and impor- tance of the memorials which were explored in follow up semi-structured interviews (Lofland and Lofland 1984). We asked stewards about changes tothe site and its stewardship, the flora present and why they were chosen, achievements, and challenges. Additionally, we noted and photographed the flora to triangulate with other data sets and to better understand the botanicalcharacter of the sites. For logistical reasons and out of respect for the sacred and sensitive nature of the sites, voucher specimens were not collected. The identication of flora was based on information provided by stewards,authoritative texts (Barnard 2002; Petrides 2008), and consultation with specialists.JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY 2017 7Findings: Patterns and Purposes of Flora in 9/11 Memorials While living memorials to 9/11 are found throughout the country, the greatest density is in the NYC metropolitan area. In response to the urgent desireto respond to the loss, these community-based living memorials wereconstructed shortly after 9/11, long before a national memorial at the WorldTrade Center site was dedicated in 2011. Most living memorials were initiated byindividuals, informal groups, and civic organizations rather than by governmentagencies. They vary greatly in form, from single trees to forests, and involved therededication of existing green space and the creation of new green space. Theyare located in forests, ocean front, parks, community gardens, town centers,found space (e.g., trafc islands, vacant lots), and on school and hospitalgrounds. They honor victims from among the nearly 3,000 who perished as wellas responders and survivors. Because the severity of the destruction meant thatonly a small fraction of victims' family members received any physical remains,in many cases, these sites are revered as gravesites. In the following section, wereport our ndings on the patterns in flora composition seen across sites and thestewards' explanations for planting them. Flora as Symbols of Life and Healing as the Basis for Living Memorials As has been documented around the world, flora at these living memorials are seen as symbols of life that connect to a larger reality beyond the space andtime we occupy as individuals. A woman who lost her husband, a NYCreghter performing a rescue at the World Trade Center, explained how the actof planting pine seedlings at the memorial in Sterling Forest (Tuxedo, NY) was''very healing in and of itself because it was a living thing.'' Family membersmarked the specic trees they planted for their loved ones by adorning them withornaments, drawings, notes, and rock designs. Similarly, a steward at the Gardenof Healing memorial site in the Staten Island Botanical Garden (New York City,NY) explained: ...nature is one of the things greater than all of us. It's always here, as long as the world is here, nature is here. Plants grow. Maybe the idea ofreturning to the soil and then things visibly growing from the soil givesus the sense of continuity of the Earth and people ...Putting us in touch with our own niteness and our continuity. A reman who helped plant trees at the same site commented: I think people in general, the whole world, associates greening, trees, shrubs, and flowers with something very peaceful ...It's only natural that you come to a place like this to have a reflection on something thataffected you. That's just the way we are as people. Just the forest, thegreen, the beautiful flowers have an effect on us. It's the natural way ofdoing things. The primary steward from the Healing Garden of the Federated Garden Clubs of New York State in Staten Island reflected on the trees they planted and said, ''I'veMcMILLEN et al. 8 Vol. 37, No. 1spent many beautiful times under those trees with people who all for some reason feel, you know. They expressed to me sadness. I didn't ask them to ...it just ...that's the power of living things.'' As has been documented with roadside shrines to vehicle accident victims (Einwalter 2007), designing, maintaining, andvisiting these memorials is part of the mourning process that allows survivors theopportunity to ''work through the loss'' (Collins and Opie 2010). Most Common Flora across Sites A subset of sites (n \u00bc223) from the database had records of stewards mentioning 102 different kinds (or generic categories) of plants and trees. Theseare primarily flora that were planted for the living memorials, but also includesthose previously existing on site. The names stewards used ranged from broad categories (e.g., evergreen, perennials) to specic species such as '' Cornus kousa'' and varietals such as ''Mount Vernon Red Maple,'' demonstrating a continuumfrom general to specialized knowledge. Guided by the respondents, most ofwhom used terms at the common folk level versus the specic species level, wefollowed principles of folk taxonomy (Berlin et al. 1974) of generic, specic, andvarietal. When specic taxa were mentioned, we collapsed them into their generic categories for the purpose of analysis. (A list of all plants and trees mentioned and the number of mentions for each is found in Supplemental Table 1.) Thisdecision also follows our interest in understanding if any specic flora arerepresented across a majority of sites. Patterns emerged indicating the most salient categories of flora mentioned but none were in the majority of sites. Oaks were the most common, with 17%(41) of sites. This includes the specic oaks: sawtooth, willow, red, shumar, live,burr, Daimyo, white, English, and American (all Quercus spp.), which we collapsed into their generic ''oak'' category. Maples ( Acer spp.) were also commonly mentioned at 14% (33) of sites. Specic maples mentioned included: red, Norway, silver, sugar, Manitoba, Amur, and sunset, as well as varietals\u2014Mount Vernon Red, Japanese Red, Green Mountain Sugar, and Crimson King. Allwere counted as their generic ''maple.'' Cherries ( Prunus spp.), mentioned at 8% (18) of sites, included the specics black, snow fountain, and weeping and thevarietal Weeping Higan Cherry. The only specic evergreen mentioned was Douglas r ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ). Otherwise, sixteen other site representatives simply mentioned they had, or had planted, evergreens. Dogwoods ( Cornus spp.), mentioned spp.), also mentioned at 15 sites, included white, red, scrub, Austrian, Loblolly, barrens, pitch, and the varietal Fastigiate White Pine. Across sites, composition is highly heterogeneous. Most flora (75% or n \u00bc77) were only named at 1% or less (three or fewer) of sites. The top mentioned floraare listed in Table 1. Number of Trees Symbolizing Lives Lost At some sites, the number of trees planted was more symbolic than the type of tree. At the New Jersey Living Memorial, A Grove of Remembrance, theoriginal goal was to plant 691 trees to memorialize the 691 New Jersey (NJ) livesJOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY 2017 9lost on 9/11, but the project surpassed its goal and hundreds more trees and perennials were planted at Liberty State Park. The design of the MarlboroTownship Living Memorial (NJ) included 15 dogwood trees, the state's ofcialmemorial tree, to honor the 14 who died from their community, plus one more to represent all the other victims and heroes. In An American Remembrance in the Manalapan Arboretum (NJ), 12 trees were planted to represent the 11 Manalapanresidents that died and the twelfth tree represents all of the remaining victims and heroes. They are regionally common trees, including tulip among others. At the Garden of Healing, the Federated Garden Clubs of Staten Island planted 78 smoke trees ( Cotinus sp.) for the 78 fallen re ghters from the borough. At the Richard Cudina Memorial (Lebanon, NJ), the chief steward (Cudina's widow)planted 16 Yoshino cherry trees ( Prunus 3yedoensis ) to represent the 16 deaths from their county. In Glen Rock (NJ), 11 flowering plums ( Prunus sp.) were planted for the 11 community members lost. Color Symbolizing Patriotism, Remembrance, and Peace Color can evoke emotions and the color of leaves and blossoms also played a role in the selection of flora for living memorials. Patriotic themes featuringannuals that are red, white, and blue were documented at multiple sites, including the West 104th St. Garden (NYC), the Memorial Courtyard in Binghamton, NY, the 9/11 Hometown Memorial in Babylon, NY, and EisenhowerPark American Patriot Garden in Nassau County, NY. Since annuals are ephemeral, they likely appear and disappear at other memorial sites, too. Through flower color and through other symbols, such as American flags andremnant steel from the World Trade Centers, sites that are not physicallyconnected share common themes of patriotism and unity. The yellow ribbon for remembrance was invoked as a reason for choosing yellow flowers. A steward at GRACE Memorial at Veteran's Park in Glen Rock (NJ)Table 1. Most mentioned flora types across 223 Living Memorials to 9/11. Categories No. mentions Percent sites Oak ( Quercus spp.) 41 3%McMILLEN et al. 10 Vol. 37, No. 1explained they display and distribute yellow roses ( Rosa spp.) annually at their 9/11 ceremony ''because [of the custom to] tie a yellow ribbon 'til you come back.'' An organizer of the Daffodil Project that distributes thousands of bulbs annually around NYC explained that she thought daffodils ( Narcissus spp.) were chosen, in part, because ''yellow is technically the color of remembrance.'' Drawing on anothertraditional association with color, one steward explained that the purple fringeplants (possibly Chionanthus virginicus ) at the Healing Garden of the Federated Garden Clubs of New York represent the bravery of the fallen remen, a nod to the purple heart, a military award given to the next of kin of an armed forces memberwho is killed in action or dies as a result of war wounds. Other sites featured flora with white flowers that bloom in the spring, which represented peace and the renewal of life for multiple stewards. White crape myrtle ( Lagerstroemia spp.) were planted ''to represent doves and symbolize peace'' at one site. At the Memorial of Remembrance at the Shrine of St Joseph(NJ), ''white pines [ Pinus strobus ] were selected because they symbolize peace in Native American culture and plants with white flowers were selected becausethey are seen as healing to the touch.'' The viewshed Memorial groves are located at distinct vantage points in each of NYC's ve boroughs where people observed the World Trade Center's destruction. Each site features white flowering redbuds(Cercis canadensis f. alba ), chosen both because they are hardy native trees and for their white blossoms that are ''uplifting and pure.'' The 9/11 Memorial Grove inBrooklyn's Prospect Park (NYC) features trees that flower white in the spring, including dogwood ( Cornus 3Celestial along a curving pathway at the end of a long, open meadow so that the ''grovefeels like it is hugging you'' in a subtle way. The temporality of color and memoryalso came into play with maples. Multiple stewards talked about how the flush ofred leaves in the fall marks the time of 9/11 and inspires reflection. Stature and Habit Symbolizing Tall Structures, Smoke, Weeping, and Reflection Across sites, stewards described how trees and plants were chosen because of the symbolism attributed to their stature. The plaque at the U.S. EPA Region IImemorial (Edison, NJ) explains that the selection of trees was based on their stature and number. Each of the trees [is] symbolic. Columnar Pin Oaks to represent the Twin Towers, Weeping Cherries are memorials to the suffering and sadness experienced as a result of the attacks, and three Hollies to symbolize thelost, living who suffered loss, and generations to come. Other sites also planted two tall columnar trees to represent the fallen Twin Towers. Pin oaks spp.) were among those chosen for that purpose. Seven of the 18 sites that listed cherry trees specied weeping cherries (Prunus spp.), which multiple stewards attributed to their mournful posture. Like weeping cherries, willows ( Salix spp.) ETHNOBIOLOGY 2017 11referred to their drooping stature as reflective and sullen. One steward said ''a Persian weeping willow was planted in memory of the tears, sorrow, and beauty of the lives that were lost.'' In the Staten Island Healing Garden, smoke trees werechosen because of the smoky appearance of their flowers (Figure 4), which symbolized the smoke encountered by the reghters at the crash site in Manhattan. Two ephemeral living memorial projects created by artists focused on planting sunflowers ( Helianthus spp.) around Manhattan because of their resilient, upright, sculpture-like, and cheerful nature. The organizer of the Sunflower Project NYC said: Like New Yorkers, sunflowers are tenacious, surviving and thriving in adverse conditions. Sunflowers improve the ground and air where they grow, attracting birds and butterflies. They make sense as one tall way to remember life and make it a bit better\u2014it's hard not to look up in their presence. The Suntowers project creator aimed to demonstrate how small things, like seeds, could turn into something even bigger than the sunflowers themselves, such as towers. His concept was to plant sunflower seeds along Manhattan's streets in an outline ten times larger than the actual World Trade Center towers. Survivor Trees We documented survivor trees at four sites. The Living Memorial Grove, initiated by NYC Department of Parks and Recreation staff, features ve Figure 4. A site steward (left) at the Healing Garden explains the symbolism of the flowering smoke trees (background) and knock-out roses (foreground) to a Forest Service researcher (right). (McMillen)McMILLEN et al. 12 Vol. 37, No. 1callery pear and linden ( Tilia sp.) trees that were rescued from the Ground Zero and replanted together at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge in Lower Manhattan. A steward described them as ''siblings that ...had borne this tragedy together and we didn't feel we had the right to separate them.'' He continues to bringvisitors to see the trees because they help tell an important part of the story ofrecovery. The other three sites planted callery pear saplings that were grown from seeds produced by the same tree that survived and was rescued from GroundZero and later re-planted on the same site after the 9/11 Memorial was created.As progeny of the tree that witnessed and endured the devastation, the seedlingsare laden with symbolism of resiliency and renewal. The one planted at the Garden of Healing in the Staten Island Botanical Garden was among the rst survivor tree offspring to be planted; however, in a twist of cruel irony, it did notsurvive its rst winter. (The survivor tree is one of multiple features that have notendured at that memorial, likely due to a combination of its large size, elaboratedesign, and reductions in the Botanical Garden staff.) The two other survivor trees we observed at the memorial in the Manalapan Arboretum (NJ) and at the September 11 Family Group Memorial (Brooklyn, NYC) (Figure 5) are thriving.Stewards from both sites expressed how proud they are to have survivor trees,which they feel connect them both to the site of the tragedy as well as to thebroader community of survivors. The tree helps tell their story of resilience andtenacity as survivors. Co-recovery of Social-Ecological Systems While the symbolism of flora at some memorial sites was described in literal terms, other stewards spoke about the symbolism of the process of restoring asite's ecological functions while promoting emotional recovery within the community as well. One of the reasons the particular site in Prospect Park (Brooklyn) was chosen for the 9/11 Memorial Grove is because it ''neededrestoration anyway.'' The memorial in Jersey City (NJ) consists of 10 acres wherehundreds of trees and perennials were planted to restore a former browneld siteat Liberty State Park. The designer of the Richard Cudina Memorial focuses most of her effort on the woodlands surrounding the built aspects of the memorial. She ''wants everything to be native'' and so she routinely removes non-nativeinvasive plants, protects native trees from deer browsing, and propagates andplants native trees. On Long Island (NY), at the beachfront Babylon HometownMemorial, the site coordinator from the Department of Environmental Control chose hardy, native, and naturalized perennials to stabilize the dunes and salt- tolerant, hardy trees to serve as a windbreak. His goal is to create a place thathonors the victims and their families while also restoring the native dune system.This restoration was done with extreme weather and coastal protection in mind;indeed, the memorial survived the winds and tides of Hurricane Sandy. A nal example is about an hour's drive from NYC: the Sterling Forest Arrow Lake Memorial (Tuxedo, NY), 80 acres of conservation land that are managed forpsycho-social and ecological recovery. Before 9/11, health professionals hadalready begun ''prescribing'' experiences there to support patients' recovery fromtrauma. Immediately following 9/11, staff implemented a program for FireJOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY 2017 13Department of New York families who lost loved ones at the World Trade Center. In a subsequent commemorative event, they planted white pine and spruceseedlings beneath dying hemlocks in dedication to those lost. A stewardexplained how planting was part of their bereavement process and it helpedthem feel connected to their loved ones. People just want to sit with and visit their tree quietly before they engage in socializing and comradery with other surviving family membersupport groups ...acknowledging your loved one's loss, to do it with a living memorial, to do it with a tree\u2014it's a living thing, it connects youback to the life and gives you a sense of how they continue on ...and it's still a part of the world, it's almost like some little part of them getsimbued to the tree and so it's like they stay where we are. The seedling survival rates and hemlock regeneration exceeded expectations. As a result, both ecological and emotional recovery are being realized at the site. Figure 5.

(McMillen)McMILLEN et al. 14 Vol. 37, No. 1Perhaps it is at these sites of co-recovery that the flora play the most active roles in the co-creation of memories and as mechanisms for recovery. Discussion: Memory, Metaphor, and Mechanism: The Roles of Flora in Living Memorials How Do the Memorials Call Upon Traditional Symbols and/or Inspire the Creation of New Symbols? The practice of planting one tree per deceased in the form of honor groves has been well documented with war memorials abroad (Sather-Wagstaff 2015) and is also evident among living memorials to 9/11 in our research. While the symbolism of each tree representing a life lost can be compelling, it can also make a site vulnerable. When a tree that has been dedicated to a deceased individualdies itself, the symbolism can take on a negative tone. At one site, two columnar oaks were planted to represent the Twin Towers. One thrived but the other did not, and the desired effect was compromised. A designer of the 9/11 viewshed memorials in NYC parks talked about avoiding the ''one place, one object, one tree design'' and chose to plant multiple individuals of the same hardy species (white flowering redbuds) as a way to build resilience into the memorial. She noted that avoiding singularity also avoids making the memorial territorial, which is important in public spaces meant to be appropriate for everyone, such as NYC parks. Indeed, a number of stewards avoided dedicating a tree to aspecic person because of that risk. Some parks even have policies against such dedications. Although oaks and evergreens were relatively common across LMP sites, and both are traditionally associated with memorializing, there is likely more at play. The oak's strong representation in the U.S. social-ecological landscape is likely the reason it is so widely featured in living memorials. Given its symbolism as our national tree and given the large stature, long life, and wide distribution of theQuercus genus, it is not surprising that it emerged as the most popularly documented tree across memorial sites. It is somewhat surprising that its traditional associations were invoked only once by an interviewee. An organizer of the ''Patriot Gardens'' in the Hudson Valley explained that an oak tree was chosen specically because its strength represented the personality of the personbeing memorialized. Similarly, the traditional associations of evergreens with rebirth were not mentioned by stewards. Perhaps some traditions are expressed through habit and familiarity rather than conscious choice, a potential subject for further research. Another theme conveyed through the flora and other design features of the memorials is a sense of national unity and shared identity. This includes oaks as a symbol of American heritage, survivor trees being exchanged across sites of tragedy, and the planting of red, white, and blue annuals. Although native species were not invoked as symbols of national, regional, or local identity, some stewards did talk about the ecological value of their sites as they promote natives and/or work to remove invasive species. The symbolic (not just ecological) valueJOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY 2017 15of native species for fostering a shared identity could be explored in future research on memorials. New botanical symbols have arisen in 9/11 memorialization practices. As the ofcial memorial tree for the state of NJ since 1951 (State of New Jersey 1951), thedogwood may have been given some preference; however, most stewardscommented on the beauty of its flowers as a reason for planting it and only one referred to its special designation. Another more recent tradition that is becoming a well-known, potent symbol is the callery pear 9/11 survivor tree. It emergesfrom the tragic event and acquires an iconic status due to circumstance, not itsidentity as a particular species, color, or stature. While this symbol is striking, thetree was only documented alive at three sites; however, this may be due to the recentness in which these survivor saplings have become available. An agricultural high school in Queens (NYC) has been caring for hundreds ofsurvivor tree seedlings that may be distributed to groups who want tocommemorate 9/11 in that way. We may see more plantings of survivor treesin the future. How Do Behavior, Form, and Other Attributes of Trees Play Symbolic Roles in Living Memorials? The color and form of trees can represent emotions, personality traits, and a specic time of year in the context of living memorials. Stewards who plantedmaples explained they were chosen because of their availability in and suitability to the region and because of their brilliantly colored leaves, the timing of which coincides with the anniversary of 9/11. For some, yellow daffodils became asymbol of recovery from 9/11, but they have since become a symbol of recoverymore broadly as the scope of Daffodil Project itself has expanded, for example toareas most affected by Hurricane Sandy. This speaks to the malleable nature of living memorials and the ''work'' their plantings do. It also speaks to the diversity of the sites and their memories that are co-created by people through the storiesthey tell about their plants. The species are less important than how many, howtall, or how white their flowers may be. They have been chosen because theyattract butterflies, help tell the story of the smoke that billowed from the towers, or because each spring they bring new life and inspiration. What Other Factors Influence the Selection of Species and Spaces for Memorializing? While symbolic associations of specic trees' type, habit, and color are woven into stewards' explanations of their memorial plantings, the botanical compo- sition of sites also reflects the preferences and expertise of the community,surviving family members, volunteer landscape architects, and the availability ofsuitable planting materials. Logistical reasons such as funding, climate, siteconditions, and the accessibility of plants and open space also influence the selection of flora and sites for memorials. Indeed, some stewards explained that plants were chosen on the basis of their environmental suitability as tolerant todrought, salt, or pests. Site designers and stewards work to balance practicalitywith ideals about how the sites should look. For example, a steward at theHealing Garden in Staten Island initially described their smoke trees as symbolicMcMILLEN et al. 16 Vol. 37, No. 1representations of fallen reghters and later she explained they were also chosen because they are heat tolerant, affordable, and available in the event one needs to be replaced. Stewards understand the importance of having a sustainable design, especially as funding for 9/11 programs has declined considerably over the lastfteen years. A degraded memorial is seen as an embarrassment that is disrespectful to the victims and their families. One steward described his challenges managing dandelions, the reason for complaints from a vocal community member. Conversely, a well maintained memorial is seen as a sign of ongoing respect and care\u2014an indicator of human investment in the site(Nassauer 1995). Stewards work diligently to maintain their sites and, in some cases, this has meant transforming the design to a more sustainable one that is more resilient on its own with less ongoing care and maintenance. Instead of featuring annuals, multiple sites have converted to perennials. These shifts in plant composition seem not to have compromised the meanings and thememories stewards attach to the sites. Across cases, some more clearly articulated than in others, the act of planting and the plants themselves are seen as active agents in the recovery of people from the emotional trauma. Future research could explore how stewards weigh the composition of sites with the process of maintaining them in their efforts to commemorate and recover. Conclusion: The Work of Flora in Living Memorials At the most fundamental level, the symbol of trees and plants as living forces is at the heart of all living memorials. Yet, their symbolism can also play specic roles in the co-creation of memory. Stewards described the flora in their memorials as metaphors for what was lost: the number of community membersand their characteristics (e.g., occupations such as re ghters; characteristics such as brave, strong, inspiring). Flora are also prompts used to punctuate narratives with the sentiments surrounding the events of 9/11, whether they be mournful (willows, weeping cherries), hopeful (springtime blossoming), or tenacious and resilient (survivor tree, sunflower). While in some instances thesecommunity-based living memorial sites may share some traits of ''negative heritage'' (Meskell 2002) that function as ''repositor[ies] of negative memory in the collective'' (Meskell 2002:558), in other cases they are more personalized andpositive than more ofcial hallmarks of post-September 11 culture that emphasize the creation and consumption of patriotic and heritage artifacts. In this study, memorial stewards explained that people under 18 years of age have no personal memories of 9/11 and that engaging them with the memorials\u2014 through educational tours and stewardship\u2014helps them to recount the events asthey unfolded in real time and became a day they would ''never forget,'' whether it was due to the death of a loved one, the reconguration of their urban landscape, or perception of a new era of vulnerability. Yet, the most common theme we documented among stewards is that the acts of planting and tending memorials are mechanisms for recovery and healing.JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY 2017 17Many stewards described an overwhelming feeling of helplessness upon learning about 9/11, while also experiencing an intense desire to ''do something.'' Engaging nature and tending plants has been shown to ameliorate stress (Adeviand M artensson 2013) and stewards described how they experience reduced anxiety and increased well-being through creating living memorials. One woman described it as ''cathartic.'' Through the collaborative work of planting and caring for flora in memorials, grief became embodied and processed. One steward described digging holes to plant trees as ''driven by the need to do somethingand get our hands in the soil.'' The ongoing stewardship of sites is part of the memory-work and the ongoing process of healing, described by stewards as their ''therapeutic outlet.'' Some stewards recounted the achievement they felt in overcoming great odds (nancial, logistical, horticultural) to create their memorials, which they saw as a parallel to overcoming the great emotionalchallenges their families and communities faced following 9/11. We also nd that the ongoing work of planting and stewarding LMP sites has been ''community building work,'' a theme in other research that documents how the well-being and social cohesion of the group is supported in gardens (Milligan et al. 2004) and parks (Kaz \u00b4mierczak 2013). We nd that there is a basic need for people to enact rituals such as creating and tending living memorials not just to mark past events, but also for the senseof community they promote, for the expressions of resilience they represent, and for the healing they can embody. Overall, we nd a prevailing engrained desire to memorialize loss that becomes differentiated by a combination of location and intent as well as time. This is an area to explore both in future research and in praxis as decisions are made regarding the use of community-m a n a g e do p e ng r e e ns p a c ei no u rc i t i e sa n dt o w n s .I nm a n yw a y s ,s y m b o l i ca c t s of planting occur at one moment in time and the vegetation may last for one to two generations without consistent stewardship over both the site and its meaning. In revisiting many of the 9/11 memorials to better understand the ethnobotanical aspects, we've found that their flora are co-creators of memory,metaphors for resilience, and mechanisms for recovery. Through the life of the plants, living memorials symbolize the ability to live on and they reafrm a community's strength and the ability to continue in the face of hardship and disturbance. At the same time, as living beings, these trees and plants dedicated as memorials ''in perpetuity'' willeventually die. Given this inevitable truth, how can we best understand the role of these landscaped sites as part of our collective memory, particularly through symbolic and ritual acts of dedication and memorialization, as well as more subtle, ongoing acts of stewardship and care?
