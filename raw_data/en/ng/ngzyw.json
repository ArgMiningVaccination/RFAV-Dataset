Besides water, the most critical component considered in a diet is energy. o Gross Energy: Caloric value of food o Digestible Energy: Energy that is available for absorption across the intestinal mucosa o Metabolizable Energy: Amount of energy available after losses in urine and feces. Value most often used to express energy content of pet food ingredients o Most important factor in determining the quantity of food an animal should eat/day Food broken down into components Sources of these components not necessarily evaluated Digestion and absorption start in the mouth and continues throughout the GI system o Most of chemical digestion and absorption of nutrients o Mostly involved in water absorption and certain electrolytes, most notably sodium National Research Council (NRC) Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) o Lists of minimum daily requirements of nutrients for dogs and cats Complete system of medicine Synergism between the five branches For the body to retain its balance and harmony requires only following a proper diet.\" Sun Si Miao, Qian Jin Yao Fang (Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold Pieces for Emergencies) \"...diet is such an important part of our daily life that, unless one's diet is well adjusted, no amount of herbs, acupuncture, or other medicines or treatments can achieve a complete and lasting cure.\" Bob Flaws, 1998, The Tao of Healthy Eating What is TCVM Food Therapy? o Treatment & prevention of disease o Promotion of better health o Energetics of food/herbs o Species +/- breed o Food preferences/aversions o Current disharmony o Geographical location Why is Food so Important? o Transformation by the Spleen (pancreas) o Replenishes Yuan Qi and Jing o Origin of Ying Qi and Wei Qi Gu Qi: Replenishes Yuan Qi and Jing o Active form of Kidney Jing o Derived from Jing and requires supplementation by Gu Qi o Essential for proper function of Zang-Fu organs - If abundant Yuan Qi , there will be good organ function and illness will occur less frequently o Prenatal Jing and Postnatal Jing o Congenital - Lifetime supply is inherited from parents and is stored in the Kidney at birth o Foundation of life. - Basis for all growth, development, sexuality and reproduction o Easily depleted and very hard to replenish o From Gu Qi o Excessive Acquired Jing can be saved or transformed into Congenital Jing - Can only partially decrease depletion of Congenital Jing Gu Qi: Origin of Ying Qi and Wei Qi o Circulates in the blood vessels o Produces Blood and nourishes the entire body o Hemoglobin and other serum proteins are a part of Ying Qi o AKA Nutrient Blood or Ying Blood - First line of defense against external pathogens o Circulates outside of blood/lymph vessels in superficial parts of the body o Rules opening and closing of pores o Regulates body temperature o Part of Yang Qi - Warms up body - Deficiency results in cold limbs and/or trunk o Formed, gathered and stored in the chest o Promotes control of respiration by the Lung o Promotes governing of Blood and vessels by the Heart It's all about the Middle Jiao o Receives and ripens food o Digestion is aided by anything that helps to create a \"body-temperature soup\" o Separation into: o Pure part of food which goes to Spleen o Impure part of food which goes to Small Intestines (for excretion via the \"Back Door\") o Responsible for metabolism of food to create Food Essence o Transformation and Transportation of food and water (Double T) o Transforms food (digestion and absorption) into Gu Qi or Food Essence o Transports Food Essence (Amino Acids, Glucose, other nutrients) to the upper jiao o Lungs: where transformation into Qi occurs; subsequent distribution to the rest of the body o Heart: where transformation into Blood occurs o Ensures Spleen Qi moves upwards and Stomach Qi moves downwards o Spleen Qi generates Essence so it must ascend - Downward movement can result in diarrhea, prolapse of stomach, uterus, intestines, kidney, bladder, rectum, vulva or vessels of the rectum or vulva (hemorrhoids) o Stomach Qi generates \"bad stuff\" so it must descend to facilitate elimination - Upward movement can result in nausea, hiccups, belching, vomiting - \"Wife always ascends, Husband always Food Therapy o www.balanceit.com o www.stlzoo.org/animals/caremanagement/animalfoodnutritioncenter/zootrition.htm o www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search o Food Energetics - The effect food has on digestive, metabolic, and physiologic processes - Xing or Thermal Nature - Five Energies - Hot, Warm, Cool, Cold, Neutral - Five Tastes - Sour, Bitter, Sweet, Pungent, Salty o Bian Zheng (Pattern Differentiation) - Eight Principles - Zang-Fu Organs Thermal Nature of Food o E.g., lettuce vs. root vegetables o E.g., watermelon o E.g., grapes and raisins o Addition of growth hormones and other stimulants increases thermal nature of food o Grain based diet increases thermal nature of livestock o Crowded containment, stressful environment o Observe your patients' response and decide for yourself Hot/Warm Foods o Meat: Lamb, venison, chicken, shrimp o Grains/beans: Oats, quinoa, spelt o Vegetables/Fruit: Sweet potato, garlic, squash, cherry, raspberry o Others: brown sugar, olive oil, wine Cool/Cold Foods o Examples: o Meat: Turkey, deep ocean fish, rabbit (farm raised), crab, oyster o Grains/beans: Millet, barley, brown rice, tofu o Vegetables/Fruit: Celery, spinach, broccoli, mushroom, kelp, watermelon, banana, pear, orange o Others: Honey, green tea, salt, flax seed oil Neutral o Meat: Pork, beef, rabbit (wild), salmon, sardines, trout, chicken eggs o Grains/beans: Corn, white rice, soy beans, black beans o Vegetables/Fruit: Yam, Chinese cabbage, carrot, asparagus, apple, grapes o Others: White sugar, peanut oil Sour - Wood o Yin, cooling o Stimulates absorption and contraction o Benefits digestive absorption o Stimulates gall bladder and pancreatic secretions o Lowers intestinal acidity o Astringent effect o Prevent abnormal leakage of fluids and energy o Dry and firm up tissues o Uses: Urinary incontinence, hemorrhage, diarrhea, weak and sagging tissue (flabby skin, hemorrhoids, rectal/vulvar prolapse o dampness, constipation, heaviness of mind or body Bitter - Fire o Yin, cooling o Antipyretic - drains heat o Causes contraction o Dries fluids and drains damp o Improves appetite o Stimulates digestion o Heat conditions and heat toxins (inflammation, infection, fever), damp, constipation (some bitter foods have purgative effect) Sweet - Earth o Yang o Moistening o Builds the Yin of the body (tissues and fluids) o Strengthens weakness and deficiency o Harmonizing o Full Sweet - more tonifying and strengthening o Empty Sweet - more cleansing and cooling Pungent - Metal o Yang o Disperses stagnation o Stimulates circulation of energy and blood o Tends to move energy upwards and outwards o Stimulate digestion o Stagnation: phlegm (tumors), edema (Damp), pain (Blood) o Promotes circulation of energy and blood o Some can destroy or dispel parasites o Dry, windy, nervous, thin o Examples: Ginger, mint (mentha), cloves, all hot peppers, horseradish, turnip Salty - Water o Yin o Cooling o Move energy downward and inward o Moistens dryness o Softens hard lumps and stiffness o Aids digestion o Detoxification Bland - Extra Taste o Drains damp o Diuretic o Promotes urination Direction of Food o Warms from the inside out o Tends to speed us up o Use for Exterior conditions o E.g., Arthritis o Move Yang upward o Warm, neutral.
