If your office is within this jurisdiction it is included. The Colorado Chiropractic Association's position on healthcare decisions, including vaccines, is pro-choice. Our position statement: We support Coloradoans in their right to choose and make informed decisions regarding patient care for both the individual and their family and children. No healthcare procedure, of any sort, is without potential risk. It is essential that patients educate themselves on both the benefits and the risks associated with any procedure to properly exercise their freedom of choice in making healthcare decisions. (This, obviously, includes you, the doctor, and your staff). Earlier this year, we as a board, anticipated that this type of development may occur and developed the position statement, above, and we stand by it. The CCA's Board met on Wednesday, August 4, to discuss Mayor Hancock's Denver health order, with two attorneys present sharing their insights, answering questions, and advising according to the law as it stands. We had 15 board members present, representing the entire state of Colorado. Please note that, currently, this is ONLY IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER. We are sending this to our entire membership, so everyone in the state is aware of the developing situation. The health order that was announced on Monday, August 2, 2021 requires personnel in healthcare facilities, including Chiropractic offices, to be fully vaccinated by September 30, 2021. Denver's Public Health Order is not consistent with the Association's position of freedom of choice. After consulting with our attorney and our lobbyist, we will be sending a letter to Mayor Hancock to express the Board's concerns and opposition to this health order. We will continue to monitor the situation and keep you informed as we learn more. Craig Pearson DC President Colorado Chiropractic Association Call 3-1-1 for questions, comments or more information "}
