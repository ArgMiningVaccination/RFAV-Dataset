August 7 University of Houston -Downtown: Houston's Downtown University Mission Statement The University of Houston- Downtown is a comprehensive four -year university offering bachelor's and selected master's degree programs and providing strong academic and career preparation as well as life- long learning opportunities. Located in the heart of the city, the University reflects the diversity of the Greater Houston Metropolitan Area and, through its academic programs, engages with the community to address the needs and advance the development of the region. UHD is an inclusive community dedicated to integrating teaching, service and scholarly research to develop students' talents and prepare them for suc cess in a dynamic global society. Vision The University of Houston -Downtown will be a premier city university where all students engage in high- impact educational experiences and graduate with 21 st century skills. University of Houston- Downtown: Houston's Downtown University Located in the heart of Houston, UHD is a public, four -year university that offers excellent educational opportunities through its colleges: Business, Humanities and Social Sciences, Public Service, Sciences and Technology, and University College. UHD offers six bachelor's degrees (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Engineering Technology, Bachelor of Social Work, and Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences) with majors in 43 areas, and five master's degrees (Master of Business Administration, Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Science in Professional Writing and Technical Communication, Master of Science in Criminal Justice, and Master of Security Management for Executives), with programs in seven areas. UHD is nationally recognized for its outstanding academic opportu nities and for its connectivity to the communities, agencies and people in the greater Houston metropolitan area. UHD ranks 33 rd nationally for graduating Hispanic students and 37th nationally for graduating African- American students with bachelor's degrees, as reported in Hispanic Outlook Magazine. UHD is the second largest public university in Houston and it has been recognized as a leader in communit y service by being named to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for the past five consecutive years by the Corporation for National Community Service. In June 2010, UHD opened the doors to UHD Northwest, a new campus at Lone Star College - University Park that lets students move from an associate degree to a bachelor's degree at the same location. Students choose UHD because they enjoy the flexible degree options UHD provides. Students take classes online, through live i nteractive television classes, in traditional classrooms at satellite locations, and through hybrid arrangements that blend online and traditional classroom instruction. UHD also offers classes at Lone Star College- CyFair, Lone Star College- Atascocita Center, Lone Star College- Kingwood, and UHD Northwest at Lone Star College- University Park. UHD's weekend and evening classes are also available. The nature of the UHD student population prepares individuals to thrive in the multicultural workplace of the 21st century. UHD students are diverse in every sense of the word: in ethnicity, age, financial background and life situation. UHD's campus has grown considerably since the institution was founded in 1974. The campus includes the historic One Main Building, the Academic Buildin g, the Commerce Street Building, the Shea Street Building, the Jesse H. Jones Student Life Building, and the restored Willow Street Pump Station. UHD's History and Future on the Bayou UHD is creating an exciting future based on a fascinating past. The University's history began in 1974, when the assets of the private South Texas Junior College were transferred to the University of Houston. By 1979, the Texas Legislature approved the new institution as a separate entity within the University of Houston System. In 1983, the name was changed to the University of Houston- Downtown. Today, UHD is the second largest institution in the University of Houston System, which includes four distinct universities: the University of Houston, UH-Clear Lake, University of Houston- Downtown, and UH -Victoria. All four institutions are governed by the UH System Board of Regents. The chief adminis trative officer at each university is its president. The history of the University's campus goes back even farther. The campus' One Main Building was constructed in 1929 on the banks of White Oak Bayou and Buffalo Bayou. Then known as the Merchants and Manufacturers Building, the building served the city for decades as a center for commerce and man ufacturing. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. UHD's facilities have continued to change since the University's inception. In the late 1990s, UHD added the Academic Building- with more than 40 classrooms and lecture halls, the Technology Teaching and Learning Center, the Wilhelmina Cullen Robertson Auditorium and a food court. While the Academic Building was taking shape, so was the Jesse H. Jones Student Life Center, a state- of-the-art facility devoted to student health, recreation and fitness. In 2004, the University opened the Commerce Street Building, which houses the College of Public Service, classrooms, academic labs, computer labs, meeting spaces and faculty offices. In fall 2007, the University opened yet another showcase facility, the Shea Street Building at the corner of Main and Shea Streets. The new home for UHD's College of Business features a glass -enclosed entrance that provides stunning views of Houston's downtown skyline. Adjoining this award- winning new building is a multi -story parking facility. UHD students enjoy the excitement of the nation's fourth largest city, including being just minutes away from Minute Maid Park, the Toyota Center, world -class museums and art galleries, and a wide assortment of restaurants and sidewalk cafes. Getting to and around campus is easy for students with UHD's free shuttle bus, the city's light rail line that stops at the University's front door, and easy access from two interstate highways. UHD's wireless campus provides faculty, staff and students with optimum service and flexibility. In addition to applying for admission and registering for classes online, students can handle much of the \"business\" of going to college from laptops or desktops while at home or at school. And connectivity makes it easy to meet online with other students for group projects and classes. Since its founding, the University of Houston- Downtown has continued to grow and provide degrees, programs and facilities to meet the needs of students, faculty and staff. It is all part of UHD's commitment to providing access and opportunity to higher education. Campus Safety and Security The University of Houston- Downtown Police Department is committed to assuring your safety and security on campus. The Police Department provides comprehensive police services 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Offices are located on the first floor of the One Main Building, Suite 118 -North.

Method of Payment Students shall be provided with two alternative methods of payment of tuition and mandatory fees for each semester for which they are enrolled. Full payment of all tuition and mandatory fees prior to the beginning of the semester, or Installment Plan Fall and Spring semesters - Up to eight equal payments with the first payment plus a $24 or $16 installment fee (depending on plan option) to be made in advance of the beginning of the semester, the remaining payments to be made monthly, and the final payment to be made before the last day of the semester. There will be a $10 late fee added for each installment payment not received by the due date. Installment payments are also available online through Student e- Services under the My Payment option. Summer semesters - Up to three equal payments with the first payment plus a $24 or $16 installment fee (depending on plan option) to be made in advance of the beginning of the summer term and the final payment to be made before the last day of the term. There will be a $10 late fee added for each install ment payment not received by the due date. Installment payments are also available online through Student e- Services under the My Payment option. Students are only eligible for one installment plan option per semester. Once the installment plan is executed for the semester, it cannot be altered. Any charges incurred after the execution of the installment plan are due immediately. Additional charges that are incurred and not paid in full with the next installment are subject to being assessed a $10 late fee. Payment may be made by cash, check or credit card. Payment may be made in person, by mail, online (credit/debit card or echeck) or through the payment drop box located in the hall next to the cashier's office on the third floor. Credit card payment (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover) may be made over the web via UHD's Student e- services (www.uhd.edu) or by fax to 713- 226-5267 (authorization form available at http://www.uhd.edu/cashiers/documents/ccaf_students.pdf Please remember that mailed payments must be received by the posted payment deadlines to avoid having classes dropped or late fees assessed. UHD does not receive mail on Saturday, so payments must be received by Friday for Saturday deadlines. Health Insurance fees shall be paid prior to the beginning of the semester. Most financial aid awards will be credited to your account automatically once processing is completed and you are registered for the same number of hours for which you are awarded. It is the student's responsibility to check their fee statement to assure that their funds have been posted to their account before the payment deadline. If the funds have not been posted, the student must make the payment or other arrangements with the Cashier's Office by the deadline to avoid losing their classes. Student fee statements can be viewed through UHD's Student e- services (www.uhd.e du), the My Payment option. Students receiving financial aid equal to, or in excess of, the total amount of tuition and fees prior to the beginning of the semester may not participate in the installment plan. The full payment of tuition and fees for the s emester in which they are enrolled must be made upon issuance of that semester's financial aid funds before any excess amounts will be refunded. Withdrawal from the university, for whatever reason, will not cancel the obligation to pay the full amount of the installment plan. If the amount of tuition and fees credited as a result of withdrawal is less than the remaining balance of an installment plan, the balance remaining is still the obligation of the student. If the credited amount is more than the balance of an installment plan, the remaining credit will be refunded to the student. Any student who has elected to pay tuition and fees by installment, and who is delinquent in making payment by the final installment due date, is barred from registering at any institution in the University of Houston System until full payment, including delinquent charges, has been made. Each university maintains records and informs other institutions about the status of payments should the student attempt to register for courses or pursue a degree at any other component of the University of Houston System. An additional default fee of $50 is collected from any student who fails to make all installment payments by the end of the semester. This fee, in addition to all other amounts due, must be paid prior to the student's registering for courses during a subsequent semester. Financial Responsibility Students are required to meet financial responsibilities to the university. Students who write checks to the university on accounts with insufficient funds are assessed a $20 service charge for each such check, regardless of the amount. If a check is returned as a result of bank error, the student must deal with the bank for reimbursement of the $20 returned check charge paid to the university. If such a check is presented in payment of tuition and fees, the payment will be reversed from the student account and the student will be subject to all applicable late fee and drop dates. Failure to make a valid payment by the drop date WILL result in loss of registration and a reinstatement charge may be required before reenrollment is approved. A student who does not meet financial responsibilities to the uni versity may be subject to withdrawal from classes and may be referred to law enforcement authorities and/or the local credit bureau. Once an account is referred to our collection agency, the student is responsible for payment of additional collection fees. These fees are no less than 23% of the delinquent amount. An official transcript shall not be given to or on behalf of a student who is in default on any payment due the university. The student will not be allowed to re- enroll at UHD or any UH system university until all past due payments have been made. Additionally, students in default are reported to the State Comptroller and will not be able to receive a payment from any state agency until the debt is cleared. Refunds All refunds are processed through HigherOne, the issuer of your GatorCard. In order to receive a refund you MUST activate your GatorCard and choose one of the three refund methods. To activate your GatorCard, go to www.uhdgatorcard.com. If you have not received your card, you can click on the Where's My Card? link also at www.uhdgatorcard.com to see the status.

Scholarships and Financial Aid Estimated Costs The following are estimated costs for attending UHD full time for the 2013- 2014 academic year: Direct Costs Resident Non-Resident Tuition & Fees (12 hours) $4,786 $12, 298 Books and Supplies $1,100 $1,100 Indirect Costs Living Expenses With Parents $4,300 $4,300 Parents $8,600 $8,600 $3,800 $3,800 The University of Houston- Downtown offers a variety of financial aid programs to assist undergraduate and graduate stu dents in meeting educational costs. The programs include scholarships, grants, loans and part -time employment, which may be awarded in various combinations and amounts to meet individual student needs. Because funds are limited in many programs, it is important to begin the application process early and complete the necessary applications properly and on time. To receive priority consideration for Supplemental Equal Opportunity Grant and all state grant funds, all necessary applications must be on file in the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by April 1 of each year. Most federal and state aid is awarded on the basis of proven financial need rather than academic achievement. Most scholar ships are awarded on the basis of academic achievement, talents and special skills rather than proven financial need. Financial Aid Programs www.uhd.edu/eservices University of Houston- Downtown participates in the following federal, state and institutional programs. Most programs have limited funds so early application is encouraged. Grants Federal Pell Grant. A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. Pell Grants are awarded to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's or a professional degree. The maximum can change each award year and depends on program funding. The amount awarded, though, will depend not only on the student 's financial need, but also on their costs to attend school, status as a full - time or part -time student, and plans to attend school for a full academic year or less. Federal Supplemental Equal Opportunity Grant. The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program is for undergraduates with exceptional financial need. Pell Grant recipients with the lowest Estimated Family Contributions will be considered first for a FSEOG. Just like Pell Grants, the FSEOG does not have to be repaid TEXAS Grant . This renewable state grant is available to recent Texas high school graduates who completed the recommended or advanced curriculum in high school or who received an associate's degree after May 1, 2001 who also demonstrate financial need. Students must enroll in a minimum of 12 hours and be classified as Texas residents. Texas Public Educational Grant. This grant is funded by tuition revenues and is available to both Texas residents and non- residents. Students must demonstrate financial need to be eligible for this grant. Priority will be given to students who enroll at least half -time. License Plate Scholarship. This grant is funded by revenues from UHD vanity plate fees. Students must enroll at least half -time, be classified as Texas residents and demonstrate financial need. Student Deposit Scholarship. This institutional grant is awarded to students who enroll at least half -time and demonstrate financial need. Work -Study Programs https://jobs.uhd.edu Texas Work- Study and Federal College -Work Study. These programs are designed for students who enroll at least half -time who demonstrate financial need. Awards are earned as wages in on- and off-campus positions. Must be a US citizen or permanent resident f or federal work -study or be classified as a Texas resident for Texas work - study. Students who have relatives working at UHD must get clearance from the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid to show they are in compliance with the university's nepotism policy. Student Loans Direct Lending. Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan. A low -interest loan with interest subsidies while student is enrolled at least half -time. Must be a US citizen or permanent resident and be enrolled at least half-time to participate. Maximum loan amounts vary with grade level in college. Additional application and loan counseling required. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. A low -interest loan not based on financial need. Students may defer interest payments while enrolled at least half -time. Must be a US citizen or permanent resident and be enrolled at least half -time to participate. Maximum loan amounts vary with grade level in college. Additional application and loan counseling required. Parent Loans to Undergraduate Students. A low -interest loan for parents of dependent students enrolled at least half -time. Parent must be a US citizen or permanent resident and student must be enrolled at least half -time to participate. Families do not need to demonstrate need to participate in this program. Additional application required. Application Procedures At a minimum, students should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Other forms or documentation may be required to determine eligibility for state and/or federal programs. When completing the FAFSA, students should list UHD's school code (003612) in Step Six. Once a student has begun the appl ication process, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will notify the student of missing forms and/or documentation by e- mail. Students will also be e- mailed an award letter to their gator mail account when their eligibility for aid has been finalized. Students may also access their financial aid information online at www.uhd.edu/eservices Certain categories of foreign- born and immigrant students in the state of Texas can meet state requirements for re sidency. Such students are able to pay the resident tuition rate while attending public institutions of higher education in Texas. If a student falls into this category he/she will also need to complete the FAFSA. Direct Lending Procedures Getting Started: 1. Important: You will need your Department of Education issued PIN (the same PIN used for the FAFSA) in order to complete and electronically sign your electronic Master Promissory Note (eMPN) under the Direct Loan Program. If you have forgotten your PIN or do not yet have one, please go to www.pin.ed.gov to have your PIN sent to you. 2. Have your social security number, date of birth, and driver's license number accessible. 3. You will also be required to provide two personal references (full name, address, and telephone number) whom you have known for at least three years. Each reference provided must reside at a different U.S. address as well as different from the student's address. Complete an Electronic Master Promissory Note (eMPN) To complete your eMPN, you will need to go to www.studentloans.gov and click on \"Complete New MPN for Student Loans\". Remember that you will need your Department of Education issued PIN to begin the process. An eMPN can be completed in 9 steps. We estimate that it will take 30 minutes to complete the eMPN process. Make sure you allow enough time to complete the entire process in a single session. If you exit the web site before submitting your signed MPN in Step 8 and return later, you'll have to start over beginning with Step 1. Step 1 - PIN Registration Step 2 - Disclosure and Consent Step 3 - Provide Name and School Step 4 - Complete MPN Step 5 - Review/Read Draft MPN Step 6 - Sign Your MPN Step 7 - Review signed MPN/Enter Confirmation Code Step 8 - Confirm Acceptance of MPN Terms and Submit MPN Step 9 - Succ ess! Now Print Your MPN Once you complete the eMPN process correctly, UHD will receive notification electronically that you have completed your MPN. This will allow the UHD Financial Aid Office to continue working on your loan disbursement process. Com plete a Loan Entrance Counseling (LEC) To complete your LEC, you will need to go to www.studentloans.gov and click on \"Complete Loan Entrance Counseling\". Remember that you will need your Department of Education issued PIN to begin the process. Your LEC includes information about all of your past student loans as well as helps you to see the amount you will owe based on that previous total. This is required every academic year that you borrow loans. Once you co mplete the LEC process correctly, UHD will receive notification electronically that you have completed your LEC. This will allow the UHD Financial Aid Office to continue working on your loan disbursement process. Other Eligibility Requirements UHD Degree- Seeking Student Requirement In order to receive financial aid, students must make progress toward their degree as defined by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid. There are three components to academic progress: Grade Point Requirement Undergraduate students must achieve and maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative grade point average on all course work attempted. Graduate students must achieve and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0. Completion Requirement Students must complete at least 73% of all course work attempted. Time Frame Requirement Students may attempt up to 170 hours without earning a degree. Students who have earned their first bachelor's degree are allowed 150% of the hours remaining to complete their program. A complete copy of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy is available upon request. Please read this policy to see how progress will be monitored. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid is required to review students' entire academic records (regardless of the age of the record or whether or not aid was received) to determine compliance. Students found not to be in compliance will be notified in writing of any denial/suspension and the appropriate appeal procedure. Dropping Classes Students' final eligibility for aid will be based on the number of hours for which they are enrolled on the Official Day of Record listed in the Class Schedule. If they register and then drop classes prior to that date, their eligibility for aid will be RECALCULATED on the remaining hours as of the Official Day of Record. Since financial aid is released prior to the Official Day of Record, students who receive a financial aid payment based on more hours than those remaining as of the Official Day of Record may be responsible for repaying a portion of any financial aid received. Dropping classes may affect students' eligibility for future aid. Students should consult the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy to determine if dropping classes will affect their eligibility for aid. Total Withdrawal from School For students who register and then totally withdraw from all classes, eligibility for aid will be RECALCULATED based on the number of days they attended class. If they totally withdraw from all classes prior to the first class day, they must repay any and all financial aid received. If they withdraw on or after the first class day, they may have to repay a portion of any cash financial aid received. Students who have failed to earn a passing grade in any of their classes are considered to have totally withdrawn from school and may have to repay a portion of any financial aid received. See Return of Title IV Funds below. Students who totally withdraw should consult the definition of Satisfactory Academic Progress to deter mine if their withdrawal will affect their eligibility for future aid. Return of Title IV Funds The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 changed the formula for calculating the amount of aid a student and school can retain when the student totally withdraws from all classes or fails to earn a passing grade in any of the current semester's classes. Students who withdraw from all classes prior to completing 60% of the semester will have their eligibility for aid recalculated based on the percent of the semester completed. For example, a student who withdraws completing only 30% of the term will have \"earned\" only 30% of any Title IV aid received. The remaining 70% must be returned by the school and/or the student. A student who fails to earn a passing grade in any of his/her courses will have their eligibility recalculated based on the midpoint of the semester or the last date of participation in an academically related activity. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid encourages you to obtain a complete copy of this policy from the office and read it carefully. If you are thinking about withdrawing from all classes PRIOR to completing 60% of the semester, you should contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid to see how your withdrawal will affect your financial aid. Academic Scholarships Academic scholarships at UHD are intended to recognize and reward outstanding achievement and community involvement. Applicants for most scholarships, therefore, do not need to show evidence of financial need to apply. The application deadline for most UHD scholarships is April 1 of each academic year. However, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid may accept applications at other times during the year if scholarship funds are availabl e. Interested students should contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid as soon as they decide to apply for admission at UHD to find out what scholarships are available. Many academic departments at UHD also award scholarships. Students are encouraged to contact the department of their major to find out what departmental scholarships are available. Tuition and Fee Exemptions Hazlewood Act for Veterans State law provides that a veteran who is a legal Texas resident is exempted from tuition and certain required fees, but not from deposits. The veteran must meet the following criteria: resides in Texas for a period of not less than 12 months prior to the date of registration; served in the armed forces or in certain auxiliary services for more than 180 days; was a bona fide legal Texas resident at the time of entering such service; was honorably discharged (except those who were dis charged because of being over the age of 38 or because of personal request); exhausted all veteran's educational benefits; is not eligible for federal grants, including federally sponsored grants provided for veterans by the US government; and is not be in default on any federal or state student loans. To obtain this exemption, the veteran must submit an application with attached evidence to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by the Official Day of Record of the term for which the vet eran is applying for the Hazlewood benefits. Hazlewood applications must be renewed each year. Academic Policies Courses and Course Credit Course Load Maximum course loads are established to encourage students to think carefully about the amount of time they will need to devote to each class. The following policies are in place so that students are better able to meet their course obligations successfully. A standard undergraduate course load during the fall and spring terms is 15 to 16 semester credit hours, or five courses. Twelve semester credit hours are considered the minimum full -time load. Students who are employed 40 hours per week should take no more than two courses, or six credit hours. Students who wish to enroll in 20 credit hours or more in a fall or spring term must receive approval from the assistant or associate dean of their college. The standard load for one summer session is six to eight credit hours. Students who wish to enroll in nine hours or more in a single summer ses sion or in two overlapping summer sessions must receive approval from the assistant or associate dean of their college. For information on the graduate course load, consult specific master's degree coor dinator. Part-of-Term (PoT) Effective Fall 2011, UHD began utilizing shorter sessions, termed \"Part -of Term\" (PoT) within full terms. For more information about these offerings, please review the posted academic calendars on the UHD website (uhd.edu). Schedule Changes Schedule changes are made online, and may require approval by an academic advisor. Registration instructions for Schedule Changes are found in each term's Registration & Information Bulletin and the dates for Schedule Changes are found in the online Academic Calendar . Discontinued (Cancelled) Classes The university reserves the right to discontinue classes or other wise alter the class schedule. Whenever possible, enrollment in an alternate course is completed through an administrativ e change form initiated by the department responsible for discon tinuing the class. Classification Undergraduate classification is determined by the number of credit hours which have been semester hours and above: senior. Master's classification is determined by admission status. Class Attendance Students are expected to attend all class sessions. The responsi bility for dropping a course lies with the student. Departments and faculty members may have additional attendance policies for their courses. Transfer Credit -Undergraduate Acceptance of Transfer Credit Transfer students must submit official transcripts from all colleges or universities attended as a part of the admission process. An evaluation will be performed during a student's first semester at the university. Course work transferred or accepted for credit toward an undergradu - ate degree m ust represent collegiate course work relevant to the degree, with course content and level of instruction resulting in student competencies at least equivalent to those of students enrolled in the institution's own undergraduate degree program. Courses t ransfer on the same level and with the corresponding number of hours as earned at another institution. Courses taken at a junior or community college do not transfer as upper -level credits. Courses taken at other colleges that do not correspond to cours es offered by UHD may transfer as elective credit. With the consent of the appropriate dean, the chair of the department in which a student is majoring will make the decision concerning application of transfer credit to the degree program. Therefore decl ared majors should obtain approval from their degree- granting college before taking courses from a community or junior college which they wish to transfer to UHD. In general, UHD does not award transfer credit for vocational courses that are not considered part of a standard college curriculum. Students may petition the academic dean of the college in which they are seeking their degree, who may agree to award credit for such courses in exceptional circumstances. Students should direct questions concerning transfer credit to their academic advisor or degree program coordinator. Evaluation of Transfer Credit Transcripts will be evaluated for institutional transfer credit upon completion of the admission application process. Students accepted later in t he admission cycle may not have their transcripts evaluated until after they have actually enrolled. Transfer work will be further evaluated for applicability to the student's chosen degree plan by the degree- granting college once the student has been accepted into the college as a declared major. Students who apply to UHD while they are attending another institution must submit two official transcripts. The first should be sent at the time of application and should reflect the student's current enrollment . A second must be sent as soon as grades are available for those classes. Transferring Credits from Other Countries Students applying for admission with college credits from other countries must submit an evaluated transcript from a credential evaluation service recognized by the university. Credits will be granted based on the recommendations of the evaluating service with respect to University of Houston- Downtown degree requirements at the time of enrollment. Information and brochures from evaluating service agencies are avail - able at the Office of Admissions and online at www.uhd.edu/admissions. Transfer Credit Dispute Resolution Procedures Students who receive written notification from Office of Admissions that a lower- level course taken at another Texas public institution of higher education has not been accepted may challenge denial of credit by UHD. To initiate a dispute action, a Transfer Dispute Resolution form must be completed. The form and instruc tions for its completion are available in the Office of the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost, Room S950. Credit by Examination UHD accepts up to 24 hours of credit by examination. Credit by examination may be obtained on the basis of several types of examinations. Nationally recognized standardized examinations such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the College Board's Advanced Placement program may be used. Examinations widely used within a professional field and locally designed examinations also may be used. Students planning to take CLEP exams should do so before their final semester. Nationally standardized examinations are administered through Testing Services; all other examinations are administered through the responsible department. If credit is not awarded, a period of six months must elapse before application for re- examination will be considered. Appropriate fees are charged for each examination. No student may attempt the exam for a particular course more than twice. Credit may be granted for professional certification and training received from armed forces and service schools. With consent of the appropriate dean, the chair of the department in which the student is majoring will make the decision concerning the appli cability of such courses to the degree program. Credit received by examination does not fulfill residency requirements for graduation. No grade is awarded for courses for which credit has been obtained by exam, nor are hours received for such courses included in the calculation of grade point average for graduation. Listed below are the subject examinations for the Advanced Placement Program and the College Level Examination Program.

Credit for military courses and/or credit is available to all admitted undergraduates. Either elective or direct course credit will be awarded based on ACE recommendations. Credit for Military Service (HB 269) HB 269 makes military veterans who enroll in Texas universities and who meet certain requirements eligible to receive undergraduate college credit for the time they spent in the service. Eligible veterans receive college credit for all the required physi cal education courses needed for their degree and up to an additional 12 semester hours of elective coursework. To be eligible to receive credit under HB 269, veterans must have: Graduated from a public or private high school accredited by a generally recognized accrediting organization or from a high school operated by the United States Department of Defense Completed at least two years of service in the armed forces (or discharged because of a disability) Been honorably discharged from the U.S. armed for ces Credit awarded under HB 269 is awarded for having served, not for college- level courses that might have been taken while in the military. Acceptable forms of documentation include: AARTS Transcript (Army ACE Registry Transcript) CCAF Transcript (Comm unity College of the Air Force Transcript) SMART Transcript (Sailor/Marine ACE Registry Transcript) Elective credit Directed Studies Courses A directed studies course allows students to work directly with a faculty member on an individual basis. This type of study is intended to expand the curriculum and may not duplicate an organized course. A directed studies course requires a term paper, research study or comparable project. Students wishing to enroll in a directed studies course must be juniors or seniors and have a grade point average of at least 3.0, with a grade point average of at least 3.3 in the specific area of the directed studies course. Procedures for enrolling in directed studies courses are available in each academic department. Degree requirements may limit the number of hours of directed studies that may be applied. Auditing Courses To audit a course is to enroll in a course on a noncredit basis. Audit students pay the regular tuition and all other applicable fees as set for the current academic year. Senior citizens 65 years or over may audit for free on a space- available basis. A change to credit status may not be made after the student has registered to audit a course. Changes from credit status to audit status in a course must be made prior to the end of the business day of the Official Day of Record. A Request for Audit form must be processed in the Registrar's Office by the Official Day of Record for the appropriate term along with Instructor approval. Students wishing to audit courses should contact the Registrar's Office for further details http://www.uhd.edu/registrar/documents/audit_form.pdf Grading System and Standards Academic Honesty The Academic Honesty Code is embraced by all members of the University of Houston- Downtown academic community and is an essential element of the institution's academic credibility. The Honesty Code states \"We will be honest in all our academic activities and will not tolerate dishonesty.\" The purpose of the Academic Honesty Policy is to deal with alleged violations of the Honesty Code in a fair and consistent manner. The policy is administered jointly by students and faculty. It is each student's responsibility to read and understand the Academic Honesty Policy. It may be found in the Student Handbook (www.uhd.edu/campus/handbook/) Grading System The following grades are included in the calculation of grade point averages: Grade Grade Points A Superior ................................................................................... 4.0 B Above Average ........................................................................ 3.0 C Average ................................................................................... 2.0 D Below Average ........................................................................ 1.0 F Failure ...................................................................................... 0.0 The following grades are not included in the calculation of grade point averages: Grade .................................................................................... In Progress Aud ........................................................................................... Audit S ..................................................................... Satisfactory (passing) U ............................................................ Unsatisfactory (not passing) W ........................................................................................ Withdraw I (Incomplete) An incomplete grade is given only when an unforeseen emer gency prevents a student from completing the course work and only with the instructor's approval. A grade of I will be changed to a passing grade if the missing work is completed satisfactori ly by the deadline set by the instructor but no later than the end of the long semester immediately following the term in which the grade was received. An incomplete grade that is not removed by this deadline becomes an F. Repetition of a course for which an incomplete grade was received does not affect resol ution of the original grade. An incomplete grade earned in a student's graduating semester is computed as an F in determining grade point average. IP (In Progress) The grade of IP may be given in some developmental courses. In the calculation of grade point average, a grade of IP is treated as a W. To receive credit for a course in which an IP was assigned, a student must register for the course again and earn a passing grade. S (Satisfactory) The grade of S may be earned in field experience courses and cer tain other courses. Credit received with a grade of S is not part of the grade point average calculation. W (Withdrawal from Courses) Students will not receive a grade for a course if they drop the course by the Official Day of Record (see Academic Calendar). Students automatically receive a grade of W for any course they drop after the Official Day of Record up to the drop/withdrawal deadline as listed in the online Academic Calendar. Official Day of Record and drop/withdrawal deadlines are published in the University Calendar online at www.uhd.edu/AcademicCalendars and may be found in the Registration & Information Bulletin. Class days are defined as days on which the university normally has one or more classes scheduled; not the days for which an individual student is scheduled for his/her particular classes. For purposes of determining academic calendar dates, class days during the Fall, Spring, May and Winter terms are Monday through Friday while class days during a summer term are Monday through Thursday. Additional grading system information applicable to graduate students is published in the specific master's degree handbook -. Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average is a measure of a student's academic achievement. Grade point averages are computed by multiplying the grade point value by the number of credit hours in each course, and then dividing the sum of all grade points obtained by the total number of hours attempted. The following formula represents the method of computing grade point average: Total Number of Grade Points Total Number of Semester Hours = Grade Point Average The number of grade points earned for each course equals the hour credit value of the course multiplied by the points awarded for grades received. Grades of I, S, U, IP and grades marked with an asterisk (*) in the table above are not counted in the calculation of the grade point average, except for graduation. Grades of I will be calculated as F grades in determining grade point average for graduation. In calculating the Grade Point Average (GPA) to determine honors for students who have earned all their credits at UHD, the UHD GPA, as it appears in the student record system, is used. For students who have completed some portion of their college work at other institutions, the UHD GPA is combined proportionately with the GPAs earned at those other institutions to determine eligibility for honors. Undergraduate students must meet a graduation requirement of a minimum 2.0 grade point average calculated on all grades earned at UHD. Some departments may specify more stringent requirements, such as a 2.5 grade point average in the major or a 2.5 grade point average in all upper- level courses. Graduate students must meet a graduation requirement of a minimum 3.0 grade point average. Appeal of Grades Any grade which a student believes to be in error should be appealed, first to the instructor, then to the appropriate department chair, and finally to the appropriate dean. If an appeal is not made within one calendar year after the close of the semester in which the grade was received, the grade will be considered final and no appeal is allowed. Dean's List The Dean's List recognizes students who have achieved superior academic performance during the fall or spring semester. To be included on the Dean's List for a specific semester, a student must, during that semester, complete at least nine semester hours of college-level work, earn at least a 3.5 grade point average, and receive no grade of I or F. The Dean's List is published by each college at the end of each fall and spring semester. Grades for Repeated Courses Effective Spring 1994, when a course is repeated, only the most recent grade, even if it is lower than the original grade, will be used in computing the grade point average. This excludes courses repeated prior to Spring 1994. Graduation with Honors Students who complete bachelor's degree requirements with exceptionally high grade point averages receive degrees with honors. a cumulative grade point average of 3.75- 4.00 graduate summa cum laude, a cumulative grade point average of 3.50- 3.74 is required for magna cum laude. a grade point average of 3.25- 3.49 is needed to graduate cum laude. In the computation of this average, all courses attempted at UHD are counted, including courses repeated, failed and passed, but excluding courses with grades of S, W or IP. For candidates who complete some portion of their college work at other institutions, the cumulative grade point average of all work attempted at UHD and the grade point average of all college work is computed; the lower of the two averages is used as the basis for determining honors. Students not eligible for cum laude, magna cum laude or summa cum laude honors may be eligible for College Honors. Students who have earned a GPA of 3.50 or greater in their last 60 hours attempted at UHD, including at least 30 upper -level hours, are eligible to receive the designation, \"College Honors.\" Academic Probation and Suspension Transfer students who were placed on Academic Suspension at the most recent institution attended, prior to applying to UHD, will not be offered Admissions. Probation Academic probation is a warning to the student that his or her aca- demic record has been unsatisfactory. A student who is not making satisfactory progress toward meeting graduation requirements may be placed on academic suspension if this record does not improve. A student is placed on academic probation at the end of any term in which his or her cumulative GPA falls below the specified mini mum cumulative G PA shown below. The cumulative GPA for aca demic probation and suspension is computed on all grades earned at UHD. Grades of I, IP, S or W are not counted. Semester hours Minimum Required Cumulative GPA 1-29 1.70 30-59 1.90 60 or more, or upon declaration of a major 2.00 Suspension Suspension means that a student is ineligible to register or remain in classes. Students on academic probation will be suspended at the end of any term in which their cumulative GPA falls below the specified minimum cumulative GPA unless they earn a minimum GPA of 2.0 in that term. A student's first academic suspension will become effective at the beginning of the next term and will remain in effect for that term only. The student may be granted earlier readmission at the discretion of the student's academic dean or the dean's designated representative. The second time a student is placed on academic suspension, the length of the suspension will be indefinite. The student may be con-sidered for readmission after one term and only upon appeal to the students' academic dean or the dean's designated representative. The third time a student is placed on academic suspension, the suspension will be permanent. Any appeals for readmission following a permanent suspension must be initiated at the academic dean's office. The final decision rests with the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost. Academic Amnesty After a four -year absence, a student returning to UHD may petition his or her academic dean for academic amnesty. To be eligible, the student must not have attended any institution of higher education for the four- year period immediately preceding readmission to UHD. In addition, the student also must complete 24 semester credit hours with a minimum grade point average of 2.5 following readmission. The amnesty provision applies only to the application of credit toward a degree and computation of the student's grade point average. No grades on the student's permanent record are altered or deleted. If academic amnesty is granted, all courses with grades of F or D earned prior to readmission are ignored in applying credit toward fulfillment of degree requirements and in future computations of the student's grade point average. A student granted academic amnesty relinquishes all rights to graduation with honors and any other academic recognition based on grade point average. Student Records Transcripts Requests for official UHD transcripts are made online through the MyUHD portal via Student eServices and are processed by the Registrar's Office. All requests for official UHD transcripts will be processed within 2- 3 business days, with the exception of transcripts that include coursework completed at South Texas Junior College, which may take up to 10 business days for processing. Official transcripts from other institutions which are submitted to the Office of Admissions as part of the admissions process become the property of UHD and will not be rereleased to the student unless the request is covered under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Graduation Requirements General Degree Requirements for Graduation For degree completion, at least 25% of the semester credit hours must be earned through instruction offered by UHD. In addition to completion of specific degree requirements, all students must meet the requirements described below. The final 30 semester credit hours of course work toward the degree must be taken at the University of Houston- Downtown. At least 18 of these hours must be at the upper level and be approved by the student's major department. Only the appropriate academic dean may waive any por tion of these requirements and only upon petition by a student who has extraordinary reasons. The University of Houston Downtown limits academic residency to no more than twenty -five percent of the degree requirements for all degrees for active- duty serv ice members. Academic residency can be completed at any time while active -duty service members are enrolled. Reservist and National Guardsmen on active- duty are covered in the same manner. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 calculated on all grades ear ned at UHD is required for graduation. In addition, a grade point average of 2.0 is required for all courses taken at UHD that apply toward the degree. Students enrolled in any degree program at the University of Houston-Downtown who wish to take courses at another college or university (including any other institution in the UH System) and apply the credits toward the degree should consult with their degree program advisor to be sure the courses apply to their degree program. A student taking courses u nder these provisions is responsible for having an official transcript from the second campus for warded the Office of Admissions at UHD. The student also must request that an official evaluation of this transcript be made and reported to the appropriate degree program advisor. Double Majors and Dual Degrees A student can earn two different degrees by simultaneously completing the requirements for two academic programs of study that award different Bachelor's Degrees, such as a Bachelor of Arts (BA), a Bachelor of Science (BS), a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) or a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology (BSET). With each degree, students will also select a major and, thus, will graduate with two majors as well as two degrees. However , the fact that each major is awarded with a different degree establishes students on this path as students seeking a \"dual degree.\" A student can earn a double major by simultaneously completing two academic programs, both of which award the same degree. Examples of majors include English, History, Chemistry, Finance, Accounting, Criminal Justice, and Computer Science. The majors may or may not be housed in different colleges. The fact that each major is awarded under the same degree establishes students on this path as students seeking a \"double major.\" A UHD GPA of 2.5 is required to declare a dual degree or double major, and the declaration must be made before students submit any applications for graduation. Students may not pursue more than two degrees or majors simultaneously. A bachelor's degree contains a minimum of 120 semester credit hours. Students in a dual degree program must complete all courses required for each degree. Each degree must consist of at least 30 unique hours taken in residency at the University of Houston- Downtown, with a minimum of 18 of the unique hours in each program being upper -level and applicable to the upper -level requirements of the degree. Students seeking a double major must complete at least 18 upper -level hours in residency at the University of Houston- Downtown for each major. These 18 hours must be unique to each major and must be applicable to the upper -level requirements of each major. Students should be aware that the state has imposed a limit of 120 hours for all degrees. Students who attempt more than 30 hours above this enrollment cap may be charged out -of-state tuition for th e excess hours. If students declare both degrees or majors at the same time, they must indicate which will be the primary degree or major and which will be the secondary degree or major. The college housing the primary degree or major is the academic home of record. If the second degree or major is declared after the student has already been accepted into one program, the first degree or major is considered primary. Students wishing to have the second declaration considered the primary degree or major must seek permission from the dean of the college housing the new primary degree or major. Students deciding not to continue pursuing a dual degree or double major may opt out of one degree or major by notifying in writing the dean of the college housing that degree or major before graduation is certified. Students who will not be able to meet all of the requirements of one of the degrees or majors by the time of certification will be notified by the dean's representative in their home college. At that point, such students have three options and must state the preferred option in writing to that representative: to get certified in only the completed degree or major to change the uncompleted degree program or major into a minor, if a minor in that area exists to delay any certification until both degrees or majors are completed. Honors of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude will be calculated by an official in the college of the primary degree for dual degrees and the primary major for doubl e majors. The college of the primary degree is responsible for forwarding the needed documentation to determine honors in the secondary degree to the college responsible for the secondary degree plan. College Honors will be determined by an official in the college of the primary degree for dual degrees or the primary major for double majors. The college of the primary degree is responsible for forwarding the needed documentation to determine honors in the secondary degree to the college responsible for the secondary degree plan. Students who successfully complete a dual degree will receive two diplomas, and both degrees and any majors within those degrees will be noted on their transcripts. The transcripts of students who successfully complete a double major will indicate both majors. Additional Bachelor's Degree To qualify for a second UHD bachelor's degree after having been already certified in one bachelor's degree, a candidate must meet the general and specific requirements for each degree. take at least 30 unique hours, including 18 hours needed for the major, in residency for each degree at the University of Houston- Downtown, with a minimum of 18 of the unique hours in each program being upper -level and applicable to the upper- level requirements of the degree. Graduation under a Specific Catalog A student usually graduates under the degree provisions of the Catalog in effect at the time of his or her first completed term of enrollment; where enrollment is defined as registration for and completion of at least one course. Students have the option of graduating under the Catalog in effect at the time of their major declaration or any subsequent Catalog. If degree requirements change during the time of the student's enrollment, the student may be required to meet the new degree requirements if the number of hours the student must take has not increased. Exceptions: No Catalog more than 10 years old may be used. Students who interrupt their program for more than two con secutive long semesters for reasons other than military serv ice shall be governed by the Catalog in effect at the time of re- entry to the university. Students whose enrollment is interrupted by military service must re- enroll within one year from date of separation from the service and no more than five years from the beginning of military service in order to remain under the provisions of the Catalog in effect at the time of original enrollment at the university. Students forced to withdraw for adequate cause before completion of their degree may upon readmission petition to graduate under the Catalog in effect at the time of original enrollment. Students who change their major shall be governed by the Catalog in effect at the time of the change. Applica tion for Graduation All degree candidates must file an application for graduation with their college and pay the $50 graduation fee by the Official Day of Record for the term of intended graduation. The graduation fee covers the costs of processing the graduation application, printing the diploma and mailing it to the graduate, and other costs associated with the commencement ceremony. If students fail to complete all degree requirements during the term in which they applied for graduation and paid the graduation fee, then they must apply for graduation and pay the graduation fee again when they become eligible to graduate. Candidates must also place a diploma order, which specifies how they want their name to appear on the diploma, with the Registrar's O ffice. Commencement Exercises To participate in c ommencement exercises, students must be enrolled in the courses needed to complete all degree requirements and must file an application for graduation with their college, and pay the graduation fee by the second Monday after the last day to drop a course without a grade (the Official Day of Record) for the term of intended graduation. The final decision on eli gibility for graduation and participation in commencement exercises rests with the appropriate academic dean. Commencement participants with honors are so designated in the commencement program and wear special insignia with their academic regalia. As commencement occurs prior to the posting of final grades, the designation of honors for May and December commencement participants reflects only grades earned prior to the final semester. Designation of final honors on the transcript and diploma, however, is based on all work attempted. Arrangements for obtaining academic regalia may be made through the university bookstore. Deadlines for ordering and paying for regalia are announced for each commencement. Undergraduate Academic Programs General Education The granting of a college degree signifies having reached a level of intellectual development that merits formal recognition. Intellectual development can be measured both in terms of depth and breadth of knowledge, and a college degree should signify growth in both dimensions. In most college programs, students demonstrate depth of knowledge by completing courses required in the major field of study. Breadth of knowledge is demonstrated by satisfying a group of general education requirements that are shared by students in all majors. Whereas the aim of the major field of study is to provide experiences defining membership in a disciplinary com munity, the aim of the general education program is to provide experiences that define what it means to be a college- educated person. The centerpiece of the general education program is called the \"core curriculum\" because these courses comprise the core of the c ollege experience. The goals of UH- Downtown's general education program are that graduates will demonstrate: The ability to view events from a variety of perspectives, especially including different historical and cultural perspectives; An awareness of the different ways of pursuing knowledge, including the methods of scientists and of those engaged in the arts and humanities; Knowledge of, and sensitivity to, ethical and moral standards; Knowledge of, and a degree of skill with, new technologies; The ability to communicate clearly and effectively and to use various media to transmit and process information. In order to achieve these goals, the general education component of all degrees earned at UH -Downtown consists of four parts: courses satisfying the common core requirements, appli cation course requirements, enhancement course requirements. Each of these com - ponents is described below: Common Core Requirements Students in all UH -Downtown undergraduate degree programs must complete a common core of courses consisting of at least 42 semester credit hours. If any course taken to fulfill a core requirement has a corequisite, the corequisite course must be taken concurrently. For instance, if a student chose to fulfill the Natural Sciences requirement by taking BIOL 1301, the corequisite lab course, BIOL 1101, would also have to be taken in the same semester. The following table lists the disciplinary components of the core, the number of semester credit hours (SCHs) required in each component, and the UH -Downtown courses that may be used to fulfill these requirements. Departments often suggest certain courses that they prefer their majors to take to fulfill some of the core requirements, so students should carefully study the degree plans that interest them. Degree plans may be found in the sections of this Catalog describing the departments' programs and in degree program brochures available in departmental offices. A student transferring to UHD who has completed the common core requirements at another Texas institution of higher educa tion will receive credit for each of the core courses transferred and will be considered to have fully satisfied all of UHD's com mon core requirements. A student transferring to UHD who has completed some, but not all, of the common core requirements at another Texas institution of higher education will receive credit for each of the core courses transferred and will be considered to have fully satisfied the corresponding common core requirements at UHD. The student must still satisfy any remaining UHD common core requirements. Students concurrently enrolled at more than one institution of higher education should follow the core curriculum require ments in effect for the institution where they are classified as degree- seeking students. DISCIPLINARY COMPONENTS SCHs UHD COURSE OPTIONS Communication English composition 6 ENG 1301, 1302 Speech 3 2307, 2309 Mathematics 3 Any MATH course numbered 1301 or higher Natural Sciences 6 Two 3 -hour courses from BIOL, CHEM, GEOL, MBIO, NS or PHYS that include lab hours or have corequisite 1 -hour labs. Humanities & Visual & Performing Arts Fine Arts 3 One lower -level course from ART, DANC, DRA, MUS or their cross -listed equivalents Literature 3 Any lower -level literature course Social & Behavioral Sciences US History 3 3 HIST 1305 or 1306 HIST Hours 42-43 Time Frame for Completing Common Core Requirements The common core of the general education program is designed to provide students with the academic skills and knowledge that constitute the foundation of a baccalaureate education. The spe-cialized course work taken in the major field of study builds upon this foundation, so it is necessary for students to complete core requirements early in their course of study. Writing and computational skills are especially critical for future academic success. Therefore, in the first semester in which they are eligible to do so, students must enroll in the courses that will satisfy the English composition/rhetoric requirement (ENG 1301 and ENG 1302), and the courses that will satisfy the mathemat ics requirement (any MATH course numbered 1301 or higher), and students must continue to enroll in these courses until they have been successfully completed. Students are encouraged to complete all other common core requirements before enrolling in any upper -division (3000- level and 4000- level) courses. Application Course Requirements The application course requirements are intended to ensure that the communication and analytical skills learned in common core courses are applied and further developed. Application courses are required in the following two areas: Writing Skills In addition to the common core requirements in English compo sition and literature, students must take two upper -division courses that include substantial written assignments. These courses, designated as \"W courses\" in degree programs, assure students of opportunities to use and further refine their writing skills within the context of the major field of study. Nonverbal Analytical Skills In addition to the common core requirements in mathematics and computer literacy, students must take one course that mak es use of the skills learned in these core courses to solve problems related to the major field of study. These courses are designated as \"S courses\" in degree programs. Enhancement Course Requirements Enhancement courses represent another way in which certain objectives of the general education program are embedded in courses beyond those in the common core. Each degree program includes certain courses that (1) give significant emphasis to ethical and moral issues, and (2) engender in students a greater appreciation of their membership in a world community marked by vast diversities of every type. University College B. Christiana Birchak, PhD, Dean William Waller , PhD, Associate Dean Charlie Finch, PhD, Assistant Dean S655, 713- 221-8007 University College houses baccalaureate degrees in applied administration and interdisciplinary studies. Additionally, it offers programmatic resources for students who have yet to declare officially a specific major. Committed to learning across multiple disciplines and from a variety of diverse perspectives, University College fosters the versatility and creativity essential to success in the 21st Century. It maintains various initiatives that assist undergraduate students in making the most of their university experience as they transition into higher education and beyond. Among these academic enrichment programs are Supplemental Instruction, College Success courses, the Freshman Summer Success Program, and Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID). Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEARUP) The GEAR UP Program, federally funded by the U. S. Department of Education, has made possible a collaborative involving Project GRAD, the Houston Independent School District (specifically Davis, Yates, Wheatley, Reagan and Sam Houston feeder patterns), and the University of Houston- Downtown. GEAR UP is designed to better prepare middle and high school students for college through academic preparation programs and scholarships for students, professional development activities for educators, and college access information for students and parents. Programs of Study Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences with a major in Applied Administration Bachelor of Science with a major in Interdisciplinary Studies Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences with a major in Applied Administration (120 hours) Karen C. Kaser , Ph.D. , Tara Nuwal, Ph.D. Mission Statement The Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences with a major in Applied Administration (BAAS -AA) is designed to offer students that have completed the Associate of Applied Science degree (AAS) the opportunity to develop competencies, skills, and the foundation preparation for promotion to administrative and supervisory positions in organizations. Through the completion of the BAAS in Applied Administration, the student is provided the opportunity to acquire knowledge in the areas of program planning and evaluation, supervision and leadership, human resources, budgeting, interpersonal communication skills, change management, information systems, and the development of technology for use in organizational processes. This degree will provide the skills and knowledge for upward mobility into supervisory and administrative positions. Academic Requirements Consistent with the University of Houston-Downtown's commitment to quality undergraduate education, the BAAS in Applied Administration Program adopts this policy regarding admissions, the declaration of majors, course enrollment and requirements for graduation for the BAAS in Applied Administration degree. Admission and Declaration of Major Students who have a GPA of 2.25 or higher at UHD or the last institution attended may be admitted to the BAAS in Applied Administration If they meet the following cri teria: Completion of an AAS degree from a community college, Satisfactory completion of Texas Success Initiative (TSI) requirements, and No transcript or cashier holds. Students may declare their major in Applied Administration if they meet the above criteria. Denial of Admission Students with a GPA of less than 2.25 at the last college or university attended do not qualify for admission to the BAAS in Applied Administration and must meet with University College advisors for course approval s. Satisfaction of Prerequisites Prerequisites are NOT optional; prerequisites ARE requirements or courses that must be completed PRIOR to taking a course. The prerequisites for a course are described in the catalog course descriptions. It is the student's responsibility to insure that he/she meets the prerequisites prior to enrollment in a course. If the student enrolls and does not meet the prerequisites, he/she may be administratively withdrawn from the course at any time. The administrative withdrawal will result in NO REFUND of tuition and fees because it appears that the student knowingly enrolled in the course in violation of catalog requirements. Any variance in prerequisite requirements or this policy must be obtained in writing from the program chair prior to enrollment in the course. Dismissal from the BAAS -AA Program Students admitted to the BAAS in Applied Administration whose overall GPA falls below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters will be placed on academic suspension in accordance with the current UHD Catalog. Students on academic suspension will be dismissed from the program. Students who fail a required course after three attempts will be dismissed from the BAAS in Applied Administration for failure to progress. Course Approvals and Advis ing Students admitted to the BAAS in Applied Administration will be advised by BAAS -AA advisors only. Students with declared BAAS -AA major will be granted self -advising privileges as long as they have completed the 42 hour Common Core, they maintain a GPA of 2.25 or above, and they follow all prerequisites. Students who fail to follow prerequisite requirements will be denied self -advising privileges. This provision applies to students who have not completed the 42 hour Common Core or do not follow advisors' directions. Students who fail to file a declaration of major when eligible will be denied enrollment in courses administered by the BAAS -AA Program until the declaration has been filed. Students in the BAAS in Applied Administration may not enroll in courses in the College of Business BBA programs. Likewise, students in College of Business BBA programs may not enroll in BAAS in Applied Administration courses. Graduation Requirements In addition to meeting the general requirements established by the University of Houston- Downtown for eligibility to graduate, students receiving a degree in the BAAS -AA program must have an overall GPA of 2.0 or better for all courses taken in the BAAS -AA program. The final 30 semester credit hours of course work toward the degree must be taken at UH- Downtown. Prior to the start of the final 30 hours of course work, students, who wish to take Common Core classes at a community college may apply those credits toward the BAAS -AA degree. For degree completion, at least 25% o f the semester credit hours must be earned through instruction offered by UHD. Additionally, 18 of the last 30 hours must be in upper division course work as approved by BAAS- AA Program. Only the Program Chair of the BAAS -AA Program may waive any portion of these requirements and only upon written petition by a student who has demonstrated extraordinary ability. Courses of Instruction Individual courses of instruction are subject to change or cancel lation at any time and may not be offered each semester or every year. Students should be especially mindful that summer offerings are limited and vary from year to year. Therefore, careful planning is required if progress toward the degree is expected during the summer months. Field Experience Field experience integrates theory learned in the classroom with practical work experience in a job related to the student's academic and professional goals. The work experience and the academic experience must be directly related. Positions may or may not be paid and may last the duration of the fall or spring semester or the entire summer. Field Experience generally is not approved for students already employed in their area of study. Eligibility for Field Experience enrollment includes at least 60 semester hours completed in the degree program, completion of additional General Education courses, and a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or prior approval of the director. Submission of applications and other preliminary procedures should be completed during the semester prior to the one in which the student wishes to enroll. The BAAS in Applied Administration program allows up to two courses (6 semester credit hours) in Field Experience to be applied toward graduation requirements. These courses are graded on a pass/fail basis and do not apply toward calculation of the grade point average. Course Requirements for BAAS -AA Major This major integrates the Associate of Applied Sciences (AAS) with the requirements of the BAAS -AA enabling the student to earn a four -year degree with minimal loss of AAS credit hours. Common Core Requirements (42 hours) Check the common core requirements listed in this catalog. Application Course Requirements AA 3302 or ENG 3302 and AA 3307 (see Required Courses below) satisfy the writing skills requirement. The nonverbal analytical skills requirement is satisfied by AA 3306 (see Required Course below). Enhancement Course Requirements The general education requirements related to ethical and moral issues and the world community are addressed by AA 3301 and applied throughout the required applied administration core courses. For the study of these i ssues to be most meaningful, they must be studied in direct relationship with the major chosen by the student. Thus, within the content of each Required Courses, relevant material related to these ethical and moral issues is presented. Courses in Technical in Major from the AAS Degree (36 hours) Applied Administration Major Requirements (30 hours) AA 3301 AA 3302 AA 3303 Professional Ethics Administrative Communication or ENG 3302 Business & Technical Report Writing Information Technology Administration AA 3304 Budgeting for Administrators AA 3305 AA 3306 AA 3307 Human Resources Administration Decision Making Skills for Administrators Administrative Leadership AA 3308 Negotiation and Mediation Skills AA 3310 AA 4305 Administering Organizational Change Project Administration Prescribed Electives (9 hours) Select three courses from AA 4301, AA 4303, AA 4306, AA 4307, AA PSY or POLS 4319. Free Upper Division Electives\u2014 No UHD College of Business Courses (3 hours) Bachelor of Science with a major in Interdisciplinary Studies Melissa Hovsepian , PhD, Program Chair S601, 713- 221-8926 The Bachelor of Science with a major in Interdisciplinary Studies permits students to select those courses that most interest them and to present 36 semester credit hours of those courses as their major. The degree shares the basic core curriculum with other degrees and includes a distribution of courses to ensure a good academic foundation. Since the degree is interdisciplinary, it is often a suitable degree completion alternative for transfer students and for students who wish to pursue a multidisciplinary degree that meets their academic and professional interests. Although a minor is not requir ed, students are strongly encouraged to complete one or more, using the area of concentration as a basis. Graduates are qualified to undertake a variety of employment or community service opportunities and challenges. By careful selection of courses with the help of a college advisor, students who complete the degree can prepare themselves for advancement in their current position, new directions in their career path, and a variety of post - baccalaureate programs. Students should consider taking advantage of the option to complete up to 6 upper -level credit hours of field experience or internship. Program Learning Outcomes Graduates who earn a BS in Interdisciplinary Studies will: Be able to write effectively, using proper grammar and sentence construction; their thoughts will be organized effectively with clear awareness of discourse. Be able to research topics in one or more arts/sciences disciplines and correctly cite and arrange citations Be able to apply disciplinary or interdisciplinary knowledge to an active engagement in workforce, service, or capstone academic experience: internship/business context, service learning, capstone/supervised research experience, or senior- level course project. Degree Requirements The degree requires the completion of 120 semester credit hours. At least 36 hours must come from upper -level course work. A minimum of 9 hours of the Major Requirements must be in the same discipline or area of concentration, but no more than 18 may be in the same discipline or area of concentration.

Each year, the University of Houston- Downtown Chapter invites to membership the juniors in the college who rank in the top 10% of their class and the sen iors who rank in the top 10% of their class who are not already members. Academic Requirements Consistent with the University of Houston- Downtown's commitment to quality undergraduate education, the College of Business adopts this policy regarding admissions, the declaration of majors, course enrollment and requirements for graduation for BBA degree programs. Admission and Declaration of Major Effective January 10, 2010, current students and new transfer students must have a GPA of 2.50 or higher to declare their major in the College of Business. Students currently enrolled at UHD with a GPA of 2.50 or higher on all work at UHD may apply for admission to the College of Business and simultaneously declare a major in business if the following requirements are met: completion of 42 hours of the common core requirements, completion of College Algebra with a \"C\" or higher, satisfactory completion of Texas Success Initiative (TSI) requirements, and no transcript or cashier holds. Joint -Admission community college/UHD students with a GPA of 2.50 or higher at the college/university most recently attended may apply for admission to the College of Business and simultaneously declare a major in business if the following requirements are met: completion of the 42 hours of common core requirements, completion of College Algebra with a \"C\" or higher, satisfactory completion of TSI requirements, and no transcript or cashier holds. New transfer students with a GPA of 2.50 or higher at the college/university most recently attended may apply for admission to the College of Business and simultaneously declare a major in business if the following requirements are met: completion of 42 hours of the common core requirements, completion of College Algebra with a \"C\" or higher, satisfactory completion of TSI requirements, and no transcript or cashier holds. Denial of Admission Students with a GPA of less than 2.50 at the last college or university attended do not qualify for admission to the College of Business and must meet with University College advisors for course approvals. Post -Baccalaureate and Special Stat us Admission Students who hold bachelors or graduate degrees from accredited universities who are not seeking a degree from the University of Houston- Downtown may apply for admission to the College of Business as a special status students prior to enrolling at the University of Houston- Downtown. Students who desire to take courses offered by the College of Business which have been approved by external certification agencies to fulfill their continuing education requirements may apply for admission to the College of Business as special status students. In order to qualify, the applicant must have at least 60 hours of university credit. Additionally, the student must satisfy TSI requirements if applicable. Courses taken by a special status student may not be used to fulfill degree requirements of any degree granted by the College of Business. Transient students who need to take one or more business classes at UHD to complete their degree at another university must obtain prior written approval from their dean to enroll in specific courses which will be used to satisfy graduation requirements. Satisfaction of Prerequisites Prerequisites are NOT optional; prerequisites ARE requirements or courses that must be completed PRIOR to taking a course. The prerequisites for a course are described in the catalog course descriptions. It is the student's responsibility to insure that he/she meets the prerequisites prior to enrollment in a course. If the student enrolls and does not meet the prerequisites, he/she may be administratively withdrawn from the course at any time. The administrative withdrawal will result in NO REFUND of tuition and fees because it appears that the student knowingly enrolled in the course in violation of catalog requirements. Any variance in prerequisite requirements or this policy must be obtained in writing from the department chair prior to enrollment in the course. Dismissal from the College of Business Students admitted to the College of Business whose overall GPA falls below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters will be placed on academic suspension in accordance with the current UHD Catalog. Students on academic suspension will be dismissed from the College of Business. A student who changes his/her major to a discipline outside of the College of Business will be dismissed from the College of Business and their records will be forwarded to the appropriate college. A student who is unsuccessful in a required course after three attempts will be dismissed from the College of Business for failure to progress. College of Business interprets a required course as any course in the Business Core or Major Requirements. Finally, the College of Business will interpret failure to progress as not moving forward in a degree plan. Therefore, in so me majors a \"D\" in a course will be considered unsuccessful if the degree sequence requires a \"C\" or better. An attempt is registered when the student receives either a grade or \"W\" for the course. If a student subsequently seeks readmission to the College of Business, she/he must reapply and meet the College of Business standards of admission in force at the time of reapplication. Course Approvals and Advising All students admitted to the College of Business will be advised by College of Business advisors. Students with declared majors will be granted self -advising privileges as long as their GPA is 2.25 or above and prerequisites are followed. Students who fail to follow prerequisite requirements will be denied self -advising privileges. This provision applies to students who have not completed the 18 hours of required lower division business core classes in MATH, ACC and ECO before attempting upper division courses, or do not follow advisors' directions. Students who fail to file a declaration of major when eligible will be denied enrollment in courses administered by the College of Business until the declaration has been filed. Students not admitted to the College of Business who want to enroll in upper division business courses must have an overall GPA of 2.00 or higher, must meet all the prerequisites for the courses, and must have prior written approval of a College of Business advisor or a designated delegate. The only course that does not require prior written approval of a College of Business advisor is BA 3300 (Business Cornerstone). Students not admitted to the College of Business (non -business majors) will be restricted to a maximum of 18 hours of upper division Business courses. Students seeking more than 18 hours must receive written permission from the Dean of the College of Business. Graduation Requirements In addition to meeting the general requirements established by the University of Houston- Downtown for eligibility to graduate, students receiving a degree in a program administered by the College of Business must have an overall GPA of 2.0 or better for all courses taken in the College of Business at UHD. The final 30 semester credit hours of course work toward the degree must be taken at UH -Downtown. Prior to that time, stu dents who wish to take junior- and senior -level courses at another college or university, including any other campus of the UH System, and apply the credits earned toward their degree, must request approval through the College of Business Student Services Office in Room B101. Courses taken without such approval will not be counted toward the fulfillment of degree requirements. For degree completion, at least 25% of the semester credit hours must be earned through instruction offered by UHD. Additionally, all of the final 30 hours must be upper division course work taken at UH - Downtown. Only the Dean of the College of Business may waive any portion of these requirements. Courses of Instruction Individual courses of instruction are subject to change or canc ellation at any time and may not be offered each semester or every year. Students should be especially mindful that summer offerings are limited and vary from year to year. Therefore, careful planning is required if progress toward the degree is expected during the summer months. Field Experience Field Experience integrates theory learned in the classroom with practical work experience in a job related to the student's aca demic and professional goals. The work experience and the academic experience mus t be directly related. Positions may or may not be paid and may last the duration of the fall or spring semester or the entire summer. Field Experience generally is not approved for students already employed in their area of study. Eligibility for Field Experience enrollment includes at least 60 semester credit hours completed in the degree program, a mini mum cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or prior approval of the department chair in whose area the course is being offered. Other requirements speci fied by the department may impact the applicant's eligibility. Submission of applications and other preliminary procedures should be completed during the semester prior to the one in which the student wishes to enroll. The College of Business allows up to two courses (6 semester credit hours) in Field Experience to be applied toward gradua tion requirements. These courses are graded on a pass/fail basis and do not apply toward calculation of the grade point average. Field Experience credit may NOT be used to satisfy minor program requirements. Minor Program Requirements Additionally, the College of Business offers a variety of minors to complement major programs. Both students pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration degree and those pursuing other degrees offered by the university can select these minors. Students planning to take a minor in the College of Business who are not seeking a Bachelor of Business Administration degree are reminded that in compliance with the accrediting principles of AAC SB-International, the course work taken in the College of Business, including all courses applicable to the minor, is limited to 25% of the credit hours applied toward graduation.

Major in Supply Chain Management (120 hours) Supply Chain Management faculty: Adams, Davis, J., Stading, Zhou Every year more than $1,500 billion of materials are purchased by manufacturing firms alone. Federal, state and local governments purchase another $1,000 billion of goods and services per year. In Hous ton and across the nation, supply management, the acquisition and management of supplies and services, plays an important role in the economy. In the private sector, every dollar saved by purchasing and supply management professionals adds another dollar to profit. In the public sector, every dollar saved by a government purchasing office represents either a dollar available for another project or for tax reductions. Career opportunities in the Supply Chain Management area are available for students with a sound understanding of purchasing and supply management strategies. Hospitals, city and county health departments, public utilities, and such diverse industries as engineering design and construction manufacturing, parts distri bution, chemicals, oil, foods, trucking, pipelines, and retail organizations currently employ graduates of UHD's program. A major in Supply Chain Management combined with a minor in engineering technology, marketing, or management provides a broad background, which can enhance students' career opportunities.

Through the excellence of our faculty in the areas of teaching, scholarship, creativity and service, our mission is to educate students to think critically so that they will then be able to use appropriate communication skills to express effectively their ideas in a variety of media. The critical , historical, and global perspective we offer in the study of languages, rhetoric, and the visual and performing arts is enhanced by courses that offer hands -on applications, including those that incorporate new technologies. Such inclusion further broadens the scope of the liberal arts tradition by taking advantage of contemporary advances to build on past wisdom while anticipating future innovations . Students who wish to pursue a general liberal course of studies may enroll in the program leading to either the Bachelor of Science with a major in Interdisciplinary Studies (see information in the University College section of this catalog) or the Bachelor of Arts with a major in Humanities. Students seeking to work in the communications profession pursue the Bachelor of Arts with a major in Communication Studies. A Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts degree prepares students for careers in the visual and performing arts industry.

Department of Social Sciences Jeffrey Jackson , PhD, Interim Chair N1009, Allen, Anderson, Wright Academic Areas: anthropology, geography, history, philosophy, political science, psychology, sociology Mission and Objectives The Department of Social Sciences is an interdisciplinary department. Faculty teach courses and conduct research in seven academic areas: anthropology, geography, history, phi losophy, political science, psychology, and sociology. In addition to classes in these disciplines, we offer interdisciplinary classes in the social sciences. Currently, seven undergraduate degrees may be taken in our department: History (BA), Philosophy (BA), Political Science (BS), Psychology (BS), Sociology (BS), Social Sciences (BA or BS). Beginning in Fall 2014, SOS will be offering the interdisciplinary Master of Arts in Non- Profit Management. Please come visit us, or call and talk with us about your interests and plans. The department's educational philosophy is holistic, emphasizing the importance of educational and professional growth both inside and outside of the classroom. Our degree programs prepare students in a number of ways: students are provided with job skills relevant to their career aspirations, a readiness for graduate or professional school, and a strong, broad- based background in the liberal arts which is important in the ever- changing social and economic environment. The essential components of the department's mission are community - based research and public service, and these also constitute integral parts of the department's educational program. All of the department's degree programs are designed to develop skills in research and analysis. Students also are strongly encouraged to engage in internships, volunteer service activities, or other degree- related work experiences in which classroom theory can be applied to \"real -life\" problems. The study and practice of the social sciences provide the means for students to unify their learning, since the social sciences, in attempt ing to understand human individuals and institutions, employ both the methodologies of the linguistically -oriented humanistic disciplines and the empirically -based natural sciences. Thus our unique contribution to the intellectual life of the university is to provide the arena in which all viewpoints can meet and exchange.

For all other purposes, contact the Air Force Science program at UH, 713- 743-4932. Col. Phil Bossert, Commander The Air Force Reserve Officer Training (ROTC) program prepares men and women of character, commitment, and courage to assume leadership positions as commissioned officers in the active duty United States Air Force. Upon completion of the curriculum, students will have a thorough understanding of the core values, leadership, teamwork, and other requirements to be an effective officer in the US Air Force. All courses and physical training sessions take place at the University of Houston. Flight orientation occurs at airports in the Houston metro area. Course Credit ROTC classes may be taken for elective credit toward any degree plan at the University of Houston- Downtown. Freshman and sophomore level classes are open to all students. No military obligation is incurred as a result of enrollment in these courses. Junior and senior level courses are more restrictive and do require a military obligation. ROTC scholarship students also incur a military obligation. Four -Year Program The General Military Course (GMC) is the first half of the four -year ROTC program and is taken during the freshman and sophomore years. This program allows the student to experience Air Force ROTC without obligation (unless the student is on an Air Force ROTC scholarship). Each semester of the GMC consists of one classroom hour of instruction as well as Leadership Laboratory each week. During the first two years, the student will learn about the Air Force and the historical development of aerospace power. During the summer preceding the junior year, the student will compete for the opportunity to attend a four -week Field Training Unit. Successful completion of field training is mandatory for entrance into the Professional Officer Course (POC), the junior and senior years of the four -year program. As a junior, the student will study the core values, leadership, teamwork, and management tools required to become an effective Air Force officer. During the senior year students study the national security policy process, regional and cultural studies, and complete final requirements for commissioning as second lieut enants. Enrollment in the POC is open to graduate students if they have four semesters of school remaining. Each semester of the POC consists of three classroom hours of instruction as well as Leadership Laboratory each week. Leadership Laboratory As an Air Force ROTC cadet, each student is required to attend an additional two- hour class known as Leadership Laboratory. Although not part of the academic class requirement, it is an essential element of officer training. Leadership Laboratory is an intensive, military training program in which students gain invaluable leadership and managerial experience while learning about the Air Force way of life. Students have numerous opportunities to hear guest speakers and panel discussions, participate in field trips, and experience practical leadership exercises. AFROTC Scholarship Opportunities Air Force ROTC offers various scholarship opportunities for students at the University of Houston- Downtown: In-College Scholarship Program (ICSP) \u2014is a highly competitive scholarship program aimed primarily at college freshmen and sophomores in any major (students with a bachelor's degree can compete to earn a master's degree).

The professional development sequence of classes include field- based courses that are in selected public schools in several Houston metropolitan districts. Building upon an understanding of cultural, economic, and lin guistic diversity developed through the program's general edu cation requirements and its Urban Education Core, the three professional development semesters provide opportunities for future teachers to: observe and interact with master teachers and divergent learners within the school setting interact with children of diverse backgrounds and experiences to create an understanding of themselves, their own culture, and the cultures of others develop a community of learners which acknowledges the similarities of diverse members and appreciates differences plan and implement effective strategies which ensure aca demic success for all learners, and use technology in effective ways to enhance student achievement. To promote and ensure student success, the design of the curriculum is based on (a) state certification standards , (b) the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills, and (c) the state teacher education proficiencies. It is expected that at the end of the teacher educa tion program, the new teacher will have internalized the state identified proficiencies for teacher education and will successful ly pass the state examinations required for teacher certification. Post -baccalaureate Teacher Certification Post-baccalaureate students seeking certification must meet the requirements for admission to Teacher Education and have a minimum 2.5 cumulative grade point average or a 2.5 overall grade point average in the last 60 hours. Students interested in secondar y certification must also have a 2.5 GPA in their area of specialization. There are three possible post -baccalaureate routes to teacher certification. Alternative Certification Program (ACP) Post -Baccalaureate Plan Teacher certification is avai lable in EC -6 (Generalist), EC -6 (Bilingual), 4-8 (Generalist), and secondary education.

Texas Common Course Numbering System Cross -Reference List TCCNS Course COSC 2425 CS 2410 Course Descriptions Course Credit and Numbering System Progress toward the completion of academic work is measured in terms of semester credit hours. One semester credit hour is normally equivalent to one hour of class work, or from one to six hours of laboratory work per week for a semester. All courses are identified by discipline and number. The first digit of a course number indicates the academic level. Courses in the 1000 series are generally for freshmen, 2000 for sophomores, 3000 for juniors and 4000 for seniors. The 5000 and 6000 series courses are graduate courses. Undergraduates are not allowed to enroll in graduate courses without permission of the academic department which offers the courses. The second digit indicates the number of semester credit hours that the course carries. The third and fourth digits specify a particular course within its discipline. The three numbers in parentheses after each course title indicate the number of semester credit hours, the number of class hours per week, and the number of additional laboratory or activity hours per week. Texas Common Course Numbering System The University of Houston- Downtown is a participant in the Texas Common Course Numbering System (TCCNS). This system ensures that if a student takes a course bearing a common course number at another college or university, UH -Downtown will accept the course in transfer as equivalent to the correspon ding UH -Downtown course. Common course numbers have a four -letter prefix followed by a four -digit number. The four -letter prefix identifies the subject area. For example, ENGL is the common prefix for English courses, and COSC is the common prefix for computer science courses. The four -digit number following the prefix identifies a specific course with the subject area. Each digit in the four -digit sequence gives additional information about the course. The first digit identifies the course as either freshman level (1) or sophomore level (2). The second digit identifies the number of credit hours students earn upon completing the course. The final two di gits indicate the sequence in which courses are generally taken. Thus, French I (FREN 1311) is taken before French II (FREN 1312). In this Catalog, for courses corresponding to those in the TCCNS, the common course number is indicated in parentheses at the end of the course description. The preceding page lists all UH -Downtown courses for which a common course number exists. More information about the Texas Common Course Numbering System is available from the Office of Admissions (Room 326 -South; 713- 221-8533).
