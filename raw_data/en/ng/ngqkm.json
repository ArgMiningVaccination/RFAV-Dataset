Dr [Aniket Joshi](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/aniket-joshi) , principal investigator for the trial at Oyster & Pearl Hospitals, Pune, said participants at the trial have to fulfil two key criteria \u2014 they should have no medical history of [Covid](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/coronavirus) , and must be unvaccinated. \"Pune has been a very active city as far is Covid is concerned, and aggressive with vaccination. Many are either vaccinated or have contracted Covid. Volunteers should be in good general health, which combined with requirements above, could make finding volunteers a tough task. \" Officials said phase three trial of the intranasal vaccine is yet to start, with most study sites currently awaiting approvals from ethics panel. Dr Joshi said Pune had also hit 100% first-dose vaccination coverage late last year. \"So there may be very few pockets in the city with vaccine-naive groups and people who haven't caught Omicron during the third wave,\" he added. One trial site investigator said before Omicron, they would get phone calls from eligible volunteers \u2014 all without history of infection and willing to be part of trials. \"But that may not be the case now,\" the official said. Dr [Joshi](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/joshi) , however, said once the ethics committee approval is in, the hospital trial site will target to recruit nearly 150 volunteers. \"We will do everything we can to find volunteers, because this vaccine trial is very important. The trial will not only estimate blood serum antibodies after the shots, but will also assess vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunogenicity and antigen specific T-cell and [Bcell](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bcell) responses, which could be a pertinent secondary outcome of the study,\" he said. An investigator from a trial site in New Delhi said, \"It may become very difficult to find volunteers for the intranasal's phase three trial because the exclusion criteria states volunteers should not have contracted "}
