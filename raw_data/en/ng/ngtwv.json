Staying at Posada Natura was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had in my life. It was stunning in every way imaginable, from the visual to the emotional and psychological and spiritual. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly and all our needs were taken care of immediately. I felt instantly comfortable in the warm embrace of Posada Natura and the staff. They built this resort stone by stone in one of the most naturally spectacular corners of one of the most beautiful places on earth. The love they put into creating it is evident in everything that happens there. The lodging was fantastic, the service was top-notch, and the food was stomach-rumblingly delicious. Even writing this review has put a soft smile of wondrous remembrance on my face and calmed my heart.

Secluded, sacred, unbelievable nature. The space is open and beautiful with multiple decks and areas for yoga, lounging, reading, hammock-ing, and exploring. The river runs along the property and can be heard from anywhere, a constant soothing reminder of the magic of this place. You can soak in the river, lay, on the rocks, or just marvel at the undeniable sacredness of the jungle in which it runs through.Plus, the staff are extremely kind and humble. Everyone there seems to glow. There is no way to go to Posada and not leave feeling more connected, grounded, and rejuvenated.

I live in Uvita, Costa Rica and had heard through a friend about Posada Natura. It is located about twenty minutes outside of Quepos in the small unpretentious village of Londres. The gated compound is geared for retreats and ceremonial events and includes a large greeting room, a dining room, a spacious elevated yoga deck and a temple. The main structure is perched on a hill overlooking the Rio Naranjo which is easily accessed by a set of stairs that lead down to a natural pool fed by the adjacent river.

This place is truly an amazing resort experience in the heart of the rainforest, off the beaten path, on a pristine river, and conveniently located 20 minutes from Manuel Antonio National Park/Beach, with very comfortable cabins, a restaurant, a pool, yoga decks, and an outdoor restaurant. While staying here, you'll find that you can nourish all aspects of your mind, body, and spirit. We experienced how it feels to be in an edible forest garden, found out how to use certain medicinal plants, and we saw one of the biggest bamboo collections. Well known spices such as cacao, vanilla, cinnamon, lemongrass, and mint were just a few of the many useful plants that abound in the premises. All cabins are situated next to the river where you...
