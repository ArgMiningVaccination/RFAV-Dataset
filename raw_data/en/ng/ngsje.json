Even patients of NDs are often unaware of the plethora of therapies and services NDs are trained in. Naturopathic Doctors attend one of 5 accredited universities in the United States, the two largest being Bastyr University in Seattle, WA and the National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, OR. These doctorate level programs are a minimum of 4 years long with a competitive option for another 1-3 years of residency. Naturopathic medical school curriculum contains the same basic sciences of conventional medical school (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, pharmacology, etc...) as well as additional classes in naturopathic-specific therapies. Examples of these Naturopathic-specific therapies include: nutritional therapies, counseling, botanical medicine, homeopathy, and physical medicine. This education prepares graduates of accredited programs to enter the medical profession as primary care physicians after passing the Naturopathic licensing board exams (NPLEX). There are 17 states (and counting) that provide licensure for NDs currently in the United States. Each of those states governs a different scope of practice for NDs practicing within their state lines. For example, the state of Washington has a rather comprehensive scope of practice, NDs are licensed as primary care providers with prescribing rights for the majority of common pharmaceuticals and have coverage by most insurances in the state. So how does a Naturopathic Doctor practice?Naturopathic doctors follow the same general model as Medical doctors, with extra assessments and therapies incorporated. The process looks something like this: - Obtain a detailed history of the patient's current and past medical issues. - Perform appropriate physical exam to aid in diagnosis - Order any necessary labs or imaging - Determine biomedical assessment and Naturopathic assessment - Decide upon proper Naturopathic and conventional treatment options for the individual patient. - Provide efficient follow up Some special considerations that NDs add to medical assessment include: - General Lifestyle (diet, hydration, exercise, sleep) - Nutritional stress - Chemical and environmental stress - Elimination channels and detoxification processes - Hormonal stress - Mental, emotional, and spiritual health - Structural stress What does this look like at Emerald City Clinic?Emerald City Clinic is a shining example of a Naturopathic primary care practice.
