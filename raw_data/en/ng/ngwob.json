Director Southwest College Research Institute Tempe, AZ (602) 363-9237 kkail@cox.net I would like to thank the Chairman and members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to br ing testimony before you. I am a naturopathic physician and have a fami ly practice in Phoeni x, Arizona. I am a member of the Adviso ry Council to the NIH National Center for Complementary and Altern ative Medicine. I am al so the liaison to the Cancer Advisory Panel for Comple mentary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. I am involved in several multi- specialty health networks and co-ma nage patients with conventional physicians. I am here on behalf of the American Association of Naturopathic Medical Colleges (located here in Washington D.C.) and the Southwest College of Naturopathi c Medicine and He alth Sciences located in Tempe, Arizona. This submission discusses the trai ning, licensure, practice and insurance reimbursement of natu ropathic physicians. Naturopathic physicians provide primary care for patients of all ag es. We utilize conventional diagnostic techniques including physical examination, laboratory evaluation, diagnostic imaging and pathol ogic diagnosis. Assessment may include determination of nutritional status and toxic burden. Additionally, the patient's mental, emotional, social and spiritual status is evaluated. Traditional naturopathic therapeuti cs include lifestyle interventions, the prescription of natur al medicines of animal, mineral and plant origin, therapeutic diet, homeopa thy, physical modalities and counseling. Naturopathic physicians are also trained to provide in office minor surgical procedur es, administer vaccinations and prescribe a range of dr ugs. We refer for eval uation and management by specialists, using the same crit eria as conventional primary care providers. Naturopathic physicians meet public health requirements and in utilizing a prim ary care model, work with a multi-specialty referral network of other provid ers. A natural evolution of naturopathic care models has resulted in the emergenc e of integrated clinics that include the full gamut of licensed provider types (ND, MD, DO, DC, LAc, ARNP, LM, ...). Naturopathic principles of care a nd philosophy serve as the bases for naturopathic practice and guide the pr actitioner in utilizing the least invasive, most efficacious and cost ef fective level of intervention. The goals of care in clude direct patient m anagement, education in self-care, disease prevention and health promotion through restoration of normal physiology to the greatest extent possible. Evaluation and management, as well as procedure codes, ideally describe the actual se rvice provided. It is hoped that an understanding of how natur opathic physicians prac tice will aid in the code development process undert aken here by the committee. Naturopathic Medicine Naturopathic Medicine is a unique an d distinct system of health care that emphasizes the us e of prevention and natu ral therapeutics. The doctors who practice natu ropathic medicine, called naturopathic physicians (NDs), are trained to se rve as primary care general practitioners who are experts in the prevention, diagnosis, management, and naturopathic treat ment of both ac ute and chronic health conditions. In the United States, the naturopath ic profession's infrastructure is based on accredited educat ional institutions, prof essional licensing by a growing number of states, nationa l standards of practice and care, peer review, and an ongoing commitment to st ate-of-the-art scientific research. Modern American natur opathic physicians receive extensive training in an d use therapies that ar e primarily natural and nontoxic, including clinical nutritio n, homeopathy, bot anical medicine, hydrotherapy, physical medicine, and counseling. Many NDs have additional training and certificat ion in acupunctu re and natural childbirth. Naturopathi c physicians practice medicine as primary health care providers an d are increasingly acknowledged as leaders in bringing about progressive changes in the nation's medical system. Without exception, all laws that have licensed naturopathic physicians (both historically and currently) es tablish educational standards that are recognized as the highest ava ilable when the laws were enacted. Naturopathic physicians are trained at accredited, four-year, post- graduate, residential naturopathic medical programs. Today, the highest educational stan dard available for the naturopathic profession is graduation from a four-year, residential naturopathic medical school that has been accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education. The traditionally regulate d scope of practice fo r a licensed naturopath has remained consistent since the profession's founding in the early 1900's although some changes have been made to reflect societal changes and scientific advances. The naturopathic physician's scope of practice continues to include di agnosis and treatm ent of patients by using light, air, water (hyd rotherapy), botanical medicine, homeopathy, clinical nutrition, ph ysical medicine, and lifestyle counseling. Naturopathic medicine is defined by its fundamental principles. Methods and modalities are selected and app lied based upon these principles in relationsh ip to the individual needs of each patient. Diagnostic and therap eutic methods are se lected from various sources and systems, and will continue to evolve with the progress of knowledge. The earliest doctors and healers wo rked with herbs, foods, water, fasting, and tissue manipulation - gent le treatments that do not obscure the body's own healing powers. Today's naturopathic physicians continue to use these ther apies as their ma in tools and to advocate a healthy dose of primar y prevention. In addition, NDs conduct and make practical use of the latest biochemical research involving nutrition, botanicals , homeopathy, and other natural treatments. For many diseases and conditions (a few examples are ulcerative colitis, asthma, menopause, flu, obesity, and chronic fatigue), treatments used by naturopathic ph ysicians can be primary and even curative. Naturopathic physicians al so function with in an integrated framework, for example referring pa tients to an a ppropriate medical specialist such as an oncologist or a surgeon. Naturopathic therapies can be employed within that contex t to complement the treatments used by conventionalphy sicians. The result is a team-care approach that recognizes the best overall treatment most appropriate to the patient's specific medical condition. The current scope of natu ropathic practice includ es, but is not limited to: Clinical Nutrition That food is the best medicine is a corner stone of naturopathic practice. Many medical condi tions can be treated more effectively with foods and nutriti onal supplements than they can by other means, with fewer comp lications and side effects. Naturopathic physicians use di etetics, natura l hygiene, and nutritional supplementation in practice. The discovery of vitamins, minera ls and deficiency diseases in the early part of the 20th century began to provide a scientific understanding of clinical nutritio n. The realizat ion that enzyme systems were dependent on essent ial nutrients provided the naturopathic profession with great insights into the importance of an organically gr own, whole foods diet for health. Nutritional biochemist Roger Williams' formulation of the concept of biochemical individual ity in l955 further developed insights into the unique nutritio nal needs of each individual, how to correct in-born errors of me tabolism, and ev en how to treat specific diseases thr ough the use of nutrient -rich foods or large dosages of specific nutrients. Linus Pauling, two-time Nobel Prize winner, coined the concep t of orthomolecular medicine, and provided further theoretical substantiation for the use of nutrients as therapeutic agents.\" Naturopathic physicians are the on ly health care professionals that meet and exceed the re commendations of formerUS Surgeon General Koop for education in nutrition. Naturopathic physicians frequently use nutrit ional supplements as part of a patient's treatment. The dietary approach to preventi on and treatment of chronic degenerative disease, champion ed for more than a century by naturopathic physicians, has re cently gained the attention of conventional medicine. Each of t he seven dietary guidelines in the 1988 U.S. Surgeon General's report on nutrition and health is a traditional part of naturo pathic practice. More than 40 scientific journals worl dwide are devoted to clinical nutrition, and articles on the therapeutic us e of diet or su pplements also appear regularly in conv entional medical journals. Botanical Medicine Many plant substances are powe rful medicines. Where single chemically derived dr ugs may only address a specific problem, botanical medicines are able to address a variety of problems simultaneously. Their organic nature makes botanicals compatible with the body's own c hemistry; hence, they can be gently effective with fe w toxic side effects. Naturopathic physicians use plant material for food, medicine and health promotion. Formal training includes plant identification, preparation, stor age, therapeutic indications, contraindications and dosing. There is exte nsive contemporary medical literature on medicinal and healing plants. Nothing in naturopathic licensing laws prev ents the use of plant medicines by any other individual or group. Most European countries recognize the effectiveness of medicinal plants, include them in their official pharmacopoeias and regulate them as drugs or over-the-counter remedies. At least 14 scientific journals worl dwide are devoted to the study of botanical medicine. Naturopathic Formulary : Naturopathic form ulary is usually a part of rules and regulations ra ther than law that list those prescriptive substances which naturopathic physi cians use in practice. Much of the prescr iptive pharmacy is based on naturally derived s ubstances. Further, giving naturopathic physicians prescriptive rights saves patients mone y and time by not requiring a visit to anothe r physician when a simple prescription is indica ted. Giving a regulator y board the ability to create the list, the formulary, clarifies to legislators, pharmacists, naturopathic phys icians and other practitioners the legal scope of nat uropathic prescribin g. The list is composed of those substances that are in the traditional pharmacopoeia of nat uropathic medicine. The curriculum of naturopath ic medical schools includes extensive training in clinical pharmacology. Courses cover the use of legend drugs as well as nonpre scription agents, botanicals, antibiotics, hormon es, vitamins and minerals. Homeopathic Medicine Homeopathic medicine is based on the principle of \"like cures like.\" It works on a subtle yet powerful electrom agnetic level, gently acting to strengthen the body's healing and immune response. Homeopathic medicines are made from natural substancesand stimulate the body's immune and defense syst em to initiate the healing process. Naturopathic medical schools teach homeopathic therapeutics as a standard part of the curric ulum. Naturopathic schools offer training in homeopathy to the same high standard of Canadian or European schools. Homeopathy is a system of m edicine more than two hundred years old and there are more th an one hundred homeopathic medical colleges worl dwide. A recent revi ew article in the British Medical Jour nal performed a meta -analysis of 107 controlled clinical tr ials of homeopathic su bstances, and found positive evidence supporting significant and comprehensive review of homeopathic research ever conducted, The Lancet published a meta-analysis of 89 blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and concluded that the homeopathic medicines in the studies had a 2.45 times greater effect than placebo. The authors of the research include Klaus Linde, MD, and Wayne Jonas, MD, former director of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. (The Lancet, September 20, 1997 Various other in vitro or animal studies hav e also demonstrated the effectiveness of homeopathic preparatio ns (Bildet; Poitevin ; Sukul; Wagner). Physical Medicine Naturopathic Medicine has it s own methods of therapeutic manipulation of muscles, bones, and spine. NDs also use ultrasound, diathermy, exercise, massage, water, heat and cold, air, and gentle electrical pulses. Naturopathic Manipulat ive Therapy (NMT) ha s been an integral part of the practice of naturopa thic medicine since the founding of the naturopathic profession, a nd throughout its existence. It is part of every current naturopat hic licensing law. Manipulative therapy is a large, internatio nal, interdisciplinary science practiced by a multitud e of professions. Th is is important to understand because some systems of medici ne want to co-opt manipulative therapy for their exclusive use. The chiropractic system of spinal adjustme nt is only one of many systems of spinal manipula tion, as is NMT. Naturopathic manipulative therapy is perf ormed and prescribed as a \"therapy\". That is, it is used fo r a specified therapeutic effect and is not conceived of as the final act of anatomical approximation of a disp laced bone. Rather, it is conceived of as dynamic process having specif ic therapeutic benefits. The training of naturopathic ph ysicians in NMT and related fields is extensive. Students receive appro ximately 348 hours of instruction in NMT. Of these, 132 hours are devoted strictly to the hands-on learning of techniqu e. In addition, elective course work is available for students wi shing greater expertise in this area. Naturopathic manipulation of the muscles, bones and soft tissues is collectively known as Naturopathic Manipulative Therapy (NMT). Physical medici ne also inclu des exercise therapy, physiotherapy using heat and cold, electrical pulsation, ultrasound, diathermy and hydr otherapy. Such techniques are regularly evaluated in jo urnals such as the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapies . A recent study in England found manipulative treatment to be more effective than orthodox medical treatment for ce rtain kinds of back injuries (Meade). The value of such tr eatments is recognized in other licensed professions such as physical therapy, osteopathy, chiropractic, and massage therapy. Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy is the use of hot and cold water for the maintenance of health and treatm ent of disease. These are therapies that stimulate circulat ion and healing, often with the only other effect being cleanlines s. Naturopathic medicine is in part rooted in the European hydrotherapy movement, centuries old and still thriving. The best-known American hydr opath was John Harvey Kellogg, a medical doctor wh o approached hydrotherapy scientifically and performed many experi ments to determine the physiological effects of hot and cold water. His book, Rational Hydrotherapy , is considered one of th e definitive texts on the therapeutic effects of water. It also has an extensive discussion of the actual techniques. The value of wate r treatments, fasting and rest in treatment for chronic disease is recogniz ed throughout the developed countries in Europe. Ab out a half million Fr ench citizens each year receive insurance reimbursement for medically prescribed spa therapy. Acupuncture and Traditio nal Chinese Medicine Acupuncture and Traditional Ch inese Medicine (TCM) are complimentary healing philoso phy to naturopathic medicine. Meridian theory offers an import ant understanding of the unity of the body and mind , and adds to the We stern understanding of physiology. Acupun cture provides a me thod of treatment, which can unify and harmonize the imbalances present in disease conditions, which, if untreated, can result in illness. The eclectic base of the modern naturopathic practices offers simple, effective acupuncture tr eatments for a wide variety of health problems. NDs are train ed with entry-level acupuncture competency. Many continue stud ies that certify them as specialists. An individual naturopathic physi cian may or may not have the same in-depth training as an acupuncturist, who is the kind of specialist to which referrals are made. Every ND receives appropriate training to utiliz e acupuncture in an eclectic practice. An ND wanting to specia lize in acupuncture will have training similar to any other acu puncturists at t he level required for certification by the National Commission on the Certification of Acupuncturists. All naturopathic physicians are trained at an introductory level in the basics of Oriental medi cine, and about one in five receives further training and specia lizes in it. Oriental medicine has been developed continuously for more than three thousand years in Asia and coexists al ong with conventional medicine today in China and Japan as a primary form of medicine. Dozens of peer-reviewed journals are devoted to the scientific evaluation of Oriental methods, including both acupuncture and botanical medicine. Naturopathic Obstetrics Naturopathic physicians provide natural chil dbirth care in an out-of-hospital setting. They o ffer prenatal and postnatal care using modern diagnostic te chniques. The naturopathic approach strengthens health y body functions so that complications associated with pr egnancy may be prevented. Naturopathic physicians have a long history in safe at home childbirth. Those naturopathic physicians certified in the specialty of naturopat hic obstetrics (natural childbirth) are trained to perform the following: \u0083 Episiotomy, including its repair \u0083 Repair of current obstetri c laceration of cervix \u0083 Repair of other current obst etric laceration (includes only repair of perineu m, vagina, and vulva) \u0083 Circumcision, in newborns only Mind-Body Medicine Mental attitudes and emotional states may influence, or even cause, physical illness. Counseling, nutritional balancing, stress management, hypnotherapy, biofee dback, and other therapies are used to help patients heal on the psychological level. The training of naturopathic ph ysicians includes counseling. The ND must be able to talk with patients in a constructive way about lifestyle, stresses, and habits. As a rule, naturopathic physicians spend one ha lf to one and a half hours with a patient on the first visit. They gather a medical history, as well as a family history. They get data on lifestyle and stress, means of relaxation, diet, and exercise. They ask the patient when each symptom began and what was happ ening in his or her life at the time. They try to uncover the cause or causes of the symptoms or imbalance and to di scover the blocks that keep the patient from necessary chang e. Again, no thing in any naturopathic licensing bill interferes with th e scope of any other practitioner. Naturopathic physicians are trai ned in various psychological techniques, including basic co unseling, stress management, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, and methods of lifestyle modification. A large body of scie ntific literature points to the importance of treatment for psyc hological and somatic factors and coping mechanisms in ma ny illnesses and complaints. Minor Surgery As general practitioners, ND s do in office-minor surgery including repair of superficia l wounds, remova l of foreign bodies, cysts, and other superficial masses. Naturopathic physicians are prim ary care doctor s and need the limited authority to remove fo reign objects (excepting from areas that are higher risk and require specialty training). We take slivers out of kid's hand s. When trained in obstetrics stitching episiotom ies are necessary. Most naturopathic physicians refer most minor surgery. The following represents the ge neral scope of naturopathic minor surgery. All licensable naturopathic physicians are trained to perform the following: A. Operations on skin and subcutaneous tissue 1. Incision of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (example: Aspiration of absce sses, hematomas, and seromas of the nail, skin or subcutaneous ti ssue; incision of pilonidal sinus or cyst; other incision with drainage of skin and subcutaneous tissue [exclude s fascial compartments of face and mouth, palmer and t henar space]; incision with removal of forei gn body form skin and subcutaneous; other incision of skin a nd subcutaneous tissue [exploration of sinu s tracts, skin, and the undercutting of hair fol licles; excludes fascial compartments of fa ce and mouth, pa lmer and thenar space]). 2. Excision or destruction of lesion or tissue of skin and subcutaneous tissue (examp le: Debridement of wound, infection, or burn [includes on ly minor wounds, infections or burns]; removal of nail, nail ed, or nail fold; ligation of dermal appendage). 3. Other local excision or dest ruction of lesi on or tissue of skin and subcutaneous tissue (example includes the removal of moles, warts, and cysts; and the destruction of tissue by cauterization, cryosu rgery, fulguration, or laser beam. Excludes Z- of scalp, including suturing excisions, and minor wounds of the scalp; suture of skin and subcutaneous tissue of othe r sites, including suturing of incision, or destruction of lesion or tissue of scrotum (includes only the treat ments of benign lesi ons such as warts). E. Local excision or destruction of lesion of penis (includes only treatment of benign le sion such as warts). F. Destruction of lesion of cervix by cryosurgery (includes only treatment of benign lesions). G. Hymenotomy H. Excision or destruction of le sion of vagina (includes only treatment of benign le sion such as warts). I. Excision or destruction of vu lva and perineum (includes only treatment of benign lesi ons such as warts). J. Incision or excision of perianal tissue 1. Incision of perianal abscess; 2. Excision of perianal skin tags; 3. Other excision of perianal tissue (includes only treatment of benign lesions su ch as warts). K. Procedures on hemorrhoids 1. Injection of hemorrhoids; 2. Cauterization of hemorrhoids; 3. Destruction of hemorrh oids by cryotherapy; 4. Ligation of hemorrhoids; 5. Evacuation of thro mbosed hemorrhoids. Diagnostic Imaging As primary care practitioners Na turopathic physicians have the need access to diagnostic tool s used routinely in general practice. These includ e x-ray, ultrasound, mammography, etc. Often naturopathic physicians do not perform these tests, but need the flexibility to order them. For example: Naturopaths routi nely do breast exams, pelvic exams and pap smears. Inab ility to order a routine mammogram results in ad ditional cost to a patient if she must pay an MD for the visi t so that a te st can be ordered. It can result in late di agnosis if the patient refu ses to see an MD which some do. Naturopathic physici ans are trained to follow the reports and refer appropriately as would any primary care physician. The training and testing of na turopathic physicians cover all these procedures. Naturopathic Medicine Education The degree of Doctor of Naturopath ic Medicine requires four years of graduate level study in the basic sc iences and clinical medicine, and clinical training. Na turopathic medical colleges are four-year postgraduate schools with admiss ions requirements comparable to those of conventional medical school s. A minimum of three years of undergraduate premedical study is prerequis ite for entry to a naturopathic medical school. The co urse of study is an intensive four-year gr aduate program including approximately 4,500 hours of academic and clinical trai ning. The program lead s to licensure as a Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND or NMD in Arizona). It is important to distinguish certified naturopathic physicians from non- certified who have completed just a short-term course-work mostly by correspondence. Naturopathic medicine is at the forefront of the alternative and complementary healthcare moveme nt as it evolves today, and naturopathic physicians are the most comprehens ively trained doctors of natural medici ne.

Comparing Training in Nutrition Training in nutrition and lifestyle modification, in both classroom and clinical setti ngs, has been part of the co re curriculum of naturopathic physicians since the pr ofession was organized in the United States in 1902.

Naturopaths also practice in other states wi thout official government sanction; however, without licensing standards individuals with little or no formal education may proclaim t hemselves naturopathic physicians without medical school educ ation or boar d testing. The Council of Naturopathic Medica l Education (CNME) serves as the programmatic accrediting ag ency for naturopa thic medical programs. Graduates of four-year progra ms that lead to the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree from accredited or pre-accredited (candidacy) by CNME are eligible to apply for the naturopathic licensing examinations administered by the No rth American Board of Naturopathic Examiners. A licensed naturopathic physician (ND) attends a four-year graduate level naturopathic medical school and is educated in all of the same basic sciences as an MD but al so studies holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with a str ong emphasis on di sease prevention and optimizing wellness. In addition to a standard medical curriculum , the naturopathic physician is requ ired to complete four years of training in clinical nutrition, acupuncture, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, psychology, and counseling (to encourage people to make lifestyle cha nges in support of thei r personal health). A naturopathic physician takes rigo rous professional board exams so that he or she may be li censed by a state or ju risdiction as a primary care general prac tice physician. Twelve states, and Puerto Rico, license naturopathic physicians. Five of these states have continuous ly licensed NDs since the early twentieth century. All the state lice nsing laws include title protection, exam requirements, g eneral qualification requirements, scope of practice definitions , integration into the publ ic health system through reporting requirements, and creati on of peer review mechanisms. An evaluation by an independent body of medical school examiners from the Oregon Office of Educat ional Policy and Planning drew this conclusion: Naturopathic medical college prepares a ND with biological and biomedical education of the same breadth and depth that prepares a MD to be primary care physician. In states that license naturopat hic medicine, NDs refer and co- manage cases with conventional providers, an d are rapidly integrating into the established healthcare delivery system. Complaints are few. Malpractic e awards almost non-existent In every state that licenses naturopa thic doctors, the sa fety record of the naturopathic profes sion is superior to th at of the allopathic medical profession. Since naturopa thic medicine is less invasive therapeutically, it inherently puts the patient at less risk. Further, licensing actually protects the public safety by creating a defined scope of practice, auth orizing regulatory oversight and providing recourse for complaints. Licensed NDs can be held to the same public health and OSHA standards as other licensed health care providers. Licensing NDs is consistent with the current practice of licensing other primary care providers, incl uding medical doct ors, doctors of chiropractic, osteopathic physicians, and licensed acupuncturists, as well as all other health care provi ders including dentists, optometrists, nurses, etc. Th e American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) is the only nati onal professional associ ation in the U.S. for licensed and licensable NDs. The AANP str ongly believes in and advocates for state licensing of na turopathic physicians in all 50 states. Insurance Coverage for Naturopathic Physicians State and provincial government audits, in surance company rate policies, and measures of utilization all find na turopathic medicine to be cost-effective when compared with orthodox medicine and high hospital fees. In 1989, the state of Hawaii audited health costs associated with naturopathic medi cine and concluded that there was no evidence that naturopathic medicine increased health care costs. (\"Study of proposed mandatory hea lth insurance for naturopathic care\", Legislative Audi tor of the State of Ha waii. Report # 89-25, December 1989.) The British Columbia government Medical Services Plan audited naturopathic practice in that prov ince in 1988 (MSP). The audit showed naturopathic medicine to be cost-effective and, Minister of Finance Mel Couveleir concluded: \"The governme nt will attempt to control health-care co sts by emphasizing holistic and preventive medicine.\" Most people (67%) believe the ava ilability of alternative care is an important selection criterion in their choice of a health plan. Landmark Report on Public Perceptions of Alternative Care , 1998, Landmark Healthcare, Inc. Nearly one-half of adult s in the US say they would be willing to increase their monthly health care expenses in order to have access to alternative care. Landmark Report on Public Perceptions of Alternative Care , 1998, Landmark Healthcare, Inc. Audits of naturopathic servic es and surveys of insurance companies have indicated that na turopathic medicine is less expensive than conventional care, perhaps by as much as half. The actual savings may be much higher, because none of the audits measured the long-term effect of th e naturopathic preventive approach in reducing costs associated with serious chronic disease. Naturopathic Medicine: Contribu tion to Health Care Reform , 1993 American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Over 70 companies, un ions and state organi zations have health plans that cover naturopath ic medical services. Naturopathic medicine offers inexpe nsive therapeutic options to over utilized expensive conven tional procedures. Hy sterectomy, prostate surgery, tonsillectomy, myringotom y, and many other procedures have been found by insu rance reviewers and other cost-control experts to be frequently overused (Califano; EBRI; E llwood; Rand). An article in a 1991 issue of the Journal of the Americ an Medical Association suggests that medical costs could be reduced by up to 20% by reducing the rate of inte rventional medici ne and unnecessary surgery (Gleicher). 1. At American Western Life, which grosses 54 million a year, insiders say they are already ma king money with the plan that covers naturopathic se rvices but expect the biggest savings occur in the future because prev entive care will help stave off high priced claims. 2. The inclusion of naturopathic medical se rvices, supported by appropriate state and fe deral laws and regula tions, in the array of medical services offered to consumers, may lower overall health costs through increased competition. 3. More than 90 insurance carriers cover naturopathic medicine in the United States and Canada. Also, state legislatures in Connecticut, Hawaii, and Alaska have mandated insurance reimbursement for naturopathic medical services. 4. The Hawaii state Auditor's office hired actuarial firm, the Wyatt Company, to survey 24 under writers of indemnity medical plans. Wyatt found that most co mpanies do not raise their rates in states where naturopathic physicians are included. Those companies that do raise their rates typically charge an extra one to three cents a month on private plan s, and nothing extra on group plans. 5. There is no evidence th at NDs drive up utilization inappropriately. Patien ts who utilize naturo pathic services in North American see their physici ans about three times per year (AANP). The national average fo r patients who use M.D.S. is between five and six visits per year, and for a chiropractor about eight visits (HCFA). Pati ents' visits remain about the same in states without manda tory insurance reimbursement: 3.5 visits per patient in Washin gton state; 2.5 per patient in Arizona; and 3.6 per patient in North Carolina (AANP). 6. Malpractice suits against natur opathic physicians are extremely rare. Master Insurance Trust repor ts that in a fo ur-year history involving 50 licensed naturopathic physicians only 4 incidents were reported and nothi ng was paid in judgment or settlements. 7. Federal commission studying medical malpractice estimated malpractice costs passed from doctor to patie nt increased 10 fold during the 1970s . These cost have cont inued to ri se with the present 28 billion a year in malpractice representing $400,00 per MD in indirect costs. Medicaid Coverage The majority of state Medicaid pr ograms provide so me coverage of alternative therapies for children in low-income famili es, according to a new study from the University of Michigan. Medicaid representatives from 46 states were interviewed in the study, which reveals that chiropractic is reimbursed in 74 percent of t he states, biofeedba ck in 22 percent, acupuncture in 15 perc ent, hypnosis in 13 percent, and naturopathy in 11 percent. The states, on average, currently spend less than $500,000 per year on alternative therapies for Medicaid recipient s; seven states plan to expand alternative medicine coverage in th e next 3 years.

We want you to understand clearly that this is a lice nsing bill and NOT a bill asking for insurance third party reimbursemen t. Insurance issues include those of liability insurance for the prac titioner and cons umer access to insured naturopathic care. Washingt on State is being watched by the nation following the dire ctive from its insur ance commissioner to cover every category of licensed provider. Th e states of Hawaii, Arizona and Connecticut require in surance parity for naturopathic physicians. In the state of Mont ana the insurance commissioner's policy is that if coverage for prim ary care is provided, naturopathic physicians must be cove red as the law defines them as practicing a primary care system of medicine. It is important in this time of great concern over health care to remember that \"conventional\" medicine is not a health care system. It is at best an early detection an d \"disease management\" system. Because of this, our health care co sts get higher and yet we as a population get sicker. This is why on e out of every three Americans is seeking an alternative approach to medicine (E isenburg, NEJM l993). A naturopathic physician is a prim ary care physician who focuses on wellness and disease prevention. making naturopathic medi cine a service with cost effectiveness making their patients good insurance risks ( coverage ) because they are concerned with prevention; making naturopaths good risks for professional liability insurance because they have clos e relationships with patients, use safe therapies and are not pe rforming invasive procedures; and making naturopathic physi cians an obvious part of any managed care system that seek s to assure quality services while limiting costs. Professional Liab ility Insurance Naturopathic physicians cannot purc hase malpractice insurance in unlicensed states. Wouldn 't it protect your constituents for this coverage to be available? Two U.S. insurance companies pr ovide coverage designed for naturopathic physicians. Master Administrative Services, Inc. administers policies for naturopathic physicians located in states that provide licensure to nat uropathic physicians. The MGIS Companies administered medical -professional liability insurance designed specifically for naturopathic physicians for eight years. They found the loss expe rience for naturopathic physicians compares extremely fa vorably with that of other health care professional classe s. Malpractice insurance rates are generally less than $4000.00 per year , indicating the sa fety of naturopathic treatment as assessed by insurance companies. Master Insurance Trust reports that of the na turopathic physicians for whom MIT provides liability insur ance, there have been only four incidents reported to the compan y for follow-up. However, nothing has been paid in eith er settlements or judg ments on any of these items. \"While this pooling of ph ysicians is much too small to base actuarial considerations, this claims experience is clearly superior.\" (Jeffrey D. Brunken, Program Mana ger, MIT, Letter dated May 21, 1990.) Jury Verdicts Northwest , a legal database which records court cases in Washington and Oreg on, the area of the co untry with the largest number of naturopathic physicia ns, shows no judgments for malpractice against N.D. s since the database wa s started in 1983. One in five M.D.s is sued eac h year in the US (AMA). Naturopathic methods are less likely to cause injury than orthodox methods. Prudent dietary and life style changes, for instance, are unlikely to cause harm. Naturopath ic physicians by philosophy and training use the least invasive means to treat and prevent disease. This results in less inju ry to patients. Naturo pathic physicians also have excellent diagnostic and referra l skills. There is no significant history of complaints against naturopathic physici ans resulting from a missed diagnosis, the most common cause for suits in a general practice. From insuranc e data, it appears that naturopathic physicians as a group know th e limits of their methods an d refer patients to other practitioners or specia lists when appropriate.
