Our formula offers 100% of your daily recommended intake but also ensures maximum absorption into the body. The key to this is a clinically-studied piperine extract (the active ingredient in black pepper). It improves the bioavailability of key nutrients and vitamins and is clinically proven to increase the absorption of vitamin C by 52%. Quercetin dihydrate (a plant pigment and powerful antioxidant) has also been added to increase vitamin C absorption. The boosting blend also contains medicinal turkey tail mushroom (coriolus versicolor), which has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine to treat upper respiratory ailments.

IMMUNITY is 100% of your daily allowance. Most vitamin C supplements are not absorbed properly, passing through the body as urine. Piperine and turkey tail mushroom are proven to increase its absorption by 52%. THE 360\u00b0 HEALTH ROUTINE Our formulas are engineered to work together for long-term benefits. BODY Our immune response is directly impacted by our stress levels, so to avoid sickness, the mind and body should be supported synergistically. It's why we recommend pairing IMMUNITY with our stress-reducing multivitamin MOOD: the mind and body are strongly interlinked, and only by taking a 360\u00b0 approach to our self-care routines can we ensure a happier, healthier future.
