How to store Remicade 6. Conte nts of the pac k and other information 1. What Remicade is and what it is used for Remicade contains the active substance infliximab. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody - a type of protein that attaches to a specific target in the body called TNF (tumou r necr osis fact or) alpha. Remicade belongs to a group of medicines called 'TNF blockers'. It is used in adults for the following inflammatory diseases: Rheumatoid arthritis Psoriatic arthritis Ankylosing spondylitis (Bechterew's disease) Psoriasis. Remic ade is also us ed in adults and children 6 years of age or older for: Crohn's disease Ulcerative colitis. Remicade works by selectively attaching to TNF alpha and blocking its action. TNF alpha is involved in inflammatory processes of the body so blocking it can reduce the inflammation in your body. Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory disease of the joints. If you have active rheumatoid arthritis you will first be given other medicines . If these medicines do not work well enough, you wil l be giv en Remicade which you will take in combination with another medicine called methotrexate to: Reduce the signs and symptoms of your disease Slow down the damage in your joints Improve your physica l function. 2 Psoriatic arthritis Psoriatic arth ritis is an in flammatory disease of the joints, usually accompanied by psoriasis. If you have active psoriatic arthritis you will first be given other medicines.

Patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have had the disease for a long time, may be at higher risk of developing lymphoma. Children and adults taking Remicade may ha ve an increased risk of developing lymphoma or anothe r cancer . Some patients who have received TNF -blockers, including Remicade have developed a rare type of cancer called h epatosplenic T- cell lymphoma . Of these patients, most were teenage boys or young me n and most had either Crohn's disease or ulcera tive c olitis . This type of cancer has usually resulted in death. Almost all patients had also received medicines containing azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in addition to TNF-blockers. Some patients treated w ith infliximab have developed certain kinds of skin c ancer. I f there are any changes in your skin or growths on the skin during or after therapy, tell your doctor. 4 Some women being treated for rheumatoid arthritis with Remicade have developed cervical cancer. For women taking Remicade including those over 60 years o f age, your doctor may recommend regular screen ing for cervical cancer.

Children and adolescents The information above also a pplies to children and adolescents. In addition: Some children and teenage patients who have received TNF -blockers such as Remicade have developed cancers, including un usual types, which some times resulted in death. More childr en taking Remicade developed i nfections as compared to adults. Children should receive recommended vaccinations before starting Remicade treatment . Children may receive some vaccines during t reatme nt with R emicade but sh ould not receive live vaccines while using Remicade. If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor before you are given Remicade. Other medicines and Remicade Patients who have inflammatory disease s already take medicines to t reat their problem. These medicines may cause side effects. Your doctor will advise you what other medicines you must keep using while you are having Remicade. Tell your doctor if you are using or have recently used any other medici nes, incl uding any othe r medicines to rheumat oid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis or medicines obtained without a prescriptio n, such as vitamins and herbal medicines. In particu lar, tell your doctor if you are using any of the following m edicines: Medicines that af fect your immune system. Kineret (anakinra). be used together. Orencia (abatacept).

PIL.REM.22.GB.8193.Art61(3).No RCN12 The follow ing information is intended for healthcare pr ofessionals only: Patients treated with Remicad e shou ld be given the patient reminder ca rd. Instructi ons for us e and handling - st orage conditions Store at 2 \u00b0C-8\u00b0C. Remicade may be stored at t emperatures up to a maximum of 25\u00b0C for a single period of up to 6 months, but not exc eeding the original ex piry d ate. The new e xpiry date must be wr itten on the carton. Upon removal from refrigerated storage, Remicade must not be returne d to refrigerated storage. Instructions for use and handling - reconstitution , dilution and administrat ion In order to improv e the traceability of biological medicin al products, t he tradena me and batch number of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorde d. 1. Calculat e the dose and the number of Remicade vials needed. Each Remicade vi al con tains 100 mg inflix imab. Cal culate the total volume of recon stituted Remic ade solution required. 2. Under aseptic conditions, reconstitute each Remi cade vial with 10 ml of water for injections, using a syringe equipped with a 21- gauge (0.8 mm) or sm aller needle. Remove flip -top from the vial a nd wipe the top with a 70% alcohol swab. Inse rt the syringe need le into the vial through the centre of the rubber stopper and di rect the stream of water for injections to the glass wall of the vial. Gently swirl the solution by rotating the v ial to dissolv e the lyophilised pow der. Avoid prolo nged or vigorous agitation. DO NOT SHAKE. Foaming of the solution on reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 minutes. Check that the so lution is colourless to l ight yell ow and opal escent. The solution may develop a few fine translucent particle s, as infliximab is a protein. Do not use if opaque particles, d iscolouration, or other foreign particles are present. 3. Dilute the total volume of the reconstituted Remi cade solu tion dose t o 250 sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusi on. Do not dilute the reconstituted Remicade solution with any other diluent. T he dilution can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of the sodiu m chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solut ion for infusi on from the 250- ml gla ss bottle or infusion b ag equal to the vol ume of reconstituted Remicade. Slowly add the total volume of reconstituted Rem icade solution to the 250- ml infusion bottle or bag. Gently mix. For volumes greater than 250 ml, either use a la rger infusion bag (e. g. 500 ml, 1000 ml) or use multiple 250 ml infusion bags to ensure that the concentration of the infusion s olution does not exceed 4 mg/ml. If stored refrigerated afte r reconstitution and di lution, the infusion solut ion m ust be allowed to equilibrate at ro om temperature to 25\u00b0C for 3 hours prior to Step 4 (infusion). Storage beyond 24 hours at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C applies t o preparation of Remicade in the infusion bag only. 4. Admi nister the infusion sol ution over a period of no t less than the infu sion time recommended . Use only an infusion s et with an in -line, sterile, non- pyrogenic, low protein- binding f ilter (pore size 1 .2 micrometr e or less). Since no preservative is present, it is recommended that th e administration of the s olutio n for infusion is to be started as s oon as possible and wit hin 3 hours of reco nstitution and dilution. If not used immediate ly, in use storage times and cond itions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would nor mally not be longer than 24 hours at 2\u00b0C-8\u00b0C, unless reconstitution/ dilution has been take n place in controll ed and validated aseptic conditions.
