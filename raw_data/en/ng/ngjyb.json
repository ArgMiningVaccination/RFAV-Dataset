Today's airfreight logistics capacity is designed to meet planned programs of vaccination distributions in designated countries. In order to upscale to the capacity required to address global distribution of COVID -19 vaccine s adapting infrastructure , processes and resources are critical to respond effectively to the huge global logistical challenges . Governments, supply chain partners, humanit arian organi zations and pharmaceutical manufacturers must collaboratively prepare themselves for a widespread global coordinated response to distribute vaccines to where they are needed in a timely, safe and secure manner . All countries and territories are imp acted , either as a receiver or supplier of vaccines . The challenge for the supply chain stakeholders is to plan and execute a global network delivery mechanism for the COVID -19 vaccines and associated medical and logistical suppl y chain support ing the vacc ine, life science and pharmaceutical products . This will be on a n unprecedented scale ; such is the anticipated global demand for COVID -19 vaccines . The global supply chain is complex , diverse and fragmented. The COVID -19 crisis has exposed the strengths and weaknesses of the different systems in place . This, however, enables opportunities and innovation. IATA has called for increased collaboration as well as cooperation and communication acros s all parts of the supply chain to ensure the contin uous flow of life science supplies and to move vaccine s on a global scale in a safe , secure and controlled environment. More than ever supply chain stakeholders will have to share information on their processes and strategies because of the levels of uncer tainty . This includes where and how the vaccines will be manufactured , from where, to where will they need to be transported, under which conditions will they have to be handled and how will they be secured . To ensure industry collaboration , stakeholders across the air cargo supply chain must m ove away from bilateral relationships and start to foster multilateral partnerships. This will ensure that all parties involved are aware and understand what is at stake, learn from each other , establish best practic es, align priorities and processes as well as make better use of the information in the segment in which they are operating. The air cargo industry is playing a key role in facilitating this global challenge while instilling public trust and c onfidence that air transport provide s a safe, reliable and trusted force multiplier . There are several scenarios that stakeholders in the supply chain are currently exploring and implementing. We encourage evaluations of possible scenarios be done taking into consideration the need for a risk-based approach during the process . However, the main challenge is undoubtedly to respond to uncertainties , unkno wns, and evolving issues . In that regard, IATA is facilitat ing the sharing of accurate and timely information to the industry to minimize potential distribution challenges and to meet the demand for vaccines, health, and humanitarian supplies , even as e -commerce and other commercial needs demand additional cargo capacity . IATA is collaborating with several leading authorities and organizations and global humanitarian agencies, such as the Internatio nal Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) , United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) , World Food Programme (WFP), World Health Organizatio n (WHO), International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), Pan Ame rican Health Organization (PAHO), UK Civil Aviation Authority - Aviation Security , World Bank , World Customs Organization (WCO) , World Trade Organization (WT O), International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) who have unique expertise in different aspects of planned vaccination distribution programs and in regional, national and pan region community humanitarian response. A joint informatio n sharing forum has been established to facilitate and ensure industry preparedness . This document is about planning, preparing and looking at the global considerations as well as draw upon the lessons learned during the crisis , set a precedent for the fu ture and identify how the existing procedures can be efficiently adapted to ensure the fast and safe movement of products using a risk-based approach. Although the set of considerations are for the distribution of COVID -19 vaccines, the current capacity re quired for routine immunizations must be protected and overall capacity expanded to accommodate COVID -19 vaccines. This document was subject to regular review and revision as add itional information and best practices are made available by the vario us stakeholders. 6 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 This 5th edition will be the last edition that will be released as this document served the purpose of sharing information to facilitate targeted and comprehensive planning with industry stakeholders, to ensure full preparedness when va ccines for COVID -19 are approved and available for distribution . 7 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 1. Constraints, Assumptions and Risks As supply chain stakeholders prepare them selves for the upcoming cha llenges, there are many constraints, assumptions and risk s that have been identified to date and that will have to be overcome to achieve the common objective of effectively and efficiently supplying globally the necessary medical needs of the global population. 1.1. Constraints There are multiple constraints and challenges already identified that all those involved in the production, multimodal transport, storage, distribution and disbursement of vaccine will need to address in order to deliver vaccines to where they are needed and minimise wastage and loss. Considerations include: - Preparat ion time for companies to be ready and capable to resp ond swiftly, in an agile and adaptive and fully compliant way; - Number of doses of vaccines required as well as the overall weight, size and volume of shipments; - Product shelf life, handling and storage environment; - Need for u ninterrupted temperature -contro lled management across the supply chain to align with manufacturers' requirements ; - Handling and temperature transport requirements as well as conditions of vaccines ranging from deep frozen at -80C to t he range of +2C to +8C ; - Multiple COVID 19 vaccines wit h different storage and handling requirements; - Availability of specialized temperature -controlled, infrastructure, facilities, equipment and dedicated resources such as specialist staff ; - Storage and handling facilities, national, regional, sub regional, w ith replenishment supply frequency determined by adequate temperature -controlled storage facilities ; - The establishment of national vaccine distribution and delivery facilities, temporary or permanent, a nd the daily volume capacity ; - Need for peripheral medical equipment and PPE required by each vaccine disbursement facility ; - Return or disposal logistics associated with empty vaccine vials and used PPE and other medical equipment requiring disposal ; - Compl iance with the respective quality and regulatory requirements and air transport regulations (e.g. requirements for correct process, the method of refrige ration used , for the type of batteries applied in track and trace solutions or other equipment or devic es); - Need for i ntegrated multimodal transport to strengthen the network and the delivery ; - Integrated IT systems ; - Applicable g overnmental requirements (e.g. customs, security, public health authority etc.) ; - Need for p riority customs clearance; keeping physi cal examination and/or sampling of goods by customs only in exceptional circumstances; ensuring that inspections by other government agencies and inspections by customs are coordinated and, if possible, carried out a t the same time; - Need for e fficient and coordinated move of goods across borders ; - Quality and availability of transport connection and/or land -based networks with in countries/regions ; - Lack of e ffective cross -functional / cross -departmental and cross -organi zational coordination'; - Need for a ppropr iate support and commitment (from senior management or government authorities) to prioritize sensitive shipment movements; - Required p rocesses that can demonstrate fully auditable end -to-end integrity of consignments ; - Other, non -medical consignments ( such a s e-commerce) will compete for limited cargo capacity, even if they are lower priority; - Capacity constraints due to the large volume of COVID -19 vaccines could curtail transport of other medical goods, including radi opharmaceuticals; - Document accuracy and completeness . 8 Guidance for Vac cine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 1.2. Assumptions Based on the existing information , the following non -exhaustive needs and/or requirements are presented that should be realized to have a successful global roll -out: - Pharmaceutical companies will be able to produce the quantitie s and the quality required to meet global vaccine demands ; - National regulatory agencies will adopt fast tracked approval certifications for vaccines ; - Manufacturing of vaccines will be carried out over time at different locations in the world, meeting the number of doses required globally ; - Aid and public health agencies will be able to mobilize and implement a global delivery mechanism covering the 200+ countries and territories impacted by COVID -19; - Access to vaccine or its components will be equitably sha red amongst nations; - A supranational body will help coordinate and regulate the trade, availability and access to this critical lifesaving product globally through public health intervention in response to such a pandemic crisis ; - Border agencies will ensur e effective and expeditious declaration and clearance; - Airlines can immediately make available required capacity to respond to the identified demand; - Vaccines and related supplies will be moved safely , securely , efficiently, and smoothly across air cargo supply chain s; - Ability to track and guarantee end -to-end quality of vaccines during transport through digital sensors and monitoring, whether through data loggers or real time sensor access ; - Temperature -controlled supply chain solutions will ensure product integrity is maintained , even in hot climates ; - Sufficient and appropriate temperature -controlled equipment (e.g. active/passive and aircraft/non - aircraft temperature -controlled containers) are available; - Handling and transport personnel will be appropriat ely trained and qualified to handle time and temperature sensitive products; - The temperature -controlled supply chain will be capable of storing, handling and transporting large scale of vaccines over time; - Airports and cargo handling capacity (e.g. facilit y, processes, trained staff) to accommodate sudden increase of extraordinary import / export flow of temperature -sensitive products and medical supplies - Ground based distribution networks will be capable of guaranteeing temperature integrity at destination as well as on the last mile of delivery ; - Governments and health authorities will identify and communicate replenishment quantities required to enable effective continuous ground support operations; - Supply chain stakeholders can provide end -to-end data con nectivity to ensure transparency, visibili ty and predictability; - The COVID -19 vaccines will be shipped at the agreed prioritization and time frame; - New COVID -19 vaccines will continue to emerge, and current ones may be modified to have less stringent trans port requirements for easier, less costly shipping ; - Other cargo not be ing unnecessarily displaced . 1.3. Risks When transporting temperature sensitive pharmaceutical products, quality assurance is the key and cannot be jeopardized. Therefore, mitigat ing the im pact of logistical constraints in company's strategies is crucial . This involves identifying risks for each segment in the supply chain and analyzing these in a risk -based approach and designing the controls to mitigate these risks. Engage ment with busines s partners to work collaboratively is essential, and where available, adopt the best practices that are developed from the lessons learned . Operational risks - Scarcity of air cargo capacity ; - Unavailability of quality air service provider to conflic t zones and to remote destinations; - Missing of adequate ground handling equipment outside main airports; 9 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 - Delayed / cancelled flights ; - Unannounced deliveries ; - Breakdowns in operational processes ; - Regulatory non -compliance ; - Unsecured environment ; - Acts of unlawful interference ; - Unavailability of temperature -controlled environment ; - Closure/limited operation of airports ; - Seizure of goods by governments in export and transit port ; - Duration of the transport journey ; - Delay in the shipment due to non -compliance with the D angerous Goods Regulations (DGR) . Product risks - Absence of stability data and experience of new product development ; - Integ rity of the product and s ecurity of doses ; - Lack of specialized packag ing to protect product ; - Scarcity of raw materials or active pha rmaceutical ingredient (API) to manufacture biologicals and sensitive pharmaceutical products . People - Limitations of available manpower ; - Lack of appropriate training and relevant knowledge ; - Insider Threats. Information - Lack of coordinated approach and i nformation sharing, unclear instructions and requirements from the manufacturers, unclear instructions and requirements from temperature -controlled equipment manufacturers, etc; - Lack of reliable document and data exchange between stakeholders and lack of f ull supply chain data visibility ; - Lack or unclear instructions for handling, transporting, delivering and storing biologicals and sensitive pharmaceutical products . Execution - Lack of all -party collaboration ; - Broken or unstructured communication channels ; - Prioritization of shipments ; - Lack of preparedness for receiving shipments ; - Administrative blockages ; - Lack of transparency in decision making processes. 10 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 2. Community Engagement and Collaboration IATA has been engaging over the last month s with a number of international organizations as well as authorities to seek how critical information can be consolidated and collaboratively shared , to ensure appropriate planning across the temperature -controlled supply chain, from manufacturer to end patient. Working i n a collaborative approach takes place also in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a universal call to action to improve the lives an d prospects for everyone everywhere on a sustainable path to 2030 , especially consideri ng the importance of \"Partnerships for the Sustainable Development Goals - SDG 17 . The rol e of each organization varies while sharing a common objective . 2.1. International Civil A viation Organization (ICAO) In addressing the acute challenges COVID -19 continues to pose to civil air transport of both passengers and cargo on global scale, ICAO has p artnered with its Member States, UN agencies, international and regional organizations, and industry. This partnership is primarily materialized through its Council Aviation Recovery Task Force (CART) and has resulted in a set of recommendations and techni cal guidance contained in the CART Reports and \"Take -Off Guidance Document\" respectivel y. Additional joint statements and coordinated action with other UN agencies, as well as international organizations , have also contributed to ensuring essential connect ivity and support to global supply chains Since the early days of the pandemic, ICAO h as provided States the technical guidance to enable flights and their crews to have the needed flexibility to undertake their essential duties in transporting quickly critical humanitarian personnel and cargo acr oss vast distances. It has provided relief t hrough alleviations to the Standards of its Annexes to the Chicago Convention as interim measures to support continued operations during the initial stages of the COVID -19 pandemic. Further, its contributions, su ch as the Public Health Corridor (PHC) conce pt, are critical elements for restoring flows of passengers and goods by air and for reducing contamination risk for shipments through increased use of contactless tools and procedures. ICAO guidance specific to the transport of COVID -19 vaccines is public ly available here , as well as in Section 6 of this document . Ultimately, ICAO will play a key role in restoring and further growing air transport so that it continues to provide needed air connectivity for passengers and cargo \u2014both humanitarian and commercial \u2014to drive global economic recovery. 2.2. International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) FIATA is the global voice of the freight forwarding and lo gistics industry and works in close collaboration with various stakeholders at the international level. With its unique focus on all modes of transport (air, rail, road, sea), FIATA has a leading ro le to play in ensuring optimal and integrated multimodal t ransport solutions which will be crucial for the effective transportation and last mile delivery of the future COVID -19 vaccines. Access to and from airports and the improvement of land -based infras tructure are just initial examples to ensure seamless tran sport of supplies. FIATA has been working closely with its members and other stakeholders active in the world's supply chains throughout the COVID -19 pandemic to ensure aligned and appropriate resp onses at the international and national levels. This inclu des working to ensure a level playing field that allows for a fluid and well -functioning supply chain, encouraging the adoption of appropriate border clearance and trade facilitation measures, and pursuing digital solutions to expedite information flows an d data sharing. FIATA is currently active in policymaking discussions with other international organisations to ensure appropriate infrastructure and legal frameworks are in place to strengthen mult imodal transport, building on lessons learned from the COV ID-19 11 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 pandemic. An inclusive approach will be key to developing a resilient supply chain that can withstand heightened demand. FIATA has published a paper containing considerations on the effectiv e delivery of the COVID -19 vaccines, which is available here as well as in Section 6 of this document . 2.3. International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufa cturers and Associations (IFPMA) IFPMA represents the research -based biopharmaceutical companies, and regional and national associations across the world. We facilitate collaboration, dialogue, a nd understanding within our industry and with other internati onal stakeholders in the health community. We bring the industry and broader health community together to promote policies that foster innovation, resilient regulatory systems and high standards of quality, uphold ethical practices, and advocate sustainabl e health policies to meet patient and health system needs. 2.4. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) PAHO/WHO is providing direct emergency response to Ministries of Health and other nati onal authorities in the Americas, for surveillance, laborator y capacity, support health care services, infection prevention control, clinical management and risk communication; all aligning with priority lines of action. The Organization has developed, pub lished, and disseminated evidence -based technical documents t o help guide Member States 'strategies and policies to manage this pandemic in their territories. As part of this response, PAHO is procuring PPES, diagnostics kits, syringes, cold chain equipme nt, waste management supplies and vaccines on behalf of the c ountries of Latin America and the Caribbean. PAHO is supporting the equitable access to Covid -19 vaccines, preparation to implement vaccination, and co -leading (along with UNICEF) procurements e fforts on behalf of COVAX Facility, with PAHO responsible for countries in the Americas. 2.5. United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF ) To ensure global equitable access to the COVID -19 vaccines, UNICEF is leading the procurement and supply of vaccine on behalf of the COVID -19 Vaccine Global Acc ess Facility (COVAX Facility), led by Gav i - the Vaccine Alliance , the World Health Organizatio n (WHO ) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) . In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund , UNICEF is leading the procurement and delivery for 92 low- and lower middle -income countries while also supporting procurement for more than 97 upper -middle -income and high -income nations. Together, these represen t more than four -fifths of the world's population. When a safe and effective vaccine is approved by WHO, UNICEF will begin the operation to transport vaccines from manufacturers to countries. The initial 2 billion doses are intended to protect frontline he alth care and social workers, as well as high risk and vulnerable people. In view of its globa l logistics preparedness efforts, UNICEF has established a mix of logistics solutions to optimize the existing commercial cargo capacity based on the size of CO VAX shipments to optimize the costs of chartering and has already have pre -negotiated competitiv e rates from all origins to all advance market commitment countries destinations. The choice of the solution is highly dependent on the size of shipment s, origi ns and destinations and the mapped solutions can range from the use of existing cargo airfreight capacity, to full or part charters and milk runs depending on the scenario. 12 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 Besides the mere delivery of vaccines, the end -to-end supply chain coordination requires a thorough planning from allocation to delivery in country with a focus on timing supply availability at the upstream supply chain, to verifying the country's absorpti on capacity prior to shipment of vaccines downstream. This requires a close coor dination and product expertise between manufacturers, the shipping setup on the one hand and our country in country logistics points on the others to reinforce the COVAX princi ples of \"no doses laying around\" and \"0 Therefore, the end -to-end supply chain focus under UNICEF's oversight enables a synchronized approach of movement of devices, PPEs and cold chain equipment. This is of paramount importance to ensure all COVID -19 supplies required for the initiation of vaccine campaigns are received in -country prior to arranging the shipments of vaccines, particularly in AMC countries under the COVAX Facility. As the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, UNICEF has a uniq ue and longstanding expertise in procurement and global logistics to help gover nments to address children in need. On a yearly basis, UNICEF procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines for routine immunization and outbreak resp onse on behalf of nearly 100 countries . Up-to-date information on the distribut ion and market developments of the COVID -19 vaccines with status on COVAX roll -out, can be found by accessing the COVID -19 Vaccine Dashboard here . 2.6. World Customs Organization (WCO) As the only international organization with competence in Customs matters, representing more than 180 Customs admini strations across the globe that collectively process approximately 98% of world trade, the World Customs Organization has a leading role to pla y to ensure that the temperature -controlled supply chain can deliver the required medical supplies across border. During the early stage of the COVID -19 pandemic, the WCO played a key role in reminding the global Customs community to apply internationally agreed procedures and processes to facilitate the cross -border movement of goods, conveyances and crew. This orga nization also supported WCO Members preparedness for the COVID -19 related challenges (border closures, travel bans, export restrictions, social distancing, lockdowns and closures of non -essential businesses, etc.) by taking several initiatives to gather an d communicate as much information as possible. The same approach is being applied to the vaccine distribution effort. 2.7. World Health Organizati on (WHO ) The World Health Organization (WHO) and their partners work together on tracking the pandemic, advising on critical interventions, distributing vital medical supplies to those in need and racing to find a vaccine. The WHO launched in April COVAX, bringing together governments, global health organiza tions, manufacturers, scientists, private sector, civil soc iety and philanthropy, with the aim of providing innovative and equitable access to COVID - 19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. 2.8. World Trade Organization (WTO) The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the global international organization which coordinate s trade rules between member governments with the primary mission to facilitate cross -border trade flows. In response to this unprecedented economic and sanitary c risis, the WTO is actively informing, guiding and communicating with its members as well as the wide trade community to lessen disruptions caused by the pandemic. Working towards the reestablishment of normal economic trade flows and improved access to suc h vital goods, the WTO is advocating for the full implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitati on Agreement (WTO TFA), widely recognized as a catalyst to the recovery, specifically for developing and least developed countries. The WTO Trade Facilitation Agree ment Facility assists developing, and least developed countries find the support they need t o implement this Agreement. Simultaneously, the WTO is collaborating with other international organizations such as the WCO and the WHO to facilitate the distributi on and access of pharmaceutical, life science and medical products across borders. 13 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 2.9. World Food Programme (WFP) The World Food Programme (WFP) is the world's largest humanitarian organization with a vast operational footprint spanning 86 countries. On any given day WFP has 30 ships at seas, over 5,000 trucks on the road and nearly 100 aircraft i n the sky transporting food and other assistance. WFP also manages services in support of the wider humanitarian community, namely the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depots and the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service, is the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster and is the only UN agency with the mandate and expertise to operate aircraft on long term lease and fly to conflict and remote destinations. This is how WFP became the main provider of logistics services for the humanitarian community, stepping up as needed to enable partners' response. At the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic, WFP quickly stood up a system to deliver critical health supplies and tran sport personnel around the globe. A network of hubs and airlinks was established which becam e the backbone of the COVID -19 Supply Chain System, moving cargo and passengers when commercial airlines were grounded. As of 13 January, WFP has reached 171 coun tries, with over 140,000 m3 of critical health and humanitarian items and has transported ov er 27,000 passengers to 68 destinations around the world, supporting almost 400 organizations. WFP requested special authorizations and clearances to open national airspaces, otherwise closed to commercial options, for the passenger flights, which were app roved and implemented following strict health measures and the latest COVID -19 guidance. As the COVID -19 response keeps evolving, WFP continues to engage with par tners to assess supply chain gaps and needs. Beyond the response, WFP is working on its long -term preparedness capacity to support the humanitarian and health community to respond to health emergencies and crises through a strengthened cold chain and tempe rature control service for temperature sensitive products, including health and nutrition it ems, which, if required, may be used to support global and country efforts to deliver the COVID -19 vaccine. On the 15 of March, the first shipment of COVID vaccine was flown to Somalia through WFP managed UNHAS (United Nations Humanitarian Air Service). 14 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 3. Industry Preparedness The a ir cargo supply chain plays a key role in the distribution of vaccines in normal times through well -established global time - and temperature -sensitive supply chain and distribution systems. This capability will be crucial not only to the quick and efficient transport and distr ibution of COVID -19 vaccines but for all pharmaceutical and life science product s as well as humanitarian aid . This can only happen with careful planning, led by governments \u2014 brought together through multila teral organizations \u2014 and supported by industry st akeholders. This means that in the long term, a network of sustainable infrastructure, technology -driven initiatives and people are needed. 3.1. Capacity & Connectivity Governments must consider the current dim inished cargo capacity of the global air transpor t industry , which will return only slowly . With the severe downturn in passenger traffic, airlines have downsized networks and put many aircraft into remote long -term storage. With the grounded passenger air craft, t he global route network has been reduced dramatically from the pre -COVID situation . The financial impact of the pandemic on airlines will mean that the restart of each individual route will be subject to heavy internal scrutiny to ensure that the r oute meets the cost and revenue targets . In planning their vaccine programs, particularly in the developing world, governments must consider careful ly the current limited air cargo capacity. If borders remain closed, travel curtailed, fleets grounded and employees furloughed, the capacity to deli ver life -saving vaccines will be very much compromised , including the last mile. The WHO, PAHO, UNICEF and Gavi have already reported severe difficulties in maintaining their planned vaccine programs during the C OVID -19 crisis due, in part, to limited air connectivity. Therefore, a ccessing capacity will be achieved only through cautious planning. To more swiftly re-establish global air connectivity for cargo , which is critical in facilitating global trade, IATA encourages States to implement ICAO CART Rec ommendation 16. This can be done fastest by granting to foreign carriers extra -bilateral traffic rights (specifically, so called \"7th freedom\") for their all -cargo operations. Multilateral solutions are also avail able in certain regions where suitable mult ilateral air services agreements are already in place. Further, IATA is work ing with ICAO and health authorities on the development and deployment of rapid, accurate, affordable, easy -to-use, scalable and systemat ic COVID -19 testing for all passengers befo re departure as an alternative to quarantine measures. This may in return help resume a limited , but continually increasing level of capacity and connectivity. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Regulatory flexibility Government action to increase capacity , e.g. by supporting on a regional or global level the grant of additional traffic rights on a temporary basis for operations carrying the COVID -19 vaccines and other critical goods where traditional restrictions may hinder effi cient transport . Government s should avoid movin g towards nationalization of carriers to guarantee domestic access to goods , but rather ensure equitable and fair access to everyone. Airline s to ensure prioritization of shipments Considerations must be tak en to ensure to pr ioritize the movement of essential shipments , including but not limited to vaccines. These priorities should be clear at the time to the concerned parties and followed to the extent operational ly feasible . 15 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 Capacity expansion with COVID -19 testing roll-out This process will result in a number of tests to be moved globally, which will represent a huge volume of medical supplies and COVID -19 test kits to transport. Facilitating freighter charter Facilitating freighter charter is critical while considering areas such as : feasible airport pairs, easy (worry -free) return of asset (aircraft / non -aircraft containers) . Interline operations and multilateral interline agreements Process and procedure must be put in place to enable interline oper ation where possible. 3.2. Operational Environment Both the infrastructure and the resources will be critical as countries prepare themselves for a massive vaccination in response to COVID -19, impacting all countries and territories. The upcoming challenge fo r the supply chain stakeholders is to jointly plan and execute a global network delivery mechanism for the COVID -19 vaccines, unlike any situation experienced previously. Capabilities & Infrastructure The temperature -controlled supply chain will need to b e capable of storing, handling and transporting such a drastic increase in quantities of vaccines and other related medical supplies throughout the journey. The most direct route for deliveries of COVID -19 vaccines is paramount with agreed transit times . Supply chain stakeholders will have to prepare themselves, conduct careful analysis of the existing processes, plan for the necessary processes and prepare for their implementation. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Planning on Capabilities Estimate and evaluate the capa city of handling and storage facilities as well as equipment; and assess ways to increase the capacit ies in a collaborative, cost effective and sustainable way: - work and engage with your business partners / suppliers to communicate about scale -up initiativ es such as the COVID -19 vaccines or humanitarian aid that will affect space and distribution planning and develop strategies on future use of temporary or mid -term temperature -controlled environments (e.g. refrigerated trucks, reefers units , etc.) includin g the u se of off -airport facilities, equipment or infrastructure ; - establish standard operati ng procedures with business partners to meet customer's expectations and regulatory requirements ; - refrigeration equipment used to store sensitive pharmaceutical and temperature -controlled shipments must be monitored to ensure its performance is within the defined range and temperature accurate ; - assess the handling and storage capabilities at origin, transit and destination . Temperature Controlled Rooms / Freezers Consideration must be given to temporary storage areas in cargo terminals such as cool rooms and freezers that are used to hold vaccin es where dry ice is present as a refrigerant. National occupational health and safety regulations must be complied with . In the absence of such regulations, below are minimum recommendations that should be applied: - These storage areas present a significant asphyxiation risk from elevated CO 2 levels from sublimating dry ice. Employees that enter the cool room or freezer must be made aware that dry ice is present so that care is taken when entering the cool room / freezer. 16 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 - Where dry ice is present the cool room / freezer should be placarded with a warning mark affixed at each access point in a location where it will be easily seen by persons opening or entering the cool room / freezer. An example is shown below. This placard should remain on the cool room / freezer until the following provisions are met: a) the cool room / freezer has been ventilated to remove harmful concentrati ons of CO 2; and b) the packages containing the dry ice have been removed. Figure 1: Asphy xiation warning mark (UN Model Regulations, 21st revised edition, Figure 5.5.2) * Insert \"DRY ICE\" or \"CARBON DIOXIDE, SOLID\" in letters at least 25 mm high. Other mitiga tion actions could include the i nstallation of CO 2 monitors / alarms in the cool r oom / freezer . Ramp Operations Consideration must also be given to the loading and unloading of vaccines where dry ice is present as a refrigerant. National occupatio nal health and safety regulations must be complied with. In the absence of such regulations, below are minimum recommendations that should be applied: Verify the documentation ( loadsheet, LIR, NOTOC , CPM, LDM ) for of dry ice as a refrigerant (code ICE); To avoid asphyxiation prior to entering a n aircraft cargo compartment where dry ice is present, the cargo compartment door must be opened and allow ed to vent as per the company's procedures. In absence of specific instructions, it is important t o wait for a minimum of 2 minu tes for ventilated cargo compartments and 10 minutes for non -ventilated cargo compartments before entering the cargo compartment; A visual detectable damage check should be performed to ensure there is no damage to the packagi ng or ULD during loading and/or offloading. Airline's capabilities 17 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 During planning it is also important to consider a number of variables that need to be verified before the booking is confirmed and accept ed: - approved airlines in carrying dangerous good s, if the airline does not hold an approval to carry dangerous goods as cargo from their regulatory authority , the airline would not be allowed to handle cargo such as temperature -controlled containers with lithium batter y powered data loggers ; - aircraft ca pacity (e.g. available space, if dr y ice is used as refrigerant, the quantity limits on dry ice) ; - the capabilities of the airport of departure/transit/arrival ; - airports limited cold and ultra -cold storage in transit and at destination ; - ensuring the right t emperature setting in the aircraft . Airlines should provide a process for transport between the cargo warehouse and the aircraft that minimizes the product exposure to temperatures beyond the allowable range. Optimizing operational efficienc ies Coordinat ion efforts among the supply chain stakeholders should be made to ensure integrated solutions and processes to maximizing the shipment capabilities to the extent possible Standards It is important that stakeholders involved in the shipping, handling and transport of pharmaceuticals and life science products have the most up to date regulations, such as the IATA Temperature Control Regulations (TCR), international and regulatory requirements . This will ensure compliance and integrity of the time and temper ature sensitive products along the supply chain. In addition, to provide visibility and transparency to manufacturers and logistics providers of the level of infrastructure, operations and IATA certified stations, IATA developed the ONE Source industry pl atform for validated aviation capabilities and infrastructure information . All critical information contained on ONE Source has been verified by IATA to help ensure its accuracy. Equipment Equipment used to transport or hold temperature -sensitive healthca re shipments are critical in the overall process. Whether these are aircraft or non -aircraft containers , active or passive Temperature Controlled Cont ainers (TCC), insulated containers , thermal blankets or ramp \"cool\" dollies. Aircraft Temperature Control led Container (TCC) : Performance and functionalities of active / passive aircraft Temperature Controlled Containers (TCC) must be made available ; The aircraft acceptability must be verified to ensure the aircraft TCC are allowed to be loaded aboard the int ended aircraft types in accordance with the aircraft Weight and Balance Manual ; Aircraft TCC may be very heavy due to size and total gr oss weight, appropriate handling equipment with the appropriate capacities (e.g. lift capacity of forklift, length of for k tines, size of pallet dolly) should be always available at all locations to avoid potential staff injury, mishandling, equipment dama ge and/ or service interruption; Training for parties who are not typically involved in aircraft ULD build -up procedures; Serviceability and air worthiness requirements will need to be met ; Special handling instructions from the manufacturer of the aircraf t TCC will need to be conveyed to all supply chain participants ; Specific training programs/ requirements for the use of aircraft TCC should be in place ; Facilitate the transport of aircraft TCC to pharmaceutical manufacturer's facility for acclimatization and loading ; Facilitate the immediate return of the empty aircraft TCC to allow efficient asset utilization . Note: Aircr aft TCC is an aircraft container , certified or non -certified under TSO C90, with an integral temperature control system. Aircraft TCC is designed to be directly restrained by the aircraft Cargo Loading System (CLS). 18 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 Non -aircraft Temperature Controlled Cont ainers (TCC) : also be although non -aircraft TCC s are not aircraft ULDs, considerations on the suitable aircraft type should also be made to ensure operating limitations of the aircraft (e.g. weight and contour limits) are not ex ceeded as per the aircraft Weight and Balance Manual. Non -aircraft TCC may be very heavy due to their size and total gross weight, appropriate handling equipment with the appropriate capacities (e.g. lift capacity of forklift, length of fork tines, size of pallet dolly) should be always available at all locat ions to avoid potential staff injury, mishandling, equipment / shipment damage and/ or service interruption . Non -aircraft TCC is also valuable reusable and returnable asset, immediate return of the empty units should be arranged to allow efficient asset uti lization. Note: Non -aircraft TCC is a non -aircraft container with an integral temperature control system. Non -aircraft TCC is usually loaded onto an aircraft pallet and restrained by a compatible aircra ft pallet net. Passive equipment: Other passive equi pment such as thermal blankets may be used ; however , their capabilities, the logistics and distribution of those items to the origin , and their return and/or their disposal of waste should be considered . The environmental impact should not be forgotten. Facilities and equipment for the storage and handling of such equipment must be suitable . Considerations include: - ULDs must not be placed on the ground. At all times ULDs must be on dollies or in storage racks; - ULDs must not be lifted or moved by forklifts unless the ULD has a forkliftable base. Ramp \"Cool\" dollies Such devices exist at some airports and can be used to help maintain temperature control while the goods are outside the temperature -controll ed facility (e.g. on the ramp or outside the cargo facility). The device capabilities should be verified as there are no specific aviation related standards beyond the basic Ground Support Equipment (GSE) aspects. The availability of such devices, at ori gin, destination and/or transit where they are required or desired to be used should be verified. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Planning on available ULDs and their distribution to the origin and fina l return logistics ; Depending on the nature of the required tran sport conditions for the vaccine, it may be necessary to use temperature controlled ULDs. Aircraft ULDs are c ertified items of aircraft equipment and therefore need to meet certain regulatory requirements and industry standards as described in the applicab le airworthiness certification requirements and IATA ULD Regulations ( ULDR) ; Other non -aircraft TCCs require either securing to an aircraft ULD (such as a n aircraft pallet and aircraft pallet net combination) or specific loading and securing to the aircraf t structure as per the aircraft Weight and Balance Manual ; Not all aircraft ULDs are suitable for all aircra ft types and not all aircraft are designed to transport aircraft ULD s; Aircraft TCC and non -aircraft TCC with dry ice and lithium batteries must me et the provisions set out in the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR). Return logistics : ULDs can typically be used in both directions of travel, however, in the case of specialized ULDs , especially TCC, it may not be the most efficient operational opti on and therefore reverse logistics considerations need to be made. In addition, the return of ULDs in charter operations should be facilitated preferably multilateral ly instead of bilaterally. 19 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Dist ribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 3.3. Border Management Trade movements have been heavily impacted in such time of crisis as government authorities have enacted restrictive measures . IATA's advocacy r ole led many governments and international regulatory bodies to facilitate the movement of air cargo. It is critical that International Organisations, suc h as the WCO / WTO and countries continue to develop and recommend to their Members standards, guidance and best practices measures to facilitate and prioritize the movements of vital life science supplies without disrupting the supply chain. Working effec tively with health and customs authorities wi ll, therefore, be essential to ensure timely regulatory approvals, increased security measures, appropriate handling and customs clearance. In addition to transport preparations, coordination is needed between authorities involved in border management . Governments must also consider priorities for border processes such as acceptance of electronic documents, prior to arrival customs clearance . Furthermore , they should grant priority on arrival and expedited clear ance procedure of those vital shipments to prevent possible temperature excursions due to delays or considering tariff relief to facilitate the movement of the vaccine and life science p roducts. Consideration to be given in case of unplanned diversion int o an en -route airport Facilitation procedures Border Agencies are requested to work with UN agencies, international organizations , and private sector partners to review facilitation pro cedures and measures at borders in order to examine whether further opportunities exist to implement facilitation instruments , standards, tools and guidance that would support the fast processing through contactless means of vaccines, pharmaceutical, life science and medical products at borders. In addition to direct consult ation with individual government agencies, national trade facilitation committees as encouraged by the World Trade Organization's Trade Facilitation Agreement provide a good forum for th is cooperation and coordination. The national trade facilitation commi ttees should be represented on, or work closely with, any COVID 19 task force . WHAT TO CONSIDER: All actors in the supply chain of those essential shipments should be identified now between border agencies and private sector partners, in order to start d eveloping strategies for: - The legal and regulatory frameworks to import export and transit shipment s of vaccines at both regional and national levels ; - The identification of these essential goods , i.e. finished goods like the COVID -19 vaccine, but also biologic materials (e.g., \"drug substance\") used in upstream manufacture and testing of COVID -19 vaccin es, by considering all vaccines, pharmaceutical, life science and medical products, including their packages (incl. temperature -controlled containers), whos e aim is to address the COVID -19 pandemic; - Once identified, integration of these goods into the lists of critical items issued by the World Customs Organization in cooperation with the World Health Organization and their Harmonized System (HS) classificat ion, so that these goods can be cleared exped itiously in line with established international guidance on disaster relief; - Necessary capacity needs along with implementing procedures aligned with international standards to ensure the interception of counter feit and sub -standard (not fit for purpose) v accines. This includes detection at the border, coordination with international health authorities, and offering real -time exchange of relevant information to fight the trafficking of counterfeit medical suppli es, and keeping risk management program up to date to identify problem shipments while ensuring rapid release of genuine goods ; 20 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 - The facilitation of the movement of these shipment s at borders through the implementation of a series of trade facilitation meas ures such as: o Measures to support compliance and cooperation between border agencies (e.g. exchange of information, bilateral and regional agreements); o Common border procedures and simplific ation of import, export and transit documentation requirements to facilitate the release and clearance of goods ; o Coordinated joint inspections of goods in temperature - controlled area s; o Transparency of information and easy access to cross border trade mea sures (e.g. appointment of a single, centralized contact point to respond to industry requests for help or information , up to date information published on -line and available through the enquiry point ); o Procedures for expedited release with the creation of green lanes to accelerate the release process at borders for such shipments and reduce the sheer volume requiring inspection, at acceptable risk to the country; o Let any specific transport equipment (such as temperature -controlled containers) for the safe transport of vaccines and other pharmaceutical and medical produc ts aimed at addressing the COVID -19 pandemic be considered as a ULD (Unit Load Device) and fall under temporary admission (and return) exempt from duty and bond/guarantee requirements ; o Use of information technology to support the establishment and mainten ance of a \"single window \" which would expedite the submission of information and/or data requirements for the release and clearance of goods , acceptance of electronic copies/scans of certifi cates and document s instead of original or certified copies in pap er, and e -payment to facilitate payment of duties and fees ; and o The possible introduction of deferral (e.g. separation of the release from the final determination of Customs duties, taxes, f ees and charges ) of duties, taxes and fees, as well as bond progra ms and deferred payments with post -clearance audit (in order to move the duty and tax collecting processes away from the border to the inland premises of the importer); Smart Coordinated Borders Border agencies should seek out every opportunity to share i nformation, apply smart border measures and implement simplified procedures to the extent possible to expedite vaccines (including COVID -19 vaccines), pharmaceutical, life science and medi cal products. Due care should be undertaken by all parties to ensure that such products are secured, transported and stored in facilities that do not jeopardize the integrity of such goods. Customs authorities should ensure that all levels of government ( including border agencies) and law enforcement, i.e. national (feder al), regional (State or provincial), and sub -national (local) remain coordinated to allow uninterrupted door -to-door delivery of these shipments. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Coordination to fight illicit trade of counterfeit medical supplies To support the permane nt and real -time exchange of relevant information to fight the t rafficking of counterfeit medical supplies, the WCO and its members should continue to e xchange intell igence information, messages and alerts via the secure channels developed under the Intell ectual Property Rights (IPR) CENcomm Group. Emergency border contacts list for humanitarian goods The World Customs Organization (WCO) has compiled a database of emergency contacts to minimize cargo border blockages and ensure these can be responded to im mediately. IATA will be the focal point with the WCO if contacts in countries are needed. Furthermore, the WCO has provided guidance to support the classificati on 21 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 of vaccines, medicines and medical supplies and prioritize their customs clearance . A similar approach should be taken to prioritize other border agency clearance at borders for vaccines. 3.4. Security Environment Vaccines are highly valuable commodities and their transport as air cargo will swiftly raise civil aviation's public profile and visibilit y. Risk assessment1 should be performed to determine vulnerabilities and threats , including insider2 and cyber threats3,4 to Air Cargo Management Systems, related to transport (safeguarding from tampering and theft). Air Cargo Service and System providers should review physical and cyber controls to reduce the risk of loss of cargo or degradation of connected systems support ing the transport of vaccines. Physical Security Measures Processes and procedures are typically in place to keep cargo shipments sec ure, from both, the aviation security and transport of valuables perspective. The potential volume of vaccine shipments, geographical scope of distribution and handling conditions m ay however require early planning from the point of origin, during the enti re transport until loading and the departure of the aircraft, as well as upon arrival (off -loading, storage) to ensure that they are scalable and provide protection against all sort s of interference (including both, aviation security and criminal threats). In terms of security and screening procedures, given the specificity of the shipments, the procedures relevant to secure supply chains, which involve known consignors and/or regu lated agents, should be maintained. Additionally, consultations with States ' appropriate authority are encouraged to verify if conditions of the respective National Civil Aviation Security Programme (NCASP) at the point of departure or transfer or transit of BIO consignments include and allow for special arrangements regarding appropriate security controls for BIO consignments such as vaccines and other lifesaving materials, that are reflective of the guidance set out in the ICAO Security Manual Doc. 8973 (Section 13.5.5 and Appendix 33). However, the use of alternative security measures should be strictly limited, be applied on a temporary basis, and clearly defined in a State's National Civil Aviation Security Programme. Such processes are also referre d in ICAO State Letter AS 8/7 -21/6 dated 27 January 2021 . ICAO guidelines are found in Distribution of COVID -19 Vaccines and Air Cargo Security , which is available on the ICAO public website , here , as wel l as in Section 6 of these document . Cyber Security Measures In terms of cyber security, IATA along with Aviation -ISAC , recommend airlines to focus on both data and information, as well as the systems supporting the logistics and transport of the vaccines . Air Cargo Service and System providers engaged in the transport of Covid -19 vaccines are under increased risk of ph ysical and cyber -attack. Aviation -ISAC 5shares that threat intelligence reveals organized crime groups are seeking to procure vaccine sh ipments for sale on the black market. Similarly, ransomware groups have targeted the healthcare and aviation sectors d uring the pandemic. Airlines may be subjected to cyber -attack as they announce their ability to transport vaccines, as seen in one particu lar event, last November 2020. Data and information relative to vaccines distribution, should be designated confiden tial or privileged. This data and information should implement restricted access measures as well as data loss prevention and encryption measures. 1 IATA Security Management System Manual Edition 4, chapter 5, Security Risk Assessment 2 IATA Security Management System Manual Edition 4, chapter 6.4, Insider Threats 22 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 Systems processing this data and supporting the transport, including flight operations, are also under in creased threat of compromise. Security teams should consider increased continuous monitoring of these systems for both internal and extern al attempts for unauthorized access. More information on how ransomware attacks unfold can be found via different refe rence materials and cyber incident response best practices. Note that most of those attacks result in exfiltration of sensitive data, foll owed by file and network encryption. Airlines need to make sure their solution providers are using state -of-the art cyber security defence and are maintaining their systems up to date. Airlines and Air Cargo Service and System providers should review the ir business continuity and or disaster response plan, ransomware incident response plans and ensure the plans have bee n exercised. Also, some basic considerations and recommendations are provided below. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Appropriate security screening facilities and methods throughout the supply chain ; Maximum usage of Known Consignor and Regulated Agent programs and faster access to such programs for the duration of the COVID 19 Pandemic ; On airport secure facilities ; Consignment level shipment tracki ng sensors ; Off airport secure storage facilities, mi nimized quantities in unsecure areas ; Information flow controls to protect against cyber interference ; Secure zone access control, consider CCTV monitoring ; Adequate s ecurity measures of all distribution of these are high value shipments including the 'Fin al Mile' distribution to mitigate the risk of theft or product tampering ; Final vaccine disbursement facilities to have secure facilities ; Air Cargo Service and System providers should be updated to the latest version; Backup copies should be up to date, and isolated from the other systems, as they could provide the only capacity to put back the systems online rapidly, after an attack ; Solution provider s should be consulted on the ir capacity to sustain cy ber-attack s, and support the airlines ; Business Continuity Plan should be devise d and/ or refresh ed to face such malicious event s; Consult with regional regulator authorities on government intelligence sharing as well as private intelligence sharing working groups for a be tter understanding and monitoring of the threat landscape ; National civil aviation authorities to promote awareness campaigns amongst all aviation stakeholders to raise awareness about Insider Threats , highlight the importance of being ext ra vigilant and develop policies and procedures to mitigate against Insider Threat situations. Airlines and airports to consider the deployment of additional security resource as added protection to the valuable cargo. The State's National Facilitations C omm ittee to oversee the interagency coordination to ensure effective, secure, efficient and expeditious processing and handling of the shipment . 3.5. Safety Environment With the capacity crunch, many airlines have repurposed passenger aircraft to be used for just the carriage of cargo and/or mail, including loading cargo in the passenger cabin. Such exceptional operation require s a very robust and comprehensive safety risk assessment involving all parties within the organizat ion following standardized procedur es in compliance with defined operating standards and regulations , particularly ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs), as well as other ICAO provisions6. 6 ICAO Safe transport of COVID -19 vaccines on commercial aircraft 23 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 Airlines are required to perform a safety risk assess ment that addresses the carriage of cargo in a ircraft cargo compartments. For the transport of vaccines , life science and medical supplies the safety risk assessment must consider : The quantity of dry ice that is permitted in aircraft cargo compartments. Where the quantity of dry ice normal ly permitted is to be increased , consideration must be given to addressing the potential risk of increased concentrations of carbon dioxide gas to flight crew and other persons carried on board the aircraft as well as to ground staff responsible for loadin g and unloading the cargo compartments ; The risk to aircraft systems from electromagnetic radiation for data loggers / cargo tracking devices . However, temperature -controlled vaccines, life science or medical supplies might not all be suitable to be carri ed in the passenger cabin due to regulatory constraints or risks to the operation . Therefore, all supply chain partners must familiarize themselves with the overall requirements to safely transport vaccine shipments be fore looking to accept or handle such consignments , especially where cabin loading of cargo is considered . Manufacturers of vaccines must consider the classification of the vaccine, particularly where regulatory approval from the appropriate national auth ority of the State(s) of origin, trans it or destination has not been issued, or is still pending. - COVID -19 vaccines containing GMOs or GMMOs, including those in clinical trials, are not subject to the Dangerous Goods Regulations. The challenges are really about preparation and planning as w ell as vaccine manufacturers providing information as early as possible to airlines and other supply chain partners to understand which temperature -controlled environment will be needed when transpor ting vaccine s. Potentially the temperature required may range from deep frozen at -80\u00b0C to +2 \u00b0C - +8\u00b0C. The temperature requirements will also impact on the type of packaging solution that will be used and any special handling requirements . Where dry ice i s required to maintain the vaccine in a frozen state cons ideration must be given to: - the quantity of dry ice that will be offered for each flight; - training requirements for personnel who will prepare the shipments; - the prohibition on the carriage of dry ice when cargo is loaded in the passenger cabin; - how the sh ipments will be offered for air transport, e.g. individual packages, overpacks or in aircr aft unit load devices. These factors may limit the quantity of vaccine that can be transported per flight and the time and effort required by the airline or their gro und service provider to accept the shipments . Most pharmaceutical shipments require the use of data loggers / cargo tracking devices that are inside packages, attached to packages or may be inside the ULD , or pre -installed in the TCC by manufacturers, to record and verify that the contents have at all times been maintained within the requir ed temperature range. The types of data loggers vary as does their power source, however where the data loggers have a transmitting function (GSM / GPS) and/or are po wered by lithium batteries then the regulatory requirements that apply to the transport of lithium battery -powered equipment and the transport of active portable electronic device (PED) must be addressed. WHAT TO CONSIDER: For shipping dry ice as refrige rant for general cargo, the shipper must also be dangerous goods qualified (i.e. trained and assessed), and the packing requirements must meet the applicable requirements of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) . Ship pers are advised to coordinate with the airlines in advance for shipping dangerous goods ( as well as pharmaceutical products ). For the shipper (consignor): 24 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 1. Dry ice (Carbon dioxide, sol id) is regulated by the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) even when used as a refrigerant for non -dan gerous goods. Shippers must be dangerous goods qualified (i.e. trained and assessed) according to the training requirements in the Regulations and follow the packing requirements laid out in Packing Instruction 954. 2. Dry ice must only be in packaging s that allow s the release of the carbon dioxide gas that is generated as the dry ice sublimates. Packagings such as aluminium, plastic or steel drums or jerricans are not suitable . Packagings such as wood, fibreboard or mo re likely expanded polystyrene boxes are suitable as these materials are gas permeable. 3. Dry ice can be placed directly into the appropriate packagings or in the dry ice bunker of the ULD or loose in the ULD. Completed packages can be packed with the dry ice into a larger box to form an overp ack. Alternatively, the packages can be packed into a ULD with the dry ice provided that the airline agrees . In that respect, it is not just the dry ice inside a package that can be packed into an aircraft ULD but the dry ice itself can also be in loose in the ULD. It must be emphasized that \"overpack\" does not exist for general cargo, and acceptance staff will consider the \"overpack\" of general cargo as a single package (piece) . 4. Where the dry ice is in packages, the outside of each package must: a. be marke d with the name and address of the shipper (consignor) and consign ee, \"UN 1845 \", \"Carbon dioxide, solid\" or \"Dry ice\" and the net weight of dry ice in each package; and b. be labelled with a Class 9 hazard label. 5. If the individual packages are packed with th e dry ice into an overpack then the information in 4 a. and b. must be on the outside of the overpack . Where very large numbers of packages each containing dry ice are to be offered for transport, it is recommen ded that the shipper group s packages into an overpack as this will facilitate handling and reduce the time and effort required by the airline or their ground service provider to perform the dangerous goods acceptance check . 6. There is no requirement for a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods whe re the dry ice is used as a refrigerant for non -dangerous goods. However, there must be information on the air waybill, or if there is no air waybill on another document, that shows: \"UN 1845 \", \"Carbon dioxide, solid\" or \"Dry ice\", the number of packages a nd the weight of dry ice in each package. 7. Shippers shall always make advance arrangement with the freight forwarder or directly with the airline for the transport of shipments containing dry ice to ensure that the total weight of dry ice being offered in the consignment does not exceed the limit for the particular aircraft type . Shippers must ensure that all requirements in the DGR have been followed before tendering the shipment because a shipment rejection c an possibly result in a delay and potentially miss the booked flight. 8. In cases where aircraft TCC is used and in the possession of shipper, shipper is responsible for ensuring the aircraft TCC is only handled by appropriately trained and qualified personnel and the serviceability of ULD is maintaine d. Where lithium battery -powered data loggers / cargo tracking devices are planned to be used or have been installed in the TCC by manufacturers, the shipper must ensure that the applicable provisions in the DGR are complied with. These include: - Obtaining a copy of the lithium battery test summary from the manufacturer / supplier of the lithium batteries or the manufacturer / supplier of the device. This test summary must confirm t hat the lithium cell or battery type has passed all applicable tests in Subs ection 38.3 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria; 25 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 - Packing requirements laid out in Section II of Packing Instruction 967 or Packing Instruction 970 in the DGR, as applicable; - Unless the data logger / cargo tracking device only contains a button cell, whe re there are : o more than two packages in the consignment that contain a data logger / cargo tracking device in each package, or o multiple data loggers / tracking devices in a packag e (e.g. more than four devices powered by lithium cells or more than two dev ices powered by lithium batteries) . then each package must bear the lithium battery mark with \"UN 3481\" or \"UN 3091\" as applicable, and there must be a compliance statement on the air waybill, when an air waybill is used . Packages containing COVID -19 pharm aceuticals accompanied by lithium battery -powered data loggers and/or cargo tracking devices are not required to bear the lithium battery mark and consequently the compliance statement is not required on the air waybill. This same package configuration, wh en consigned without the COVID -19 pharmaceutical for the purposes of use or re -use, is also not required to bear the lithium battery mark and the compliance statement on the air wa ybill is not required, provided prior arrangements have been made with the airline . ; - All employees preparing or offering shipments must receive adequate instruction on the provisions set out in the aforementioned packing instructions. This adequate instru ction must be commensurate with the functions for which they are responsible . Some data loggers / cargo tracking devices may not be powered by lithium batteries but other battery types, such as dry batteries or nickel -metal hydride batteries that are no t restricted by the DGR when the conditions as shown in the corresponding sp ecial provision in the DGR are met (e.g. Special Provision A123 for dry battery and Special Provision A199). More information can be found on the IATA Dangerous Goods Website . Where the data loggers / carg o tracking devices are a type with transmitting functions, the shipper must ensure that: - They confirm with the manufacturer / supplier of the device that the device has passed all applicable tests to ensure that it does not pose a hazard to aircraft system s due to emission of electromagnetic radiation; - Except as provided in the applicable regulations, the device is fitted with two independent means of shutting down all transmitting functions when airborne ; - The device has been approved by the airline on whic h the cargo will be transported. For acceptance, handling and loading as a freight forwarder: 1. The staff processing the shipments should inspect the packages , when visible, to ensure that the packagings used are designed and constructed to permit the rel ease of carbon dioxide gas , the packages or overpacks are marked and labelled in accordance with the Regulations and the details required for the completion of the air waybill, or alternative documentation, are provided by the shippers. 2. There must be coor dination with the airline that will transport the consignment with dry ice to confirm that the qu antity of dry ice is within the limits set by the airline specified for the particular aircraft type(s) over the route from origin to destination. 3. Where the c onsignment with the dry ice is to be stored in a freezer / cool room , there should be procedures to ensure that employees are aware of the risks associated with dry ice. The carbon dioxide gas generated as dry ice sublimates displaces the air in a confined space, such as a freezer or cool room. This may create an oxygen deficient atmosphere that can a sphyxiate persons. It is recommended to placard the freezer / cool room that is stored with these shipments to identify the presence of dry ice and that people should not enter the room unattended. Additional CO 2 monitors that trigger alerts when the CO 2 concentration exceeds the safe levels can be installed . 26 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 4. In cases where aircraft TCC is used and in the possession of a third party (e.g. shipper, or freight forwarder), that party is responsible for ensuring the aircraft TCC is only handled by appropria tely trained and qualified personnel and the serviceability of ULD is maintained. 3.6. Risk Management Companies that implemented quality -driven strategy programs s uch as the IATA Center of Excellence for Independent Validators in Pharmaceutical Logistics (CE IV Pharma) program are well placed to mitigate the impact of logistical constraints in their strategies, as they are already aware of : - the operational challenge s; - the standards and requirements to be followed ; - the necessity to have trained and knowledgeable staff ; - the requirement to have dedicated equipment as well as infrastructure ; - the importance of reviewing and if necessary, adjusting robust risk assessments. Being part of such programs will be a significant advantage in building confidence and trust, in a collaborative environment where the integrity of such sensitive products is maintained throughout the handling and transport journey until it reaches its e nd customer. This provides manufac turers and logistics providers the possibility to identify the level of competency as well as operational and technical preparedness at airports. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Standards and Training Non -standardized processes have a detrimental impact. Global standards must be implemented, reviewed and maintained through robust audit and training processes. Risk -based Approach Establish contingency and emergency plans as well as the most direct comm unication for rapid response to issues arising along the supply chain. 3.7. Digital Environment Enhancing patient safety and quality of care can be achieved by connecting logistic networks , increasing the level of supply chain digit alization, as well as increased end -to-end visibility and transparency of existing capacity and facilities. Digit alization will be the enabler for more efficient, robust , resilient and smarter supply chains across various modes of transport by using the captured data for analysis and information sharing. These, in turn, could lead to more efficient business processes, more effective planning for future pandemics and other emergencies, as well as for infrastructure, policies, and regulations . Track and Trace solutions To ensure that the security and integrity of that the data and the products are maintained throughout the supply chain , track and trace solutions can be implemented either in real time or at destination. These are for temperature and/or humidity monitorin g or localisations for security reasons. Tran sport & logistics transparency and visibility To ensure maximized usage of both the logistics capacity as well as the vaccines themselves, stakeholders should make data available on the shipments, planned and executed transport parameters, disruptions and alternative plans. IATA's ONE Record data shar ing standards prescribe a method for such direct data access securely using a common language for data exchange . 27 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Lo gistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 Global distribution planning and oversight Governments and pharma suppliers should consider shari ng data on the global distribution planning an d oversight to ensure that logistics resources are maximised, ideally fairly, but at least with common knowledge. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Temperature Monitoring Monitoring activities by means of validated temperatur e m onitoring devices are necessary to ensure that the process is under control at each critical step in the supply chain , to minimize the time out of refrigeration (ToR) and to avoid temperature excursions. Product will be sensitive to moving out of the ma ndated temperature ranges so temperature monitors will be critical in validating the quality of the final product . End -to-end visibility and data sharing Collaborate in establishing effective technologies allowing parties to be accurately informed about the status and the mo vement of their air cargo. This can be achieved through proactive data sharing, facilitating transparent, reliable and direct access to such data to all relevant stakeholders. 3.8. Sustainability and CO 2 Emissions Sustainability consider ations While immunization efforts are well underway in some developed economies, low and middle -income countries are struggling to secure their access to vaccines and to find adequate logistics solutions. To facilitate the global transport and distribution of vaccines, medical supplies supporting the vaccines, life science and pharmaceutical products, it is important to consider establishing a sustainable infrastructure network. This is especially critical in low -income countries , where energy access can be challenging for temperature -controlled environments . GAVI estimates that only 10% of healthcare facilities in GAVI -eligible countries have adequate cold chain equipment, and many rely on polluting diesel generators fo r electrici ty7. Where significant investment is necessary to expand the cold chain, sustainable, long -term solutions should be selected (e.g. o ff-grid8, solar -powered mobile cold -rooms9 can be an efficient and lasting solution for remote areas.) . Building effective and resilient cold chains in low -income countries will also reduce food and medicine waste, ease new health and vaccination campaigns, and enable economic growth. These actions will lead to a successful response to the pandemic and contri bute to a green er recovery worldwide. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Invest in / subsidiz e the deployment of renewable sources of energy in out -of-the-grid facilities ; Analyse the energy requirements to keep vaccines at the recommended temperature ; Select effici ent, clean cooling technologies and approaches during the planning and procurement processes as much as possible; Examine how to minimize energy waste and emissions of refrigerant gases; Calculate the waste produced by vaccine transportation and analyze reduction, recycling, and safe disposal options for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 CO 2 Emissions The CO 2 emission generated as a result of flight operations itself is also worth considering. The global vaccine distribution is undoubtedly a large -scale operation which means even r elatively small efficiency gains can result in absolute CO 2 savings that are substantial. Many measures to enhance operational efficiency, in particular fleet optimization, may already be implemented as part of an ongoing effort to save fuel and reduce CO 2. Beyond this, it may be advantageous to explore carbon offsetting as a means to compensate in part or fully for the CO 2 produced. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Estimating the CO 2 footprint of vaccine distribution flights with best available data, e.g. attributable fue l consumption and/or payload data; Sourcing good quality carbon credits in projects that are meaningful to your organization's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR ) objectives. 3.9. Multimodal Ground based distribution networks will have to be capable of g uaranteeing temperature integrity at destination as well as on the last mile delivery. WHAT TO CONSIDER: Collaborate and use existing road distribution channels ; Ensure appropriate ness and availabilities of Road Feeder Services (RFS) ; Guidance for groun d transport of ULD (aircraft TCC) including loading/ unloading ; Align transport of vaccin es and the associated medical consumables ( syringes, vials, needles , PPE, etc) ; via different modes to prioritize air cargo for short shelf life and temperature sensit ive vaccin es; Freight forwarder qualification and capability (training, facilities, equipment, etc.) ; Quality management program in place (Master Operating Plan, track & trace, real -time monitoring) ; Collaboration on ground, for first and last mile. 29 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 4.

Lessons Learned Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna COVID -19 Vaccines Transporting the vaccines in the frozen state by air do es not pose risks to the product provided that the required transportation temperatures are complied with. Once the vaccines are in a refrigerated state and intended for distribution, caution must be exercised to handle it with care to avoid s hocks, drops an d vibrations that could cause degradation of the product . Capacity Capacity remains cons trained from the loss of available belly cargo space as passenger aircraft remain parked. Airline members are extending freighters, utilization of fleet and increased network. The use of \"preighters \" (combination of passenger aircraft and freighter ) remain s limited due to the regulatory requirements (e.g. lack of fire protection in the passenger cabin and passenger aircraft not desig ned to carry cargo in the cabin) bit. However , these are alternatives for smaller airports/destination s. Lessons learned from the distribution of PPE in early 2020 has helped prepare for the distribution effort. Humanitarian organizations are calling on airlines to de dicate enough space to transport vaccines across the globe. The industry has not yet reached the large scale of v olumes and global distribution that was expect ed. The air freight supply chain has been managing positively the first roll out of vaccines. Today there are still a limited number of vaccines approved for full use and manufacturers are experiencing some de lays in the production and/or availability of raw materials. Manufacturers are starting to scale -up their capacity as countries around the glo be and international organizations have been ordering and pre -purchasing different type s of vaccines, which will b e transported subsequent to their approval for use. Regulatory - Dangerous Goods The use of dry ice as a refrigerant for vaccines has raised some operational challenges : Acceptance process where packages contain dry ice : There is a requirement for an acc eptance check for packages containing dangerous goods. The acceptance check requires that the airline , or their ground handling agent, verify the marks and labels on packages. Where there are significant numbers of packages of vaccines that contain dry ice , the time to accept the packages increases significantly. This needs to be factored in for the time required from delivery to the airport to flight departure. Coordination on dry ice quantity limits Each airline is requir ed to establish the maximum quant ity of dry ice that can be loaded into the aircraft cargo compartments. There must be coordination across the supply chain to ensure that what is being offered for transport is within the limits for the airline (s); particul arly important where the shipment s are carried on multiple airlines from origin to destination . The use of data loggers / cargo tracking devices Time required to approve data loggers If the use of a new type or model of data logger / cargo tracker is plan ned, there can be a significant d elay while the airline 's internal approval process proceeds. This r equires multiple internal stakeholder sign - off (Engineering, Safety, Flight Operations). Some airline s must also get the approval from their CAA before the data logger can be accepted in ca rgo. As a result of the use of passenger aircraft to carry just cargo, i.e. no passengers, Airbus and Boeing developed increased dry ice limit tables for passenger aircraft types where very limit ed numbers of persons are carried. Airbus and Boeing also p ublished revised dry ice table to take into account very low sublimation rates of less than 1% per hour. This w as to address the very sophisticated packaging for one of the vaccines which is able to achieve a 32 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 sublimation rate of approximately 0.3% per hour . For aircraft types manufactured by other than Airbus and Boeing, airlin es should seek revised dry ice data from the aircraft manufacturers. Infrastructure Ensuring temperature -controlled storage facilities are in place from manufacturer to their final destination for distribution and administration remains a challenge especially in remote areas. There have been few instances of temperature excursions identif ied in the transport chain, but these remain so far exception as much attention is given to such high value products. Public - Private Partnership IATA's call for collaboration has resulted in positive developments between the private and public sector. The work with the regulators and ICAO allowed the existing requirements to be revised (e.g., rela xation on data loggers and/or cargo tracking devices requirements), that defin itely facilitated the movement of cargo and provides more flexibility for manufact urers and airline s. The work with the World Customs Organization has resulted in airline members not encountering specific obstacles so far to current border processes for these critical shipments. Some Customs administrations have taken specific steps to facilitate the movement of such shipments, such as: identification and assessment prior to goods arrival end-to-end automated clearance prioritization of the clearance of shipments containing vaccines and related supplies and equipment immediate release based on the facilitation measures applied separation of the release from the payment of duties, t axes, fees and charges creation of task forces h eaded by Customs and comprising representatives from Partner Government Agencies, a irlines , ground handl ers, warehouse operator s, etc . for inclusive decision making and to ensure a coordinated approach . Colla boration between regulators and ICAO allowed development of the guidanc e \"Distribution of COVID -19 Vaccines and Air Cargo Security \", which was released as ICAO State Letter AS 8/7 - 21/6 and published on ICAO's public website, here , as well as in Section 6 of these document. Communication Airport stakeholder communities have been established in response to the pandemic with the aim of addressing the logistics challenges through alignment and appropriate preparation. A number of industry task forces have been set up to ensure visibility across the supply chain and bring business partners together to develop capacity analysis and conc rete action plans . Collaboration To assist further the global distribution of vaccines and provide transparency on the available cargo capacity and connectivity, IATA organized together with UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) a virtual meeting with major global airlines on the expected capacity requirements and discussed ways to transport close to 2 billion doses of COVID -19 vaccines in 2021. Bringing the industry together with international agencies, also allowed UNICEF to launch the Humanitarian Airfreight Initiative, where over 1 5 leading airl ines have signed agreements with UNICEF to support the prioritization of delivery of COVID -19 vaccines. Sustainability An upcoming challenge identified is the bio medical waste (e.g., needle, P PE, syringes etc.) that will need to be destroyed after use an d some countries will require assistance as they don't have the means or infrastructure to carry out this task. There are concerns about the possible rise of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) emissions w hen the gas is used to freeze the vaccine to allow its storage and transportation over certain period of time. Caution must be given to ensure refrigeration equipment are in good condition and hermetically sealed to limit its effect. 33 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 Focus on quality Companies that implemented quality -driven strategy programs such as the IATA CEIV Pharma program were well placed to mitigate the impact of logistical constraints in their strategies by defining and adopting a risk -based approach. Security Working effective ly with health and customs authorities is essenti al to ensure timely regulatory approvals, increased security measures, appropriate handling and customs clearance. A number of options have been implemented such as the possible trucking access directly to the aircraft on the airport apron. Information fl ow controls to protect against cyber interference/attacks. 34 Guidance for Vaccine and Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution Edition 5 & Last Edition - 1 June 2021 6.
