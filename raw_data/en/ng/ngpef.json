A variety of side effects have been reported, ranging from fairly mild localised reactions to autoimmune disease and death. These include: - Hives. - Cellulitis surround injection site. - Chronic fatigue. - Guillain Barre syndrome. - Nausea, vomiting and weakness. - Seizures. - Airway constriction. Class action brought against vaccine manufacturer. Merck was sued for injury and death allegedly caused by the Gardasil vaccine. They were ordered to pay $6 million in damages. Out of 200 claims, 49 were compensated (2 of these were due to death) and 92 were still pending as of 2013. [[1]](#_ftn1) The class action was organised by an Australian woman who suffered multiple sclerosis-like symptoms after being injected with Gardasil; these were later diagnosed as being a neurological reaction to the vaccine. A research study investigating the likelihood of serious autoimmune disorders developing in association with the HPV4 immunisation (Gardasil) noted that those who had been vaccinated 6-55 days prior were more likely to display adverse events including the development of lupus, vasculitis, alopecia and central nervous conditions. [[2]](#_ftn2) An independent analysis of the body of research used to submit the Gardasil vaccine for approval raised serious questions regarding the manufacturer's methodology . The authors write: \"We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications)... the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities).\" [[3]](#_ftn3) These findings are disturbing indeed and imply that the manufacturer, Merck, appears to be actively designing clinical trials to report in their favour. Controlling risk factors associated with HPV infection is far more sensible - and safer than vaccination. These include: - Smoking - Co-infection with herpes, chlamydia, or HIV - Having multiple sex partners - Compromised immunity - Long term use of hormonal contraceptives Most of these are modifiable risk factors and can be managed. Modern day medicine would have us believe that there is a pill for every ill, but it is far more important that we take back responsibility for our own health, or risk the consequences.
