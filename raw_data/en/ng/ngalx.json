A person who needs this remedy usually feels extremely chilly and exhausted. Gelsemium This remedy is often helpful when a person feels ill from anxiety or nervous anticipation of a stressful event or outcome. Weakness and trembling may occur, and the person may have chills and headache. Ipecacuanha Persistent nausea and violent vomiting that does not relieve the discomfort suggest a need for this remedy. The person may also salivate profusely. Lying down and resting offer little or no relief. Kali phosphoricum This remedy can be helpful for exhaustion and weakness after any kind of illness or extended stress. The person may be oversensitive to light and noise, and feel deeply chilly. Mental dullness, depression, and a feeling of inability to cope are often seen when this remedy is needed. Nux vomica A person who experiences nausea but has difficulty vomiting may find relief in this remedy. Headache and great sensitivity (to odors, noise, and light) are also likely. Chilliness, irritability, and impatience are often present when Nux vomica is needed. Sepia This remedy may be indicated if nausea is severe and debilitating, with a headache (especially left-sided) and a dragged-out feeling of weariness. The person may have a strong desire to be left alone and not be expected to interact with others. (Note: The homeopathic remedy Cadmium iodatum has been used by some physicians to counteract unpleasant side-effects of radiation therapy.) [] Dosage Homeopathy Dosage Directions Select the medicine that most closely matches the symptoms. In conditions where self-treatment is appropriate, unless otherwise directed by a physician, a lower potency (6X, 6C, 12X, 12C, 30X, or 30C) should be used. In addition, instructions for use are usually printed on the label. Many homeopathic physicians suggest that medicines be used as follows: Take one dose and wait for a response. If improvement is seen, continue to wait and let the medicine work. If improvement lags significantly or has clearly stopped, another dose may be taken. The frequency of dosage varies with the condition and the individual. Sometimes a dose may be required several times an hour; other times a dose may be indicated several times a day; and in some situations, one dose per day (or less) can be sufficient. If no response is seen within a reasonable amount of time, select a different medicine.
