That has left the Christian skeptical of their use. As Christians we must reject completely the idea that plants offer anything but physical healing, that they are worthy of worship, that they contain power or magic. Let it be known these ideas are not of the Lord. Instead, our use of herbal medicine is rightfully taking back what is ours in Christ. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. The herbs are the Lord's. The cattle are the Lord's. The grasses of the field are the Lord's. It is not that these things are glory, but rather they declare the glory of the Lord. We do not worship creation, we worship The Creator who did not neglect to give us every good thing for life and godliness. As the [Christian Herbal blog](https://www.christianherbal.org/herbalism-from-pagan-roots/) puts it: \"Herbalism is not rooted in paganism. Herbalism is perverted in paganism.\" It's not that we are taking something pagan and \"redeeming\" it to use in a Christian way, but rather using these plants in the way God originally intended\u2014 for physical treatment only. All things are ours in Christ. God's good gifts to us\u2014 from the teachers that shepherd us and teach us The Word, down to the seemingly mundane cup of fresh peppermint tea soothing an upset stomach\u2014 these are all for our use and our benefit and our enjoyment. Consider 1 Corinthians 3:21-23\u2014 So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future\u2014all are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's. God created plants with specific properties, each beneficial to our bodies in particular ways. He gave us these things to utilize for our own health and as a way to show mercy to others. To be equipped to treat a variety of ailments at home is radical compassion. A home apothecary is prudent preparation. It is managing the household wisely. The Lord has been gracious to us through these plants that often treat a physical need, all while supplying perfectly our most important need of healing from our spiritual sickness: sin\u2014 through His son who now rules and reigns. Plants do not offer spiritual or emotional healing, enlightenment, or anything in between. Only Christ can do that. All things are subject to Him. Even the herbs and their medicinal properties. As we learn, grow, and utilize these herbs, may we do so rightly. May we be filled with thankfulness and may we forever lean on our Great Physician first and foremost. FAQ: What about homeopathy? Homeopathy is not the same as herbal medicine. In our home we choose not to use or endorse the use of homeopathy because of its roots in the New Age. You can learn more about that here: [https://www.gotquestions.org/homeopathic-Christian.html](https://www.gotquestions.org/homeopathic-Christian.html) and [@huntressathome](https://www.instagram.com/huntressathome/) also has a story highlight with more information and resources. Where can I find herbal information without the New Age perspective? I recommend Rachel Weaver's book series on herbal medicine. She has a few: Be Your Own Doctor, Be Your Own Doctor II, Backyard Pharmacy, and Be Your Child's Pediatrician. [Natural Hope Herbals](https://www.naturalhopeherbals.com) is a Christian herbal company, and I recently discovered the [Christian Herbal](https://www.christianherbal.org) website and have been exploring that. If anyone else has any solid resources please leave them in the comments below! Does this mean unbelievers can't use herbal medicine? No, the rain falls on the just and the unjust (Matthew 5:45). It is a gift of \"common grace\" that those outside of Christ can still partake in the physical healing benefits of plants and herbs. The problem is when New Age and occult practices are introduced and intertwined with herbs that God created for physical healing. The user is then worshipping the creation rather than The Creator (Romans 1) and there are consequences to that. This is where the believer must "}
