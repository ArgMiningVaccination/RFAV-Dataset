The body has many innate ways to fight infections, go through the inflammation process, and restore equilibrium \u2014 and for thousands of years, Ayurvedic doctors have been using certain herbs to help it along. One of the most respected and time-tested of these plant foods is [ Ashwagandha](https://organicindiausa.com/ashwagandha/). Ayurvedic doctors have used Ashwagandha for immune support, recovery and more for thousands of years. Ashwagandha is a powerful [adaptogenic](https://organicindiausa.com/blog/harnessing-the-ancient-power-of-adaptogenic-herbs/) herb, meaning it's used to promote a healthy response to environmental, emotional, and physical stressors. According to Indian philosophical tradition, the physical body is the manifestation of the emotional and mental bodies \u2014 so it only makes sense for the Ayurvedic physician to treat all three. Typically, it is the root of this evergreen shrub that is used in traditional and modern remedies. The link between stress and immunity Over the past few decades, Western medicine has discovered what Ayurvedic doctors have known for thousands of years: Stress determines health. Ayurvedic practitioners understand that it takes more than just addressing physical symptoms to get to the root of an illness. It's of utmost importance to consider emotional and mental factors that cause physical problems, make them worse, or prevent complete healing. The [ International Journal of Yoga](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3099096/) reported that wellbeing is related to positive emotions and cognitive processing. Negative emotions adversely affect the ability to cope with stress, and therefore the health of the body. Studies have shown that yoga, to name but one modality of mind-body practices, reduces anxiety and depression, thereby leading to wellbeing. Other means include meditation, quiet walks, exercise, breathing practices, Qigong, laughter, guided imagery, rest and herbal remedies. Ashwagandha for immune support According to the African Journal of Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative Medicines, ashwagandha contains potent antioxidant properties and bioactive compounds that help support immunomodulatory actions and healthy inflammatory responses. In the [study ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722/)it is noted, \"Ashwagandha has been described as a nervine tonic ( [Singh et al., 1988](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722/#R37), [1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722/#R40)) in Ayurveda and that is why it is a common ingredient of Ayurvedic tonic. Tonics, rejuvenators and vitalizers of Ayurveda appear to induce immunity ( [Singh et al., 1986](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722/#R34)) and longevity in the users.\" In terms of its stress-relieving properties, [Australian researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750292/) point out that Ashwagandha is likely to work by way of the herb's moderating effect on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis \u2014 the glands involved in the body's physiological reaction to stress. This is important because a full recovery from illness necessitates dealing with the stress that can potentially stand in the way to the body's ability to bring itself into balance. Ashwagandha for recovery It's no secret that rest aids recovery. A good sleep has been the cure for many conditions \u2014 from headaches to digestive issues. Retired Cornell University scientist [ James Maas, PhD](https://experiencelife.com/article/the-healing-power-of-sleep/), one of the world's foremost sleep researchers, said that at least 70 percent of Americans do not get enough sleep, and this puts them at risk for serious health problems. But, happily, Ashwagandha is promotes restful sleep. [Japanese researchers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5313221/) noted that the root or whole plant extract of Ashwagandha has a long tradition of use to help induce sleep. This is important because poor sleep is a cofactor in most major illnesses and a wide array of mind-body symptoms. Ayurvedic medicine classifies Ashwagandha as a Rasayana herb \u2014 one that promotes homeostasis, which, in turn, slows the aging process and prevents illness. Ashwagandha boosts body- and brain-health in a number of ways, including the increase of the stress tolerance and immune system strength. The result, of course, translates to quicker recovery. The scientific name for Ashwagandha is Withania somnifera, with \"somnifera\" meaning \"sleep-inducing.\" Ayurvedic doctors have been recommending the herb for sound sleep throughout the centuries. As an adaptogen, Ashwagandha corrects the imbalance between the immune and neuroendocrine systems to normalize bodily functions under stressed conditions. A good night's sleep helps this process along. The body wants to recover Our bodies are imbued with complex and dynamic systems that help us recover from illness and protect us from all sorts of health-threatening phenomena. The herbs in Ayurveda are used to restore balance to the body. When using ashwagandha for immune support, recovery and stress relief, it helps bring the body back into balance and better able to support the immune system. [Mandip Goyal,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6369608/) editor of the International Quarterly Journal of Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat, India, explained that the time has come for world healers to take a closer look at the philosophy of prevention and preservation in Ayurveda as the first step in treatment and to recovery. While every system of Western medicine emphasizes treating disease, said Goyal, in Ayurveda, treating a disease is always secondary. The first order of business is to maintain and preserve health. It takes a healthy immune system to accomplish this. Ayurveda's historical use of Ashwagandha has been to improve the immune system to allow the body to find equilibrium. With proper balance of mind, body, spirit, and emotions, health is the natural outcome. "}
