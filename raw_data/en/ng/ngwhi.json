Some Words From Sabrina about the Meditation: The first time I did this journey... Goddess Artemis came to visit me, and armed me with wisdom and understanding of myself, I didn't even know I needed. (Hence the bow and arrow symbolism... if you ever see me use it I'm beyond excited to facilitate this healing journey for you to meet one of your spiritual guides... reminding you of your worth, your value, how much you are loved, and showing you any information you need at this time on your journey. This journey is more direct, simple, traveling to meet your guide, absorb the wisdom and healing, and bring it back with you into your daily life. Again in an hour and a half, with opportunity to share and connect with other journey participants if you desire. Before we start, we will talk a little bit more about Shamanic Journeying, and tips to success and trusting the messages that come through, in whatever form they arrive. Your intuitive minds will have more room and space to allow in imagery this time. ~ Pay as you can option: [August Healing Meditation & Shamanic Journey Pay-as-you-can Registration](https://checkout.square.site/merchant/D38AWEDHQ8TDX/checkout/TYFSH6VXTECFZ6QQRA5E5AQE) I hope each of you are doing well, and finding some magic and support in each of your days.
