This ancient form of medicine is based on the belief that a misalignment in the body's vital energies can cause illness. In modern times, acupuncture can help increase blood flow, which increases tissue oxygenation. Our team at Canyon Animal Hospital believes in using pet acupuncture to supplement medical therapy. During an veterinary acupuncture treatment, tiny needles are inserted into an animal's body at precise points (meridians) where nerves and blood vessels converge. The needles help movement of vital energy along these meridians. This supports the nervous system and promotes circulation while enhancing the body's ability to heal. Our veterinarians frequently recommend pet acupuncture or other types of Chinese medicine to help treat a variety of issues, including: Chemotherapy and other medical treatments can make your pet feel very uneasy. They are frequently used in conjunction with acupuncture to alleviate pain and aid in the treatment of your cat or dog's illness. Acupuncture is frequently used to help people recover from injuries. Acupuncture is also effective for conditions like arthritis, nerve injuries, and hip dysplasia. Pet acupuncture can help with hot spots, granulomas, and allergic dermatitis by encouraging increased circulation. It can also help with healing and pain relief, resulting in less itching and over-grooming. Acupuncture can help to stimulate digestive secretions, which promotes healthy digestion. Increased blood flow may help with conditions like diarrhea or nausea. Acupuncture treatment can help asthma, allergies, and other conditions by calming the immune system and reducing inflammation.
