Take a look at the great traditions we have here at HCU. Join in with your HCU Spirit and Husky Pride to keep the Legacy going. HCU Traditions - [Hail the Orange & Blue (HCU Alma Mater)](#panel-0-64fa5548b48d3) The HCU Alma Mater \"Hail the Orange & Blue\" is traditionally sung: - After all sporting events (win or lose) - At the Commencement - After special Convocations - At special HCU events (Homecoming, Family Weekend, etc) Lyrics: In the great state of Texas, Houston, USA, Stands our noble Alma Mater, Christ saying I am the Way. In our search for knowledge, Tempered with Thy love, Seeking our place of service, With wisdom from above. Give us courage, strength and faith, To face a world filled with fear. Ever onward to the challenge, Knowing Thou art near. God bless our school. Keep her safe and true. God bless our Alma Mater. Hail the Orange and Blue. Music & Lyrics by Dr. W.H. Hinton and Dr. Don Looser - [HCU Fight Song](#panel-1-64fa5548b48d3) When our Huskies need an extra push of encouragement, we gather and sing the FIGHT SONG! Lyrics: Get up and go, you mighty Huskies Give it a fight for HCU. Whenever the goin' is rough and things are tough, Don't give up the fight. Shoulder the load, hold to the road, Pull with all your might. Get up and go, you mighty Huskies Give it a hail for orange and blue. Get ready to meet the test, show your best Drive until you've made History, with victory You'll win for HCU. Music & Lyrics by Dr. Robert L. Parker - [The Beanie](#panel-2-64fa5548b48d3) Strong in Mind, Strong in Body, Strong in Spirit One of HCU's oldest traditions, the Beanie is a hat won by our incoming Freshman students during their first week of school. Each freshman that attends Welcome Days will participate in the Beanie Ceremony where they are charged with carrying on or creating a legacy here at HCU. Proper wearing of the Beanie: Proper wearing of the Beanie is bill to the front, with the HCU letters proudly showing When should I wear my Beanie?: During the first week of your first year; rain, shine, night and day. Why is the Beanie special?: The Beanie helps HCU recognize and welcome our incoming students. It also allows students to bond with a long-standing tradition, and with their fellow classmates. - [The Beanie Ceremony](#panel-3-64fa5548b48d3) Join a legacy and the tradition..... During Welcome Days all freshman students have the privilege of participating in a time honored tradition where they are knighted with their Beanie. This ceremony celebrates the legacies that are being continued, and the new legacies that are being made. - [Tug-of-War](#panel-4-64fa5548b48d3) The ultimate battle of the classes! During the first week of school, the Freshman class battle the Upperclassmen in a battle of Tug-of-War. If the Freshmen win the battle they are free to remove their Beanie. If they lose......which they always do....... they must continue wearing their Beanie's proud for one more week! - [Dawgs Up!](#panel-5-64fa5548b48d3) HCU's official hand sign. How to do it: Place your middle finger and ring finger to your thumb with you pointer and pinky finger sticking straight up. When to do it: When you hear someone yell, \"DAWGS UP!\" Throw your Dawg in the air and bark! Be ready at all times! You never know when the yell will come! Remember keep that snout out and those ears up! - [The HCU Seal](#panel-6-64fa5548b48d3) The HCU Seal is a source of pride for HCU.
