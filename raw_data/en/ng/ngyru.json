Spirulina is incredibly nutritious, and has numerous health benefits.", "sitename": "Healthline Media", "date": "2018-10-05", "cleaned_text": "type of algae that grows in fresh or salt water. It comes as a supplement, in tablet or powder form. People use it for its health benefits, as it is rich in nutrients and has antioxidant properties. [Spirulina is among the world's most popular supplements. It is not a plant but a type of algae that consists of cyanobacteria. Spirulina supplements are dark green in color.] People use spirulina to boost their levels of nutrients and antioxidants in their body, and it may help protect against various diseases. Here are 10 evidence-based health uses and benefits of spirulina. Spirulina is an organism that grows in both fresh and salt water ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32133854/) It is a type of cyanobacteria, which is a family of single-celled microbes that are often referred to as blue-green [algae](/nutrition/algae-oil) ( [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882571/) Just like plants, cyanobacteria can produce energy from sunlight via a process called photosynthesis. Spirulina was consumed by the ancient Aztecs but became popular again when NASA proposed that it could be grown in space for use by astronauts ( [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5609256/) [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9143897/) This tiny alga is packed with nutrients. A single tablespoon (tbsp.), or 7 g, of dried spirulina powder contains ( [5](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170495/nutrients) - Protein: 4 g - 14% of Daily Value - Riboflavin: - Iron: 11% of the DV It also contains decent amounts of [magnesium](/nutrition/magnesium-benefits/), [potassium](/health/potassium), and manganese. In addition, the same amount contains only 20 calories and less than 2 g of carbohydrates. Spirulina also provides a small amount of fat \u2014 around 1 g per tbsp. (7 g) \u2014 including both [omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids](/nutrition/optimize-omega-6-omega-3-ratio) in an approximately 1.5-1.0 ratio. Plus, the quality of the protein in spirulina is considered excellent and provides all of the [essential amino acids](/nutrition/essential-amino-acids) that your body needs ( [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32133854/) Note that it is often claimed that spirulina contains [vitamin B12,](/nutrition/vitamin-b12-benefits) but this is false. It has pseudovitamin B12, which has not been shown to be effective in humans ( [6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157522000825)). Summary Spirulina is a type of blue-green algae that grows in both salt and fresh water. It is highly nutritious and a great source of protein, copper, and B vitamins. Oxidative damage can harm your cells and can drive [chronic inflammation](/health/chronic-inflammation), which contributes to cancer and other diseases ( [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5927356/) Spirulina is a fantastic source of antioxidants, which can protect against oxidative damage ( [8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34235823/) Its main active component is called phycocyanin, which is an [antioxidant](/nutrition/antioxidants-explained) that also gives spirulina its unique blue color ( [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7938138/) Phycocyanin can fight [free radicals](/health/oxidative-stress/) and block the production of molecules that promote inflammation, providing impressive antioxidant and [anti-inflammatory](/nutrition/13-anti-inflammatory-foods) effects ( [10](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31775595/) Summary Phycocyanin is the main active compound in spirulina. It has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Heart disease is the world's [leading cause of death](/health/heart-disease/statistics/) ( [11](https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases) Many risk factors are linked to an increased risk of heart disease. As it turns out, spirulina positively impacts many of these factors. For example, it can [lower total cholesterol](/nutrition/how-to-lower-cholesterol/), LDL (bad) cholesterol, and [triglycerides](/nutrition/13-ways-to-lower-triglycerides), while also increasing HDL (good) cholesterol ( [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26433766/) According to one review, spirulina was able to significantly improve these markers in people with [metabolic syndrome](/health/metabolic-syndrome/) and related disorders ( [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31359513/) Another 2014 study in people with [high cholesterol](/health/high-cholesterol/levels-by-age/) determined that 1 g of spirulina per day [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23754631) Summary Studies indicate that spirulina can lower triglycerides and improve cholesterol levels, which may support heart health. Fatty structures in your body are susceptible to [oxidative damage](/health/oxidative-stress). This is known as lipid peroxidation, a key driver of many serious diseases ( [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466575/) For example, one of the key steps in the development of heart disease is the oxidation of LDL cholesterol ( [16](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30362886/) Interestingly, several studies have found that the [antioxidants](/nutrition/foods-high-in-antioxidants) in spirulina may be particularly effective at reducing lipid peroxidation ( [17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4320919/) [18](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35394687/) In fact, one small study showed that spirulina supplementation was able to reduce exercise-induced lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and muscle damage in 17 rugby players ( [18](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35394687/) Summary Fatty structures in your body can become oxidized, driving the progression of many diseases. Some research suggests that the antioxidants in spirulina may help prevent this. While more studies are needed, some evidence suggests that spirulina has [anti-cancer properties](/nutrition/cancer-fighting-foods). Research in animals indicates that it can reduce cancer occurrence and tumor size ( [19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34606108/) [20](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34371830/) Spirulina's effects on [oral cancer](/health/oral-cancer/) \u2014 or cancer of the mouth \u2014 have been particularly well studied. In fact, several studies have found that spirulina supplementation can be useful for the management of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a type of precancerous lesion in the mouth ( [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6585230/) [22](https://www.jomos.org/articles/mbcb/full_html/2022/01/mbcb210176/mbcb210176.html)). In another 2013 study of 40 individuals with OSMF lesions, 1 g of spirulina per day led to greater improvement in OSMF symptoms than pentoxifylline, a medication used to promote blood flow ( [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3919363/) Summary Spirulina may have anti-cancer properties and appears especially effective against certain types of precancerous lesions of the mouth. However, more research is needed. [High blood pressure](/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/lower-it-fast) is a main driver of many serious conditions, including heart attack, stroke, and [chronic kidney disease](/health/chronic-kidney-disease/) ( [24](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31865786) One review of five studies found that taking 1-8 g of spirulina per day could significantly reduce both [systolic and diastolic blood pressure](/health/diastole-vs-systole/), especially for people with high [blood pressure levels](https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/) ( [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468496/) This reduction is thought to be driven by an increased production of [nitric oxide](/nutrition/how-to-increase-nitric-oxide), a signaling molecule that helps your blood vessels relax and dilate ( [26](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31772708/) Summary Spirulina may increase production of nitric oxide and reduce blood pressure levels, a major risk factor for many chronic conditions. [Allergic rhinitis](/health/allergic-rhinitis) is characterized by inflammation in your nasal passageways. It is triggered by [environmental allergens](/health/allergies/environmental-allergies/), such as [pollen](https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/pollen/), animal hair, or even wheat dust ( [27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538186/) [28](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26889090/) Spirulina is a popular alternative treatment for symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and there is evidence that it can be effective ( [29](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.21.21265199v1.full)). For instance, one study found that spirulina was more effective than [cetirizine](/health/drugs/cetirizine/), an [antihistamine](https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/antihistamine-brands/) used to treat allergies, for improving symptoms of allergic rhinitis and decreasing inflammation ( [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416373/) However, more research is needed. Summary Spirulina supplements may be effective against allergic rhinitis, but more research is needed. Anemia is a condition characterized by a reduction in hemoglobin or [red blood cells](/health/rbc-count/) in your blood ( [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499994) There are many possible causes of anemia, included [nutrient deficiencies](/nutrition/7-common-nutrient-deficiencies), genetic disorders, and chronic inflammation, among others ( [31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499994) Anemia is fairly common in older adults, leading to prolonged feelings of weakness and [fatigue](/nutrition/10-reasons-you-are-tired) ( [32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697587/) In one 2011 study in 40 older people with a history of anemia, spirulina supplements increased the hemoglobin content of red blood cells and improved immune function ( [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012879/) Some other studies in animals have also found that spirulina could improve [hemoglobin However, more high-quality, recent studies in humans are still needed. Summary One study suggests that spirulina can reduce anemia in older adults. Some animal studies have also found that spirulina could be beneficial for anemia, but more research is needed. Exercise-induced oxidative damage is a major contributor to [muscle fatigue](/health/muscle-fatigue) ( [37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498668/) Certain plant foods have antioxidant properties that can help athletes and people who are [physically active](/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise) individuals minimize this damage. Spirulina appears beneficial, as some studies pointed to improved muscle strength and endurance ( [38](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8937016/) In one study, spirulina supplementation was able to improve oxygen uptake during an arm cycling exercise, with researchers noting that it could act as [ergogenic aid](/health/performance-enhancers-safe-deadly) to [enhance athletic performance](/health/foods-naturally-enhance-athletic-performance/) ( [39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7674321/) Summary Spirulina may provide multiple exercise benefits, including enhanced endurance and increased muscle strength. Several animal studies suggest that spirulina could help [lower blood sugar](/nutrition/15-ways-to-lower-blood-sugar) levels ( [40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7507773/) [41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7547908/) There is also some evidence that spirulina can support healthy blood sugar levels in humans. According to one review of eight studies, spirulina supplementation in doses ranging from 0.8-8 g daily could significantly reduce [fasting blood sugar levels](/health/diabetes/fasting-glucose-normal-range/) in people with [type 2 diabetes](https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/) ( [42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8212345/) However, there was no significant effect on blood sugar levels after eating or levels of [hemoglobin A1c](/health/diabetes/ways-to-lower-your-a1c-level), which is used to measure long-term [blood sugar control](/nutrition/foods-to-lower-blood-sugar/) ( [42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8212345/) Therefore, more research is needed. Summary Some evidence suggests that spirulina may benefit people with type 2 diabetes by significantly reducing fasting blood sugar levels. Still, more studies are needed. What does spirulina do to the body? Spirulina contains protein, vitamins, and minerals and has antioxidant properties. It may help manage inflammation, blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure, among other benefits. Who should not take spirulina? Spirulina may not be safe for: - children - anyone who is pregnant or breastfeeding - people with an autoimmune disease - those who will be having surgery within 2 weeks - anyone using medications that affect the immune system, [blood clotting](/health/blood-clots-where-can-they-form/), or blood sugar - anyone using [garlic](/nutrition/11-proven-health-benefits-of-garlic/)or other natural remedies for blood clotting or [glucose](https://www.healthline.com/health/glucose/)levels Always check with a doctor that spirulina is safe for you to use, follow any instructions with care, and obtain your supplements from a reputable source. Some products may be contaminated with heavy metals and other toxins or bacteria ( [43](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/923.html)). Are you supposed to take spirulina everyday? Most people who use spirulina take 1-10 grams every day for up to 6 months. A doctor can advise on how often to use it, how much to take, and for how long ( [43](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/923.html)). How much spirulina should I use? The National Institutes of Health (NIH) note that people have safely used up to 19 g per day for a maximum of 2 months and up to 10 g per day for a maximum of 6 months ( [44](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/natural/923.html)). Why does spirulina give me energy? One older research article notes that spirulina enables the body to release vitamin B6, a substance that helps with energy release. A more recent review notes that it seems to improve both physical and mental fatigue by providing various nutrients needed for effective brain function ( [45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136577/) [46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8224803/) Spirulina is a type of cyanobacteria \u2014 often referred to as blue-green algae \u2014 that is highly nutritious. Studies show that it may improve cholesterol and [triglyceride levels](/health/triglycerides/), suppress oxidation, reduce blood pressure, and lower fasting blood sugar levels. However, more research is needed. If you want to give this supplement a try, it's widely available in stores and online. "}
