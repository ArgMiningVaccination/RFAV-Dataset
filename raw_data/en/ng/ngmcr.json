Now we aim to explore more about the details. All things are interrelated Ayurveda is a combination of ancient Indian health science that recognizes the necessity to maintain a harmony of body, mind and spirit. Besides, all things are interrelated, this is why Ayurveda has an integral aspiration: Central elements are: Ayurveda massage and Ayurveda cleansing technologies, dietetics, spiritual yoga practice and herbal medicine. Briefly summarized: increasing the well-being and prevention of diseases, stress management, improvement of fitness and nature, play an important role in the Ayurveda philosophy. The aim: a holistic healthy life style. Three Doshas in Balance A central term in the Ayurveda concept is Dosha, what could cause problems\". The three Doshas and associated elements are Vata (air and wind), Pitta (fire and water) and Kapha (water and earth). It is thought that they give a person its individual constitution and adjust its physical and spiritual function. If there is an imbalance, it can lead to indisposition and sickness. Accordingly, the individual constitution of the Doshas are defined at the beginning of an Ayurveda treatment in order to bring them in balance. To restore this balance and reject amassed slags, food therapy, ordinal therapy, plant science and certain cleansing procedures, so-called Panchakarma are used. Fasts, baths define Panchakarma, traditionally moreover, enemas, therapeutic vomiting and bloodletting that are carried out in the West mostly in a weakened form. Popular are massages, yoga and breathing exercises, color and music therapies and Ayurveda food. Eat properly with variety - better than every medicine Food plays a substantial role at the whole Ayurveda teachings. This means for one thing that your food choice should complement your individual Dosha : Since the healthiest food doesn't pay if your body cannot process it well. Digestion is an important subject. Hence, in the Ayurveda kitchen you will seldom find raw vegetarian food, almost all dishes are cooked, sweet dishes are often passed before the main dish because they are heavier to be digested. Moreover, a lot of value is placed in the fact that a meal demands of all of your functions of food - bite, suck, chew, leak, swallow - and that the sense of taste (\"Rasas\") - sour, salty, bitter and sharp - are combined in a harmonious manner. The ten king's spices of the Ayurveda kitchen with their healing powers ensure this. The Ayurveda kitchen is also very tasty and based on a particular nice rule: If you eat, eat\" - take your meals together with other people, eat in peace and a relaxed atmosphere.
