From there, she'll gently tailor the session around your needs and goals - including Intuitive Coaching techniques, a customized wellness plan will be formulated (including herbs, nutrition, supplement, lifestyle and mindfulness practices), visual tongue analysis and energy healing. Calls are most often over video-conferencing, though audio-only phone calls are available if you are a returning client (and Erin has met with you either in person or over video previously). Most of Erin's distance clients have a standing-time for their sessions, spaced at a frequency of weekly, bi-monthly or monthly depending on their needs and goals. Energy Healing Distance Energy healing not only offers up more information on the root of your current struggles through your customized Energy Scan, but an opportunity to immediately shift deeply rooted energetic patterning. The actual distance-energy-healing portion of your session takes 10-15 min, and can be integrated into the [50-min or 25-min calls](https://acusimple.com/access/4098/#/appointments/). The energy healing portion of your session begins with 5 min of silence while Erin drops-in to scan your energy field. From there, she will provide gentle energetic manipulation of acupuncture points, meridians and chakras as per your system's unique needs for that day. Because this form of healing uses energetic resonance and the quantum field, it can be done without physical touch. During this time, it is recommended that you find a comfortable place to rest and breathe and begin receiving energetic shifts. After the brief period of silence, Erin will be in verbal communication with you throughout the remainder of the distance healing as relevant to your system's needs in that time - about 10-15 minutes total. Once the energy has balanced, she will close the session with an intentional energetic nourishment practice that helps your system integrate the work. She will then share her findings in service of cultivated practices and suggestions that can be used after your session to deepen the effects. While this form of energy healing is not mandatory in distance sessions, Erin encourages her distance clients to utilize this offering as it has shown to deepen + lengthen the results from her calls.
