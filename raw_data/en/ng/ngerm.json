One of my first memories of Dharma is his impromptu performance of Beatles songs at a talent night at a professional conference for which I was the master of ceremonies. Wielding a well-used guitar and wearing his immaculate white turban, he made a wonderful symbol of East meeting West. A childlike joy emanated from him, drawing the audience into a space of delight. The yogic disciplines that Dharma has mastered and practices faithfully have not made him dry and ascetic. Rather, they have allowed him to live life more fully and abundantly, with great mental and physical strength. They can do the same for you. For almost twenty years I researched the mind/body connection, the pathways through which the mind and emotions affect immunity and other physiological systems. Like many researchers in integrative medicine, my interest in the field stemmed from personal health problems that the best of our powerful modern medicine could not help. Chronic migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, dizziness, anxiety, and an irregular heartbeat made my graduate studies at Harvard Medical School very difficult. Fortunately, my lab partner in physiology was a student of yoga. He suggested that I try some of the same yogic breathing exercises and meditations that Dr. Khalsa outlines so effectively for you. After a few months of practicing these techniques, my symptoms disappeared. I felt more peaceful and joyful than I had believed possible. My personal experience with meditation and yoga inspired the desire to help others. While an assistant professor at Tufts Medical School in Boston, I taught yoga and meditation to staff, faculty, and students. Then in 1978 I accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard with Dr. Herbert Benson, with whom I had worked briefly as a graduate student a decade previously. In 1967 I assisted Dr. Benson with his research on biofeedback, in which he demonstrated that blood pressure can be controlled by behavioral means. Then our paths parted. Dr. Benson began to study the physiological effects of meditation, which he called the relaxation response. I studied the pathology of cancer cells, researching ways to make them behave normally. When my beloved father died of cancer, I realized that I knew a great deal about cancer cells, but almost nothing about the experience of people with cancer and that of their loved ones. Drs. Carl and Stephanie Simon-ton were just beginning their explorations of mental imagery, attitude, and cancer survival. I joined with Dr. Benson in the hope of contributing something useful to this new field of behavioral medicine and cancer. More than twenty years have passed since that time, and a great deal of medical research on the effects of yoga and meditation has begun to prove their efficacy. While much research remains to be done, you will read of the great strides that have been made in the chapters to follow. The medical and psychological effects of ancient, time-tested healing techniques from other cultures, including Qi Gong from Chinese medicine and yoga from India, are an area of intense exploration. Dr. Benson's pioneering research on the health benefits of focused attention, which elicit the relaxation response, provided an important first step. Whenever the mind is focused on the here and now, cutting off the anxiety-provoking inner dialogue that conjures images of past troubles or future problems, an integrated hypothalamic response that decreases the fight-or-flight response is initiated. Not only does this response short-circuit needless activation of the stress-producing sympathetic nervous system, it also yields entry into more refined control of the nervous system. For example, the Tibetan practice of gtumo yoga enables the meditator to increase body temperature and remain comfortable in freezing temperatures, while essentially naked and wrapped in wet sheets, which soon dry from the body heat generated by gtumo practice. This well-researched physiological effect is a step beyond the relaxation response that serves as a gateway for more sophisticated physiological control. The next frontier in medical yoga and meditation is outlined by Dr. Khalsa in these pages. What meditation techniques are especially useful for specific medical conditions? Some research has already been done, but much more remains. Nonetheless, the collected experience of thousands of years suggests that different meditative techniques stimulate specific physical responses. Much of modern medical treatment stems from similar logic. Many accepted treatments are based on demonstrated clinical usefulness, even when the specific physiological mechanisms have yet to be worked out. In this book, for the first time, a program of Medical Meditation that bridges ancient wisdom with developments in modern science is made available. In the years to come, we will doubtless learn much more about the molecular underpinnings of these practices. Until that time, we can rely on the fact that these time-honored techniques have proved their utility over the thousands of years during which they were developed and practiced. The practices are clearly outlined and easily learned. The chapter on breathing alone can transform your body and mind. This book is a treasure, presenting techniques that just a few years ago were unavailable to the average person. Use it with confidence. Medical Meditation can help bring about well-being, spiritual healing\u2014a sense of deep connection to life, compassion, and peace of mind\u2014and, in many cases, needed physical healing. A Personal Prologue Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D. In your hands you hold a book that can change your life. Using meditation as medicine has helped hundreds of thousands of people around the globe recover from illness, resolve emotional conflicts and reach their optimal potential in mind, body and spirit. My own experience with Medical Meditation, the type presented in this book, goes back to August 1978. After finishing my anesthesiology residency at the University of California, San Francisco, I moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for my first hospital position. I recall very clearly asking the wife of a friend where I could find a yoga class. At the time I was a practitioner of basic yoga and the Transcendental Meditation technique. Leslie simply pointed to a listing in a local alternative newspaper and said, I hear that's a good one. So off I went. Little did I know that this class would totally transform my life. It was a session in kundalini yoga and meditation as taught by Yogi Bhajan. The facilitator of the class that day was a young man with a beard and a turban. For some reason, I had a sense that this was exactly the right thing to do. Finding your dharma, or true path, I think, depends on having a feel for your own destiny, so that you know it when you see it. One fine day, you just happen to peek through a crack in your world\u2014and there it is. When I began to do kundalini yoga and meditation\u2014essentially the same form of meditation that I later adapted as Medical Meditation\u2014it changed me forever. I experienced a very elevated state, mentally, physically, and spiritually, which felt very healing to me. This feeling is so indescribable and indefinable that I think it makes the most sense to describe it only in terms that are allegorical or amorphous, such as highest self. I'm certain you know what I mean. You've felt it. You may not have felt it for years, maybe not since your childhood, but you still remember it. Once you've felt it, the feeling's there forever. For about two years, I continued to practice kundalini yoga and meditation almost daily, but had not yet decided to integrate it absolutely into the fabric of my life, personally and professionally. Over this same period of time, I had also become very interested in the religion that is often associated with kundalini yoga, Sikhism. Kundalini yoga and Sikhism are two very different things; they both originated in India, but one is an ancient science, and the other is a religion. In America virtually all Western Sikhs practice kundalini, but the majority of the world's 15 million Sikhs, most of whom live in India, do not practice kundalini. One major reason that many of America's kundalini practitioners have converted to Sikhism is because Sikhism is the religion of Yogi Bhajan, America's only kundalini yoga master, who was raised in the Sikh tradition in India. Because of the powerful influence of Yogi Bhajan, the Mahan Tantric (or highest living yoga master in the world), if a person practices kundalini in America, he or she is sure to be exposed to Sikhism. Personally, the more I saw of it, the more I liked it. I loved the universality of it, the assumption that there is only one God, but that it can be equally proper to address this God as Allah, or Jehovah, or God, or Vishnu. I also loved the religion's strong and simple moral code: Help other people. In addition, I was captivated by its lack of a punitive, judgmental attitude, and its insistence that being happy is as godly as being holy. I discovered that Sikhism, the world's fifth-largest religion, is short on dogma but full of heart. Still, I wasn't quite ready to take the leap and commit completely to the vigorous and altruistic Sikh lifestyle, including wearing the traditional turban, which helps keep kundalini energy elevated. Before deciding to adopt Sikhism, I sought the advice of the fabled Yogi Bhajan, whom I'd never met. I'd heard he was a man of ultimate honesty, and that if he thought this wasn't right for me, as an individual, he'd tell me so. I drove over to a house where he was staying in Albuquerque. What happened next felt very strange, almost surrealistic. He was lying on a couch in the house amid a large group of people. As I entered the room, it seemed as if the Red Sea of people between us parted, and that I glided over to him, not on my own power, in a movement that felt nothing like walking. But before I could speak, all I could see were his luminous eyes as he said, \"Tell me, Doctor, how much money do you make?\" To this day I'm not sure why he said what he did, but in that brief moment I was blasted out of the conventional doctor-box forever. Then he closed his eyes and went into a deep meditation, and for some reason I didn't feel at all shut out. In fact, I felt as if he were including me, on a level much deeper than the one on which a host usually includes his guest. When he opened his eyes, I was waiting for him to say something profound. He said, Let's go to the movies. So we did, along with a number of other people. Then something else unusual happened. I went to the restroom, and as I was washing my hands, Yogi Bhajan emerged from one of the stalls. He said, We are together. Then I heard him say, Again. I started to say, Yes, again. Stopped. I realized that he hadn't actually said Again\u2014even though I'd heard it just as distinctly as the rest of his statement. Of course, this could have been my imagination, but I'd never before imagined anything at all like this. Did he mean again as in a previous life or again as in today? I was beginning to think that either this was the most intuitive, tuned-in person I'd ever met, or that I was in the Twilight Zone. Two weeks later, I went to Espanola, New Mexico, the picturesque desert village that is Yogi Bhajan's retreat. For the first time, I donned a turban and the traditional white clothing that Sikhs wear. I wanted to talk to Yogi Bhajan. I was concerned that this striking form of dress would change my identity at the hospital. In addition, if I converted, I would have to change my name to Khalsa, or Pure One, because that's the traditional last name of all Sikhs, who are members of the Brotherhood of the Khalsa. These would be major changes for me\u2014hard ones. Even so, they were changes that I hoped would help me find spiritual fulfillment. As I pondered my destiny, or dharma, I couldn't help but think about my father, who had, I feared, died spiritually unfulfilled at the relatively young age of sixty-three from pancreatic cancer. I also thought about my two uncles, men of achievement, but maybe not fulfillment, dead also at sixty-three. Sixty-three didn't seem that far away. I approached Yogi Bhajan, who noted my turban. He said, Do you think you can go before the public like that? It may take some time, I said. Time, he replied. What is time? Do you think sixty-three years is a long time? I had begun to say no when I realized that he had pulled the number 63 out of thin air, or out of my mind, and I was very startled and amazed. But then my amazement seemed to congeal into a laserlike beam of understanding that traveled straight from my forehead to that of Yogi Bhajan. At that moment, I felt suddenly capable of committing myself to a new life and a new name. I wrote down my American name, and my date and place of birth, and gave it to Yogi Bhajan. He performed a yogic calculation, wrote my spiritual name, or Sikh name, on a piece of paper, and handed it to me. It said, Dharma Singh: A pure lion on a victorious path. Another way to interpret it would be: A man who fights like a lion for his destiny. At the instant I saw the name, the buzzing, floating feeling in my forehead intensified, and I felt as if I had for the first time in my life opened my third eye, or sixth chakra\u2014the only part of me that can see without illusion. Then and there, my life changed forever. I knew that I could take the truths I had learned from advanced Medical Meditation and apply them successfully to the world of modern medicine, and that matters of dress and status were utterly trivial compared to what I hoped to achieve. No longer would I have to be content with using modern drugs as an anesthesiologist to make patients unconscious. Now I could truly help them become conscious human beings. I became Dharma. Throughout these ensuing twenty-plus years I have used Medical Meditation to elevate myself and help my patients heal. Your journey to healing lies within you. In your hands you hold the key to the success of that journey. Using Medical Meditations will activate the power of your natural healing force, the force that allows your body, mind, and spirit to heal themselves. Meditation is a natural physiological event, well studied and actually quite simple to perform. As I will show you in this book, it is also medically specific. The healing energy Medical Meditation generates involves the complete mind-body-spirit connection. It creates a state of exaltation, the essence of which ultimately creates total health and regeneration. It is your birthright as a human being to be healthy, happy, and whole. Now is the time to claim this power. Meditation as Medicine provides all the tools you will ever need. Let us begin. May the long time sun shine upon you, all love surround you, and the pure light within you guide your way on. PART ONE Healing with Medical Meditation CHAPTER ONE Introducing Medical Meditation Just before dawn, in the intense quiet outside my desert home, slight sun and deep shadow swirl together, coloring the eastern sky a streaked gray, with a slash of brightness at the horizon, promising light. This is not the darkest, but the lightest hour of the night. As the most distant stars begin to blink off, warmth fights the nighttime chill, and the mix of hot and cold twirls in a breeze that touches my face. As the stillness of night gives way, cardinals and finches begin to tentatively test the quiet. In the hills and canyons behind my house, their songs herald the sun. It reminds me of a proverb: Faith is the bird that feels the light, and sings while the dawn is still dark. I discovered that if I listened carefully to the birds that lived around my house, and whistled their own cries\u2014not just generic birdcalls, but each bird's own signature song\u2014they would often answer. A cardinal calls; I do my best to mimic his cry, and I am rewarded with a reply: Whit-chewww! Whit-whit-whit-whit! As we trade sounds, I focus on the exquisite beauty of the desert that surrounds my rural Tucson, Arizona, home. I see that the rugged perfection of the desert, with its infinite capacity for survival, reflects the most fundamental secrets of healing: balance, regeneration, and the ability to change. I feel certain that if I can help my patients find these powers in themselves, I can help them heal. And on this day I will need these powers badly, because a patient is coming to me who has lost faith that a new day will always dawn for her. She has a terrible medical problem, and fears, quite realistically, that she will be paralyzed for the rest of her life. Sadly, the grip that paralysis holds on her has practically stopped her life, even while she still draws breath. She is still struggling through the motions of life, but she doesn't have much heart or hope left. She is clinging desperately to her old habits and perceptions, as if change itself were death. I look to the horizon, now pink with blue, close my eyes, and ask God to give me the power to speak to this frightened person in her own language, so that I can reach her center and reignite the spark that has been snuffed. In my mind I can see the sun, brilliant and pulsing, still on the other side of the world. A force begins to flow into me as I begin my first mantra of the day: Ong Namo, Guru Dev Namo ( I bow before my highest self). It's always my first mantra. On this day, I mean this mantra with all my heart, because I know that only my highest self\u2014the part of me that can feel the universal spirit\u2014can help heal my patient's tortured soul and broken body. As time falls away, I chant, Ong Namo, Guru Dev Namo. I can speak the words in English, I bow before my highest consciousness, but it would not have the same physical effect. The ancient Sanskrit words that I chant every morning have a very specific physiological action. The reverberative sounds in them vibrate the pituitary, just above the roof of my mouth, which changes the secretions of this master gland of the endocrine system. Obviously, the ancient yoga masters who devised this mantra had no anatomic knowledge of the pituitary, but they did know that the Ong Namo mantra worked. Quite simply, it made people feel more like themselves\u2014their true selves, their highest selves. It doesn't concern me that the ancient masters didn't know about the pituitary, because even today doctors don't know why some of their treatments work\u2014they still don't know why aspirin stops pain, they just know that it does. The ancient yoga masters taught that this mantra and others should be chanted before dawn. They did not know that the hours just before sunrise are critical to the body's balance of hormones and neurotransmitters, which the pituitary influences. Modern neuroscientists know now that these are the hours during which the endocrine and neurotransmitter balance shifts from relative domination by sleep-inducing melatonin to relative domination by serotonin, norepinephrine, and cortisol. If this shift does not occur smoothly, it can have very distressing, and even disastrous, effects. It can diminish the production of stimulating neurochemicals, and leave people groggy and depressed all day. Or it can have the opposite effect, and cause overproduction of the stress hormone cortisol, which can cause agitation, immune dysfunction, memory loss, and premature aging. The ancient yoga masters knew nothing of the endocrine system, but they did know that there was something magical and empowering in the predawn hours, which they called the ambrosial hours. As the sun slowly begins to bathe my face in radiance, my sense of personal power, serenity, and intuition continue to expand. I keep meditating, and doing exercises of kundalini yoga. These exercises heighten the presence of life energy, or vitality, which the ancient masters called kundalini. The exercises are the physical element of meditation, and are every bit as important as the mental element, since mind and body are inseparable. I finish by chanting the Mantra of Ecstasy, Wahe Guru ( Out of darkness, into light). Suddenly a hot knot of fear hits my stomach, hard as a fist. How could I possibly help heal this young woman? She has a spinal injury that is, by all conventional medical reckoning, beyond help. She clearly wants me to work a miracle, but no honest doctor can ever presume that capability. I vowed over the phone to do whatever I could to help her. But ever since she called, I've been uneasy. Afraid to be totally honest. I was afraid I would let her down, and add to her emptiness. But I pushed down the fear and rationalized it. I went back to my work. On a conscious level, the fear went away. During my meditation, though, my fear has resurfaced. Maybe my meditative mental state, which is analogous to a hypnotic state, has allowed the fear to break out. Or maybe the yoga I was doing released emotions that I stored in neuropeptides in my abdominal area. I know it may sound like scifi to say that emotions can literally be stored in the gut, but the latest neurological research, by Dr. Candace Pert and others, indicates that this astounding mind-body function is quite real. Many of your gut feelings are literally the results of the neurochemicals that abound in your upper intestine. As quickly as my fear hit, it evaporated. I felt much better, as I always do when meditation lets me release fear or anger. Some people think that meditation is nothing but sitting around feeling blissful, like a latter-day Buddha with a big enlightened smile. But it's not like that. Meditation means opening yourself to the truth. And sometimes the truth hurts. After I faced my fear, I found myself focusing on my patient in a much clearer, sharper way. Meditation is excellent at removing the obscuring screens of your own personal concerns, and letting you see things the way they really are. What I see now is a young woman who is suffering more than most people can bear, and who would be grateful for any help she could get. If I can just give "}
