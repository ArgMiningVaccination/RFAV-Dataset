Too few eyebrows were raised when a fashionable New Ybrk hostess, Marta Orbach, invited a Mafia killer, Joseph regu,lar Sunday brunches, wnere opeople like David \u00b7steinberg, the comedian, or Neil Sinon, the playwright, made small. talk,...-at least: until Gallo was gunned down on .

A distinction is somatilres drawn between an organized crime. \"enterprise, \" which engages in \u00b7providing illicit goods or services, and an organized crilre \"syndicate,\" which regulates relations between individual \"enterprises\"--allocating territory, settling personal disputes, offering protection .from rival groups and criminal prosecution. Syndicates, too, have been different types. 'lhey have been metropolitan, regional, national, or international in scope, and they have been multi-service or limited to only one field of endeavor--for exaxrple, narcotics. Tradit.ionally, however, most public attention has been focused on one. national, multi-service syndicate. The organization has been called a variety of. . ' 11CIIOOS by its own rrenibers. In Chicago, it is the \"OUtfit.\" In .Buffalo, it is \"The Ann.\" 7 In .New York City, i.t is. Only or Mafip., however, conjure up stereotypes of Italian-American gangsters is unfortunate. As Joseph Valachi, the m:>b info~r, put it, \"I'm, not tglking about Italians, I'm talking about crimirial.s. \"8 Nevertheless, the ethnic 2 character JJ(:' shown, an accident ot history~ criminality is not. un essential character trai\u00b7t of a particular group of .l\\nl2rican citizens C. HoO'ts of Or:ganiz(:.'Cl Crilre The roots pf organized crime run and 'I'he uurly piratc::B first Arrericans to engage in organized criire. The revolutionary period, too, produced its smugglers, mc:my of whom--such as Jolm Hancock--are nCM counted arrong the Founding Fathers. The 19th century also produced a variety of violent gangs: the city !T'DPs of New York and San E'rancisco arising out of ethnic friction, poverty, and the crude politics of the early netroJ:X>lises; the highwaynen nnd slave snatchers of the old West; the river and port pirates, such as Jean Lafitte, a hero of the. War of 1812. The end of the century produced its frontier gangs, who were either nercenaries or parties to the struggle over land, cattle, mining and timber properties. The aftennath of the Civil War also saw a variety of gangs, which,. since they w~re usually held together by the force of a strong personality, dissipatc.->d UJ:X>n the leader's death: the James boys, the Daltons, and the Youngers. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of the great city-wide gang canbinations, usually in alliance :' ' with the nouveaux riches and the nouveaux politiques. The first gangs of the Little Old New York. area were I:r:-ish, and a pseudo-scientific stUdy 111 1881 concluded that the Irish were criminal by nature: . even though they were a minority of the population, they made up a majority . . inmates. u-.::. by the tum of the century in New York, the Jewish gangster had cane into his awn. New York's Police Ccmnissioner, Theodore Bingham, noted that even though Jews make up 3 ) only 25 percent of the population, they conn1itted 50 percent. of the cr:imes.11 'I'hc Prohibition era in New Yorl< saw the rise of Arnold Rothstein, vJho was imnortalizec1 by 1?. Scott Fitzgerald as the Great Cc:1tsby, and who J:ixcd---so they say--:the 191~ World Series. 12 But, by the middle of the 1930s, the Italians in many areas of the nation, especially :Ln the Northcas\u00b7t und Midwest, had gained sorre semblance of dominance, 13 although rarely a nonopoly of organized crine activities. D. National 1\\wakening 1. The 1950 Conference rrhe beginning of a nr-.f- rmal effort to understand and combat organized crime may be best14 dated from the Conference on Organized Crime that was called by Attorney General J. HO\\Vard McGrath at \u00b7the urging of the U. S. Conference of Mayors, the Atrerican Municipal Association, the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers, and the National Association of Attorneys ~nera1.15 The conference was part of the annual meeting of United States Attorneys. Law enforcerrent officials from all over the nation net in Washington on Febnmry 15, 1950 to consider the growing nationwide scope of organized crime, particularly in professional gambling. New Orleans' liberal mayor, De Lesseps S. Morrison, spoke for the majority: ~~e do not have the whole picture--but each of us present--and hundreds of other ( s) . [has] seen a small segnEnt of this national scene of organized .. crime. These pieces fit -~--\u00b7--together 1.n organizcd .. whose wealth, power, scope of operations, and influen'?e hay5 recently grown to .. alanning proport1.ons. 4 He went on to. comment s~cifically on the casino and slot machine gc:unbling operations of Frank Costello, Phil Kastel, \u00b7and Carlos \u00b7Marcello in J\u00b7efferson Parish, La., and the takeover of a nationwide wire f:lervice that supplied horse-race results to bool<makers, by the \"old Capone gang.\" 17 Morrison 1 s viE.>w of the nationwide cha~acter of organized crime was echoed by Wilj_ Wilson, the dis\u00b7trict:. attorney from Dallas, Texas, who cited as evidence slot machines and punchboards that had care t:o his city from Chicago. Wilson added that the syndicate 1 s control over gambling in his area .was maintained \"by dealing in killing, killing of the most reckless kind.\"~8 He told df the effort to kill a policeil'lqil by wiring a bomb to his car, which killed the policeman 1 s wife instead. Later, the policenan himself was wounded, but not killed, as he left his hare. ..The gang finally finished the job by shooting him through a hospital window. 'l'he majority view at the conference, however, was not universally shared. Au. s. Attorney from. Chicago, otto Kerner, dissented. \"There was 1\" Kerner said, \"no organized gambling in the city of Chicago \" He then told the Conference that he did \"not know that the Capone syndicate exist[ed]. I have read about it in the newspapers. I have never received any evidence of it. n19 \\The Mayor of Los Angeles, Fletcher Brown, took issue with Kerner. He said he would like to say that his city was. \"lily-white, but it [was] not. \"20 He agreed with the majority. \"This is no fiction aDout organized cr.i:me--it is a reality, and :i::L extetn:ls fJ;:au one elid of the 21 nation to the other.\" 2. Results Of t ':p , or=\" Conference The 1950 conference was an irop::>rtant step in the developrrent of a national awareness of organized cr.:irre, and a nurriber of its participants 5 '\u00b7\u00b7 J. subsequently made significant. contributions in the effort to conlba\u00b7t it. When Price Daniel, at.torney yener.al of Texas in 1950, for example, becnrne United StatE!S Senator from Texas, his efforts led in 1956 to tough, narcotic laws, which were to result in the convictiol1s of several 22 syndicate leaders. \u00b7 Otto Kerner, on the other hand, though he went on to becon~ Governor of Illinois in' 1.960 nnd a United StateH Circuit Court Judge in 1960, was convicted on February 19, 1973 of accepting $150,000 \u00b7 ibe \u00b7 11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b711\u00b7 \u00b7 Keogh, the u. s. Attorney fran Brooklyn and later a New York Supreme Court J'ustice, was convicted in 1962 with .Anthony Corallo, a. New YorK underworld :figure, of improperly attempti,ng to influence a bankruptcy pe\u00b7tition. 24 l!.'ugene Keogh, Vincent's brother, had been a close friend of President I<ennedy and one of the \"five people who were nost helpful,\" according to Robert F. Kennedy, \"to the President in the [1960] election.\"25 The Attorney General's Conference considered a number of recomrendations, the nost important of which was for a Senate investigation of organized cr:i.Ire, though it was blocked by Attorney \u00b7 General McGrath. Nevertheless, a resolution authorizing a Select $enate Committee for that very purpose which was then pending in tl1e Sena~ under tl1e sponsorship of Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, was E. ~e auver InvestigatiOn 1. Background 1948 was a good year for the nation and the Denocrats, the party in power. 27 The Marshall Plan in Europe was widely applauded; there was prosperity at harre; and Harry Trum::lrl had just accomplished what no one thought he could: a cane-:-from,;..behind election victory. , But less than a 6 ., . year after the election, it all changed. China fell to the Connltu~i s1-s: the economy took a nosc..'<live; and the integrity of the Trunan Administration was undermined by the \"influence peddler\" scandals. In 1950, Congress was in a restless mood, and DeLesseps Morrison, the New Orleans Mayor and president of the Arrerican Nunicipal.Association, took advanta<Je of it by pressing :for of orgcmized crilre, as he. had presr;ed the At.tbr.ney General for a crime conference in 1950. Concen1ed by what he had .1earned from a 1948 study by a cri.Ire ccmnission appointed by California Gov~rn.or Earl Warren and having talked at length ' . 28 about organized cri.Ile. \\'lith newspaper reporters., Senator Kefauver introduced Senate Re~olution 202 on January 5, 1950. It called for a swecpii1g examination of organized cri.Ire in the United Sta-tes. Swift passage of the resolution, hoWever, was not asSUred. Delrocrats feared tha\u00b7t too much light would be shed on alliances between gangsters and the big-city political machines that their party daninated; Republicans feared a .whitewash. \"As I .look back on the struggle to get the coomittee,\" Senator Kefauver later observed, 29 \"I saneti.Ires wonder that we were ever able to bring it into existence.\" In fact, it took a tiebreaking vote by Vice-President Alben Barkley to bring the Senate Special Conmittee to Investigate Organized Cri.Ire in Interstate 30 J.nto exJ.s ence. Senator KE?fauver was 46 in 1950., born of a socially prcminent Tennessee family. He bad served in the .House of RepLesentives \u00b7since 1938 and had. just teen eleeted to his first tenn in the Senate. He was known in the House as one of the brightest and rrost effective of 1 . .ht:: Sout.hern liberal bloc, sarething of a political maverick. His selection of the corrmi ttee' s staff, too, broke traditional practices. He woulp, he said, \"like to see all personnel chosen without regard to patronage 7 J u.r }:X)lit.:.ics.\"J.I \"Ccmpet.ence rather than, influence,\" he yardstick for choosing the s:t:aff.\" F'ortunately, he got hiB way, cmd Hudolph Halley, who had distinguished himself on the well-n:>gurded 'l'numn and Mead comnittees tha\u00b7t had looked into war contract abuses, was chosen as Chief Counsel; Hqrold Robinson; who had . served not only with the Trum:m corrmit\u00b7tee, but alos on War:r.en' s California crime Cornnission, was na:rced chief investigator. Kefauver was well-served, for both were m:m of. ability and integrity. 33 Kefauver had . . . th V1s1on or \u00b7 . e c;:amu tee His concern was not with cr.ine in general, but. organized crin-e, and. he wm1ted answers to. cert..:l i.n basic ques\u00b7tions: Did a l.i~~-L'-.1Wide crime syndicate exist? If so, .where did its sources of power lie? To what degree had it purchased the cooperation of local c;J\"OVernm:mts? Kefauver was permitted to rove ahead in his independent fashion, according to .Theodore .Wilson, the historian, \"not because he was trusteo, but because few people in either party believed that his investigation would receive much attention.\"35 They could not have been nore wrong. The nation paid careful attention to the work of the freshman Senator from Tennessee, m1d he almost became President.\u00b7 2. Scope of Investigation. The Kefauver committee in conducting the first nationwide investigation into organized crilre '\u00b7 held hearings fran ~y 10, 1950 ' until LV.Iay 1, 1951. \u00b7 Kefauver himself traveleci. 52, 380 miles and presided over 92 days of hearings. 36 In all, the ccmnittee heard more than 800 witnesses in Miami, Kansas City, St. wuis, Philadelphia,' Chicago, 'l'ampa, Cleveland, Detroit, New Orle~s, Las Vegas, San . .Francisco, IDs Angeles, Saratoga, and New York City. 37 The New York hearings were televised live. and seen by an est.Unated 30-lnillion people. 38 On the eve 8 .~\u00b7.\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 of the opening day of t~e probe, Attorney General McGrath said .that the ~Justice Department had l1v t..,..:.-S\\lasive evidence that a \"national cri.rre d. t II . . d 39 K f. ld 1 th t syn 1.ca was professional gambling, particularly casino gambling, which was found to be operating wide-open th:r:oughout the count.ry; . DcXJkmaking was <::.'qually illegal slot. m:\"lchines and punch boards. Professional\u00b7 gambling was found py the Kefauver connd t.tee to be \"tl;le principal rackete~ring and gangsterism. n49 The Kefauver cdrmitte!e made only a cursory examination of the narcotics traffic (it found it to be a ,, ' \" ' ,,1,\u00b7 ,' ' ' \"highly organized cr.:i.rne\"41) but its pibneer o\u00a3 the infiltration of lc'git.innte It found that the \"unscrupulous . . and unethical business practices; extortion, banking, and other forins of violence\"42 were being used by rackete~rs in legitimate enterprises, and it found \"evideru.....e of hoodltml infiltration in approximately 50 areas of business,\" ranging from\u00b7 A to . three separate occasions, amassing a record of 1,416 printed pages of hearing transcript, the rrost .. 44 for any single c1. ty ~ Quite contrary to otto Kerner's view of Cbicago, the conmittee found that the rackets were thriving. Senator Kefauver wrote \u00b7in his book, Crime in. Arrerica: If we .ha\u00a3:1 qone no farther than Chicago in our quest for evidence of the link betweeri organized cririe and politics,. we could camli.ttee found no casinos in operation in Chicago proper, but ' ', ' just outside the city linri.ts, particill.prly in Cicero where there was a 9 tradition of corruption,. the ccmnittee found murerous plush gambling houses. 46 Policy play, however, was widespread within the city itself, especially in the densely populated South Side \u00b7 The comnit\u00b7tee est.imated the policy play in the precedingfive years at $150,000,000, a sum in light of Kerner's declaration that there was no organ\u00b1zed gambling in. Chicago. ,Chicago was .ulBo found to be the sourceof the slot muchines and p\\mch boards used t}1roughout the United States~ and the base of the racing news service t:hclt was. essential for offtrack bet.ting by -' ' ' bookmakers. 47 Most distilrbihg .to\u00b7 the canmittee,. however, was the open and bipartisan alliance that existed in Chicago between crime af1cl \u00b7 politics. Roland Libonat1., ct Denocratic state senator, and J'ames J. Adducci r a Hepublican state senator, both from the West Side, were identified as leaders of a bloc of legislators that associatcu witl1 racketeers and fought to defeat reform legislation.48 As the contnittee's final report quoted John Roselli, a Chicago hoodlum at the tirre: [T]he wire service, the handbooks, the slot m:tchines, and the other rackets which have thrived in the. city.of Chicago cannot operate without local eorruption; if the hand books are open, the c.on.clusion is ~9capable that the police are being paid off. The Kefauver cornni ttee traced the rise of pJWer in Chicago of \u00b7 Alphonse. Capone from an obscure, scar-faced, 23-year:;..old bodyguard of Johnny Torrio, his mentor, .in 1924, to. the absolute master of Chicago crime by 1929--brothel keeper, bootlegger and gambler. 50 As the comnittee noted, however, Capone was convicted in 1931 for tax evasion, and his reign ended, although he left behind an organization that would be run by the men around him: Jake \"Greasy '!'hunt>\" Anthony Accardo, Murray Humphries 10. I and the l\"i.Bch.et\u00b7ti brothers, Charles and H.oco, Capone's 4 l\\l Capone As described in' l''rancis X. Busch1's Enemies of the State, 52 a raid was conduc-ted on 'lhe Strip, ~\u00b7Cicero gambling ho~se, following the brutal rmrrder, apparently by Ca;pone e ra1 1\u00b7 se directed, but what. it uricovered le;.-cl tb' Capone' s downfall at tl1e hands of the U.S. goverrunent. In .March 1929, a \u00b79Toup of citizens met with Presid~nt. Hoover and ' . 54 . told him that Capone r1,1led Chicago. Hoover then directed that all Federal agencies concentrate on Capone. A ~pronged strategy was developed. Frank J\u00b7. Wils~n headed up a special unit of the Internal Revenue Service that directed its \u00b7 attention to capone' s tax returns\u00b7. 55 Eliot\u00b7. Ness was in charge of a special unit of the Prohibition Bureau, Which was interested. in Capone's bee~ empire. 56 Of the two, Ness' s job was the nore dangerous. Only wiretaping Cap:>ne' s headquarters enabled \u00b7\u00b7 Ness to steer clear of Capone':s gumnen. As a result of the raid on The Strip, a dus\u00b7ty cashbook was found frq:n which it was possible, through a bank deposit slip, to identify I.Du Schunway, a Capone bookkeeper. Further bank record examinations led to Fred .Reis, another Capone employE..>e. Both n-e11 eventually were persuaded to cooperate with the goverrnrent. SchutrWay was hidden in Califbrnia until the trial and. Re1s was sent to South America. Based on thel:r testimJny, capone was charged with failing to .file incare tax returns in 1924, 1928, and 1929 and with tz1x evasion for the years 1925 thrcl,gl' 1929. He was also indicted separately for a violation of the Prohibition law, though never tr.i~d because of the,con:viction and 11 j sentence on.the tax charges. 'l'he goverrurent's tax case largely consisted of proof of r;pecific items of incon\\E-~ not reported and of Capone's lavish life style. 'l'he defense t.hat would not have beeJ1 brought but for \u00b7the .narre of the defendant. United States Attorney George E. Q. Johnson responded to.Fink's charge: They say we prosecute because of .the name Consider the thou.sands Of little rren and women who earn only a lit.tle rrore than $1,500 a year and pay their taxes. Is it public clarror to cfumand taXes due in tirre of national financial sttess.andtreasq;ry deficit from a man who buys two hnndred and fifty dollar d\u00b1axrond belt buckl.es. and twenty-seven dollar shirts? Ther:e io i.v\u00b7 the public interest, but I am not {:lsking yo\\l to think of this Future generations\u00b7. of the narre Alphonse Capone, but bepause it will establish whether or not a nan can go so far be~9nd the law as to .be able to escape the law. . Johnson's conment about' the public awareness of future generations did not prove accurate, but his arguxrent was persuasive. On Oc~r 17, 1931, 11 days after the. trial opened, the case was sUbmitted to the jury, which deliberated for eight hours, apparently with discriminatim1 for Capone was found not guilty of failure to file a taX return in. 1924, and guilty of only five of the renaining counts. against him. On October 24, Capone was sentenced to two consecutive five-\u00b7year tenns and fined a. total of $50,000. After two years in the Federal\u00b7 peniterrtiary \u00b7 in Atlanta, he .was .transferred to Alcatraz m San F'rancJ.sCo, where lie remained until 1939. \u00b7 Upon his release lie was .a desperately sick man, suffering from unmistakable si9ns of paresis, the deterioration of mind .and bcrly stemning from untreated syphilis. While .. the t.ax. conviction ended ~pone's lawless career, his not being tried for other crimes deprived the public of a full appreciation 12 ,, .. :, of the t:ruc~ charucter of. the man. Capone was born on January 17, 1899 in B.rookl yn, N. Y . , ot il. .. .:. J-1t pnrcnts, who had come fronl Naples in 1883. 58\u00b7 lie died in 1947. One of his nost infrurous acts was the St. Valentine 1 s Day Massacre in 1929, in which seven I~n were nachine-gunned. Only one, Frank Gusenberg, lived long. enough to. tell about it, but when asked who .shot him, Gusenberg replied, \"Nobody shot r.\u00b7g rre. I a in 1 t no copper \":> Capone was .also the personal author of an unrecorded number of murders, including the bludgeoning with abaseball bat of three enemies at.~ dinner in their hon6r.60 They were Guiseppe Giunt.a '. Albert Anselmi, and John Scalise, three officers of the Unione Sit:iliana, a legitimate fraternal org~zation founded in 1895, which by 1928 had been largely taken over and ~de a frotlt for the 1-'Jafia. 61 ' No witnesses, hOYlever, were ever found to testify against Capone in a murder trial. Until the Federal government stepped in with its tax case, he was above the law. 5. FollOYling the Investigation According to the Kefauver conmittee, 62 Capone's power passed first \u00b7to l?rank Nitti, who .ccmnitted suicide in 1943 while under indictment in a highly publicized :m:>tion. picture industry extortion proseCU:tion; next tp. Felice DeLucia; and then to Anthony Accarcjo, an old capone bodyguard ho nay have bE:.-.en one of the planners of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. 63 'l'he faces changed, but the nature of the syndicllte did not. Its response to the Kefauver hearings was\u00b7typical, as .evidenced by the murder of \u00b7two :i.n'portant witnesses before they. could testify: Hilliam Drury, a fonner police captain, and Marvin J. Bas, an attorney. Kefauver can:nented on the . ev .L.dence developed irl Chicago: \u00b7 [O]rganized crime .and political corruption go hand in hand There [can] be no big-time 13 organized crirre without. a firm and profitable alliance be\u00b7tween those who run ~~e rackets .:md . those in poli t.ical control. . 'J'he people drew similar conclusions, and they acted up:m them in an election that happened to be held right after one of the Kefauver: corrmittee' s trips to Chicago. There had been a:n. atteinpt by the comnittee to paint d balanct.\"Cl pic\u00b7ture of corruption in both parties, but the people did\u00b7 not see it quite so even-handedly, and mlirerous Denocratic: office holders were defeated on November 7, 1950, including Majority Leader of the .u. S. Senate Scott Lucas, who attributed his undoing by Everett M. Dirksen to Kefauver's hearings.65 \u00b7 6. New Orleans The Kefauver cannuttee visited De Lesseps Morrison's New Orleans. As in Chicago, there were no casinos within the city, but just over the Orleans Parish line--in Jefferson and St. Bernard Parishes--there were a number of plush houses. The Kefauver conmittee America's \"66 the rmst elaborate, featuring \"expensive night club entertainment,\" was the Beverly Club, which was owned by Phil Kastel, Frank Costello and Jake Lansky, all of New York, and carlos Marcello, who the Kefauver Comnittee identified as the local Mafia leader. The slot machine racket had beE:m. imported in the mid-1930s into New Orleans by Costello, who made a deal with Huey P. Long, then a u.s. Senator, after Costello had ~n threatened with banishment from\u00b7 New York City by Mayor-elect Fiorello Ia Guardia. After. Morrison was elected Mayor in 1946, the Costello operation was noved to the neighboring parishes, but illegal pinball nachines stil,l flourished in the city, 67 apparently with the aid of corruption. The Kefauver conmittee found an alliance between gangsters and corrupt \"sheriffs, marshalls and other law enforcement officials. 68 \u00b7 15 7 . Car los t-larce llo rrhe Kefauver carrnittee prepared a profile of the man it identifkxl as the organized crima leader in New Orleans.69 Carlos Marcello was born l?ebruary 6, 1910 in rr'unisia, of Sicilian parents, who .immigrated to New Orleans. later that year.70 His real nane was Calegero Minacore, which was subsequently changed to ~arcella and later masculinized to 11 71 Marce o. Ma.I\u00b7cello was, the Comnittee found, active in all phases of. the racket.s in the New Orleans area. He. operated casinos, horse betting and 1 h. h ' . 1. d. . the . ff. 72 parlors s ot mac mes; e was mvo ve m . narcot~cs tra -~c. In addition, Marcello had invested heavily in legitinate businesses, including bars, restaurants, inns and food processing concerns, particularly seafood. and other frozen foods.73 Marcello's na-tionwide criminal contacts included Costello in New York, Joseph Civello in Dallas, San1 Yaras li1 Chicago Los Angeles.74 . . . Marcello's New. Orleans was also found by the Kefauver committee to have 7r:. supplied the weapon ::> for a Mafia murder in Tampa, Fla., where Santos rrraff icante, Sr. had been the 11 reputed Mafia leader for nore than 1176 twenty years. 8. New York As the comnittee traveled from city to city, it seem=d as if \"Kefauver had accomplished his a.im, \" as Theodore Wilson noted, 11 of conducting a fair, non-partisan inquiry, [b:t\u00b7inging] the staggering . 77 dimension \u00b7of 'orgrutized crime befme Oppos~t~on to the probe, h~ver, wao 'J..:-owing, and not only from defeated politicians like Scott Lucas of Illinois. Senator Hay Mc...\"'Carron of Nevada, for example, was outraged at the Kefauver corrmittee's report on the daninance of organized cr.line in Las Vegas. Nevertheless, there was little the opposition could do, and attention soon turned to the 16 comnittce's work in New.York City, where hearings were opened on March 12, 1951. F'or eight. days, America watched spellbound as sorre 40 witnesses narched confident to be sworn in, only to be \"reduced to an jncoherence of belligerent silence,\" as Wilson noted, \"by\u00b7 [Chief Counsel] Halley's devastating questioning and the calm, confident . 78 behavior of Ketauvcr: and his collc~gues.\" Where the earlier hearings had considered general aspec-ts of orgnnized crilre, the New York hearings personalized tbe corrupt alliance between crime and politics by focusing on two rren-'-Frank Costello and William O'Dwyer. 9. Frank Costello Costello was born Francesco Castiglia on January 26, 1918, in Lauropoli, a hill .town in Italy's southernnost province, Calabria. 79 When he was four, he was brought .to .New York by his parents, where they .\u00b7 80' traded a life of rural squalor for an existence of urban poverty. Yet by .the tirre of the Kefauver carmittee' s hearings, Costello was hardly a rran of the slums: his apartm=nt was on the fashionable West Side of New York; his sunmer hone was in Sands Point; and he traveled regularly each year to Florida, New Orleans, and Hot Springs, Ark.81 He presented himself to the Kefauver comni ttee as a legitimate businessman, wi ~ interests in real es_a....-- , oil, and a as friend of politicians, thoul:ln not a politician. The Kefauver carmittee saw him the owner of ~llegal casinos and slot machines; and he was a bookmaker.82 The criminal syndicate he headed included such big-name criminals as Meyer Lansky, Joe Adonis, Willie Moretti, Abner Zwillman, Vito Genovese, and Joseph Profaci, and he was associated with Joseph Lanza, Charles Luciano, and Carlos Marcello, all reputed hoodlums. 83 17 'l'he Kefauver conlld:ttee credited him with the political dominance of 'l'amnany Hall, the New York City political machine in 1942. rl'he evidence on Costello was unusually reliable, since it. had been obtained from wir:et:aps by Manhattan District Attorney Frank Hogan, which, \u00b7the conmittee observed, \"gave a vivid picture of Frank Costello a . followed a much different career. He was a policeman from 1917 to 1924 at which time he left the force to practice J.uw. 85 lie was elected to a judgeship in 1938 and, in 1940, becane district at.torney of Kings County, which gave him jurisdiction over the Uu:rougb o.f Bn.XJld.yn. As Dif;trict At.torney, he conducted an investigation of rrore Umn 20 gangland murders. With the help of one of the hired killers, Abe Heles, who tm\"lled state' s evidence, 0 'Dwyer' s office identified an organization, popularly known as Murder, Inc., which was headed by Albert Anastasia (\u00b7though he was said to report to ,Joe 1\\donis) and sta.ffed by Jewish gunrren. Murder, Inc. was resp:msible for numerous killings in New York and elsewhere, but on November 12, 1941, before an indictment could be returned against Anastasia, Reles plunged to his death from the bedroom of his suite on the sixth floor of Coney Island's Half Mood Hotel, even though he was under the protection of a special squad of six policeman. 86 According to the Kefauver catutitteel however, \u00b7there was \u00b7-t.asia, who continued to maintain a 87 \"stranglehold,\" as the ccrrunittee characterized it, on the Brooklyn \\~terfront through control of a local of the International 1 1 88 Longs1oremen s Assoc1at1on. The Murder, Inc., investigation was, the Kefauver comnittee found, riddled vlith \"glaring deficiencies. rr89 18 Neverthele:'Hs, O'Dwyer was able to ride it t.o political advantage, mlCJ in 1945, he ww:.; elected JVIayor of New York. Yet thC' con[ni\u00b7t\u00b7tee concluded about. 0 'l:>vJYor, who wa~; the Uni.t.ed Ambassador to Mc:ldco at the timu of the hL'.:n~ing::-;: A single pattern of conduct emerges from [his] official act.ivit.ies in regard to the gambling nnd waterfront raclcets, murders, and police c'Orruption, from his\u00b7 days as District: Atton1ey through his term as mayor. No matter what tho not.i vat.ion of his choice, action or inaC\"tion, it often seorrcd to result favorublc \u00b7 for rrcg0 suspected of being high up in the rackets 11. Hace Wire Service 1\\s a case study of the nati<'mwide operations of organized crine, the I<cfauver cornni tt.ee examined the wire service, which provicted J:x:d<nlc\"lkers with up-to-the-minute racing news, an essential ingredient in any betting oper<rtion. As \u00b7the comni ttee noted, the \"\u00a5Tire service (was) as essential to a booknaker as the stock ticker to a t-1 b l -\"91 s _oc < ro em camnittee found that the dauinant corporation in \u00b7the racing news business 1 Continental Press 1 was controlled \u00b7by the old Capone syndicate. The first wire service, Nationwide News Service, was founded in the 1920s by H.L. \"Moe\" i\\rmenberg, whose principal associate was James A. Ragen 1 Sr. In . the \u00b7face of \u00b7a nunopol y investigation and an inqui~\u00b7y into his incane t.c\"lX affairs, however, Annenberg had to dives\u00b7t himself of his interest in 1939.92 Annenberg's legitimate publishing inter~sts would develop into 'l'riangle Pul:.1lications 1 publisher of rv Guide. 'rhe company was transforned into Cont.inental Press Service. By 1946, its managon'Ant having changed nore than once, Continental ended up in Ragen's handi3, but tl1at was when trouble began. Mickey Cc1hen and Joseph Sica, acting on behalf of Ioiles\u00b7t Coast t~lafia leader Jack Dragna, tried to muscle into 19 . ' t \u00b7\u00b7' .t ' ~ .. tho company, and a Chicago finn controlled by Anthony l\\cc~tn1o ulld the Capone syndicate, H&H I?Ublishing, l\\ m~~\" rmtionwide rrans-Ame:dca, .was di::;pJ.<iCC' C<:.ntiner\\tal in a ntmlber of cities, includin9 New Orleans. on June 24, 1946, nagE.m was shotgunned in typical gangland style. 93 He died three rronthr: later of: ncrcury \u00b7 toxin poisoning, even though he was ' . under police gua.rd. l!'our witnesses identified Lenny Patrick, Dave Yaras, and Wi ll:Lam Block as the gunman, 94 but after one witness was ru.rdereq, two others reciiDted, anq another fled,. the. indictn:ent was droppE:..>d. Continental passed into the control o~ the Capone syndicate without further violence. Carlos Marcello was nan:ed its New Orleans distdbutor, and Jack Dragna was awarded a $50,000. \"service contract. n95 Bookies everywhere .had to deal with the national syndicate's front operation--and pay a premium--or go but of business.96 12. Structure of Organized Crin:e Senator Kefauver was particularly interested in the structure of organized cr.irre. His coomittee concluded at the carrpletion of its hearings: The structure of o~ganized crime \u00b7today is far different from what it was many years ago. New types of criminal gangs have emerged during prohibition.... Organized crin:e in the last thirty years has taken on new characteristics. Crin:ri.nal groups today are multi -purpose in character, . engaging in any racket wherever tl)~re is mney to be ma:ae The Mafia . has an important part in binding together into a loose a:-.c::-.. tion the major criminal. gangs and individual hoodl~9 throughout the country. The domination of the Mafia is based fun.c:lanentally. on 'muscle' and 'murder.' . [It] will ruthlessly ~liminate anyow who stands in the way of \u00b7 ~ts success 20 .. rf 13. Accgmpl.i.stm1ents Other than its clear ];X.)rtrayal of of organized cri.ne, the accompl.ishrrents of th~ Kefauver corrmittee were hard to rreasure. With the exception of t.he Johnson Act, 98 which regulated the in'terstate shipment of gambling devices, its legislative pro];X.)sa1s were not received fnvorably until thoy were embodied in the Kennc.>cly . . Administration's legislative program, which was passed by Congress in 1961.99 Sone scholars were even critical of its work. William Moore, in The Kefauver Conrnittee. and .the Politics of Crine,, argued .that Kefauver launched the probe for politic;il gain, and the thesis of a national syndicate was erroneous.100 If there was agreement on anything, \u00b7 it: was generally conceded that the Kefauver\u00b7 cannri. ttee was successful in arousing the consciousness of the public and stirring its sensitivity to organized crime. Nevertheless, the professional ];X.)li ticians--a hostile array of urpan bosses, vengeful congressrren, white Southerners and a resentful outgoing President--denied Kefauver the presidential nanination in 1952 and again in 1956. Kefauver did secure\u00b7the vice-presidential S];X.)t on the Adlai E. Stevenson ticket :in 1956, after a down-to-the-wire roll~call contest with the junior Senator from Ivlassachusetts, John F'. Kennedy. But in 195.6, as in 1952, the November election went to. the Republicans. Senator Kefauver carne close--closer than .nost--,.to being elected President, in large part due to the public iiuage as a c:tbte fighter that his hearings establJ.shed for rum. As it was, organized crime faded from public view until November 14, 1957. F. The Apalachin Meeting 1. The Raid November 14, 1957, was a typical fall day in Apalachin, N.Y., 21 ',,, ,, ,;', ' a small town l3inghamton For son\u00a5:) t:in'C, Sergeant Edga:r D. CroswelJ of the New York State Police had kep\u00b7t his eye on the 130-acre estate of Joseph Barbara, Sr., on McFall Road, a 15-foot-wide dirt road that ran from old Route 17. to Apalachin Creek, beyond Barbara' s \u00b7 $150 , 000 hare. 101 Croswell knew that Barbara, who owned a. local Canucla Dry distributorship, \u00b7had been mixed up in bootlegging, c:tsf:;ocicxtc'<'1 with gc.urdJlcr~, and was suspected of involvcn~nt in several gangland slayings. In 1956, .he had Il'Ct at the Arlington Hotel in Binghamton with a number of known gangsters' including Cru:rnine Galente, John Bonventre and Joseph Bonanno. Barbara, in short, was though\u00b7t to be the \"man behind all of the rackets in Broome County, 11 as Croswell would later testify.102 On November 13, 1957, Croswell and a fellow trooper noticed suspicious out-of-state cars parked at the Parkway Motel in Vestal, . 103 which is near Apalachin. Upon inqUiry, they lea:rned that Joseph Barbara, Jr . had reserved rcx:xns at the rcotel for guests, sene of whan had not registered, even though they were staying there. Croswell alerted the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the U.S. Treasury Depart:Irent that it. might be a meeting like the one in 1956, which was thought to have concerned illicit al~hol, 104 and the following day.; Croswell, his partner, and two Achol and Tabacco Tax agents drove out to the Barbara estate to check it out, arriving there around 12!40 p.m. They drove into a parking area,\u00b7 planning to take the. license numbers\u00b7 of the few parked cars they e'Mected to find. Instead, they found eight :-\"' ten cars in the lot and another 20 to 25 over near a barn. As the officers backed out of the parking area, eight to ten men came from behind the garage. They were, Croswell said, 11 sharply dressed~' in [d] ark clothing,\" like \"men in the rackets wear\"; they looked like 22 I ~ .\u00b7 llh0Qdlums.~~105 'l'hc officers dt~cidecl to set Llp a ched< point on old Route 17 ncar it.s junction with .Mclt'all Road, a point that any car .leaving the estate would .have -l:.o pass to reach the highway. . l?ron1 this vantage point, the officers could see the gat.l}ering begin to breal<..up a.):)0ut 1:20 p.m. A number of men fled into the woods .. 8om2 left by car. 'l'hc ri.rs\u00b7t car to be stopped, with five persons in it, nrrived at the check point at 1:25 p.m. 'l'he driver was RUssell Bufalino of Pittstonr Pa., whan C;roswell recognized as h~ving been arrested. for receiving stolen property. 106 A ' !'' ',, \u00b7. passengE?r was Vi~o Genovese of New Jersey, who, Croswell \"an criminal bc}ckground.11 Croswell asked Genovese: 11\\'lhat are you dolng in this area,? 11 11 I don't think' I have to answer your question, do I?\" Genovese replied. \"No,\" Croswell answered.107 The car was permitted to pas!? on. Between 1:20 and 2:30, a total of .25\u00b7 persons was counted at: the check point, while others were stopped in the woods or along other roads. In all, 59 nen WP.re identified as having been at the . . Darbara residence. Collectively, they had nore than $300,000 cash on . 108 them. l'~rom New Yt>rk City, they included Joseph Bonni:inno, Joseph Magliocco, Carlo Gambino, Carmine lon'lbardozzi, Joseph Profaci and John Bonventre; from Niagar\\:1 Anthony Magaddino; from New Jersey, in . . . addition to C..enovese, Gerardo Catepa, Joseph Ida and Frank Maju1..:.: from california,. Frank DeS.irrone; from. Texas, t:e , J:t Aftermath Because of the police raid of tl)e Apalachin gathering, organized crime was.back in the public eye . Invest.igC1ti~ns were inne<:liately launched to determine the purpose of the meeting ,..._ by the FBI, the 23 t. Internal Revenue Service, th~ Imnigration and Naturalization Service, the Alcohol and 'Ibbacco 'I'ax Division, federal and state grand juries, the New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas police departrrents and legisla,tivc conroittees of both the New York and. Unit.ed States Senates. 'l'he.re were no less than 133 examinations of the Apalachin attendees, including 27 110 instancm; before fc..Xlcral. grand juries and 29 by the FBI. But nost of those questioned, like Genovese, s.:lid nothing. Of those who said anything, nost claimed they WE7re there to visit \"a sick friend.\" rl'hat ,' ' 111 was Russell Bufalino.' s story. . \u00b7 DeSin'one, however, said he had cane East to see an eye doctor ,and that Bl,lfalino had invited him and Civello, \u00b7 ,', ' ,' ' his cousin, to a party.112 Civello, on. the other; hand, told Dallas Chief of Police Carl F. Hanson that \"Russ,\" a man he did riot know but had met in New York City, had invited him to a barbecue and a. crap garre~ 113\u00b7 Not one of them would admH:. it was anything more than a char1ce meeting ---pure coincidence that so many of them had got together at one t.i.Jre. The goverrnrent, of course, di\u00a21 not believe it was a chance event for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the order Joseph Barbara, Sr., had placed on November 5, 1957, with Armour and Company .of Binghamton for 207 pounds of steak, 20 pound,s. of V:!=al cutlets and 15 114 pounds of luncheon neats. A federal grand jury indicted 27 of the attendees for conspiracy to obstruct justice and perjury. After an eight-week trial; the jury agreed, and on January 13, 1960, a Verdict of guilty was entered by the Honorable Irving R. Kaufman,\u00b7 United States District Judge for Manhattan.115 Among the 84 witnesses .who testified at the trial, one was the fo:r:rrer Chief Counsel of a Un.:ited Sta.tes Senate comnittee that had conducted its own investigation of the meeting, Robert F. , 24 I I .. t. ll( I<C'nJ IE.'<Jy. \u00b7 > Profaci had . sought., as part. of his de fens<~, to show tl1.::rt: lx~ did not. speak EngliBh well.

Profaci had told him, Kennedy said, that a \"partner\" of his who had \"recently d;ied\" had been a friend of Barbara, and. he was wondering\u00b7 \"how Barbara was feeling,\" so he paid him a visit~ 118 'I'he jury's verdict was not, however, upheld on appeal. 'l'he . .evidence of <;:onspiracy, the Second Circuit held, was being\u00b7 members of t.he .Mafia,\" the court observed that: it was \"surely a matter of public concern that nore [was] not. known of the purposes of the meeting,\" but its judgrrent had to rest on the evidence, and it was lacking, \"if not on .the question of falsity itself, at least on the . 119 question of agreement to tell false s-ton.es. Judge Charles Clark concurred, adding that \"the most curious feature11 of the case was \"that after all these years there [was] .. not a shred of legal evid~nce tha\u00b7t the Apala~hin qathcring was illegc:tl or even improper either in 120 purpose or fact. \" - '!'he court's judgment epitomized an at.titude that was. a source of\u00b7great frustration .for law enforcercent.

The !11cClellan Investigation l 'l'he 'l'eamstcrs In November and December 1956, Robert Kennedy made a trip to the West Ccx\":lst, visit.ing IDs Angeles, ~ortlc.md and Seattle.122 He stor.)ped in Chicago on December 20, on the way back to Washington. Ke:hn~y .had been taking cl preliminary look at lal)()r racketeering and in Chicago, he re.acheu a critical conclusion: 123 . Dave Beck was a crook. 'rhe irnplications of that. conclusion wen~ disturbing, for Dave Deck was the president of one of .the nat..ion's largest unions, the Inten1(ltional Brotherhood of 'l'eamsters. If Kennedy' s conclusion was correct, tnere was justification for a full Senate investigation, but which conmittee should undertake it? After much discussion, the decision Wl\\s .made to create a select camtit.tee, with McClellan as chairman. The rrembership included Senator Kennedy of Massachust=~tts. \"Bobby wanted rre on that conmi ttee, II Kennedy said l.a\"CE'~r, II in order to keep it . rrore balanced. 111~4 Otherwise, it woiuld have too anti-labor.

During the finrt year, the rrtaff tnweled 650,000 miles, interviewing 16,000 witnesses in 44 oi th(! 48 st.ates. 'l'he corrmitb~e held 104 days of hearingfj involving . . 125 486 w1tncsscs.

Beck was convicted in stat~ cour.t and imprisoned for larceny in 1957, and he was found guilt~y of \u00b7tax evasion in federal court in 1959.128 As a lX>Vler in the labor movement, Beck was finished, although he went free in f<'li1y 1975, l:?.Y h<:.tving obt.:linec] a full pardon from President Gerald H. Forc1.130 Beck's downfall, however, proved to be the occasion for the 1:ise to the presidency of the union of another labor leader, whose ties to organized cr:i.Ire were even tighter--James Riddle Hoffa. 2. ,J.irrmy Hoffa: Background Born on February 14, 1913, in Brazil, Indiana, Hoffa lost his f h . l . h h 131 -at er, a coa nuner, w en e was seven. His nother had to go to work to support him and his two sisters. In 1924, she rroved to Detroit, c r' eventually ending up on an auto assembly line. Hoffa quit sch(X)l ~t 14 and went \u00b7to work as a stock boy in Frank & Cedar Dry Goods and General Merchandise. In 193:.. , ~: ... _.... , then working on the. loading p1atforrn at the Kroger Fcod COmpany, started a work stoppage and . founded a union, Lccal 19341, which was affiliat-E.>d with the Arrerican Federation of I..abor. In 1935, th8 local was illJsorbed into tile ~reamsters, and in 1936, it was merged into Local 299, which was to be Hoffa's hom= base for more than 45 years. 28 lloff.:1' s p.ssocic:>.t.~on ~.,;' h racketeers bcqan org.:.tniz:er, rn~t ~md changed his narne to Frank O'Brien, Pigano's son took the narre of her afi'air with Frank Coptx)la, her son'~; 9odfather.

He was dep::>rted to Italy ori. ,January 9, 1948. it was through Pigano that Hoffa Perrone a11d JVM:.~.li made the first 'i'eamsters city-wide strike, in April 1937, . 134 successful, for he was able to get the rrob to stay neutral. It also was t..he beginning of an alliance that contributed mightily to Hoffa lx-x:oming the 'l'eamsters' president in September 195 7.

The Apalachin Meeting Following the. rneeting of Wlderworld leaders at Apalachin on November 14, 1957, the McClellan comnittee turned its attention to organized crime--its strt1cture and menibership. In June and July 1958, there were. hearings on th!= background of the Apalachin attendees, which was surrrnarized in the commi\u00b7ttee' s :t:.;i.nal report. Of the 59 ~n who had ', ' been identified c:ts in attendcmce, 50 had arrest records, 35 had convictions and 23 had spent t::.ime in jail or prison.156 The commit-tc:~e broke the StatistiCf' dOWP -Further: 18 of the men had either been arrested or quest.ioned in connec't:.ion with murder investigations; 15 had been arres-ted or convicted for narco-tics; 30 had been arrest..c\"Cl or convicted for gambling; and 23 had beei1 arrested or convicted for t.he illegal use of firem-rns.

This group has made fortunes in the illegal liquor traffic during prohibition, and later in narcotics, vice and garrbling. These illicit. profits [are . A measure o~ the wealth that tl1e syndicate members and their associates had amassed was later described by Kennedy in t~rms of the life style of Mickey Cohen, thE.~ west coast rrobster: our investigat.ion and hearings shoW[ed] that Nic~ey Cohen spent $275 for his silk loungin9 pajamas, $25,000 f.or a specially built btillet\u00ad proof car and at one tim::~ had 300 different suits, 1,s~g9pairs of socks ahd 60 pairs of $60 shoes. \u00b7 \u00b7 He .could have added l:iornetniug about their power.

Kennedy for the t-lcClellan ccimri.ttee was probably the JIDst extensive ever conducted by Congress.164 In some three years, 270 days of hearings were beld., 1 ,526 witnesses were ~xamined and a staggering 46,150 pages of tes.timony filled 59 volurres of transcript. One. witness in five told the cornnittee that a truthful answer to a all, 2.5 million miles vvere travelled and 8,000 subpoenas were issued. In the end, officials of 15 unions and over 50 corrpa,nies were shown to have been involved in illicit practices,166 often under the domination of organized crime. The investigation amassed an impressive set. of facts, and it left Robert Kennedywith an abiding conviction: \"If we do not on a national sea> attack .organized criminals with wea:Pons and techriJ.quer; aB effective The Atton1ey General On January 20, 1961, a,t noon, John Fitzgerald I<ennedy \\vas sworn in ~\u00b7.\u00b7\u00b7 by Chief JusU.cx~ garJ viJnrren as the 35th President. of the It was a briqht, cJ.car, bl..ln .. _y' but cold day, all the briqhtor nnd colder for the new snow that had fallen the night before and st.ill remained on tllc <Jruund.

Yet Eisenhower had served eight years; Kennedy would be President. but a.\u00b7\u00b7 thousand days. 1\\s. President-elect, l<ermody had talked with his brother at their home in Hymmisport, Mass. \u00b7. Was he interested in becoming Attorney General? Robert Kennedy said \"No.\" He \"had,\" he said, \"been chasing bad :rren for three years, and. [he) didn't :Want to spend the rest of [his) .. life doing t:hat.\"168 In the .end, the President told him he needed him. The younger br:other. had no .. Choice. 2. Priori ties Hobert F. Kermedy had a number of priori ties <:).S Attorney General. He was concerned. cibout poverty in the adnUnistration .of justice; }1e was concerncc'l about civil rights p;rograms; but, most of all, he was concerned about organized crime; and it was a concern that begot action. In his .. first inLeJ.view as At:L--orney 6enernl, Kero-.edy tha\u00b7t organize~!. crime was his number-one IJriorit::.y. 169 At his first p~\u00b7ess conference, he annmmced that. };_is organized cr~ drive had President's needed support . l}O \"Don't tell mE! what I can't do, \" 35 :.',, evcr\u00b7\u00b7nC(Jat:i.VE?

Robert Kennedy can~ in and said, 'Don't define it, do something about it.'\"172 Nevertheless, the obstacles to tlo:i.11g sonlQthi.ng about. org<.mizcd crine wer:e fonnidable. As late as J\u00b7anuary 1962, ,J. Edgar Hoover, the Director of the FBI, was on record as saying, \"No single individual or coalition of racket~el-\u00b7s years, that F'rank, Cpst.ello, whom Hoover knew, cqnvinced hinl that there was no .national organization involved in organized crirce; d . d ' }'[ d. d . 1 h' h. d 17 an , J.s mn As both rren are dead, the truth of these stories canno-t be detennined.

Targets were selected for concentrated attention: the list started out at 40, including rvtj..ckey Cohen and J'olm Hoselli on the .west Coast; and nurrerous Apalachin attendees from the Northeast.178 By 1964, the list had grown to 2,300 top nob figtires and their associates, .a.nd the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section also had 175,000 cards in its master file of information an k . - . . 179 rae cteers and assoc1ates . Kennedy' s way of using the Internal Revenue Service in the Treasury Departrrent was a good illustrat.ipn of the impact of his personality on the government--in his own right and as the Preside:nt' s brother. Mortilrer Caplan, who had taught Robert Kennedy at the University of Virginia Law Sch(X)l, was appointed Coillllissioner of Internal Revenue, but first Kennedy made sure that Caplan supported vigorous tax enforcement against the mob.18\u00b0 Kennedy knew that he would be \"criticized on .the .. grounds that tax laws are there. to raise money for the government pnd should not be used to punish th~ underW-orld.\"181 Ramsey Clark, the Assistant Attorney General for the Lands Division, later naned Attorney Gene1al t>y P1ebident JolniSOII applied. \"tax criteria,\" it not \"okay to select organized crirre cases . \"182 But that was precisely Kennedy's :point. Should nob figures, because they were nob figures, be free to evade taxes? Kennedy believed that the arguments against bringing rrob prosecutions. in the tax area \"were specious. \"183 MorE?Over, Kennedy could I ., ... . ..

Kennedy did IIDre tl1an make speeches, giving the program personal . . attention. Regional Directors of the IRS who did not support the program were trru1sferred.186 The program paid off in concrete results. IRS man-days of participation in organized crime investigations rose . ' .\u00b7 187 tram 8,836 in 1960 to 96,182 in 196~. In 1967, the President's Corrunissiori on Law Enforcerrent and the Administration of J'ustice found that 60 percent of all organized crime prosecutions brought between 1961 and 1965 turned out to have originated irt tax investigations.188 4. Public Attention: McClellan Hearings In addition to developing legislation .and bringin~ civil actions, Kermedy sought to focus public attention on organized crime. He spoke widely and freely gave interviews. He also worked closely with Senator McClellan in presenting a cqrprehensive set of hearings, beginning on September 25, 1963, on the nationwide structure of the Mafia or La Cosa Nostra, as it was known by its members. The hearings would feature the . testimony of Joseph Valachi, the first rrember of La Cosa Nostra ever to testify publicly about the nature of the organization. Senator .r.1cClellan opened with a sta~nt, in which he observed; 38 ,,, ', \\,t I ~\u00b7\u00b7 'l'odp.y, we begin a new series of hearings [j.nto organized or synidcatecl cr:i.Ire] .

In\u00b7 addition, Mickey Cohen, a West Coast underworld figure, though not a rrenlber of La Cosa Nostra, was convicted of tax evasion. For the first time on a sustained, canprehensive basis, the syndicate was feeling the pressure, not just the public exposure of a Congressional investigation, but prosecution for serious crime. Robert M. Morgenthau, the United .States Attorney for 1'1anhattan, who was later elected district attorney, told of the impact of the Kennedy organized crime program: It really waE;n 1 t until Robert . F. Kennedy beccnre. Attorney General that an organized program was developed '. It 1 s kind of like a gOod. football team.

The McClellan conmittee filed a three-part final report on March 4, 1965, which .set out its basic findings about the national syndicate, in pa,rticular what the corrmittee had learned from the test.inony of Joseph Valachi. 199 The Annual Report of the Attorney General, submitted by Kennedy for 1963, had terrred Valachi' s testimOny a. \"significant\" intelligence ' . \"breakthrough,\" which enabled the the\u00b7 \"Cosa n200 agreed that Valachi.' s test:i.nony was .trust,Wb:~thy, and it, too, credited his .description of the Oharaeter of the organization of :the. underworld. Nevertheless, not all writers then or later agreed either with the Pepartmantof JUstice or the McClellan corrmittee evallla.tion of ValaQhi 's testinony. Ralph de Toledano201 reflected the late Director' s skepticism tc:>ward Valachi, noting that the 42 t .\u00b7 FBI had \"long known\" of the organization and that not a single . 20:2 conviction had been based on Valachi' s t.estllTIOny. Arthur Schlesinger apparently reflected his own feelings in 1965 when he observed that \"[c] riminologists .. were skeptical of the sanction the Departncnt [of. J'ustice] gave tO the notion of a centrally organized and all-pervasive Maf,. ..203 J..a Schlef>inger' B own J~c~lings were I1ade explici\u00b7t in 1978, when he observed that he found the skeptics' position \"more persuasive.\"204 The judgnent of knowledgeable professionals outside the . . .goverrnrent, however, was aptly expressed in 1969 by Ralph Salerno, a highly respected authorityon orgai1ized crilre. The Valachi confessions are railked next to Apalachin as the greatest single [intelligence] blow ever d.elivered to organized crime in the United States.

[Valachi] drew a schematic \u00b7 \u00b7 picture of the organization, described it and told hOW' it worked. The :t;XJlice, for example, had long realiz.ed that certain undeiWorld figures were often seen with each other, but. they did not.realize that these were. formal, \u00b7 not casual, associations, relationships of rank in a system governed by rules and regulations. The pattern that Valachi furnished made it possible for police\u00b7 intelligence rren to begin to see the dimensions. of syndicated crime and stop205 looking at ~t as a series of unconnected casas. valachi had agreed t6 testify against other \u00b7Jtember s \u00b7of mganized crime only after Genovese had marked him for death, thinking he was art informer.

J\"irnny . of the Teamster' s Union was also a subject of. concerted. interest for the McClellan\u00b7\u00b7 conmittee when .. Robert F. Kennedy ~vas resigned. When Kennedy becane Attorney General, Hoffa was high on the . agenda of the Departncnt of Just:icq 1 s efforts against corruption .i.~ -tl-le labor IIDVeitent. In 1958, Attorney General William Roberts had set \\lP a Special Group on Organized Crime, headed by Milton Wessel, tolook into the Apalachin ~et,ing. Attorney Ge~eral Kennedy fbllc:Med up by assigning a special grout? in the Labor Rights u~.it .of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section ~o tl'le Teamsters \u00b7 Union. Head~ b\u00a5 'wal~r fo:aoor McClellan comnittee, the speci.al group was cha:rged by the Attorney General \"to take a fresh look at the findings of the McClellan ccmnittee and to probe generally into the field of racketeering, particularly into the activities of Hotfa and the Teamsters. n206 The gro\\lp cane to be known as the \"Get Hoffa Sqi.lad.\" \u00b7 f ' ' ,' ,, Hoffa himself charged qn November 15, 1961 that 29 special grand juries and one-half of the Justice Department's lawyers and FBI agents. were out. to get .him; in fact,. there were only 13 grand juries, 16 attorneys and approximately 30 FBI agents, arid their .atteJ)tion was not focus~d s~lely on Hoffa, though it was their primary assignirent.207 The effort did show sOire irnpressi ve results. During s 201 TeanJSter theiL associates weLe indicted, and 126 of. were convicted. 208 Nevertheless, the .rtost .in\"p<Jrtant 1962, Hoffa was inc:lic.ted Act 44 Nashvj,lle, Tennessc.>e for repeiving $1,000,000 .in paynent.s \u00b7 through a trucking canpany, . the 'l'est Fleet Corporation, .which had been h' . f 1 209 set up 1n 1s w1.e s name. His trial ended with a hung jury ur: December 23, 1962, but the judge, W~.lliam E. Miller, ordered the convening of a grand jury to investigate' charges of jury tampering. The judge comt~Cntc.'<:'l: The right of a defendant in a criminal case to be .. t:ried by a jury of his peers is one of the nost sacred of our constitutional guarantees. The system of trial by jury, however, becares nothing.\u00b7. nore than a rroekery if . unscrupulous persons a:r:e' allowed to subvert it by improper and unlawful means. I do nO.t intend that such shaireful acts to corrupt ?U2l~ury .sy,stem shall go unnoticed by this court. 'l'he grand jury investigation resulted in Hoffa and five others being indicted in Nashville on May 9, 1963. Hoffa and seven other$ were also indicted in Chicago on June 4, 1963 for obtaining by fraud. $20,000,000 in loans from the CentraLStates Pension Fund, from which, i~ was charged, they had diverted $1,090,000 for their own benefit.211 But first action had to be taken against one of Hoffa's lawers. b. Actions Against Hoffa's Lawyer On November 7, . 1963, Sheridan learned that an effort was being made by a Iloffa attorney, z. \u00b7 T. \"Tomny\" Osborn, Jr., to tamper with the jury I ' ' ) 0 AsSOCJ.at1on, arid he had successfully argued Baker v. Can. , \u00b7 the Tennessee reapportionment case, before the u. S., Supreme Court . With the trial judge's pennission, key conversations between Osborn and Robert Vick, . a man whose as'sistance Osborn had sought in ;tne bribery attempt, were record~d. Ol=lborn was confronted with the allegat;i:on by 45 .. \u00b7. \u00b7 the court; h~ denied it, until the tape was presented to Jdm. He then cl.:d.med he hR<~ been Eventually, Osborn was :i:ndic\u00b7ted and tried for endeavoring to obstruct justice. He ..

The'.rury Tampering Prosecution Hoffa 1 s ju;ry .tamperirlg trial, which had been $ifted to ; ' ' ' ' Chattanooga, got underway on January 20, 1964, before Jud9e _Frank W., Wilson. Six weeks later it ground to an end. Hoffa was foun\u00a21 guilty, principally on t4e basis -of the of Edward, Grady Pa+tin, the Secretary-Treasurer of 'l'eamster .I.Dcal 5 in Baton Rouge, La., who h~d \u00b7 . . been .part of Hoffa 1 s retinue during the Nash~ille trial, but who had I I \u00b7, decided to cooperate with the go\\rernrrent in September 1962. Partin at ' ' ,< ' that t.irre told Justice bepart:nent lawyers about a June 1962 conversation he had had with Hoffa in Wasbington in which Hoffa had talked about assassihatbxg. RObeL L Kemtedy \"He 1 s got to go, \" Hoffa had said, . and an . FBI lie detector test indicated he was telling the. truth.217 Partin ', \", ' : ' ,, agreed to tell Sheridan whe:i'!: he knew about Hoff~ 1 s effort to influence the jury .in the Nashville. prosecution, and his incriminating testirrony ' ' . \u00b7' survived five days o~ grueling cross-examination. It was on the basis ,,, 46 ~-. t .I of Partin's account that the jury verdict ultimately rested. J'udge Wilson sentenced Hoffa to eight years in prison on March 12, 1964 saying: Mr. llufi~ . :lou stand here convicted of having tampered, really, with the very soul of this nation [w] ithout a fair, proper and lawful administration of justice, nothing else would . be possible in this. count.ry--the administra- \u00b7 tion of labor unions, the a&ninistration of business,\u00b7 the carrying on of recreation, the adnunistration of health services, everything we call civilization depends ultimately upon218 the proper administration of. justice itself. The Supre:rre Court upheld theconviction in 1966.219 d. 'I'he Fraud Prosecution Hoffa's Chicago trial for fraud in connection with the pension funds got underway on April 27, 1964. After 13 weeks it ended with a five and one-half hour surcmation to the jury by Assistant u.s. Attorney William Bittman, in which the flow of funds was traced through intricate and devious channels. Bittnan was followed by a rebuttal by Charles Bellows, a prqmin.ent defense counsel in Chicago, but Judge Richard Austin became angered when he learned that Dellows had used charts based on exhibits not in evidenc.e and he instructed the jury to disregard them.220 Hoffa was found guilty after the, jury deliberated 17~ hours, and Judge Austin sentencect him, on August 17, 1964, to serve five years in addition to his jury tampering te:rrn. Eight days later Robert Kennedy, having resigned as Attorney C':eneral, announced his candidacy for the U. S. Senate from New York; he was elected in November. Hoffa did not go to jail until March 1967, when all his appeals had becane final. It had been a contest 9f wills of two detennined, bitterly opPosed ~n. \"\"nic struggle, l.lilprecedented in h;istory. 47 Hoffa had won the first rounds, but Kennedy had won the last. Hoffn wou.ld contend he h.:td been fnun::~d, but rl'hEm::.> was more to Hoffa' f: bat\u00b7tle to stay out. of prison than showed in the court records. 'l'he Chicago underworld had a pl~l to fix J\\1dge Miller in Nashville, but no one had the courage to offer the bribe; 221 there. was also u threat against .. the brother of Suprc.m-c Court .. Justice William ,' 222 J. Brerman 223 and other desperate efforts;\u00b7 allegations of governrrent wiretapping and ap offer d\u00a3 $100,000 to J.

Senator who had enjoy~d Teams\u00b7ter support, Edward l..Dng of Missouri (he had once received $100,000 in questionable fees from one of Hoffa i s attorneys) , 226 was behind an effort to undercut the organiz~ crime program and em:>arrass .the Attorney General. 227 And Congressman Roland Libonati. of Cgicago demanded an investigation by the House J\"udiciary.Compittee into the Hoffa prosecutions in a resolution that passed on September 22, 1964, but was not carried forward after Libo . d.

Wray Gill--sought: to help Hoffa by securing exculpating tape record:i,.ngs, and a $1,000,000 fund was allegedly made available to Marcello by union and underworld supporters of Hoffa to be used to free the Teamster leader. 230 All of the efforts to subvert justice failed. e. Hoffa's Murder Hoffa received an Executive Grant .of Clemency from Presi~nt 48 .<,:'' ,t. Richard M. Nixon on December 23, 1971, without the customary consulta- tion with the judge who sentenced hiln, and even though the u.s. Parole Board on three occasions in the preceding t:wo years had considered and unanimously rejected lli.: .. ..;.~ .... .ests for release. 231 The Parole Board's decisions had, in part, .been based on advice from the'Justice Department \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 that. Hoffa New York, term=d it a \"pivotal element. the . strbng between the [Nixon] aQministration and the . union,\" :i.rrplying it was related to the 1972 electio:n. 232 ~ terms of his release, how~ver, forbade Hoffa from engaging in\u00b7 direct or indirect managerrent of \u00b7a labor organization. Much as the union wanted Hoffa out of prison, it seexred, the nob did not wan\u00b7t him in a position of union leadership. The I?arole restriction had been bought, according to .one rurror, 233 a $500,000 npb a Teamster leader in New J\u00b7ersey and a ca:p:>regina in the Genovese family of La Cosa Nostra.234 Once out, Hoffct.filed suit to declare the restriction null and void, .and he began to make amove to regain the presidency of the union. He was sounding like a refbrm=r, and one promise hE= made, if elected in 1976, ironically, was to end the Teamster's relations with the mob. That pranise went too far. It would lead t.o his murder. 235 At about 1:15 p.m. on July 30, 1975, Hoffa left his Detroit home on Robson Drive to go to the Red Fox Restaurant 1n Bloomh.eld, a sUburb of Detroit to meet with Anthony Provenzano and Anthony Giacalone, who 49 \" ,) .t was a caporegima in the. Detroit La Cosa Nostra fami.ly.236 Hoffa arrived at the Hed li'ox about. 2:00 p.m. Neither Provenzano nor Giacalone were there; they would both subsequently establish their whereabouts elsewhere by airtight alibis. Hoff.a was evidently picked up bet.-ween 2:45 and 2:50 by Charles O'Brien, the son o \u00b7 er men were in th.e ca:r, o:--. \u00b7 whan was Salvatore Briguglio, who served for. Teamster Local 560, Provenzano' s hane lpcal. Hoffa was probably knocked unconscious,,. which would explain wl'ly his hair . ' particles and traces o.f his blood were found in the back seat of the 238 maroon Mercury that O'Brien had borrowed from Giacalone's son, Joey. , o'Brien had close ties to Giacalone, whcm he called Uncle 'l'ony. Indeed, O'Brien's mother, Sylvia, who diec1 in 1970, had also been Giacalone's girlfriend; in addition, she had been a close frierid of Hoffa's wife, ,Josephine, and it was :l::unored that the two waren were double-dating \u00b7 Giac;:olone and Anthony Cimini, another McJ.fia leader in the Detroit area, \u00b7in\u00b7 the early 1960s. According to that sto:cy, Hoffa had only been able\u00b7 to break up the affair by appealing directly to Joseph Zerilli, the La ' . bo . ' . . 239 ha ' ' ' cosa Nostra ss J.P Detro1 t. , It s been suggested, on .the other hand, that the hit men were not with O'Brien in the c~.240 Ins~ad, Hoffawas driven to O'Brien's temporary residence four minutesfrom the Red Fox. \\i\u00b77aiting calmly at the house were Salvatore and Gabriel Briguglio and rl'homasAPdretta 1 who were flawn in on a private plane. There were also conflicting reports as to where Hoffa was actually killed. It may have been at the house where O'Brien was staying, but: apparently unbekn()Wl)st to the people who lived there. 241 In addition, there were contradictions as to how Hoffa's. body was disposed of. One 50 ... ..... , informant ' s ~tory \\'Jns that it into a 55-gallon drum and . . . . 242 shipped to a New .Jersey dump. It wets also reported that. the facilities (shredder, compactor, and incinerator) of Central Sanitation Services, in I-IamtrwlC'l<, Mir'-1. were t:lSed. 243 .. According to other FBI informants, Central Sanitation Services, which was owned by Rafael . . Quasarano and Peter Vitale, two Detroit La Cosa Nostra nernbers, had been used to dispose of at. least 10 other bodies of Mafia murder victims.244 Finally, there was disagreewent over how much 0.' Brien knew or what his role was. O'Brien himself said: ''I never did anything to hUrt Jimny Hoffa. n245 \\'IJhat there was no disagreerrent about w~s that Hoffa was dead, and the mob was responsible for his death 'rhe murder, noreover, .wq.s ultimately traced to Russell Bufalino of . . Pittston, Pa., a lJJafia leader for a large area of Pennsylvania and an Apalachin attendee in 1957~246 In addition to Bufaliho, t:he finger pointed at Joseph Zerilli, as neither Provenzano nor Giacalone had the stature to order a hit on Hoffa in Zerilli's territory. Bufalino's involverrent could be inferred from a numbel\\. of factors. 247 He had, for one thing, long been associated with .bot.h Provenzano and Giacalone; he had also been in telephone contact with Quasarano and Vi tale in the months that immediately preceded Hoffa's disappearance; and he was, close to his cousin, William Bufalino of Detroit, a fonrer Hoffa attorney, who \u00b7 \u00b7 .showed up to represent all of the suspects and their alibi w.:i. tnesses in a grand ju:cy probe of Hoffa's disappearance. E'maliy, E'rank Sheeran, the president of Teamster Local 326 in Delaware, who shepherded the alibi witnesses before the grand jury, was involved with Bufalino in a ' 1,' ' \"labor leasing\" sch.eire to circumvent wage provisions .of the National Master Freight Agreerrent, which would. have been in jeopardy had Hoffa Motive. Hoffa'::;. disapearance and death, however, needs to be placed \u00b7in a I, , I broader perspec-tive than qoncern ~the. might put an end to a lc;ibor- leasing scheme. Bef9re his surveillance248 conducted be-tween 1961 and 1964 on t.he I-I<;Xre Juice Company of Detroit showed (none \"Tuice, a soft drink distributOr, was owned by Anthony and Vitb Giacalone), \u00b7\u00b7Hoffa was Giacalone, Polizzi, a. Detroit rrob figure, had remarked .that \"he would have never gotten his loan of $630, ooo' without Jimny.\" The load had been obtained said that \"Jinrny . his [force] these guys [the ~d trustees] to give it Several factors contributed to\u00b7\u00b7 ' ,, \"' Hoffa's influence over the fund, a joint errployer-:-uni<;>n trusteeship for the employees, which was establishE:d in Janua:ry 1955.249 The union \u00b7 . had de facto control over the invest~nt decisions made, as the employers did not want to q.ntagonize Hoffa. In addition, the decision WaS ma00 to. inVeSt the fund IS assetS directly and not to giVe its managerrent over to professionals. Hoffa, himself, therefore, becane the controlling figure\u00b7 in the making. of loans. . ' ' ' .

When Hoffa went to prison in 1967, he told J;itzsi,rmons that Allen \"speal<.s for me on all pension fund questions. i2:50 52 Hoffa Added, \"He's the guy in charge while I'm gone.\"251 Dorf-rnc-:m, like Hoffn, has. been succQss.ful in defcmting a number of criminal prosecut.ions. lie was found not guilty in Hoffa' s Chatt.anooga jury tanpering prosecution in 19647 he was nlso found not guilty in 1974 of embezzlement and mail fraud in connection with a fund \u00b7loan of $1,400,000. Charged with him in tl}e 1974 prosecution were Anthony Spilotro and Felix Alderisio, both Chicago mob figures, and Irwin Weiner, a Chicago bnil bonde1an long suspected of organized crime ties On September 27, 1974, a witness in the embezzlerrent and mail fraud case, Daniel Seifert,. was shotgunned to death in front qf his wife and two-year-old son.252 Dorfman's one guilty verdict carne in 1972--for conspiracy to take a $55,000 kickback for arranging a $1,500.000 \u00b7loan. The cross~examination by the prosecutor at Dorfman's tr~l established how little independent. judgnent the funds trustees exercised ove.r loans or over Dorfman, then an employee of the Fund~ J:)c)rfman was able to extract the. $55.,000 kickl:>ack by arguing that the fund had already lost so much :rroney on outstanding $15,000,000 loans to the borrower who paid the kickback, George Horvath, that a new one should cost Horvath t.he $55,000.253 Although the Horvath kickback was Dorfman's only criminal . conviction, there were organized crime overtones to pension fund loans he administered, particularly sorre in Las Vegas. Most pension funds tend to have a conservative policy, mvestmg prJ.man.ly m goverrment bonds and having less than two per cent of their assets in real estate. 254 Yet by 1963, the Central States l?und, with nccumulated assets of $213 million, had 63 per cent of its invest:nents in real\u00b7 estate and only three per cent in governnEnt bonds, with the rest heJd in bank accounts and -::cw\u00b7.,-v-, -t:e bonds.

He was found not guilty in Hoffa's Chattat1CXXJa jury tampering prosecution in 1964; he wa,s also found not guilty in 1974 of embezzlement and mail fraud in connection with a fund 'loan .of !,n ,400,000.

Yet by 1963, the Central States Fund, \\\"lith accumulated a.ss.ets of $213 milliori, had 63 per cent of its ihves-qrtents in :teal estate and only three per cent in goVetnrrent bonds, wit.h the rest held in bank accounts and corporate bonds. \u00b7 vUnd loans 255 inc~uded in 1959 54 and 1960 <1 series made to Morris \"Moe\" Dalitz, a gambler and former bootlegger from Cleveland, whom Hoffa had known in Det.roi t. and through whom a payoff had been allegedly arranged to settle a Teamster laundry strike in 1949 }56 '!'he Dalitz loans were obtained to build Sunrio2 I , Hospital in Las Vegas, as well as to finance the Stardust Hotel and\u00b7\u00b7 Country Club, the frenont Hotel nnq the Desert +nn, all in Las Vegas. According to FBI evidenc::e, the Statdust, F'rem:mt and Desert Inn casinos were tc\"lk.en to the tune of $100 ,000-a-m::>nth in the early 1960s by n skim operation for the benefit of organized crine figures, including Sam Giancana of Chicago, John Scalish of Cleveland and ~yer Lansky of Miami. 257 Pension records showed that from 1965 to 1972, $20,400,000 was lent to Caesar's Palace, the ostensible owner of which was Jay Sarno,258 but who was really, according to the FBI, a front for organized crine interests in the Midwest.~ New England.259 Skimning was suspected at Ceasar' s Palace but not doc\\m'ented by the FBI. In 1971, on Dorfman.' s recomnemdation, fund assets were also put into the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino.260 Loans of $15,500 1000 and $2,000,.000 were approved, the total figure finally reaching $26,000,000. Jay Sarno was again the paper owner, but. the real party in interest, according to the FBI, was Anthony Spilotro, described by the Illin~is Crime Investigation Commission as \"one of the most dangerous gang errorists in the Chicago area. \"261 The FBI was also suspected skimning at . the \u00b7 Ci:rcus . Ci:rcus Casino. In\u00b7 1974 , the fund also approved a $62,700,000 loan to the Argent Corporation, owned by Allen R. Glick, to purchase the Stardust and tile Frerront. 262 Glick, in turn, put Frank Rosenthal in charge of his gambling operations. Rosenthal, who was an associate of Spilotro and who was convicted in the 1960s of bribing a college basketball player, oroceeded to organize a sophisticated scht:L..,\"\" 55 ' :!J ' t.o defraud the casinos and the State of Nevada of at. least $20 million . 18 h h 1 t 1 1 . . 't' . 1 h up un ~ . t a t:ure. It has. been estimated that if all of the organized cri.Ire-connected loans since 1957 were added up, they would anount to $600,000,000, out of approximately $1.2 billion that had been loaned by the Ceritral States Pension F'lmd. 264 1\\'t least $100 ,o\u00b7oq ,000 has been lost in undercharged interest and another $285,000,000 has been lost in defaults.265 Indeed, the mismanagement of the tunu was so bad that in. 1974, it ceased making loans, and in 1979, under. Labor Depart:Irent pressure, the trustees resigr1ed ahd Central States Pension Fund _was put into the hands of F..qui table Life Assurance Society and Victor Palmiers & Cc:npany. 266 rl'he percentages of real estate loans dramatically shifted from a top- heavy 70 per cent to about 35 per cent by 1979. The cash return went up to roore than nine per cent from roughly four per cent. If Hoffa' s fate is put in the_ larger coritext of \u00b7control over the fund, then Bufalino would not have stood alone as the responsible party. It wou~ have been a matter for the Organized Crin~ Commission to pass on. Arguably, the top underworld leaders had tOO much at stake to permit Hoffa to return to the presidency of the Teamsters on a :t:\"efonn ticket.

Surveillance Program The investigations that foiiOWed'the cr~I conclave at Apaladh~ on Novenber 14, 1957, served to point out how little was, in fact, .known by law enforcem:mt about . organized cr.Ure in the Uni\u00b7ted States. As Robert Kennedy recalled, \"The FBI didn't know anything, really, about [the Apalachin attendees] that was rather a shoc:k to me. n267 Apalachin, however, marked the beginning of a broad effort to catch up. 56 Today, tho si!\"lgle most reliable source of organized crime informat.ion is the \u00b7transcripts and sunmaries of conversations of underworld figures that were obtained in the course of a corrprehensive program of electronic surveillance that was conducted by the :FBI between 19119 and ' . ,', 1965.

On August 24, 1964, Court.ney Evans, the Associate FBI Director for the Special Irtvestigative Division, could say with confidence to Alan Belm:mt, the Associate Director for the General Investigative Division: We are probably i11 the unique position\u00b7 of better understanding Giancana' s. reaction [to an incident involving Joe Bonnanno, a ccmni.ssion marrber in disfavor with the comn:i.ssioners] [are other farnily bosses]....

The Tenn Mafia While. there is a wealth of accurate information in the public domain on r.a Cosa 1\\Jostra as of the early 1960s, there is no corresponding accurate source for the O:rigin and early developnent of\u00b7 . . the national syndicate. The tenn. \"mafia\" its~lf has been traced back to the 13th centw:y, .and there are various theories. 'about i\u00b7ts o:r:igin. A called Sicilian Charles I and the French occupation army. 289 'J.'he signal for the uprising was said to have been th~ ringing of church bells: .for evening prayers, or which \"Mafian was derived. Joseph Bonnanno, a 60 \u00b7'.'.' prominent organized crime figure, .told Gay Talese,290 his biographer, that he had been taught a variation of the Vespers story, in which .the rrother of a .Sicilian girl who had been dishonored by French soldiers, . ran through the streets crying, \"Ma fia, rna fia (My daughter, my ' ' ' ' . ' daughter).\" Far fran estah1 i.shing the 1 s undoubte\u00a211 y apocryphal accqunt was a good illustration of why there is need to be skeptical of many myths about organized crime. Several points, for example, undermine the ,. authenticity of the Vespers. lec;Jend~~91 Not .a word of it can be found in contemporaneous literature, nor did \"Mafia\" appear in dictionaries of the period. 292 But, rrost telli.pg, it is doubtful that the population of Sicily in 1282 would have thought of itself as Italian.293 294 1\\lthough an author had .found the word in use as early as 1658, \u00b7 \"IYJafia11 did not appear :Ln a dictiC>na.ry until 1868, .when it was defined as a neologism :rreaning \"any sign of bravado. \"295 Another dictionary in 1876 defined it as a word of Piednontese origin, having the rreaning sarewhat of \"gang. n296 Vizzini 1 s 41 Mafia, published in 1880, attributed the word--and the founding of the organization it described--to Guiseppi Mazzini, a 19th, century Italian Republican, a shaper of the nationalism and liberalism of his day, friend of ~vill,iatn Lloyd Garrison, the Arrerican abolitionist, and a correspondent of Abraham Lincoln. 297 According to Vizzini, during a revolt i:n Sicily in 1860 against the Bom:bons, Mazzbli c:!oiJJed U1e term as a name for a secret society he established from the initials of its\u00b7 nottO.: \"Mazzini autorizza futi and poisonings) \" 'I'he facts of Mazzini 1 s life have to be determined with caution, s:i.nce l1is enemies--including the French secret police--spread vicious stories abOut him. It appears certain, however, 61 t. that. he fomed more than.one secret society dtrring Italy's revolutionary pericd. 'l'hei.r codes of conduct parallel one another, as well as those of successor societies, the Mafia and La Cosa Nostra. Assassination was not precluded. In fact, it was encouraged as a rreans of achieving political ends~ Mazzini himself, thOugh he denied it, 'was reportedly involved in an atteupted assassination of King C..'harles Albert of Piedmont, having supplied a dagger and travel dOCl.lll'ents to the would-be assassin, Antonio Ga~l~r.~~. Corsican who backed out at the last minute.29a. There is. also interesting corroboration for the Vizzini version: in 1890, a reputed J.l.lafioso, who had been arrested inNew Orleans, told a police undercover agent that the founder of the Mafia II . b . and d G . . great n.g narre 'w.seppe Mazz~m . On the other hand, substantial discount the Mazzini-as-Mafia-founder .~-]....~ . 1 'th . . f the the 300 u~s~s, a ong w~ most o o rs. For one, Mazzini was considered a liberal, while the Mafia has always been essentially conserva\u00b7tive. 301 About the safest position~ however, is that of Francis Crawford in his The Rulers of the South: .the word is \"of doubtful attrac.ted considerable attention in the United States in the latter part of the 19th century, particularly in New . Orleans, where on October 15, 1890, the assassination of a high public official was an early milestone in the development of public awareness of the Mafia as part of organized crirre in .America. 2. The Sicilian Roots In September 1874, The l.Dndon T:i.Ires reported that refugees from Sicily were pouring into Perugia, a university town in central Italy, in flight from the atrocities of a new Canorra, a secret society \"called . . the Sicilian Maffia [sic],\" which had a code of silence, and which \"had 62 :,::'\u00b7.,' ,. its own set of. laws, [that.] replaces legal authority. n304 On Novemr.:>er. 2, 1874., 'l'hc I.Dndon Ti.Jn:~s reported that the governm.::mt had, in its view, crushedthe new organization, which called itself the \"Honorable Society.\" Apparently, these were the first reports in an English 1Cl.l1.guage newspaper of +he ex.; stence of the :Mafia. Three years later, a band o:E E3icilian outlaws, also going by the name Mafici, drew at\u00b7tention to itself by the kidnapping of an English baJiker, John Porester Rose.305 'I'h~ head. of the group was Antonio Leone: his second in comnand was Gu.i,seppo EE;J?OSitp. When a ransom note sent Rose's. wife was not followed by inmed.i,CJ,te payrrent, anqther was sent, containing Rose 1 s shriveled ear. The ransom was paid, but an outraged British goveiTlll'Slt, then headed by Benjamin Disraeli, gave the Italian goverrnrent an ultimatum: unless Lc'One and his band were punished, a British expeditionary force would be dispatched \u00b7to do the job itself. Eventually, an Italian army br~gade cornered Leone and his men on a hill oUtside Palermo. After a pitched battle, Leone, Esposito and a handful of followers were captured. Leone was taken to ),bue, where he . was tried and . sentenced to life inprisonrren-t}06 Esposito, however, escaped, .apparently l:>y bribing a guard. He remained at large in Sicily for a year (he was captured and escaped a second time), then fled to New York with six henchmen in . November 1878. Largely based on cont.eirporary newspaper records and othe'.r documents, one of the best accounts of Esposito 1 s career .from that .pomt was written by David r ... Chandler, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, who suggested that E~posito1s stayin New York was brief for two reasons: 307 the refonn IIDV~t that had driven the Tweed Ring out\u00b7\u00b7 of City Hall was still il1\u00b7 effect1 and there was no place for Italian criminals since organized crime in New York at the time was dominated by 63 ~\u00b7\u00b7.\u00b7\u00b7 the Irish and.

Chandler, that. his future would be brighter in ;,2~\"\" nore hclspitable climate of .N~\u00b7 Orleans', where there . a local Mafia organization. Arriving in New Orleans in the spring of 1879, ESJ?OSito, calling himself nJ\u00b7oe Randazzo, \"309 e.stablished a fruit and vegetable business, took Sarah Castagno as a new wife (he had left another-~with five children--in Sicily) , 310 and lived a. prosperous life, d':j;ning at the . best . npst a so ec 1pse . , Josep P.

Shakespeq.re had been Mayor once before, from 1880. to 1882, \\vhen there was a .stnlggle over control of the r~atronage, graft, and vice that was thriving in the city. In fact, the Hennessey-Devereaux feud in 1881 was .widely seen as part .of ~t. struggle. In qny event, .while Hennessey had not beccme Chief of. \u00b7 Detectives in 1881, he was appointe(l Superintendent of Police by Mayor Shakesrx~itre in 1888 , .. an appoinbrent that set the stage for his. shocking assassina\u00b7tion two years later. 3. The . New Orleans Assassination a. The Murder On October 15, 1890, it. was cold and dismal in New Orleans. 321 A fog, \u00b7turning at tines \u00b7to rain, enveloped the city, and the unpaved streets of the French Quarter were topped by an inch of water and mud.322 Chief Hennessey, 32, and a .compcinibn, Captain William O'Connor of the Boylan Detective Service, a private police agency that was run by the fonrer police<superintendent, were returning at 11 p.m. from a rreetirig of the Police Board at the old City Hall. Hennessey, whose life had been threatened, .had taken to having sorreone walk with him. They had stopped for a short while in Hennessey' s office in the ~ntral Police Station at. SoUth Basin and Cormon Streets, and th,en proceede<;l toward hone. When they reached Girod Street I Hennessey told 0 I Connor I \"There's \u00b7no need .to cane any further 'witl:l me now, Bill. You .'9o on your . way. \"3~3 \u00b7 \u00b7.O'Connor then spla,Shed \u00b7 across Girop Street:. and walkeQ east toward the. Mississippi River, while HeJm,essey travelled west toward the .. house he shared with his mother at 275 Girod Street, between Basin and Franklin Streets. He did not.rnake it hone; he was ambushed by assaf;Jsins using sawed-off shotguns; he received six W()unds, four of them . 324 superficial, one \u00b7serious, one. mortal. Bleeding and staggering,\u00b7 66 1\u00b7, Hetmessey mririaged to draw his gun and return the fire. O'Connor, having heard the gunfire, reached Hennessey's side minutes after the shoot.ing . \"Who did this, Dave?\" he asked. \u00b7 \"Dagds,\" Hennessey replied}2~ He was rushed to old Charity Iiospital, where he was operated on by ,\\_, a special ~diqa,l team. At about 1 a.m~, he received tlie last rites of the Church from a Catl;c,jr r~\u00b7,st. At about 9 a.m. on October 16, he died. b. Its .Aftermath: Trial and Lynching Event:s then rroved swiftly. A large riuml:ier of :i.mlti~ants from Italy \u00b7 and Sicily were indiscriroiriately. arr~sted, sctre for appa.reritly no rrore reason tl1an that they did not speak English well. 326 On October 18, Mayor Shakespeure appOinted a .conroittee \"to thoroughly investigate the watt.er of the existence of secret societies or bands of oath-bouOO. assassins, which it is openly charged have culminated in the assassination of the hi<;:Jhest. executive officer of thePblice D~partirent \"327 That same day, Hennessey was given a grand funeral, after lying in state in the COuncil Chamber of City Hall, wl:lere ~o years earlier, Jefferson Davis, the fonrer President of the Confederate States of America, had rested. 328 .1\\ \u00b7requiem Mass .was said at St. Joseph's Catholic Church, and a f~ral procession, .m:>re than .a mile . long, went to suburban Metarie Cemetery, whc'~re Hennessey was entombed in a marble\u00b7.and Forty-e~ght hOurs after Hermesseyi s assassftiatiort, Thomas Ouf\u00a3r, a newspaper peddler, asked to see one of: those arrested; he said. he wanted to make an identification of him as one of the assassins. When the guards produced Anthonio Scaffidi, Duffylunged tbward him, firing a .32 caliber revolver.329 As the guards pinned Duffy down end disanredhim, he screami:il, \"If there were 75 nore man like me in New Orleans, we'd run 67 ,' ' :,'',\\ I:,',.> all the dagos.out of the.city!\"330 Although wounded, Scaffidi survived. Duffy was tried and convicted, and sentenced to six rronths in the Orleans. and Parish Prison.

Simres, a former Louisiana Attorney General, who was paid, accordin<;J to his granclrtiece, a \"pillow case full of rroney. \"333 OUt of 780 prospective jurors, 12 were finally selected. 334 OUt of 319 witnesses surnroned, 154 . . 335 actually testified--67 for the state, 84 for .the ~fenf:)e. \u00b7 The testirrony filled 800 typewritten pages. The trial lasted until the mid9le of March .and it was covered extensively--and perhaps unduly affected--by the press.336 Chandler, in Brothers. in Blood, termed the evidence against the defendants \"extensively incr,iminating.\"337 Richard Gambino, in Vendetta, conceded the \"probable guilt\" of four of them, suggesting that the rest wer~ \"probably innocent. \"338 The trial .judge, Joshua G. Barker, dirncted ;'ln acquit.tal for two of the defendants. 'l'WL\u00b7 days were then taken in final argument, and the jury went out. at 6:22 a.m. on March 12. The followmg afternoon, around .12:30, it declared \u00b7 itself deadlocked as to three def~ndants, and it found the others, including Macheca, not guilty. Since additional charges were pending, those found not guilty as wellas the others were rerranded to the Parish. ' ' ' Prison. Judge Barker was later to suggest that the actiori was not. what he accomplished. 'l'he impact of the jury verqict stunned the city. A howl of rage wcmt up in IK'tfayet\u00b7te Squ.;tre. As the jurors were escorted out, they wer:e taunted, \"How much did you get.?\"340 The defendants held a victory celebration in the prison, but there was another gathering tha:t night with a different purpope. At. the Boston Club, the second oldest prJ.vai.:'\" club in the country 1 W. S.

Tt announced a. mass meeting for that very morning, Saturday, March 14, at 10 a.m., at the Clay Statue, \"to take steps .to remedy the failure of justice in the Hennessey case.\" And as if to signal what was was. a briCjht and sunny day. By 10 a.m., a crowd of as mc:my as 8,000 persons had gathered about the granite pedestal of the statue of Henry Clay, then located at Canal and Royal Streets. Parkerson addressect the crowd: tion, \u00b7 is there left us, when the very head of our Police Departnent, our Chief of Police, is assassinated in our very midst by the Mafia Society ~tl..ll every m:m here follow ne, and343 see the mw::\"der of D. c.

' ' ' 68 \u00b7~. the 19 prj.sqners, so that. they might have a chance to hide. The tactic saved .the lives of eight.of them, including Macheca, but the remaining 11 were shot or hanged or both, and the bodies of two hanged men were used for target practice. The Italiap consul, Pasquale Corte, arrived at the scene to find, as he described it in his report on March 15 to the Royal Ministry in Rone, the \"hor:rors of slaughter,\" the. sight of \"dead bodies hanged to trecs.\"344 Of the 11 who were lynched, three .. had been acquitted, thr~e had been declared subjects of a mistrial, and five had not been tried at all. Response to ,the lynchings reflected an antagonistic attitude toward .irrmigrants in general c;md towar<;l the Mafia in particular, \u00b7 although the criminal socie\u00b7ty had not yet .achieved notoriety, e~cept;. in the very large cities like New York, New Orleans .and Chicago. The !-Jew ~6rk Times345 said in an editorial that ''life and property\" was wade \"safer,'' while The Washington Post346 editoriafized that the people of New Orleans had been \"provoked\" and had had to break a \"reign of terror.\" 'Iheodore RCX>s!S!velt, lynching \"a .rather good thing,\" adding that he had said so, too, at a party in the presence of \"various dago diplomats. n347 \u00b7The Italian representative in Washington., Baron Francesco Severio .Fava,, however, lodged a series of protests with Secretary of State Jame::. G. Blaine, which called for indemnity for the families of the victims .. and punishrrent of the offenders. :Relat~ons between Rome and Washl.rigtbn became tense and then deteriorated, as each nation withdrew its representatives. President ~jamin Harrison asked Attorney General William H. H. Miller to loo:K into the .watter, and on April 27, 1891, the U. s~ attorney for New Orleans, William Grant~ reported349 to the Attorney General that he\u00b7 had been unable \"to connect\" any of the persons 69 lynched with Qribery of the jury or to obtain \"direct evidence cormecting [them] wi t.h the Mafia,\" .the existence of which, he conceded, had been \"known and believed in by the public [in New Orleans] for a great many years.\" He also acknowledged that \"few of its victims [had] the courage to speak \" While conceding that he had no-t attempted \"\u00b7to examine into the guilt or innocence\u00b7 of the r~rs0r-s accused of the murder of Hennessey,\" he expresst.::.d. the opinion that the evidence was not \"conclusive .one way or the ot}1er.\" c. The Grand Jury Report A grand jury in New Orleans, which was errpowe~ed on. March 17, 1891, to investigate the lynchings, was not so restrained in its judgnent. In a report issued May 6, it called the verdict in the murder trial \"ptartlingly amazing, a bitter disappointment shocking to public op.irlion,\" and it terrred .the state's Case \"strong\" and \"nore than $Ufficient.\"350 It .also noted extensive evidence of efforts to reach those selected as talesmen, carm:nting, however, that: [It] will be quickly realized by every thoughful person that the difficulties of esta}:)lishing the existence of a conspiracy by pdequate proof are alinost insunromtable. . Such plotting_ was\u00b7 done in secret places and their working often guarded by the advice of counsel well versed in criminal. \u00b7 law. Secrecy is an essential element in the -successful .execution of the designs of a conspir\u00ad acy. Seldom does it happen that any one of the participants will reveal the v!~!ains either before or after its eXecution. The grand jury then returned six indictments for efforts to fix the trial jury in the Hennessey assassinat:ion, of .which three resulted in . convicti(,)ns, two ;resulted in acquittals, and ohe was never tried. 'I'he grand jury concluded that sare members \u00b7of the trial jury \"were su:Qject to a noney influence. \"352 On t:he question of the Mafia, the g:t:\"and jury concluded: 70 ~ ... ,I 'I'he ~xtended range of our ref)earch has developed the existence of the secret organization styled \"Mafia.\" 'l'he evidence canes fran several soi.lrces fully competent in themselves to attest its truth Officers of the Mafia and many of its rremben=J are not known. \u00b7\u00b7 Alrong them are rren born \u00b7in this city of Italian origin The larger number of the society is c~53d of Italians and Sicilians [imni.grants] \u00b7 rl'he grand jury then praised sane societies that imnigrunts had created \"for.\u00b7 laudable\" purp::>ses, .. 354 a.,sass:Lna .1on It also noted that a large part of the Italian colony in New Orleans was recognized \"as a worthy class\"; it was, the grand jury said, \"fairly industrious\" and characterized by 355 \"frugality.\" It then found that the \"sadly deficient\" or \"badly adrninistered\" imni.gration laws had failed in the past to distinguish between the \"meritorious and law-abiding\" and the \"vicious. \"356 Finally, the grand jury turned to the murder of Hennessey and the lynchings: Assassination of the late Chief of Police shows the culmination of a conspiracy. His death was deemed necessary to prevent the exposure and punishrrent of criminals whose guilt was Pj~ljg fast established by his diligent pursuit. The grand jury noted that. \"good citizens\" had been \"profoundly .irrpressed by the repeated and signal failures of justice. n358 The lynchings seemed, the grand jury said,. \"to involve the entire pec...rJ.e of the parish and city of New Orleans n359 It declined, therefore, to present any indictments on the lynchings. The grand jury report was generC~:lly well received. The Washington Post360 endorsed it, for exanple, but others felt differently. The Italian consul in New Orleans, Pasquale Corte, wrote an open letter on May 6 to the grand jury in which he questioned its work, not. denying the. existence of the Mafia or that there \\vere \".Italian criminals\" in 71 .J New Orleans. ~orte notecl that sane members of the m::>b itself had served on the grand jury, and he condemned its failure to indict those who had i ' ' in \"cold blood\" killed those who were \"either acquitted or not yet t . d 11361 rJ.e President Harrison agreeq with theitalian consul. In his Third Annual message to Congress on December 9, 1891, he termed the mob ac-tion \"deplorable and discreditable,\" but he rcsulteu a-.-.11 \"general anilrosity to the Italian 362 people.\" \u00b7 d. Its .Aftennath The repercussions of the lynchings were widespread, and, curiously, the forces in play were much the san;e as those 70-odd years later\u00b7 when the first Irish-An~rican President TIE\u00b7t the sane fate--assassination--as an Irish Chief of Police in New Orleans--the u. S. goverrurent, the national cr~ syndicate, or Mafia, and a Caribbean country that first attracted u. S. attention in the 1890s, Cuba. \u00b7 In 1891, the. United States .had alnoE;t no fighting navy,. while Italy had .one of the world's mightiest. When a war scare developed over .the. 1 ynchings in New Orleans (several resolutions in the Italian ParliartEnt363 had called for bonbardlrent of Atlantic and Gulf ports)~ the Harrison Administration, prodded by congressional militarists. like Senator Hemry Cabot Lodge of .Massq.chusett.s, second ranking on the Naval Comni ttee 1 and a jingoistic press, argued successfully for. . ''' ' ' '; ' ' ' appropriations to bolster the n,ation' s naval presence. War Wl.th Italy was averted, but the stationing of the u. S. fleet in foreign waters led eight years later to Alrerican intervention in C\\.lba, following the sinking of the U.S. S. Maine in Havana harbor on February 15, 1898. The Spanish-.1\\I\"rerican \\var was over aJ.nost as soon as it began. Cuba .was . . . . invaded in June, and by July, control of the country had been Wrested 72 ). from Spain. Cuba renuined under U. S. control tmtil a cons\u00b7ti\u00b7tution in 1900 ostabliBhcd i t.s freedom, but that ,cxmsti tution also contc:lincd the Platt. arrendrrent, which, until it was revo)<ed in 1934, recognized the right of the United States \u00b7to intervene to preserve ~'independence\" or \"order\" in Cuba. 365 'l'he NL'W Orleans incident also was seized upon by advocates of res\u00b7trictive inmigration legislation. 'l'he Washington Post366 reported three weeks after the lynchings that it was the 11alrrost un.iversal belief that Congress Twou~dl undertake to make some radical ch?mges in the :i.nmigration laws. 11 Parkerson, the leader of the. New Orleans .m:>b, went . on a speaking tour in 1891 in behalf of \"refonn. 11 In addition, Senator l.Ddge, as strong in his nativism as in his support for the Navy, fought successfully for a restrictive policy toward immigrants, which would .not be reversed until 1960, with the election to the presidency of another Senat.or from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy. What Samuel Eliot Morison, the historian, said about legislation passed in 1921 applied to a general policy of discriminating against southern and eastern Europeans: \"Sicilians were suspect, owing to their having imported the Mafia, . [while] eastern European inmigrants were suspect because they were largely Jewish ai1(i possibly 'Red. 'n367 e. A Reconstruction and Perspective It must .be conceded, tna.~ as Smith argues in The Mafia ~&stique, 36ts it is not possible to \"say forcertain where the truth lies\" in the various accounts of the Hennessey assassination and the retributive lynchings in 1890 and 1891, owing to the inherent difficulty of reconstructing any historic event, especially When\u00b7 crime and controversy are involved. Nevertheless, it is known that a Mafia family that 73 .; ., ,.) existed in Ne~ Orleans tQday can be traced through identified persons, activities and traditions back from Carlos Marcello, its current leader, to Sam Carella, to .Charles Montranga and to ~Joseph Macheca. That alone even a debunker. like Gambino, in Vendetta, conceded is \"telling.\"369 The rrost satisfactory reconstruction of the events of 1:890, however, is that of Chandl(:}J\" in Brothen> :Ln Blood. 370 According to Char, \u00b7!1,...~. Joseph P. Macheca, the stepson of a hard-working frui\u00b7t stand vendor, . was born in New Orleans in 1843, of an uniden\u00b7tifi~d Sicilian father. By the age of 30, he was a man of property and influence. Nevertheless, in 1869, Ralph Ainello, a newly arrived inmigrant from Palenro, challenged his leadership in the f.>jcilinn conmunity. Apparent.ly, Ainello was a Mafia member, and he proceeded \u00b7to organize a local chapter. Macheca had Ainello murdered by Frank Saccaro, using a lupara, a sawed~\u00a3\u00a3 shotgun, and he took over lli.nello' s organization. Ma.checa stepped aside for. Guiseppo Esposito, the Sicilian bandit, but. he was back in power in 1881, after Esposito was an:\u00b7ested by the Hennesseys and deported. In 1890, strife erupted ' ,, 1 \u00b7 .. within the organization between factions loyal .to Joseph Provenzano and Charles Montranga over control of .the NeW Orleans docks. The conflict cane to a head not long after Dave Hennessey becane Chief of Police~ On April 6, 1890, some of Provenzano.' s Iren attacked a group of .Moptranga folloWers with shotguns at Claiborne and ~planada Streets, JUSt outs~de the E'rench QUarter, and Hennessey had the \u00b7 attackeL s arrested.. Surprisit1gly, the Montranga group swore out Conplaints, and despite an evident effort to fiX the case, the Provenzano people were convicted,\u00b7 but. the judge ordered a new triaL. While the case was still pending., Hennessey let it be k:no\\m that. he would ''show up\" and the Montrangas, is 74 If investig!lt.ing ~he Provenzano case the .wrong way and he will answer. for it. n371 It wc:w, he said, \"strictly an Italian affair\u00b7. \"372 Macheca then posted one of his n~ and a 14-year~ld nephew in a wood~n shanty a half-block from Hennessey's house. In. early October, four others rroved into the shanty. On October 15, two ~ays before the second\u00b7 Provenzano trial was to st.nr.t, the nephew, ad::iflg as a lookout, signaled Hennessey's approach. The others were ready w~th their lupqras. As Chandler noted, the \"amazing thing about the 1891 lynchings is ,, . ' ' that they had so little effeot on the Mafia in New Orleans.n373 Charles f-.1ontranga succeeded to Macheca' s leadershi!), and, except during the prohibition, when:' Irish gangs challenged the Mafia,' s dominance, the power .was passed peacefully from\u00b7 generation to generation. Montranga remained as leader until 1922, when he was succeeded by Sam Carella, who in turn was succeeded by Carlos Marcello. Montranga died on October 28, 1943, at age a6, and his funeral was attended.by executives of United I Fruit and other large corporations that had been dependent on his good '11 374 w~ The events in New Orleans in 1891 pemanently affected the .i\\IIErican consciousness in a nl.lillber of ways. While there we;re a number of secret societies of a criminal character that originated in either Sicily ~r southern Italy and the cultural difference between Sicilians of various parts of the island c.:r.1 lv.:>+--on them and Neapolitans or Calab:rians was ana iS SUbStant.tal t tne tendency qnong AlOOriCaJlS after. 1891 WdS to ignore these differences and to associate the naitet Mafia, with any criminal organization whose nembership was in whole or in part of . 375 ...

Indeed, .the tendency has arisen to 75 .\u00b7\u00b7~ use the term, in itsloose sense, to refer toan1_cr:ilnr)inal organi:wtio:h: a study by Frcmcis A. J.

In the minds 'of many, Hennessey's de.ath becc:une a symbolic event, not ~rely a historical occurenrce . 377 The'tradi:t;.io~l view, of course, used the Maf;ia el:enent and the consequent '~Pl.lrity of i.n~ntions\" to justify the. conduct of <' ', ' ' ,:, , the lynch mob~ Judqe Robert H.

' I the lynchers. In general,. rrodem writers have .tended to accept uncritically the official view, at least on th~ existence of t,he IVafia, as witt1ess .Herbert Asbury's The French Qu~r, in Reid' s Mafia, in 1952, ~d F'reC!erick Sondem,. Jr.'s BrotherhoOd of Evil, in 1959. There developed, however, a revisionist strain. Seeing events chiefly from the perspective of the victims, and emphasfzing the social ' ,' ' and econanic f~ctors, including .the undeniable presence of bigotry, , L '' ' 'WOrks, such as G. Schiavo's The Truth AbOut the ~fia, in 1962, Henner Hess's Mafia and Nafiosi, in 1970, Joseph L. Albini's .The .Arnt&rican Genesis of aLe end, in 1971, and Richard Gambino's Vendetta,. in 1977, attempted to argue that there was noorganizatiori--Ma ~a o ' othe:r:--at wo;rk i.rl \u00b7the assassination of Hermessey.

What was present was a social system characterized by patronage--the relationship }Jetweein a patron and a client--and no-t an organization. 'l'hese writers were on sound ground wheri they showed that rrore than the Mafia played a role in the events of 189'1, but their effort to rule out the existence of an organization was strained--~d 379 obviously so. It is impossible not to take note, for example, of the\u00b7. , ~-' 1 . h. h Th. . h. . t d .th 1c A 1n1 \u00b7 accepte 1n 1s s u y e historical existence of the \"Molly Maguirc=s,\" an Irish secret sociE;!ty~-an organization-.....,that terrorized the anthracitecoal operators in the 1860s. and 1870s in Pennsylvania. It stands in sharp .contrast to Albini's effort to explain away all evidence--however direct and concrete--of the similar existence of an organization among criminals who happened to be of Italian extraction. 4. The Foundation of the National Syn(iicate That there was in ~istence a national syndicate prior to Prohibition, however, may be doubted. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence outside of New Orleans that thereV{ere various independe:t;1t Ma.fia groups in a number of major American citiies. In 1903, Nicola Gentile, a native of Siciliana, Sicily, finding littl~ opportunity in his native village, cane to the United States as a youth of 18.382 After a r!c>t'eer :i'1 organized crine, he returned to Sicily ll~ 1937, hav1ng been charged w1th a narcotics violat1on 1n New Orleans, . 383 where he jtllTped bail. In the 1950s, following his. retirenent, he began writing a long, rambling naroir in Italian entitled Vita di Carrp.rrafia, which was published in \u00b7~ in 1963. Gentile wrote: ~\u00b7\u00b7. li I /' ' ' All_organizatiqns are born with principles and humanitarian goals, but in their midst the. op\u00ad portunists a:re never missing and will try to\u00b7 make a profit.....

With the passing in every [najor?] city ot Nncrica these ass<)Ciations were Gentile, as well as Joseph Valachi, as a witness, a national syt~icate was apParently formed in the ye~s immediately before Gentile's return to Sicily.. The. eyewitness accounts of Gentile and Valachi--having all the elenents of a Florentine ;intrigue of the 16th century--have been independently substantiated by the reminiscences of other insiders, picked up on FBIbugs. a. The Castellamrnarese War In the 1920s, Giuseppe Masseria ruled a Mafia family in New York City that rn:uubered among its rrembers three o:f the nost. familiar narres in the annals of organized crime: Charles Luciano, Vito Genovese, Frank Costello. One of the reasons that the namas were to becorre synonyrrous with. crime itself was the part the. three rren played in a conflict between. 1-lasseria and Salvatore Maranzano, who arrived in New York i;n 1927, and pranptly founded a Mafia family. to ~ival .Masseria' s. 385 The conflict was called the Castellaimla.rese War, since Maranzano and many of his followers were natives of the Sicilian town of Castellamnare del Golf 386 Oth f. . f Ch. '11 k \u00b7\u00b7o. er Ma J.a. groups rom 1cago, as we as New Yor , were also drawn into conflict. ]\\llied with Masseria were a family headed by Steve Ferrigno, a boss from .the Bronx (Ferrigno would be succeeded by the Mangano brothers, Philip and Vincent, then by Umberto (Albert) 78 I' 1\\na~>t Chicago. Muranzano cqmmanded the loyalty of a Mafia \u00b7family headed by Profaci, a boss from Brooklyn \u00b7\u00b7succeeded by\u00b7 Magliocco, then by Joseph family in Chicago. . . 387 Valachi renanbered how the war went. Masseria had another .Mafia boss, Gaetano Reina, killed on F'ebruary 26, 1930, when l~ina resisted Masseria' s efforts (unrelat<:..>d to. the war) \u00b7to rrove in on l~ina' s ice ' distribution racket. Masseria: forced the Reina family to accept as its boss Joseph Pinzolo, who in turn .was killed on September 9, 19301 and succeeded by Gaetano Gagliano (Gagliano died of natural causes in 1953 and was succeeded by Gaetano Lucchese, better known as 'lhauas Lucchese) ~ Valachi was inducted into the old Reina frunily when Pinzolo was its boss, and Maranzano himself presided over the induction ritual. ',Joseph Bonnanno, who was later to succeed ~!Jaranzano as boss, was made Valachi' s godfather, or gorrbah. \"At the t:i.ma, 1' Valachi said, \"I don't know nothing about all this, but. the idea was to bring in new m=mbers like rre ' . 388 that they could count on to help .. them.\" Valachi' s first assignment was to watch Ferrigpo. recalled: At the t.irce I'm just \"proposed\" --\u00b7 rreaning.

Then he rasped back hoarsely. \"Cosa Nost:;ra! so you know. abdut it.\" It is Valachi \"ever intended to become a full-fledged 1410 defc.>ctor,' \u00b7. but Flynn had the good sense not to treat him as though he. had. As Salerno noted: 83 ' ;.,,,\u00b7 .,,, I. .\u00b7,.~ [Flyrm] talked to him, argued with him, reminisced, listened. Sorret.i.Ires he. saw that Valachi was with\u00ad drawn, and he would drop the subject of Cos~ Nost.ra for that day. Somet.i.Ires he would pretend to get .:mgry and call Valachi. a lying son of a bitch or try 411 to provol~e him into r:evealing more .to jus\u00b7tify himself. Valachi in short was \"handled.\" Flynn's key advantage over V~lachi~ however, was the result of intelligence obt.ained by the FBI. electronic stuveillance program. And an analysis of \u00b7tne transcripts of the surveillance confirms the authenticity \u00b7of the narre, J...a. Cosa Nostra. FBI File 92-6054., whiqh contained. .. the basic intelligence collected by the Bureau on \u00b7the national . syndicate of organized crilre, was originally entitled \"'lllie' Criminal Cormri.ssion. n412 .As. early as September 1959, the bug in Gus Alex's tailor shop in Chicago had picked up a conversation between Sam Giancana and Anthony Accardo, in which a \"Carmission\" was discussed. 413 Giancana reviewed its nanbership, in addition, to himself: Rayrrond Patriarca of Providence, Stefano Magaddino of. Buffalo, Joseph Zerilli of Detroit, Joseph Idc:1. of Philadelphia, Sebastian John LaRocca Jo5eph New York City. Once the surveill-ance program was expanded under the Kennedy Administration, agents began tb develop a nore sophisticated awareness of what they were liste.J;ling to, a .thought proeess that can be t:raced in the file, particularly in theadministrative nEnoranda, in which the agents disc\\lssed. the possible meaning of different wor&=:, 415 I ' '' ' I Initially, for example, agents listening to a conversation in Philadelphia on Pebn1.ary 11, 1962, mistakenly thought they were ' ' 416 overhearing \"La Causa Nostra,\" and the. file was renarred accordingly ' 417 ' on January 16, 1963. , On July 1, 19631 the semiannual su.rmarj! of the status of the intelligence program gave several .. variations of the. name 1 84 ., including Lc.1 :Cosa Nostra, La Causa Nostra and Onorata Societa.

According toGentile, who was ~re, the comuission fm:ned in Chicago consisted of Luciano, Profaci, Bonnanno, Gagliano and Vincent Mangano of New York, Capone of Chi~ago and Ftank Milano of Cleveland. 426 Little by little, the other Mafia families soon ' ,\u00b7 .

James J. Hines, the powerful politidll bc>ss frbm the West Side of Manhattan, a Roosevelt supporter, was also there, accompanied by Frank Costello.. 'l'hey stayed together at the\u00b7 Drake Hotel, 431 where several floors down, Luciano himself \u00b7was. ensconced in the. entourage of ~rt c. Marinelli, the Tarrmany Hall leader., who was pledged to Alfred E. Smith, the fonrer Mayo~ of New York and unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1928. t-1eyer Lansky, too, was. at \u00b7the Dem:)cratic Convention. While political influence wc;:ts i.rrportant, r .. . a. Ricfu:frd \"DlX~e'' DavJ,.s, a corrupt lawyer who represented Dutch Schultz; described the new order of the underworld. in a series. of articles for Colliers in 1939. 433 After noting the .new \"system of alliances, ... Davi.s .wondered at the s]<ill .. which . , ' Hank Messick has suggested, that the alliances desc:.;:ibed by Davis, which had apparently been agreed upan at a ~eting in the spring of 1934, in I~uciano' s. yvaldorf Towers' apartment, constituted a national . . 434 syndicate, of which the Mafia was only a part~ According to r-1essick, the Ma\u00b7fia leaders involved in the syndicate, called tlte \"combination,\" were \"nore as parb1e1.\u00b7s . than as leaders of a separat~ entity. n435 Messick wrote that the Mafia figures referred to this nation~a syndicate as the \"combiheesh [sic] .\"436 He also alleged that as Luciano was c;lbout to go to prison for canpulsory prostitution, he issued an order to his Mafia subordinates: \u00b7 \"Coope~ate with Meyer,\" ~an~ng LanSky, woo then became the leader. of the syndic:~te.437 It is questionable, however, whether Luciano possessed the po.ver to transfer his authority to Lansky or anyone else. And, if Angelo DeCarlo, a caporegi.na in the Genovese family, can be believed, Messick was mistaken. ()n October 17, l961, DeCarlo was reminiscing about \"the good old days\" with several other rrembers of the Genovese family, as the FBI was listening: 438 \"In the good old days,. they did it the right way,\" said one man. \u00b7 \"You bet your life, il DeCarlo agreed. \"'roday they 1 re talked about like everyone knowns.

'l'he services of Murder, Inc. , however, were not . 442 for h~re. The work was done exclusively on retainer, and the Mafia was its exclusive client. \u00b7\u00b7 Luciano, for example, would issue a contract to Joe 1\\clonis, who wot.dd pass it on \u00b7to Albert Anastasia, the Mafia's. contact with Murder, Inc. Thus, Luciano was twice renoved frau the killer. As Burton B. Tarkus, the District Attorney who prosecuted the leaders of. Murder, Inc. , observed: \" [A] sustain rackets.\" made another point .about organized crime investigation. \"[T]here is,\" he said, \"only one way organized crime can be cracked, Unless sareone on the inside talks, youcan investiga-te forever and get nowhete. n444 (3) Prostitution Apparently, a major aspect of Luciano's was organized QO i' Manhatum, Bronx, Brooklyn, and Quecr~s, he ran 200 houses arid over 1, 000 \u00b7girls, all. of which a.hnual h1.s role as a PJ.mP. \u00b7 \"I dOn't like the racket,\" he confided to one of his nadahls, Florence. \"Cokey TI'lo\" Brown. \"'l'here' s not enough in it for the risk we take.\" 'lhe girls who ~orked for him had their compUtint.s, too~ When Luciano was finally brought to trial, t.estiiiDny indicat.cd that ypany of them had been kicfuapped, hooked on he;r-.oin, \u00b7re\"f,e;at.edly raped, and after their will ', ' ' .

Dewey, then a special prosecutor for New York County, saw a chance :to make an unassailable case against Luciano.44~ Three telephones were tapped fran January 11, 1936, to February 1, 1936.450 Ovet 100 prostitutes and their managers were arrested, and they soon began . t6 talk, since there was safety in nurrd:>er~. One of the wox;ren at the trial told what happened to those who talked: \"r' know what happened to\u00b7 girls who \u00b7had talked about the cQnbination. The soles of their feet and their stomachs .were burned. by cigar butts n451\u00b7. On April 1, 1936, Luciano was indicted on 90 counts of compulsory prostitution~ He was arrested in Hot Springs, . and returrieq to New York . . ribncn \u00b7 j.uiy s\\.li[JTla.I'ized the prosecution's.cc:~.se: \\ ' ' ' ' ,,.,,' 'I'h.e vice industry, since Luciano took over, is highly organized and operates with business\u00ad like precision.

Even the spirited defense of one of Luciano's lawyers, George \"Morton Levy, could not overcone the c..'Ulnulative effect ()f the testim:>ny.. The hi~ point pf the trial was Dewey's cross examination of Luciano, who, though he ~ed \u00b7 any\u00b7 coni1E;!ction with prostitution, could not explain the source of the inc~that.supported his exper1sive life style. Faced with his tax returns for 1929 to 1935 .. . ' . ' ' ' which sh~-Jed .that he had never declared 1rore. than $22,.500 on an annual ' . ' . returp, Luciano was reduced to stamnering. 453 Dewet. also pointe~ly questioned Luciano about a r~co~d of his long dist~C\u20ac!. phOne calls to reputed organiz~d crime .figures, as the case Dewey pr~sented against \u00b7. Luciano went beyond the prost:J.tution charges for which he was beihg tried. 454 . cOnvict Lucian(.), Dewey told the jury, or \"say tp the world ru1d the public that the base gangst~:r can go free. \"455 1he jury\u00b7. returned its guilty verdict on June 7, 1936. Justice Phillip J. McCook456 passed sentence on June l8: Charles Luciano, an intelligent, courageous and discriminating jury has\u00b7 found you guilty ....

[~re appears] no excuse for your conduct, nor hope for your rehabilitation.... \u00b7 The court imposed a staggering sentencing of 30 to 50 years imprisonment on a stunned, 38-year-old Luciano. Dr. L. E. Keinholz, the.psychiatrist \u00b7at \u00b7Sing Sing pri$on, who. examined Luciano aJfter his conviction, cli.d not disagree with the need for Luciano's incarceration. H~ found that Luciano was \"a dangerous individtial. . [who] sqould riOt be given too .J ( 4) Arthur Flegenheirt\u00a53r \u00b7 L4-ciano W(:IS not the only c>ne of his kind to feel the heat of Dewye' s wrathful determination. Arth(Jr Flegenheirner, called \"Dutch Schultz,\" had, by strong-arm tactics and a political fix he had secured . with James J. Hines, seized control of the numl;>ers raCket in Harlem fqr . - !157 ... l3lack ge:mgsters. From June 10 to October 29, 1936, Dewey had a tap on a phone in Hines' office from which ~he learned enough about the role of J. Rich;ird. Davis , Schultz s lawyer and his link to Hines, to persuade Davis to testify ag'ainsL n~l ..:!S, who was convicted and s~nt to prison. (5) Depor~ation Luciano was sent first to Sing sing and then to Clinton State Prison at bannerwra, in upstat~ New York, wher~ he becane inmate 92168 and went to work in the laundry. 458 He did not coma to public attention again until January 3, 1946, when Dewey, by t:h.et+ Governor of New York, fo~-warded an executive clerooncy ~ssage to the State Legislature, as required by the state constitution. The nessage459 recited Luciano's conviction, sentence and prison record; it noted that Luciano was . . \"~portable to Italy.\" The next to Last paragraph df the nessage would have far-reaching repercussions: Upon the entry of the United States into [World War II] , Luciano's aid was sought by tl:te .AJ:med Services in inducing others to prcwide informatim1 concerning possible enemy attack. 'It appears that he cooperated in such effort, a.ltbol lgh the . a.ct:nal value of the\u00b7. information \u00b7 procured is not clear. \u00b7 Luciano was paroled and released into the custody of the Inmigration .and Naturalization Servic~ for deportation. His. ship, the S .. S. La.ura Keene, was to set sail for Italy on Sunday, Febrllc1cy 11, 1946.460 Newpaper reporters attempting to interview Luciano aboard ship, on \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, J February 9, \\\"Jere blocked by a line of longshoremen am~ed with baling hpoks. Michael Minichino, an employee of the company that had charge of the pier, Universal Terminal Stevedoring Company, would later deny that ' ' he had seen ALbert Anastasia that day. In addition ,to being a r~u:iking Mafia n-ariber, Anastasia ran a local of the Internatioilal l.Dngshoremen' s Association. It was routine, Minichino said, not to peunit people on a .working pier. The newspapermen did not interview Luciano, but a going-away party was held fqr him and a select group of his friends that afternoon and evening. , , Among others,, Frank Costello attended. , The rrteal, coq.sisting of lobster, spaghetti ,and wine, was duly consumed, and the conversa,t~on among old, friends lasted into the night. On the following norning, at, 8:50 a.m., Luciano set sail for Italy, never to ' A. 461 retun1 to =ner~ca agam. The rumors of Luciano's services to the government, in World W.;1r II broke into print wh.et.i, in February 1947., Walter Winchell, the colurrni~t, wrote that Luciano was, going to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. 462 , The Army, Navy, and the Office of Strategic Services , th~ precursor ot the Central Intelligence,Agency, each fonually denied that Luciano had made any contribution to the war effort. A retired Naval intelligence officer, Conmander Charles Radcliffe H.affender, was quoted as saying there was substance to the story, but when he was called before the Kefauver comnittee on l1arch 15, 1951, at the t:i.r1'lf! it inq\u00a2red into the question, he changed hiq story, ~aying Lucianohad mad~ 110 , I,\u00b7\u00b7.\") reiterated to tl1e Kefauver conmittee their p~lic denials. But the ruuvrs would not be quieted. Then :in 1971, Meyer Lansky, who was thought to have played a , role in Luciano's \"patriotic service~,\" told, il.1. an interview .with the 94 : '.,' press in Israel, his version of the story. Lansky, who was under indictment on charges .related to sk:inrning .the p\u00b7rofits ()f a Las Vegas casino, was fighting. to remain in Israel and avoid standing trial. ' . 464 L<;tnsky said: When Italy enter~d the Second World War there was a feeling that sorre Italians are not patriotic enough.. Tne Ihtellig~nce \u00b7 Branch 9f ... the American Navy .was afraid that thOse Italians .. work:iJ:1g on the 'docl<s or Italia.Il fishennen using their.bo9-ts, might collaborate with the enemy .... Mr. Hogan [the New York prosecutor who. succeeded D~ey] called\u00b7.\u00b7 the layer [for J L.l~-.mo ... to if he be helpf-ul. \u00b7 [Frank Costello and.

[Luciano] was nuch respected in .. the labor unions ... ~ \u00b7 Lansky also suggested that he and I..uciano were of assistance in the allied invasion of Sicily, helping ~ gather intelligence fran :Sicilians living in the United States. 1here is good reason to be~ieve Lansky's versiOI1, de~pite the official denials. Dewey, incensed over attack ~ his :i.rltegrity, ordered the NE!W York Cormdssion on Investigation to \u00b7conduct an inquiry ' . into Luciano's release .that was, at the time, kept confidential, in order to secure the cooperation of the Navy. In 1977, however, estate released the relevant papers. It had been a thorough investigation: from J~ry 28 to September 17, 1954, 57 witnesses--Naval o~~icers, stateofficials and racketeers--filled 2,883 pages of testiloony transcript. 466 . In addition, the ccmnission had access to wiretap records fran DistJ;ict Attorney Frank Hogan's office, since Hogan had kept the operation under surveillance, leery of what , ' . . appeared to h:iin to be the Navy's naive readiness to work with racketeers.4q7 The wiretaps confirrrcd that the Navy had enlisted the cooperation of theM.a:tia in rrueh the way Lansky had outlined it to the press in Israel. Fearful of sa,botage and espionage along New York 1 s . sprawling waterfront and advised by\u00b7Joseph Lanza, a Mafia Ii-anber who \u00b7.ruled the Fulton Fish l1arket work force, that there was but one man who . could \"snap the whip in the enti\u00b7re\u00b7 unde-rworld,\" the Navy decided to seek .

' ' He also assisted in gathering intelligence and .roak~ contact with Mafia figures overseas in anticipation of the invasion of Sicily. Conmander Paul A. A1fieri, who landed in Sicily, was asked by the New York Cormrl.ssion if his .contacts in Sicily were nembers of th~ Mafia. He replied, \"Well they would never admit such, but fran my. investigative experience in New York City, I knew that they were. \"469 He added that he had developed the contacts out of the lllciano project and that they stood him in good stead. As best the New York Conmission could detemd.ne, the Mafia figures we:re ootivated purely by patriotism-- there was no quid pro guo, no preferential treatnent gr~ted \u00a5t .return. Lanza, for example, Who was under indictment for extortion when he agreed to cooperate, was prosecuted by Hogan, convicted and sent to prison.470 As .for Luciano, the U. S. government did all it could to keep .him confined, \u00b7once he had ' . ' ' been deported: it used its good offices. with the post-war Ital~an gov~mnent, which ba.crt:\"' ~ . iano from ROllE, Milan, the island of Sicily; and it thwarted a\u00b7 npve by Luciano to establish a base of . . operations in Cuba, advising President .Ramm ..

According to vJiacbi, 482 wheri Genovese .returned to Italy in 1937, he took $750,000, which was supplarented from time to tirr\u00a5:3 by Ama, who would corre to visit with her husband's share of racket profits in.$50,000, $60,000 and $100,000 :i.ncrenents.483 Apparently, eenovese used the m:mey, not only to live .lavishly, but to ingratiate . h:imself with leaders of the Fascist regime. According to Arma, he contributed $250,000 to the construction of a Fascist Party headquarter~ . in Nola.484 There was also have \u00b7. Cartr)ine Galante ml.1rder Carlo Tresca, the editor of an anti-Fascist. publication in New York, Il Martello, on January 11, 1943 .'85 . Mussolini himself expressed gratitude to Gene>vese by conferring on hi.rtt the title, comnendator. de Re, a civilian honor~ 486 99 ':\\ In 1944; the authorities in New York resumed their interest in the Boccia murder when Rupolo was released fran prison on parole and got mixed up in another shooting. 48'7 In an effort to avoid going back to prison, Rupolo told the Brooklyn Police that Genovese had been responsible for the Boccia murder, naming Peter LaTempa, a cigar store salesman, as a. witness who could verify his story, as corroboration is a prerequisite for conviction under .New York law. Based m1 the testimony of Rupolo and LaTempa, a new indict::ment against Genovese and three others was returned for the Boccia murder. 488 As the tide of battle tumed, leading to the surrender of Italy in September 1943, Genovese did a quick turnabout and signed on as an interpreter for the Allied Military Government.at Nola.489 He could not. . . . resist a temptation to revert to his old profession, however, and he was arrested on August 27, 1944, by Ot-~e C. Dickey, a special agent for Military Intelligence, for .running a black market syndicate. 490 While Genovese was in Dickey's custody, ~ offered him a $250,000 br:i,.be, which Dickey refused. Then, when Dickey leamed from a routine check with the FBI of the outstanding murder indictment in Brooklyn, he made arrangerrents to bring Genovese back. to the United States to stand trial. Genovese pressed his demands on Dickey. 491 \"Now, look, you are young,\" he told Dickey, who was 24. \"['f]here are things you don't understand This is the way it works. Take the mmey. . . . Nobody cares what you do. ref-used, Genovese and he told Dickey, ''You al:'e doing ne the biggest favor anyone has ever dOne. to me. You are taking\u00b7~ home. II Genovese knew SQm3thing that Dickey did not:.: LaTempa was being held in 100 protective custody at the Raymond Street Jail in Brooklyn. LaTempa suffered from gallstones, and on January 15, 1945, he took a prescription for pain. T11e city toxicologist later reported that he had been given a dosage of poison potent enough \"to kill eight horses.\"492 Genovese was returned to the United States on June 1, \u00b7 1945, but without LaTernpa' s corroborating testim:my he could not be convicted of the Boccia slaying, and he was released from custody .in the sumner of 1946. Assistant1ofstrict Attorney Julius Helfru1d told493 the court on June 11, 1946: Other witness~s who could have supplied the necessary corrqboration were likewise not avail.able because they were missing or t;\"efl.lsed to talk and tell what they knew of this crime because of their fear of Genovese ru1d the other bosses of the underworld, or [because they know] full well that to talk would mean their death. Rupolo, who was released from prison in 1949, was apparently \"forgiven\" for testifying against Genovese,494 since he had done hi.s jail tine on the Gallo assault in silence, but on August 27, 1964, his tightly bound corpse broke loose frorn concrete weights and came to the surface of Jamaica Bay. 495 Rupolo had been stabbed 11 tin)ICS and shot 6 times, though apparently his murder was unrelated to his test:linony ' ', . . against Genovese. He had had a run-in with members of the Profaci family,\u00b7who weretried for his killing, but acquitted.496 (3) Succession to Luciano\u00b7. In November 1946, . Luciano, his passport in order, made a surprise appearance in Havana and placed calls to New York, Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans to announce an important meeting.497 All the top Mafia figures ca111e:. Genovese, COstello, Anastasia, Accardo, Marcello,\u00b7 even Lansky, a power though not really a member. 498 It was the occasion for 101 ,,', I D Luciano to .P~lss the power to Genovese, although th~ succession did not conE to the attention of the authorities until 1949, when Costello, who had been acting boss of the familywhile Genovese was in Italy and in prison, hosted a dirmer at the Copacabana i.n Manhattan. John F. Shanley, Deputy Chief Inspector of the New York Police P~partment, tolct499 the McClellan corrmittee: Vito was met at the door by Costello and he was ushered in and he sat at the best place and this spread through the city in no time, that Vito had errerged. But Genovese was not satisfied. According to Valachi, he was angry I , . that others, while he was iri Italy, .had been allowed \"to sew up everything.\"SOO It would take' time, but Genovese was detennined to take action against a number of his associates, includ:iJ.1g Costello, in an .effort to enhance his position. First, however, he had a danestic problem to settle. ( 4) The Return ' (i) A Divorce While Genovese was in Italy, Anria had run the Italian lottery for him, while livi.ng in lu:x.ury at 29 Washington Square West in Manhattan, one floor above the apart:lnent of Eleanor Roosevelt. 501\u00b7 When Genovese returned to the United StC;ltes, he and Anna mved to a $75,000 mansion on Skyline Drive in Atlantic Highlands, N.J. , on which, Anna sq.id, Genovese spent another $350, 000 for renoVations and furnishings. 502 \u00b7 Altheugb. they \"lived very high,\" as Arma would later testify, marriage was hardly 503 Acl!OJ ... '-' ..... 16 to Arma, Genovese beat her to the point that she feared fe>r her life, and he was involved with other women. In December 1952, Anria filed for dl:vorce in Freehold, N~J., 04 County .seat. 5 Anna's testilrony at the hearing caused a sensation and 102 :.J I it provided un unusual insight into the lifestyle of an ~rican gcmg::;ter, who::;c fortune the Bureau of Narcotics would estimate ll\"l 1960 to be $30 million. 505 AccordiJ.1g to Aru-uL, Genovese took in $20,000 to $30,000 a week from the Italian lottery. \"I know, .. \" she said,506 \"because I myself .. \" Their house, she ad~d, \"had 24-carat gold and platinum dishes. Our silve:r:ware was the best IIDney could buy. \"507 Their persunal wardrobes were equally impressive, considering 1952 mink coat, $250 suits and $60 shoes.508 Genovese funds least $500,000 in one safedeposit Lox in Switzerland.509 Yet between .1952 and 1956, Genovese declared between $7 000 and $15,000 in taxable annual :incam ~ 510 Though he denied all this wealth, the court ordered h~ to pay $300 a week alimony and $1,500 . . 511 court costs. Thereafter, Genovese reverted to the ways of his early Mafia ancestors, foregoing the opul~t style that was a hallmark of latter-day Anerican gangsters. He rented a $100-a-month bungalow at 68 West Highland Avenue in Atlantic Highlands; he drove a two-year-old Ford; and he reduced his wardrobe to not IIDre than 10 suits, none of which cost IIDre than $100.512 On the dusty top of a dresser in his b~droom stood cheap plastic statues of saints. His children and eight grandchildren visited h~ frequently, and he personally cooked spaghetti for them. 513 He told51 L~ his neighbors he had to IIDve \"to pay the alimony.\" He told515 his friends, \"Forget the high living.\u00b7 It' 11 put you in jail if you are not careful.\" Valachi recalled516 the divorce proceedings: \"Nobody could didn't do anything about her.\" Apparently, Genovese still had affection for Anna. \"[W]hen we ... were in (the Federal prison \u00b7' at] Atlanta, ... he would sane times talk about her, and I would see the 103 J ', !.', tears rolling down lus Ln~::et-. ... ,\" Valachi said. 517 \"I couldn't believe it.\" Anna's associates were not so forttmate. On June 19, 1953, when Arma was about to be called before a New Jersey grund jury, Steven Franse, her partner in the 82 Club, a Greenwich Village night club, was found strangled. 518 It was, Valachi indicated, 519 a ~aming to Arma. to keep quiet, and she took the hint.\u00b7 She told the grand jury that she knew nothing, and if she ever did, she had forgotten it. (ii) A Rival Ftank Costello, who Genovese considered his principal rival, was having his OWI.l problems. 520 He had been convicted of , contempt of Congress as a .result of his performance as a witness before the Kefauver comnittee. His appeals exhausted, he started serving an 18-m:mth tenn on August 22, 1952, but with t:i.ne off for good behavior he was released on October 29, 1953. In April 1954! Costello was back in court on an income tax evasion charge. 521 Internal Revenue agents had carefully canpared his expenditures with his declared income and found a $51,095 discrepency over a four year period. With the test:i.Ioony of 144 witnesses and 500 documents, the gove~nt was able to show an unexplained increase in Costello's net worth. \u00b7 The verdict was never in doubt, and after extensive appeals, Costello went back to prison on May 14, 1956.522 He brought a new lawyer into his case, however--the noted defense\u00b7 cotu1sel, Edward Bennett Williams of Washington, who \u00b7entered a new appeal and got Costello out on bail, after he had. served only 11 \u00b7 m::mths of his five-year tenn, 523 Inmediately, Costello returned to his nonnal routine; rwmings hoLding court at the Waldorf-Astoria; afternoons at the Biltm:.>re steam room; and evenings dining out. 524 104 ' I .\u00b7 (iii) 11le Costello Attempt On May 2, 1957, Costello\u00b7 ate diru1er at the. fashionable Marthattan restaurant, L'Aiglon. 525 At about 11 p.m., he returned to the Majeotic Apartuents at 115 Central Park West~ where he maintained an apartment . . As he entered the foyer, a fat, flabby-looking man in a .dark suit with his hat pulled down shuffled past him. His hand ce:;une out of his pocket. It held a gun. \"'lhis is. for you, Frank,\" he yelled. 526 He then fired one shot point blank at Costello's head and fled. Wounded, but not seriously, Costello was rushed to Roosevelt Hospital. 527 \u00b7 As he lay in. bed, New York detect~ve~:~ .i.n ... mtoried the contents of his pockets. They found $3, 200 in cash and a cryptic nqte: \"Gross Casino Win as of 4-27-57--$651,284.\"~28 District Attom~y'Frauk Hogan's office, with the help of the Nevada Gambling Control Board and Aaron Kohh of the New Orleans Metropolitan Crime Caunissi9n, determined that ~e figure matched. the house take at the New Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas.529 Costello apparently had a hidden interest in a Nevada casino, despite the. supposedly strict oversight by the state of Nevada of the ownership of its casinos. Costello declined to explain the note, nor was he helpful as to the identity of his would ... be-assassin. \"I didn't see nuthin' , \" he said. 530 As.ked why anyone would want to kill him, he\u00b7 replied, \"I haven't an enemy in the world. \"531 His assassin was, however' identified frcm a description the doorman provided: he was Vincent Gigante, a soldier in the Genovese family. Valachi later confirmed that Gigante had been given the contract on Costello by Genovese. He had practiced for the hit, Valachi said, in a Greenwich Village basement, though it apparently did little good. 532: Neverthe~ess, Costello testified at Gigante's trial that he had never 105 ~. seen the man\u00b7 before, ar::.l :~ , \u00b7mte was acquitted.533 Costello took. the hint and let it be known that he was retiring from the rackets . The f:iJ.1al ruling on his tax case was handed down in October 1958; it went against Costello, despite the legal\u00b7work.of the famed Edward Bennett Williams. 534 He returned to prison and was not relea~ed until June 1961. The goverrmmt then made an\u00b7 effort to denaturalize and deport him. A spokesman535 for the Italian gove~nt aptly observed: Italy should not be expected to carry the bur~n of a man who was born in Italy, lived l:tere only a short time, and then spent .tmst of his life in the United States. It's\u00b7not blood that makes a man a criminal; it's society, and we definitely do not want to pay for such men. The Supreuie. Court intervened in February 1961, and Costello was not deported. On February 7, 1973, while sitting in his Central Park West apartment, Costello suffered a mild\"heart attaCk. He was hospitalized at Doctors Hospital on East End Avenue and 87th Street. Apparently, Costello thought he would recover, for he sent word through a friend that he would let Peter Maas, the writer, prepare his biography. At 7:30 a.m. on February 18, however, he suffered a fatal coronary. ( iv) The Anastasia Murder As explanation for. the assault on Costello to the rest of the underworld, Genovese let it be known that Costello had been,talking to the government, a rationale that AlbertAnastasia, for one, did not . 536 . accept. \u00b7 No one was safe, Anastasia argued, if Genovese could order Costello's execution witboiut the prior approval of the national c0lllllission.537 Anastasia's fears were well-founded. At about 10.:15 on the tmrtli.ng of October 25, 1957, Anastasia, accompanied by two bodyguards, strolled into the barber shop of the 106 .\u00b7~\u00b7 ,, Park-Sheraton Hotel at Seventh Avenue and 56th Street in Manhattan. 538 He seated himself in chair 11tllTber four, loosened his tie and closed his. eyes for the last t~. As his barber, Joseph Bocchino, covered hi~ face with a hot towel, the bodyguards disappeared, and two other llEl walked in from the hotel lobby, strode up behind chair nurrber four and fired . 32 and . 38 caliber bullets into Anastasia's head and body, literally blasting him out of the chair. The high executioner. of Murder, Inc. had himself be.en executed. Several independent soU+ces purported to give in.side information about the Anastasia IIlLli\"der. Sidney Slater, who operated a B-girl bar on East 55th Street for Joseph Gallo, an organized crime figure, told District Attorney Frank Hogan's office that shortly after it occurred, the murder became a running topic of conversation for Gallo and four of his henchrren. \"From now on Sidney,\" Slater quoted Gallo as having said, \"you can just call the five of us the barbershop quintet. \"539 Vincent Teresa, a soldier in the Mafia family of Raymond Patriarca of Providence, told 'Ihanas Renner, his biographer, that while Gallo set up the nurder, the actual killers were imported from Patriarca territocy and that Gallo had received the contract fran Anthony Strollo, . Genovese's 540 underboss, and Cannine Lonbardozzi, an Anastasia soldier, had been involved in the conspiracy. A slightly different version was provided by Peter Diapoulos, one of Gallo's bodyguards. He told an author, Steven Linakis, 541 that the contract cane through Joseph Profaci to the Ga1los (Joseph Gallo and his brothers), and they were ''made,\" that is, founally accepted into La Cosa Nostra, as a result of the hit. Finally, according to Valachi., the nurder was principally a Genovese- 542 Gambino conspiracy for the sake of power. . 107 I None of the versions was f:undalientally inconsistent with another, and they all were in agreement that Genovese was ult~tely responsible for Anastasia 1 s death. It was evident, however, that they all r~flected . partial and superficial explanatiOn of a canplex event~ Valachi 1S account, in particular, had to be seen as incanplete and distorted by an anti-Genovese bias. .To be sure, Genovese 1 s m:>tiv~tion could have. been read as a s~le thirst for power, but the involvemmt of other major figures --Patriarca and, apparently, Santo Trafficante, Jr. --indicated \\ ' 1\\ ' that the murder of Anastasia had the support o\u00a3 others within the ' ,, \u00b7, organization and was rooted .ih reasons that went beyond the personal arrbitions of Genovese and Ganbino. Those reasons would be learned, however, if for no other reason than Genovese would be called on to justi.fy to the heads of the other Mafia families the killing. of Anastasia. Anastasia's complaint, after all, Wc;lS m:>re pertinent than ever: no one was safe was reqtiired to follow proper . . . procedure. (v) \u00b7 The Apalachin Meeting According to Robert Kennedy, when he testified. before the McClellan coomittee ili September 1963, the principal purpose of the Apalachin meeting .in November 1957 was to permit Genovese to. explain to the other leaders of I..a Cosa Nostra the assault on Costello arid .the nurder of Anastasia. 543 r.enovese. had. wanted to hold the n;eeting in Chieag~. \"Vito wanted to gc;> to Chicago. Stefano Magaddino talked him into going to Apalachin. Vito never stopped beefing about it, II Valachi told the coomittee. 544 Genovese 1 s case against Anastasja could not be bas~d merely on \"personal ambition.\" There had to be reasons that ~uld 1 . \u00b7 545 carmand general support witlUn La Cosa Nostra. According to Valachi, 108 ' '.: Anastasia was killed because he had been selling Cosa Nostra memberships to unfit applicants for up to $40,000, when the ''books were open\" in 1~54, after having been closed since 1931. This hardly seened sufficient to warrant an unauthorized execution of a family boss, and it was a good illustration of Valachi' s limited ur'lderstanding of the Anastasia nrurder. Far IIDre significant, it appeared, was Anastasia's attempt to IIDVe in on the gambling operations in Cuba, which belonged, in large treasure, t;:p Santo Trafficante. In fact, there apparently was a showdown treeting in Anastasia's suite. at the Warwick Hotel on October 24, 1957. Trafficante, who was registered in the hotel as \"B. Hill,\" checked out an hour or two after Anastasia was gt.nliled down in the barber shop a few blocks away the next IIDming. 546 Even Anastasia nust have realized that there was too nuch at stake in Havana for it to be given up without a fight. (vi) Hava.n.a Gambling Irt 1957, there were two ways to reach Havana from the United States --by car or by air.547 By car, the traveller first felt the Cuban atloosphere at Key West, a bad translation, say the Cubans, of Cayo Hueso, which treans ''bone key.\" There, while still on U. S. soil, a Cuban customs inspector thoroughly went over the car. \"There is a revolution in Cuba,\" he would say. \"No guns; no armrunitionl No 548 explosives.\" Then, the car was carefully driven aboard a ferry that looked like a warti.ma l.ST for the trip to Havana. By air, the tine was less than five hours from New York and inexpensive--$180.80 rotmd trip first class, $137 tourist.549 Flight ti.ma from Miami was only about an hour, and the rotmd trip was $36 first class. By sea, the first glimpse o:f Cuba was the 350.,.year-old Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro, .or 109 Morro Castle, imposing from where it stood on a point to the left of the narrow entrance to Havana Harbor. By air, the traveller's first close-up view, after scanning the white beaches and the city itself, was Rancho Boyeros International Airport, later renamed for Jose Marti, the hero of the revolution against Spain. The visitor to the Cuba of Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar,, the onetfue colonel who eventually made himself a president, was struck by the salubrious climate, a mean annual temperature of 76 degrees, and the beauty of Havana, although for those who looked beyond the sightseeing routes, there was grim poverty. Havana had three principal sections then: the old city, the densely settled subdivisions, and the suburbs. 550 The old n.a.rrow streets of the business section of the city connected with the Avenida del Puerto, which, with a width varying from 50 to 125 feet, rrerged at the Prado (properly called the Pase de Marti) into the Malecon, or sea wall, a wide boulevard which skirted the sea and city, furnishing a colorful route extending well out into the westem suburbs. At the point where the Prado intersected the Malecon, the genteel shabbiness of once magnificent hones continued westward ' ' ' until the newer and m::>re fashionable Vedado section appeared. On a bluff where the city proper joined the Vedado, with the long sweep of the l-1alecon on one hand and the m::>Ill.llrent to the battleship, Maine, and the Parque del Maine on the other, . stood the magnificent Hotel Naciona,l de Cuba, built in the late 1920s, with its deep-carpeted gaming roan, the Casino Parisien. Beyond Vedado were the then newer and m::>re pretentious suburbs, including Marianao.. Marianao had its fine h~s, its country clubs, the Yacht Club, Priental Park Race Track and the Tropicana, which was one of the largest and m::>st elaborate night clubs 110 i'\" J .. .. I J\u00b7\u00b7 ... t. in the world. 551 . There was another club of comparable size and splendor --the Sans Souci. Each featured spectacular stage presentations and full-scale casino ganbling, with expensive chandeliers, brocade draperies, and a mink stole clientele. The est:irna.ted v.;tlue to Cuba o\u00a3 tourism associated with the high life of the casinos in 1958, the l~st year before the success of the revolution, was $60 million. The ugly reality behind the creation of these casinos, and others just as lavish, was an important ep;i.sode in the .annals of organized cr~. In 1937, Meyer Lansky had, according to Hank Messick, acquired the garrbling concession in the Hotel Nacional. The war, however, inten::upted business, as .Messick noted in Silent Syndicate, 552 quoting Lansky: \"We stopped when the war broke out because after that there weren 1 t any boats, ... [a] nd at that t~ you didn 1 t enough planes.\" 1 'You can 1 t live,\" Lansky added, \"fran the Cuban people themselves .\"553 When Batista returned to power in 1952, Lansky and his partners in cr:i.rre were not far behind. On June 29, 1962, Angelo DeCarlo wistfully renenbered for an FBI bug how it had been tmder. Batista: \"[T]he rob had a piece of every joint dowr:l there,\" he said. \"There wasn 1 t one joint they didn ~ t have a piece of. \"554 Knowing the value of legalized garrbling to a gove~t willing to exploit it, Batista had changed the Cuban laws to attract the gambling industry and to create for himself a lucrative source .of illicit incooe. In.1955, casino gambling was pennitted in any nightclub or hotel worth $1 million or mre. 555 The Cuban \u00b7government agreed to match investment IIDney or find Cuban organizations that would. 556 The license fee would cost only $25 '000 plus 20 per cent of the profits. The word in the tmdenvor ld was that the licenses in reality cost $250,000 tmder the table to Batista and his 111 friends. 557 Import duties, usually as high as 70 per cent., were waived on building materials, and pit bosses, stic~n, and dealers were made eligible for two-year instead of \u00b7 si.x-nonth visas. 558 N~ casino hotel canplexes sprang up. Lansky built the Hotel Havana Riviera on the Malecon for $14 million, 559 at least $6 million of which was provided by gov~rrarvan~-controlled. banks; Dino and Eddie. Cellini, both organized crine figures from Ohio, ran the casino. 560 Most of the $24 million for \u00b7 the 630 roan, 30 story Havana Hilton catre fran Pension and' welfare :funds of Cuba 1 s Cooks and ~artenders Union.561 Beyond Havana, at Varo Daro Beach, the Hotel International was built. In adaition, old casinoswere taken over by organized cr~ figures Jake Lansky, Meyer 1 s brother, managed the gamb~ing operations at the .Hotel Nacionale; whose 'principal owners were, in addition to Meyer Lansky, three s)'I;1Clicate gamblers fran Cleveland, Morris Dalitz, S~ Tucker and Thanas J. McGinty. 562 \u00b7 Emest Hemingway 1 s daughter, Maria, described563 the Hotel Nacional. as the .. 564 \"place for gambling\" in Batista 1 s Cuba. . . It had, she sa1.d: Plenty of bars, a staff that never changed and always renanbered you, good rrusic, first class entertai.rm:mt, and that great t~rrace upsta4\"s looking out to the gardens with thei~ palms, the Malecon, the sea and the sky. \u00b7 Santo Trafficante, Jr. owned substanti.fil interests in the San Souci, a nightclub and casino where fellow-racketeer John Roselli\u00b7 had a manage.rrent. role;\u00b7 the Hotel Capri, in whic::h Gharles .Taurine of the Genovese family also had a share, and where George Raft, the roovie star, was a f:requent visitor; the old Hotel GOI111Ddoro; and the spanking new Havana Hilton. 565 As for the Tropicana, where .the lavish casino was as rruch a tourist attractiOn as the ciancing-girl extravaganza, it was managed by .Hartin and Pedro Fox for Batista 1S brother-in-law, Roberto ll2 1 .. Fernandez y Miranda, who also had a 1mnopoly on the slot machines throughout Cuba. 566 In tenns of criminal activity, there was roore to the casino operations in Havana than bribery for the purpose of obtaining licenses. The exact dimensions of the skbn, that is, the theft of casino profits to avoid taxes, was not docuriEnted, but it could be at least partially inferred from one incident. In Septenber 1958, Jake Lansky arrived in Miami fran. Cuba, where Customs thoroughly searched hbn, a departure from its usual routine, and found $200, 000 in cash and $50,000 in checks. Lansky said the rooney was for deposit at the Bank of Miami. \u00b7\u00b7 That explanati~ was appropriate enough for the checks, but the usual procedure was, as Hank MessiCk noted in Silent Syndicate, for the cash to flow the other way to replenish the bank at the casino, since patrons wanted to be paid off in dollars, not pesos. The inference was .. inescapable: the $200,000 represented skim. 56 7 In a report issued for 1958, the Cuban National Council of Econcmy noted that while 27 , 000 Cubans were employed in gambling, 5,000 lived by begging, and another 11 500 1. d b . . 568 Ha . vana, \u00b7 m s ort, was a full-service vice capital, owned and run by the roob, whose principal representative there was Santo Tratficante, Jr. Santo Trafficante, Jr., born in Tampa, Fla., on November 14, 1914, was the .namesake of a Mafia leader who had c~ fran Sicily\u00b7 in 1904 and was described by the Kefauver ccmnit:tee as \"a reputed leader in Tampa 569 for roore then 20 years.\" A sign that Tampa was a big-t~ Mafia city was the presence of two of the elder Trafficante 1 s associates, Joseph Baglichi and Ignazio Italiano, at a meeting at the Hotel .Statler in Gleveland oh December 5, 1928. They were aJ;Tested in a police raid 113 along with 21 other praninent gangsters fran across the co\\ID.try, including Pasquale Lolordo of Chicago, the president of the Unione Siciliana, and his associate, Giuseppa Gi\\ID.ta (Lolordo and Gi\\ID.ta were later nurdered by Al Capone personally), and three of Luciano's lieutenants fran New York, Joseph Magliocco, Joseph Profaci and Vincent Mangano. When Santo Trafficante, Sr., died on August 11, 1954570 Santo, Jr. , one of six sons, succeeded to the leadership of the T~a organized crinl= family, whose principal activities were narcotics trafficking and gambling, both casino gambling and bolita, a Cuban version of nunbers. 571 He had been well-schooled. He had r\\ID. the bolita for his father and had extended his own operation to Havana, where he acquired the Sans Souci from Gabriel Mannarino, an \\ID.denvorld figure fran Pittsburgh.572 Trafficante's status in organized crime was clearly recognized on J\\ID.e 4, 1955, at the marriage of Joseph Profaci's daughter, Carmella, to Anthony Tocco, the son of William Tocco, a Mafia leader in Detroit. 5 73 The reception, at the Hotel COIIIIDdore in Manhattan, gave law enforcemant an opport\\ID.ity to observe the deference paid to Trafficante. Trafficante had, however, evidently cloaked his interests well. The T~a police told the McClellan coomittee on October 15, 1963, that they knew of \"no legitimate businesses owned or controlled by [him].\"574 ''His house, autambile, and all The_ Tampa police also described for the McClellan committee the record of gangland violence in Tampa since 1928.576 Of the 23 known slayings, only one had resulted in a conviction. In contrast, from 1958 through 1962, 228 other nurders occurred, only four of which were not solved. Not everyone agreed with the picture of Trafficante that was painted for 114 the McClellan carmittee. His wife of 25 year~, Josephine, told a Tarnpa Tribune reporter on October 16, 1963, that the testimony about organized cr:i.ne in Tampa was \"trash.\" Pressed on related matters, however, she conceded that her husband had ''made quite a bit of m::mey while he was in Havana. \"577 Allegedly retired, Trafficante himself, who divided his time between a large, comfortable home at 2505 Bristol Avenue, in Tampa, and a nnre roodest concrete block bungalow at 523 N.E. 71st Street in Miami, was unavailable for c~nt. When Castro's revolution triumphed in 1959, the mob lost a major source of its revenue. In Castro's view, gambling was not in keeping \u00b7 with the ideals of the revolution. Initially, he closed the casinos, as part of what T:i.ne called a \"purification campaign. \"578 Then, faced with the unenployment of Cuban casino employees, he pennitted than to reopen, if they would make good on seven weeks back pay. It was Castro's plan to permit the casinos to operate under mobster management for 60 days, until clean ownership could be established. But the tourist trade dried up, and honest casino owners could not be found. . TinE quoted a ganbler who addressed Castro's .can run casinos,\" he said. ''You can't get a priest or a garage rrechanic. \"579 (5) Narcotics Another item on the agenda at Apalachin, apparently, was the continuing involvement of La Cosa Nostra in the narcotics traffic.580 According to Valachi, Frank Costello, during the Luciano-Genovese interregnun in 1948, forbade nenbers fran engaging in it. 581 Between the Costello edict and the Apalachin meeting, Congress had also passed legislation to meet the narcotics problem. The Boggs Act of 1951, sponsored by Representative Hale Boggs of Louisiana, provided for 115 1,\\ ,' mandatory penalties after a first conviction. The Boggs-Daniels Act of 1956, sponsored by Boggs and Senator Price Daniel of Texas , provided for stiff mandatory penalties for all narcotics cdnvictions.582 This legislation was . of great concen1 to La Cos a Nostra, and one conclusion reached at the Apalachin rooeting, or shortly thereafter, was that\u00b7 menbers would be forbidden from direct involveuent in narcotics traffic, although financing and importation were pennissihle. 583 In other words, dealing was to be \"franchised\" to non-Mafia groups--for example, blacks and PUerto Ricans. Other, roore drastic rooasures--killing knOWn narcotics agents--were considered and rejected. But, as Valachi .noted, narcotics trafficking was too lucrative for self-policing by the underworld to work.584 Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Henry L. Giordano told the MCClellan committee in July 1964 of the consequences of the failure to implement the \"no narcotics\" rule. 585 Since 1956, Giordano testified, the Bureau had, using undercover techniques, developed 20 ma.j or conspiracy cases against 206 praninent: organized crim; offenders. Nineteen per cent of the Genovese family, 40. percent of the Lucchese family and 20 percent of the Gambino family, or at least of those; icleptified before the conmittee, were convicted, on narcotics charges between 1956 al1d 1964.586 Vito Genovese himself was among those convicted.587 His 1959 narcot\u00b7 Nelson Silva Cantellops, a Puerto Rican dealer in Upper Manhattan, for a narcotics sale to an undercover officer.588 Faced with a possible life tenn, Cantellops agreed to. testify against 16 co-conspirators, Genovese among them, who stood erial for the importation, sale, and delivery of narcotics. The trial las ted three . roonths in Hanhattan Federal court. 116 ~\u00b7. The test~y filled 6,700 pages of transcripts. Cantellops, though a minor figure in the ring, was the principal witness against;. Genovese. He was on the stand for 19 grueling days. Judge Alexander Bick had to order fran the courtroan hecklers who. made threatening gestures at Cantellops. He could not do anything about the midnight calls to his wife: \"We 1 11 get Cantellops. . We 1 11 get you 1 n 1 the kids too. \"589 Despite the. haras~nt and guided by the careful questioning of Assistat1t U. S. Attorney Arthur H. Christy, \u00b7 Cantellops identified '' ' Genovese as the man who had ,directed the ring 1 s activities. The jury believed Captellops, an:d Genovese was sentenced to 20 years GenoVese later told a fellOW\" inmate at Leavenworth: it was \"a bum rap.\" \"I wouldn 1 t have minded if they got ~ on :inc~ tax evasion because ~t would be fair. \"590 Ralph Salerno, the organized crime expert, agreed, terming Cantellops1 s testim:my \"ahoost unbelievable. \"591 Genovese challenged his conviction, securing the services .of Edward Bennett Williams, bqt it was affinred on appeal. Having been .transferred fran the Federal prison at Leavenworth, Genovese died on February 14 , 1969.592 As for Cantellops, he was slain in a barroan brawl in 1965.593 J. The Organized Crime Program: 1957-1963 Within days of the Apalachiri .meeting, the FBI established\u00b7 it tenred its Top Hoodltm1 Program. Selected field offices arO\\.md the country were required to collect intelligence on the Apalachin '\u00b7 94 . \u00b7. ,, attendees. 5 \u00b7 Under the Kennedys, the effort was expanded, and '. .. \u00b7, ' 595 electronic surveillance was .made the mainstay of the program. \u00b7 On June 29, 1962, the FBI sent to the Department of Justice a suamary 117 I report entitled, \"The Criminal Ccmni.ssion,\" which doctli:OOnted the structure of organized cr~ nationwide. Fran there on, the report was updated evey six m:>nths. 1. The Coornission The FBI identified the commissione o~ commission, established by Luciano in the 1930s, as the highest ruling body of La Cosa Nostra, which was canposed exclusively of individuals of Italian birth or Zicarelli: LaRocca. . DeCavalcante : boss? DeCavalcante: [I] t' s all straightened 0\\l.t now. But Joe Bonanno was in on that deal. 'fuey made LaRocca take orders from the commission until everything was straight~ned out. In 1963,598 the. trembership of the Coomission included Gerardo Catena (the underboss who took over for Vito Genovese when h~ went to ' ' . ' prison) , 'fuomas Lucchese, Carlo Ganbino and Joseph Bonanno of New York ' City, as well as Sam Giancana of Chicago, Joseph Zerilli of J?etroit, Stefano Magad~ . . reppresentanti or bossef3. The. . . i bosses settled disputes betwe.en in an arguimando, or. sit down . . . ' Angelo Bruno reviewed the practice for Sam DeCavalcante in February 11, 1962:599 Bruno: Semi, look, Sam. Lets say this thing [a dis~teq gambling debt] gees to argu.im;mdo, which.l don't want it to go. DeCavalcante: I don't either. Bruno: I don't want it to go you understand. If it goes to ar~do, I have to represent [the alleged detorWhether I want to or not ... NCM if we go to their arguilp=ndo ~ you tmderstand, and your representandos [DeCavalcante was :not a bqss in 1963] is there and I'm there and lets say a .few other representandos are there .... 2. Families ad. A boss of a family was also called a capo. Under him, was an underboss or sottocapo, the second in carmand. A lateral position, usually an .elder statesman or advisor' availabl~ fo:r: consultation to any trenber, was a cQnSiglieri or consulieri or a counselor. The terminology was illustrated by a conversation that was overheard on AugUst 31, 1964, 119 betWeen DeCavalcante and Joseph Sferra, a caporegima in the DeCavalcant~ family and a busines.s agent of Local. 394, Laborers International Union, Elizabeth, N.J .. : DeCavalcante: It's about Joe. Bonanno's borgata. Sferra: !he way he conducting himself, you n-ean? DeCavalcante: Well, he made his son consigliere -\u00ad and it's been reported, the son, that he dOn't show up [when the cdrmission asked to see him.] 3. Regime Each family was divided :into subgroups or regi.oe which were headed \u00b7. 600 by ca.podecine or caporegine br captains. On June 4, 1965, DeCavalcante told Lquis LB.rasso, a DeCava:lcante: Yeah. \u00b7 Capodecina literally neans head of 10. Apparently, in the begirming, that was the intended nu:nber for each subgroup. 4. Soldiers l.ndividual members of each subgroup were known as soldati, or soldiers, orbtittol'llreil.

When they made rre they made ~m in Italian. They all spoke Italian. 5 Menbership The membership of La Cosa Nostra. in 1963 was est~ted to be between 4, 000 and 5, 000, with 50 per cent of it based in the New York netropolitan area. 602 In all, 603 there were thought to\u00b7\u00b7 be 24 families: In New York City, there were. five families, Genovese (600 nenbers); Lucchese (150 Milwaukee, one (50 nerbers). In San Jose, one family: Joseph Cerrito (30 nanbers). In Kansas City, one family: Nicholas Civelia (75 nerbers). In Denver, one family: Jones Colletti (40 nsnbers). In San Francisco, one family: James Lanza (12 nerbers). In Pittsburgh, one family: Sebastian Jolm LaRocca (50 nenbers). In Los Angeles, one fqmily: Frank DeS:im:me (75 rranb~rs). In New Orleans, one Marcello. menbers). In'New England, one family: .In Cleveland, one family: John Scalish (150 merrbers). In St. Louis, one family: Anthony Giordano (35 rranbers). In Scranton, Pa.,. one rramers). Tampa, f~ly: (75 members). In D,allas, one family: Joseph Civello (25 members). 6. Status .\u00b7 'Ihe various families were not equal in wealth, power, or status .. Sone were small and IIDre or less ineffective. Others The Milwaukee family was, for exarrple, dcminated by the Chicago family. On the other hand, Scm:! families had a treasure of independence fran the ccmn:i.ssion, as Joseph Columbo.was to explain to family members on December 4, 1968, again, as the FBI listened. New Orleans was, he said, the first Cosa Nostra . family in the United States;\u00b7 it was set up by rranbers from Sicily. As such, it. had special privilege~. It did nqt have to submit to the \u00b7 carmission on various matters, incll,ldi.ng ~ership \u00b7approval. \u00b7 In 1963, it was an un<;leniable fact that the national structure \u00b7. forged by Luciano in 1931 .had treant, throughout nl:>st of. the cO\\.U'ltry and even for the less important groups, leadership stability, and because of ' that stability, the amassing of wealth and power. New York, with its five fqmilies and violent struggle .for control\u00b7, was the exception, not ~ rule .. In Cleveland, leadership had passed easily fran Frank Milano, 604 \"Who retired t9 Mexico, to John Scalish, 605 as the. Mayfield Road nob was merged into La Cosa Nostra. 606 But the best example of paver consolidation with a nrin:inn.In of bloodletting was set by the Zerilli family in Detroit. 607 Joseph Zerilli and William Tocco, brother-in-law, both of families \"Were fr<:m the Terrasini Province of Sicily, fo~d ~ alliance with Joseph Profaci following World War I. It was cemented by marriages between Profaci's daughters and Zerilli's son, Anthony known as the East Side Gang, was involved in a vp.r:lety of le~al ahd illegal activities, including bootlegging. A Jewish group, the Pllrple ', ' '- ' ' Gang, operated in the . .northWestern \u00b7part \u00b7of the city, at first. preying on Jewish shopkeepers (bence they were tainted, or \"pmplen), but subsequently tumi,ng to labor. racket~ring and thento run runrti.ng. By 122 ' ,1_'.,' I. I. the end of 1930, the Purple Gang had been nm out of town, and since Zerilli was able to consolidate his power over the various Sicili@ and\u00b7 Italian factions, a state of relative peace was achieved. Tbe effect of\u00b7 the peace brought on by Zerilli's control was damnstrated608 statistically in 1963 to the McClellan coolni.ttee: from 1917 to 1930, there were 135 gangland slayings in Detroit, while from 193l.to 1962, \u00b7there were only 38. As. Prohibit nn ended, the Zerilli family IIDved into garrbling, pr:imarily the mnbers racket, and in 1931, Zerilli. took place on .the nationa.l Comnission. 7 .. 'nl~ Kenri~dy Administration During the years of the Kennedy Administration, organized crime figures did voice many canplaints, scma quite threatening, against .law enforcement officers , FBI agents, in particular. 609 Occasionally, J. ' ' ' '', Edgar Hoover himself was the target of a ~bster' s wrath. Ihe real anger, however~-the roost\u00b7 vituperative language to be picked up on the bugs--:-was reserved for the .. Kennedys, in particular Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Men who had been largely secure in their positions of power .and wealth we:re finding themSelves investigated, indicted, and d:mvicted as. they never had before. For alm:>st 30 years--since the racket-busting days of Thanas Dewey--they had been virtually i.umune to the processes of law~ a~ The President .qn February 9, 1962, Angelo\u00b7 Bnmo and\u00b7\u00b7 william Weisburg, a Bruno associate, discussed the Kennedys in a lengthy conversation that reflected frustration and bitterness, but also caution on the part of the .Maf\u00b7: 1 de h. 610 1.a .\u00b7 ea . +s . 1.p: Weisburg: \u00b7 See what Kennedy done.

This is an old Italian story. So, there was an old wise woman about.140 years old. So, he figured. Let me go talk. to the old wise wanan. She knows .everything. So he went to the .old wise woman. So he says to her. I came .here because I want your opinion. He says, do you think .. I 'm a bad king. She says , no, I think you are a good king. He. says, well how cane everybody says I'm a bad king? She says because they are stupid. They don' t know~ He says well hOW' cCJ~JC, why do you say I'm a good king. Well she said, I knew your great .grandfather. He was a ,bad king. I knew your grandfather. He was worse. I knew your father. He was worse tha11 them. You, you are worse them all of them, but your son, if you die, your son is going to be worse than you. So it's better to be with you. (All laugh) So Brownell [fon~r Attorney Gt:..>neral] was bad. He was no f g good. He was this and that. Weisburg: Do you know what this man is going to do? He ain't going to leave nobody alone. Bnmo: 1 knOW' he ain't. But you see, everybody in there was bad. The other guy was good because the other guy was worse. Do you tn1derstand? Brwnell came. He was no good. He was worse than the guy before. ~s one. Brtn1o: Not like this one. This one is worse. Right? If sorrething happens to this f.:,'UY. (Laughs.) Weisburg: Let me tell you sot:J'ething. The J..\"'BI always hated the IHS. Always. The IRS never checked with the Treasury rren. They went separate ways. They wouldn't give each other infonnation. They wanted credit themselves. 124 :t .. 1 .. He made it with local authorities. He.made it ring-around-the-rosy, pal. Bruno: . Oh yeah. This guy is an accm.n1tant, .see. So now, he had to do son:Jething. worse. So what? He started to think, what can I do roore than tqe other guy. The other guy .made an \u00b7 anti-.racketeering law, gambling laws, he did this and he did that. What can I do, he says, I know what I can do. . Anybody that has a record that is police property, when he g~ts pinched, no bail. [ Bnmo ... then .ca:npares the\u00b7 Italian process of not So, it' s still Anerica. \u00b7 They are trying to pass a Federal. law that you can't take the fifth ( arrendnvant) . When they gran:t you :i.rrm.mity you can't take the fifth. Weisburg:, They are not going to pass that law. Bruno: . But they might. Slowly, however, the attitude of caud.on changed. On May 2, 1962, Michael Clemmte, a caporegima in the Genovese family, W:B$ heard to . say: 612 Bob Kennedy won' t stop today until he puts us all in jail all over the country. Until the Carmission ~reets ahd puts its foot clown, things will be at a .stahdstilL . \u00b7 As evidence of the building pressure, there was an unheard-of developnent--an outbreak of hostility between the Mafici and the FBI. b. The Lorrbardozzi Funeral On April 3 , 1963., canttto La:nbardozzi, the father of Catnttne l.albardozzi, a caporegima in the family of Carlo Gambino, was buried fran Inmaculate Heart of Mary Church in Brooklyn.613 Law enforcarent offic~rs covered the wake and requiem mass for .. intelligence purposes. As the funeral cortege entered the church, several young nen, who were am.mg the m:rurhers, assault;ed Special Agent John P. Foley, who had a 125 t ' I ,.,\u00b7 ,\u00b7\u00b7 ,, !.; ~\u00b7 . J. canera. Foley was badly beaten and h,is service revolver was stolen. 614 The assault caused deep concen1 at the FBI.. .On April 30, 1963, Associate Director CourtneY Evans wrote t;:d Associate Director Alan Belmmt . that, in his opinion, ge11eral permission to retaliate against law enforcEm:!nt officers had .. not yet been given by .the organized cr~ leadership. He noted, however, that Sam Giancana was watching the reaction to the in~ident and \"would be. guided acc~rdinglY FBLagents ~t the st~eet 'level, there was no indication in .the files . \u00b7 .. that they were seeking permission to avenge the assault on Foley di:rectly, but 'they did begin a series of interviews designed, . ,, ' ,' apparently, to iritimidate namers of the Ganbino o:rganization, and on one occasion, a narber of the Lanbardozzi grot1p was. beaten up and dunlped in an ash can. In May 1963, two of Ganbino' s IIEn, Michael Scandifia, a nenber, .. and Peter Ferrara, a caporegilna, were oyerheard by a bug that had been installed under order from the New York County Court~ FBI\u00b7 agents had interviewed Ferrara and iritimated that they woiuld interview his daughter, a Catholic nun, unless appropriate anends were made for the Foley assault:616 Scandi.fia: '!hey don't want to give you nb ... in other words they ~~ telling you they don't :want to embarrass you. In other words, they vm1' t go to the convent.. Well, I would say, right now they are giving you the zing You want us to go to the .convent? You want us to embarrass ? Well that Ferrara: Yeah. Of far rrore significance. however. was the rE\u00a51Ction of various family bosses to acts of physical retaliatiOJ:1.that apparently were taken by the FBL agents. On May 20, 1963 . Angelo Bruno. discussed the incident i '' ' . ' ' ,' ' /' ,. ' with .several IIB1 at his Penn Jersey vending conpany\u00b7 'in Philadelphia~ He ' ;\u00b7 126 . .

Well, this is the test, and if you c~~e the laws and now you are going to hit FBI man, every tine we pick up one of your people we are going to break their head for than. Bruno then related that they had :i.ri fact picked up one man: 618 They alroost killed' him, the FBI. They don't do. that you know. But they pi9ked up one of his fellows and they crippled hi.m... They said, \"This is ah example. Now the next tinE anybody lays a hand on an FB.I man, \u00b7that's just a warn:ing. . There is nOthing else we got to tell you.'' Similarly, on Jtme 6, 1963, Stefano Magaddino discussed the incident with se~eral of his men at his ftmeral h<J\u00a3Ie in Niagara Falls: 619 Here, \"this . . . . But we got to resi.'St. Today.

Joseph Valachi On Jtme 22, 1962, JosephValachi, then a prisoner in the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, seized a two-foot length of iron pipe, rushed a fellow inmate, John Saupp, and beat him to death. 620 Valachi, it turned out, believed that the man he had killed was Josehp DiPalenoo, who had 127 ~\u00b7 ,),:, \u00b7 been, Valachi thought, ordered by Vito Genovese, then in prison with Valachi, to kill hUn. 621 The murder precipitated Valachi' s break with La Coas Nostra and the chain of events that led to his public test:im:Jpy on the structure of organized cri.Ire in America. 622 Valachi' s decision to cooperate was not made public at\u00b7 the time, yet it was not long before \u00b7 meni:>ers of the Mafia were discussing it. On April 23, 1963, for exalq)le, Angelo DeCarlo had a discussion with ~\u00b7man named Barney: 623 Barney: . [T] he thing they talk about San=body nust ta:l.k because they could never dO notfllng about it. . DeCarlo: And oh, the other guy. In New York. What's his ~. That was in the car with. Vito. Barney: Joe Cago (Valachi' s nic'kn.anE) DeCarlo: I hear he's talking like a bastard. He nust\u00b7 have known sorrething f:)bout this thing?\u00b7 35 years ago~ Once Valachi had begun to testify, the anger m:>tmted. On Septenber 17, 1963, Maga.ddi.no coomented, ''We passed laws that this guy has got to die.624 On October 24, 1963, however, an tmidentified male, in a conversation with the wife of a Bruno associate surined it all up for his brethren:625 \u00b7The hearing fs ali politic;;ll, instigated by Robert Kennedy. They're rrurdering the Italian ~. The reactions of orgcn1ized crime figures were not limited to eXpressions of anger against Valachi or Robert Kennedy. Mallbers in New York developed a strategy to discredit Valachi '.s testimJny by sugge~ting he was insape, citing a of na1tal illness in his farlri.ly. 128 I ) Efforts were also made to plant other unfavorable stories with . d -~1... f he ~tzer r1Ze-W1nn~g reporter, who had been set up with a prostitute. At the conclusion of the hearings , FBI Director Hoover got right to the point in a phone call to Senator McClellan. The hearings had, Hoover said, \"shook . [the mb] up.\"627 d. Carlos to Power Carlos Marcello, the Cosa Nostra boss in New Orleans, was familiar with congressional investigations. He had been a witness before the. Kefauver conmittee in 1951, as well as before the McClellan coomittee in 1959, when its investigation of labor racketeering was directed by Chief 628 Counsel Robert F. Kennedy. Marcello beat a contempt charge that grew out of his Kefauver appearance; his claim of possible self-incrimination was not challenged in court by the McClellan coomittee. Undoubtedly, Marcello had learned to live with the adverse publicity generated by such .investigations. The advent of the Kennedy Administrati~ in 1961, however, threatened ouch roore. ~~rcello was erroneously identified by the Kefauver committee as the head of organized cri.rre in New Orleans. 629 In fact, the leader in New Orleans in 1951 was Sam Carolla,630 who had, in 1922, succeeded Charles Montranga, the boss who survived the 1891 lynching that followed the Mafia nrurder of Police Chief David C. Hennessey. Carolla, an eight-year-old Sicilian ~grant in 1904, at 22 was one of Montranga's key lieutenants in the operation of the French Market in New Orleans. With the caning of Prohibition in 1919, Carolla turned to n.m running, but in 1923, the year following his elevation to boss, he was convicted 129 J',', D ::,!, ' t in federal court of alcohol theft and sentenced to two years in prison. Retuming to New Orleans in 1925, he made. an effort over the next five years to consolidate his power, personally. shotgunning, in 1930, his chief rival for control of the illicit liquor traffic, William Bailey. 631 In 1931, despite efforts of N~ Orleans police officers to provide the defendants with a rigged alibi, Carolla and Frank Tedaro, one of his caporegime, were tried and convicted for wounding a federal aaent, Cecil Moore, in a gun . fight. 632 . S~tenced to two years, Carolla entered prison in 1932 and was released in 1934. MearMrl.le, Frank Costello and . Senator Huey P. lDng had arranged for Costello to m:we his slat machines to Louisiana, after ~yor-elect \u00b7Fiorello La Guardia had vowed to have them rEmWed fran New York City. 633 Carolla not only gave his blessing to the enterprise, but be also lent to it the services of a young soldier. who himself had just\u00b7 b~ released fran Angola State Prisem after servillg four years for ''masterm:inding\" a grocery store robbery by two teenagers. 63\u00b74\u00b7 At 22, Carlos Marcello was beginning his clbnb to the top. 1947 was a significant year, for both Garolla and Marce.llo. It was the year Carolla, along with Costello and Meyer Lansky, .expanded the ganbling operation to include a race wire .service and several plush casinos, as well as slot machines. 635 Marc~llo represented the New Orleans. family in the expanded enterprise . lt.was also the year the goverrmm.t succeeded in. deporting Ceirolla to Sicily, despite efforts \u00b7'by ' . a LouisUina Congressman, .Janes Morrison, to have private imnigration bills passed to grant Garolla citizenstdp. 636 Syndicated columist Drew Pearson exposed the scheme, and the bills were defeated. AlthOUgh Carella '[\"eturned illegally .to the United States on. two occasions (he c . died in New Orleans in 1972), his power passed to Marcello. 130 ,' '.;~ /. ' ' \u00b7:'' ,. I .. (2) Wealth .

Like Marcello, however, Giancana was by no rreans free of pressure from the Kennedy Administration. In fact, Giancana was one of the principal targets of the organized crine drive because of his position in Chicago, a position that had been won over a long period by an aggressive nature and raw violence. ( 1) Background It was 1905 when Antonio Giancana, 24, arrived at Polk Street Station, Chicago, __ was no~ __ !Q _______ _ to the United States until the end of 1906.675 He had been a street peddler in the Sicilian town of Castelvetrano; he would be a street peddler in Chicago. In Sicily, there had been poverty, but at least the air was clean, and the sun bright and warm. Chicago was dirty with soot and srrok.e, the sky was gray, and it was often cold, damp, and 136 .,.1 ' windy. The area of tenerrents into which the new :imnigrants crowded was ultimately to be. called Little Italy or Little Sicily, though somet~s Little Hell, The Valley, or TILe Patch.676 An.tonio and Lena at first lived in a walk-up flat at 223 South Aberdeen, an area west of Chicago's Loop that in 1906 was h~avily Irish. 6 77 At th.:lt t~, few Italians \u00b7lived west of Halsted Street; they were concentrated between Taylor to the south and Mather to t:he north. On May. 44' 1908' Lena gave birth to \u00b7her first son, Who was:~d Salvatore, and shortly thereafter, the family roo\\Ted to 1127 West Van Buren Street., also an Irish area at the ,, ' ', t~, but one which was to becane an Italian neighborhood, as it expanded northward fran Taylor, the main street of The Patch. 678 By 1925, Salvatore, then knoWn. as \"Sam'' or ''Mooney,\" lived at.l422 West Taylor Street and was a rrember of a street gang that called themselves the \"42's.\"679 Like Valachi in New York, Gi~ana .in Chicago took pride in his ability as a ''whee~.\" His first arrest and conviction cane in Septenber of that year--for auto theft .680 . Before he was 20, he had beeh arrested and rearrested in three rwrder investigations, one of which was for the killing of an .. eyewitness in a .pending robbery case against Giancana, another for the killing of Octavius Granady~ a ?lack who sought election as a corrmitteeman in Little Italy's 20th Ward. 681 By 1963, Giancana had been arrested 60 t:i.Ioos, and he had serVed t:i.Ioo, not cm]y for auto theft, but for b~lary and llDOI1Shini.ng. 682 In November 1928, Giancana was arrested .for an\u00b7 attempted burglary of a clothing store. 683 Caught red-handed, be pled guilty and was sent~ced to. one to five years in the state penitentiary at Joliet. He wa~ not released until Christmas Eve 1932.684 It was then that he came to the attention of a slow-talking Neapolitan ~d Felice DeLucia, ~aul \"The Waiter\" Rice~ from his work at the Bella Napoli Cafe, .850 South Halsted, the base of operations of. Joseph Esposito, one of Chicago's roost notorious and. powerful beer runners. 685 \u00b7. DeLucia had also worked for the Genna br()thers (Semi, Angelo, Peter, Anthooy and James, al~ ~cious killers and bootleggers who were allied with Al Capone) and finally for Capone himself. It was to DeLucia that the mantle of leadership fell when. Capone went to prison on Hay 4, 1932, confinned in an April ~eting with Charles Luci.:mo in the Hotel ' , it was the begirming of hi~ rise to .the top. Giancana' s career was manentarily interrupted when, :in May 1939, he receivep a four-year tenn\u00b7 iri. the Federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, for rooonshining. 686 He had been caught in a barn in Elgin, Illinois, with 8,800 gallons of mash~ l,oqo ~allons of alcohol, and 1,000 gallons of noncolored spirits. Giancapa had been in Leavenworth for only two months when he was trans\u00a3erred to the Federal facility at Terre Haute, Indiana There, he was tested psychologically, scoring 7 4 verbal .and 93 non-verbal. It was also there. he went to school-~not to obtain ''book ' ' ' ' >\\1' ' ' leaming,\" but to be introduced to. the 'World of policy. His teacher was Edward Jones, a black racketeer, who had .nm po+icy :in Chicago, but who \u00b7 .. had been sentenced to 22 roonths for inct:JriE tax evasion. For Giancana, it was n~ vista--not \"ni~kel and d~,\" but ~volving \u00b7a cash flow . thousands of dollars. When he was :released \u00a3rem prison on December 12, 1942, he had learned hi.s lessons welL687 With a criminal record and a f-ly (he had married in. 1933 and by 1942 had tWo children, Antoinette and Bonita Lucille), Giap.cana bad ' ' ' ' ' L, little to fear fran the draft. 688 Nevertheless, he was 'rhe Giaricana' exemption fonn that ''he was a constitutional psy\u00a2hopath with an inadequate personality manifested by strong ' ' ' i 1 d \"689 H. d h'' ld. . . . e retume to \u00b7 ~s o pursu~ts, ut s mentor, DeLucia, was himself in prison in 1944, having been convicted of extortion. in. the faroous rootion picture ind~try case in 1943 690 (2) Motion Picture.

There was talk of high ransan, . but it apparently did not involve IOOney. Giancana had made himself a partner .in the black policy racket, and Jones retired to his estate in Mexico.

Leonardo Accardo was born in Chicago on April 28, 1906, of Sicilian inmigrant parents /06 His father, \u00b7Francesco, was a self-~loy~ shoemaker at . 560..;~ Harrison Street in the Patch. On May 31, 1923, when the 17-year;,.old Accardo was convicted of disordet::ly conduct, his father's address was\u00b7 .. listed .as 1353 Grand AverDJe., an address on Chicago's .neat;; West Side, but not in ThEi Patch. Like\u00b7his father's ux:We to a bett~ neighborhood, Accardo's rise to the top of \u00b7the Capone .gang was the ~esult of bard work. , In the early Y.aars, Accardo \u00b7\u00b7. had the reputation: of a gunman: he a st.lspectin the 1929 St ..

By: the 1940s, Accardo had becooe the manager of a of \u00b7.\u00b7 ganbling establistmmts, the mst notorious of whlch was the Owl Club in Calt.met ,City, a Chicago suburb that was virtually .owned by the .

His \u00b7 conviction was reversed on appeal on January 5, \u00b7\u00b7 1962, by a two-to-one vote of the Court o:f Appeals for the.Seventh Circuit. 711 While FBI electronic sl.lfVeillauce indicated the appeal was fixed, it was not verified by. subseqUent investigations. 712 Witnesses who t~stified iri .Accardo's defense were, however, cqn.victed of perjury 713 A retrial was ,' ,,, ' ' ordered by Attorney General K~nnedy~ but pn Octobet 3, 1962, Accardb was acquitted of tax evasion. \u00b7\u00b7His tax troubles did force Accardo to ret'ire, however, and to pass the leadership to Sam Giancana. 714 (5) Trouble in l.8.s Vegas r.1e ::>.nuL~,~ :I.lLLf,t~s th~ toost carm::>n .characteristic--violence; they are made to app~r ariirnal~like and little.toore.

But it was differept with Phyllis McGuire, the .yomgest and prettiest .of the\u00b7 .143 b '$. t McGuire Sisters, one. of the m:>st popular of ~ret in l4s Vegas. . The .Chicago syndicate got interested in Las Vegas in the late ~\u00b7\u00b7 1950s. 719 It had been .declared an open city, t~t is, not. the danain. of any one Mafia family, and by the end of 1960, both Giancana and Accardo had hidden interests in a nunher of casinos, hi(i:den because criminals were banned fran casino. ownership by Nevada law. 720 Giancana had an. ' ' ' . interest in the Desert Inn and the St:ardu5t, 'both ncminaily cMned by Morris \u00b7 Dalit:z, . and was at the Desert Itm s6meti,roo in 1960 .\u00b7that he first ~ret Phyllis McGuire.

He said .he would. take care of her markers, which he did by telling Dalitz, \"to eat it.\"721 It was the beginning of a close relationship. In 1961, Phyllis leCJ.sed the Green Gables Ranch, four miles outside of Las V~gas, in Paradise'valley . . Giancana made it . . . .f h 722 cas~ ~terests ram As tl,too went on, Giancana Is troubles stenming from the publicity created by his relationship with McGuire. got oo:l-e serious. In. 1963, Frank Sinatra, a close friend of Giancana., owned 50 per cent of the Cal-NevaLodge, a resort and casino on the N~ada side of Lake TahC>eJ23 Giancana had often bragged that, through Siriatra, he owned a sha~e of car-Neva, and Sinatra seemmgty confi!tred it by biring PaulD'Amato, a New Jers;ey gangster,. to protect ~iancana1 s interest. 724 S~ and Phyllis were frequent guests at the pLace, staying in a cozy chalet t:hat. adjoined the main hotel, but Visits on ~o successive weeker1ds :in ~uly stirred up enough publicity to attract the attention of the Nevada State Gaming Coomission. 725 \u00b7 Called to account for Giancana 1 s share of 144 ~ . \u00b7 \u00b7~\u00b7 ownership , Sinatra was defiant at first, but by Ostober he could see no alternative to divesting himself Qf his $3 milliOn. interest u{ Cal-Neva as well as nine per c.ent of The Sands in Las Vegas, which was worth $390,000.726 The Cal-Neva incident was iUustrative of the lc;~.rger interests that . . organized crirre figures had at stake in Nevada, particularly in Las Vegas. Jet air travel,. the vitality of the ecooomy, and a growing reputation as the e;ntertainment capital of the world made Las VegaS in the 1960s a rich. source of illicit profits. Publicly-report\u00a2d gaming inc~ increased from $216.3 million in 1961 to $330tnil1icm by 1965.727 \u00b7. B'U~ both the 'FBI bugging program and.

(7) Physical Surv-eillance FBI agents who had kept Giancana under surveillance since he. was n.arOOd a principal target of the Attorney General's organized crime program in 1~61, decided in the late spring of 1963 to change tacticsJ58 Up until then, Giancana had not been. under close physical surveillance. On their own, although With approval frcxn Washington, the agents decided to institute \"lockstep\" physical surveillance--a. 24-hour tail, no matter where he was\u00b7 or whan he was. with. As Brashler wrote in The Don: With his temper and his volatile rrvodiness, they saw a chance to disrupt the man's routine, his private affairs, his very equilibrium, to such an extent that they wer'759 certain it would cause h:im to .make mistakes.

As Chat\u00b7les English, a Giancana associate, put it: . ' .\u00b7 762 \"The guy ..

One of these fellas is Ro~r. n771 Giancar'li,i identified (William) Rp~r as an' FBI agent he said he met ''at O'Hare Airport nine nonths ago. \"172 Media attention was also given to Tisci, who contended to the press that his representation of Giancana in court did not conflict with his duties to Congressman Libonati.773 The Department of Justice decided to defend the case by taking the position that the court had\u00b7 no power to super~ Vise a s~eiilance; consequently, rio cross-examination was made of Giancan.B., no evi,dence was put in, and when Martin W. Johnson, special agent in charge df the Chicago FBI office, was called to testify, he ' ' L_, I, 'I refused to answer. l3. specific questions on the direct order of Attorney General Kennedy. 774 The court refused to sign an order submitted by Giancana' s lawyers, which would , o~ goveri:\"mant official noted, have \"prevented virtually any investigation ... by ani police. ~ . agency ... n 5 But to the deep chagrin of the Departrnent of Justice an.d the FBI, the \u00b7 court entered a limited order and held Johnson in contempt for. failure to testify, fining him $509; the COUJ:'t' s order. provided that the FBI could not have roore them one car parked within a block of Giancana I s hane, only one car could be used to follow him, and that there had to be at least one foursOJl'E between Giancana and the agent:;.s when they followed 776 him on the golf course.

English started to sing, ''When the caissons go rolling along, ... 1' and carmented that Lee Harvey Oswald was supposed to have been \"an anarchist\" .and \"a Marxist Conmmist. \"783 who knew how to shoot,\" Giancana replied, adding that with Oswald dead, they \"WUld not be able to kn<M if he had ''other contacts or what. \"784 K.

Not only did the statistics of 152 ~\u00b7 .. \u00b7\u00b7 D. the organized cri.nE program that ~asur~d perfonnance. fail, 786 but in July of 1965 , at the request of then Attorney General Ramsey Clark, President Johnson banned all use of electronic suryeillance techniques, \u00b7 \u00b7 l ' 787 N\u00b7 . d'd h FBI .. except m nat~ona secur1.ty ever. agam\u00b7 :L \u00b7. t e or any otner Federal :investigative agency have such canprehensive, detailed and accurate information on organized crilre. Too many people, however, had cone to realize the importance \u00b7of the Federal effort against organized cri.Ire~. A study ~roup of liberal Republicans published a sharply critical .aru3.lysis of the. declin:i.ng program, 788 artd efforts were ma.de to revive it. 789 \u00b7 The in 1967 called for its strengthening, and recomnended a legislative program in the area tha.t included grand jury re.form, inm.mity authOrization, perjury and contempt reform, wiretap authoriza.tion, and a call for new efforts to blend criminal and civil r~dies. 792 Similarly, a House ccmnittee studied the organized cri.ne program, in\u00b7 1968 and called for its strengthening. 793 Over the strenuous objections of Attorney General Clark and President Johnson, 794 too, Congress enacted in 1968 the wiretap legislation called f b h C \u00b7 c \u00b7 \u00b7 795 Wr. \u00b71976 \u00b7th \u00b7 N \u00b7 1 w\u00b7 or t e . created by the 1968 Act, observed: Since 1968, the use of court-authorized electronic surveillance to gather evidence of crimes involving organized criminals bas .. con.,.. finred the belief that syndicated criminals \u00b7 continue to pose a ma.jor problem to our society and that electronic surveillance is often an effective ~ans \u00b7of tmcovering and proving the e:kistence of organized criminal conspiraci~s. Organized criminals., we hav~. seen, seek to carry out any lucrative illegal endeavor., from gambling to narcotics distribution to major fraud sch~s, and they seek to cover their activities through the intimidation of victims and accanplices aJ:ld the corruption of public 153 ~ .. officials. Electronic surveillance, directed at these major crfroinal endeavors under care\u00ad ful Title III procedural controls, has been able to assist in the prosecution of this activity while minimizing the threa,t to the privacy of persons pursuing legitimate activities. The COilllli.ssion notes, however, that surveillance alone promises little.

Introduction Traditionally, our nation an~ our society have been characterized by violence--the fight for u1dependence, the Indian wars, slavery and the secession of the South, agrarian refonn, the errergence of organ:ized labor, the civil rights rooveroont, and conflicts based on religious and etlmic anilrosities or even pelitics. The violence that has characterized the development of our underworld therefore, ought not to cane as a surprise to anyone who knows bur history or is familiar with the dark underside of our national life today. Nevertheless, the role and impact of violence in the underworld ought not be overstated, minimized, or misunderstood. Placed in context, it is seen like a natural outgrowth of the character of organized crime itself. Organized crime, including the national syndicate as well as other groups, continues \u00b7to be extrerrely violent. The Depart::DEnt of Justice estimates that there were 200 gangland slayings in 1979, a IIJinute. portion of the total (20,000) homicides that occurred that year, but significant for the brutality that they manifested as a way of life for the organized underwurld.1 Indeed,\u00b7 violence of ail kinds, frequently Illl.lrder, is used as a means \u00b7of maintaining the organization and insuring its success. Violence is in fact considered to be a rational solution to many of the problems faced by the organization of crine. For the less sophisticated group~, violence, however, rna~ be. used IIDre frequently and less selectively than by older groups \u00b7such as La Cosa Nostra. La. Cosa N()stra, for example, typically uses twrder only when other alternatives will.not work, realizing, annng other things, that wholesale violence will attract. intensive law enforcerrent investigation.2 Nevertheless, timely rrurders remain a rrethod of 157 :e ''., conduct:ing its business. Most La Cosa Nostra families in fact go through periods .of heavy and seemingly unrestrained violence. Understanding violence is one key to understanding the essential character of organized crime . B. Traditional Patterns of Violence In the early clays of its syndication, organized cr:i.ma uurdered insiders and canpetitors with reckless abandon. Between 919 and 1934, organized crirne in Chicago, . year.3 Di~ O'Banion, a leader of one Chicago group, was killed, it is said, rret'ely for refusing to cancel another gangster's ganbling debt. 4 According to sone \\-lriters, the infa:roous M..:1sseria-Maranzano war in New York, which led to the fonna.tion of the . nationwide :;;yndicate, was ended by the killing of roughly 40 Sicilian gang leaders in a three~day period in 1931.5 Gradually, however, as ~rganized crine became \u00b7. syndicated, gangsters began to use mn:'der m:>re selectively as a tool of their trade. The m:>bsters began to realize that excessive violence was one of the crucial things that attracted public attention and law enforcement pressure. Accordingly, \u00b7.a conscious decision was taken by the principal group \u00b7to attempt to avoid :unnecessary violence. A roodem, \u00b7 rational use of violence was the result. 1. Controls over Violence6 La Cosa Nostra, as a well-established and highly structured organization, has strong internal and .external controls over violence. La Cos a Nostra' s organizational structure enables it to control the use of violence by its members.. Significant in this regard is the role of the family boss, who is usually against wholesale violence. Where the boss is strong, he rrust approve all ki,llings by rrenbers, which 158 facilitates a rational use of murder. vlhere there is no strong leader, and in the newer organized crir~ groups with less mature leadership, killings are likely to be less well thought out. The family boss controls a systL~l that is in fact relatively ef~ fective in limiting violence between rrembers of his family. Soldiers are expected to settle differences without violence. If they cannot agree, they are supposed to request a caporeg~ to arbitrate. If the _\u00a3\u00a7\u00a3 cannot resolve the dispute, the soldier is supposed to request the consigliere, rmderboss, or boss to decide. If the boss makes a decision on the matter, it is supposedly final. A member who refuses to follow the boss's decision will be punished by the organization, a ptmislm:mt ' ' ranging from a slap in the face to rrurder, depending on the gravity of the offender's misdeed. If nanbers of different families bee~ involved in a dispute, the boss or consigliere of each family may neet in a sitdown, the tmdeJ:WOrld fonn of binding arbitration. Similarly intrafamily murder is kept as impartial as possible. \u00b7 Murders are ordered only if it is for the good of the family. What reasons are sufficient to demand death vary with \u00b7 the family and boss, but they inc:t_ude infonning on the family or another member, disobeying the boss , and not sharing with the organization a proper share of the profits from illegal ventures. If a killing is ordered wi thjn the family, the members usually accept it, if the boss is strong, partly because of the boss's position of authority, but partly because they know the boss could order the saroo fate for them~ Various teclmiques are also used by organized crine to help control the use of violence against non-merrbers, including nnney and a thoroughly developed and well-cultivated instilbnent of fear .in the public. 159 '\u00b7--\u00b7,-\"\"--' ._,.....---'--- p'.' No one seems to know for sure h<Y.N nuch political corruption exists, but everyone agrees that organized crime could not flourish like it does ,' ' ' ' without SubStantial COrruption. 7 Organized Crime IS, VaSt firianci~l resources er1able it. to buy many public officials. Accordingly, corrpution allows organized crime to operate !IDre easily than otherwise and with less need for violence. Instead of threats and actual force, intensive police investigation may be. avoided. through bribery. Money, or rrore generally, ~concmic ,power, enables organized crime ' ' ' to have its way with other crililinals' and, with many legit:i.nlate businesses and labor unions. \u00b7Criminals with suCcessful operations can ' ' be brought under the\u00b7 organization 1 s control by offering protection, financing, andexclusive territory. Legitimate busiil,essmm can be controlled in several different wq_ys, including threats of labor. problems, caused by. organized .crime-bought .labor leaders. Methods such ' ' ' as these. allow organized crime to exercise a great deal of influence without resorting to violence_. Money also helps limit violence fn a rwre indirect way. One of organized crime 1 s goals is profit, and it understands ,well that .trost people' or businesses' can be milked for s~thing. Thus, instead of a beating or killing .a custarer, a loansharkmight force him to rob a bank, steal securities, or embezzle, as dead people ca.mtot contribute to the rwb 1 s till. The HOst effective altemadve .to actual violenqe, however, \u00b7 is\u00b7 fear of violence. Because of \u00b7organized crime 1 s well.,-known propensity for violence~ the resulting fear of violence actually reduces the need for .its use. In short, people are generally so intimidated by rwbsters that ' ' ' force is not necessary to encoUrage them to do whatever the rwb desires. of them. Thu8, when a loanshark tells a clistCJrrer that if he. i,s late in J 160 );' i.' payment again he will be dead, the c)Jstomer docs not wait to sec if the loansharl< really rreans it. And the rer.;taurant Oliffier pays the extortionist rather than see if the extortionist will actually bomb his restaurant. Likewise, the store owner buys the nob 1 s products instead of risking the consequences. There are well-publicized instances of what happens to those who do not go along with the rrob, and\u00b7 one threat, . . carried through, goes a long way toward preserving the nob 1 s credibility. 2. Kinds of Violence When 'necessary, organized crine uses violence in a calculated way. Force is used as a rati6nal solution to four types of organized cr~ problems: 1) business, 2) security, 3) warfare, and 4) canpetition.8 a. Business First, business . violence can be defined as the type of violence that occurs in the nonnal course of an illegal endeavor, such as a loanshark using force to collect an overdue pa~t. This type of violence is separate frooi the canpetitive violence that occurs when different groups vie for the same racket or territory. In the business context, howev~r, violence seems to be used relatively little; it is, in short, not generally good for business. The nost cCJlliiDil type of business violence is loanshark violence, as in loansharking the threat of violence is necessary to insure repayment of the loan, . for which there is no traditional collateral. At times, violence rrust, therefore, be used to d.em:mstrate that nonpayment or habitUal late payrrent .will not be tolerated.9 \u00b7 But other fortns of. punisfurent, including interest rate penalties \u00b7or business takeovers,. are usually adequate sanctions. Here, too, Violence is not always the. best policy. 161 Neither gambling nor narcotics are typified by a h:igh degree of business. violence. Both endeavors involve continuous relationships~ As / such, the use of violence is not a rrajor factor in maintaining the illicit relationship. Obviously narcotics trafficking has its violent aspects, chiefly competitive. or security violence and secondary violence by addicts, but in its ''business\" aspects narcotics racketeering is not . 1. . 1 10 excess1.ve y Vl.O ent. Ironically, business violence may play a larger role in the mderworld' s activities in the legitimate econany. Labor racketeering, for example, involves. violEmce. Payoffs and kickbacks from employers are extorted through threats of violence. Other f01'lns of labor racketeering may be made easier with the help of the threat of . 1 11 Vl.O ence. Usually, too, violence will play a role in organized crime's gaining control of legitimate businesses. Once in control, it may be necessary for mobsters to use violence to drive competitors out of business, force their products on buyers, or sweeten deals. Events in Kansas City from 1972 through 1977 apt],y illustrate the mob's willingness to.\u00b7 use force in its business dealings. 12 During this period, the Kansas City Cosa Nostra family. tried to roove its go-go bars and pornography shops irlto a newly-redeveloped area called the River Quay. The River Quay was an old riverfront area of Kansas. City, which in the early 1970's was redeveloped into a fashionable shopping and tourist center. In order to insure a family-oriented area, the developers rigorously screened prospective lessees. In 1972, Fred Harvey Bonadonna qbtained a lease and opened a restaur~t in the River Quay. The restaurant i.rrnediately ga:im~d 162 I I success, and Bonadonna bee~. influential aroong area busines~n. Fred Bonadonna, a fully legitimate businessman, was the son of a $Oldier in the Nicholas Civella crime family. When the roob became interested in the area in 1974, the River Quay included 68 different retail establishments, and it was a major Kansas City tourist .attraction. Urban renewal in the \"sex industry zone\" :in Kansas City, however, required to relocate. Accordingly, ~osepq Camnisano, a m::>b figure, purchased a building in the River Quay, intending to relocate his go-go bars in the area. Fred Bonadonna opposed the roove, and he did everything in his pcMet to stop Carrmisano' s business fran opening. Bonadonna was warned by his father not to oppose the roob, and the bar was finally allowed to open. Nevertheless, when other sex-related businesses tried to open in the area, Bonadonna, and other legitimate merchants adamantly opposed them. As a result, the businesses were unable to obtain licenses. Bonadonna was again warned by his father that the 100b v;ould resort to anything to gain control of the River Quay bars. Bonadonna then relented, but when Canmisano began to prOIOOte go-go girls in one of his bars--in violation of an agreement with Bonadonna--Bonadonna complained to the roobsters. At this point, Bonadopna's father warned him that Joseph Comrnisano and his powerful brother William Commisano considered Bonadonna an enany. Bonadonna 1 s father cautioned him to watch out for \u00b7 \u00b7 known. assassins, but Bonadonna continued to oppose the toobsters. At one confrontation, William Canmisano told Bonadonna that he (William) v;ould kill anyOne, including anyone at city hall, who opposed him. 163 I In an attempt to soften the now hardened opposition to them, the mob resorted to violence. First, in March 1976, Fred Bonadorma's son was brutally beatt::n with baseball bats. Next. in June 1976 his father , , was IID.lrdered. In Nov~rber 19 7 6, a close friend of Bonadorma' s was found strangled, and on the sauJe day, an tmknown bomber was injured while attempting to connect an explosive device to the car of Bonadonna's bodyguard. Bonadonna himself was in such danger that he was forced to enter the Federal Witness Protection Program in :March 1977. Even after BOnadonna had left Kansas City, and the m=dia began to expose the purpose of the acts of Violence, it continued. In March 1977, a Bonadonna. building in the River Quay was blown up, and in August 1977, another Bonadonna bodyguard was killed by a bomb. Because of the violence, the River Quay itself was destroyed as an attractive downtown area, and it becarr\u00a3 a seedy, bombed-out pomo district. The dream of legitimate businessm:m was destroyed by the m:>b 's greed and its violent tactics. Bonadonna himself was relocated after testifying against the Ccmnisanos, who were convicted of extortion, but he can never retum to Kansas City without risking murder by a vengeful m:>b. b. Security Organized cri.ne also uses violence . to maintain intemal security~ If a nanber or an associate is a security threat, he nust be taken care of, and that may include murder. According to Joseph Valachi, Willie Moretti, for exarrple, was killed because his mental instability rendered him 1.mable to behave rationally; he was, therefore, a threat to security. 13 Other racke.teers will be disciplined or silenced for disobeying or~rs or the nvs t catm:>n type of . . 1 15 \"\"\"-. 1 ' t b ence may no e lilll.te to t e potent a witness .16 John Fitzgerald, an attorney who counseled his client to :infonn on the nvb, h~d his leg blown off by a boob planted ii.1 his car; he, too, was apparently viewed as a security threat.17 Informants who have already done dBmage to the organization may ' . also be killed for revenge and to discourage potential informants. George A~ Francorero, who twice gave damagi.ng test:i.rrony in testilwny helped convict Rayroond :Patriarca, a New England boss, was subsequently killed after his cover was blown, and it became known that he had agreed to testify aga:in.19 '\u00b7tncieed, it is fair to conclude that the 100b 1 s continued success depends in large part on its code of silence. It is understandably diffi,cult to convince a lower level organized cr~ figure to testify against his bosses and breac;h this code. Victims of orgarP-zed cri.m: too kq.qw equally well what might occur if they testify against the roob. As such, violence, protects, the organization fran inside and outside threats. For example, in the prosecution of Gary Bowdach, a mob figure, 15 counts of an irtdictJient had to be dropped beca'4Se 15 witnesses outright refused to .testify because of their fear of Bowdach.20 Security violence in fact created the need' for the Federal Witness Protection Program, t less dangerous to testify against organized crilre. c. Warfare Warfare, external fighting or internal rebellion, occurs when an individual or faction v4thin a group attempts to InQke a chan.ge in .,the group 1 s leadership. In, La Cosa Nostra, such attempts may also be made ' ,, ' ' 165 ' ,,'l'YI I .by other families, \u00b7and. they, too, may be categorized as a . form of warfare. Warfare can result fran dissatisfactiOn with leadership, encroaclm:mt on another family's racket or territory, or simply a ,::~\": . \u00b7 vacated leadership position. It may take the form of ,.a small war, in which several gang rtarb~rs are killed, or a single assassination of a \u00b7 leader. Tile assassination in the 1970s, .for example, of La Cosa Nostra leader Sam Giancana, illustrates the point. E:xaxrples killings Bruno and I>hilip testa and Ill..l[lErc:rus narbers of the Bruno family, have been attribUted to both I 'I , rebellion and warfare, probably a takeover attempt by New Yot:k. families.24 The RPphester, New York or~ed crilre fami,ly, however, has been plagued by extended gang war in recent years and an. exami.l-tation of ~t conflict will well dem:>nstrate how warfare begins and proceeds. 25 \u00b7 ' ' ' ' I i ' ' ' I ,'!'he war can be traced to 1972, when Rochester bOss\u00b7 Frank Valenti w8.$ forcedoutby Sam..iel Russotti., ~ver, inFrisoned for 25. years t6 life fpr their roles in the rmrder .of .a fellow IIJJbster, a conviction that left a treneldous voi<i in the Rochester .family's leadership. 'Ihe ,man left ini ' .. . . ' charge, ~ Didio. was supposed'tc> ,act as a puppet for Russotti. 166 ,) .\u00b7.~::: I : :Didio, however, refused to follow Russotti's orders; he did not provide \u00b7' ' ' for the inl:>risoned m:>bster' s families; and he lCMered the status of menbers, who wer.e loyal to Russotti, Piccarreto, or Gingello. In addition, , when a fund-raising event was held for the bcilefit of the ', irrprisoned roobsters, Didio allegedly , skinned a large part of the m:>ne:x .. ,far himself~ These and other similar actions by Didio enraged Russotti and his loyalists , and created great discontent in the family. In July 1977, Didio,, sensipg the dissensionwithiri the family, began to seek counsel from Franl<' Valenti, thtis bringing Valenti back into t:he conflict. About the sam; power. In septerrber 1977, ,Pidi,o and two of his loyalists were t:Old that they were through by several Russotti followers, who then ~everely beat Didio and his men. Didio and his group then, went i.rlto hiding, and began , to hold secret meetings at a Pittsford~, New Yo+!< restaurant. In Decerrber 1977, Didio's forces latmcl1ed their retaliation by .trying to attach a rem:>te control boob to a Russotti follower's car, but , J?~re in the process. .A high speed cl1ase, through Roche.ster resulted, with the two groups shooting wildly at each other. At one point, the .barb fell off the car; it. was later discovered by a bo , wm . dismantled it. In January 1978, Didio loyalists ambUs e Russotti henchnen and riddled it with bullets, but, miraculously, no one was killed. Meqnwhile, in January 1978, Russotti and his five cohorts ware released fran prison after their convictions were re\\rersed because of ,., ' < police f)erjury in their trial. 167. ., ' \\ >;, '-~ ~ . , .j. is the violence that occurs when one or nore gangs vie for control of a racket or\\ a territory. It is ii.ttle different fran the kind of violence in which the urban youth street gangs frequently engaged. La Cosa Nostra has used it to attain and maintain its preeminence in organized cr~. For example, :i:p Boston in the early 196Qs, La Cosa Nostra. caught the powerful Irish gangs off guard, and, in a war involving at least 50 IIUJ.rclers, took full control of the ganbling and loansharking rackets .26 Rising organized ct~ groups, including Black and other etlmic organizations, are ~lso using competitive violence to expand their operations. Narcotics trafficking, however, is by far the !IPst vtolent of the rackets today, and the violence connected with. it \u00b7is chiefly competitive in character. Miami, is, for example, a center fqr narcotics . trafficking, and there is widespread Cdnpetitive violence between rival ;f . gangs trying to gain control of the racket. 27 In Miami, they refer to the rampant violence of the drug traffickers as the phenarenon of the .. \"Cocaine Cowboy. \"28 The violence is cooparable in scale and ferocity to . the violence of the carpeting bootleggers in the 1920s. 29 c6100bian organized cri.Ire groups are powerful in\u00b7 cocaine and afficking, .and as they h.;tve begun to sell directly to the ,south Florida market, they have CCJI:re into\u00b7 ~rican traffickers. 30 All the .. traffickers are fighting to hold on to a portion of the territory;31 the result has .been an tmprecedented level of violence. In 197~, l)ade Cotiney, which . 32 hanicides , of. which 42 were related to .. narcotics in SOlre way. Of 169 ' ,'\"i''\" I these 42, police s,;1.y at least 20, but probably mre, were directly related to drug traffick1r)g.33 The violence in Miami is brutal\u00b7 and totally unmhibited. For example, on April 23, \u00b7 1979, in broad daylight, police discovered two cars in .. a high speed chase with the occupants ~changing machine gun fire. 'Ihe police ~tered the .cha~e, .and they were fired on as well. When one of the cars was finally pulled over, police found an illegal ' ' I Colarbian alien hog-tied and strlillgled in the tt;Unk. 34 Similarly, on the of 29 , , a Olban a .@Jg \u00b7 traffiCker was .priving his car\u00b7 past a shopping ceriter in a quiet Dade .. County suburb. . Another car pulled alongside the Cuban' and an C>cCl.JP~t \u00b7 inachinegunned h:i.m to death. Many of the bullets passed through nearby store windows. 35 Likewise, on July 11, 1979, in midday, at least t:wo males drove up to a busy shopping mal~ in a van. conv~rted into a heavily a:t:rred war wagon. The two men exi.ted the van, entered a liquor store, and fired at. least 100 rounds fran machine guns into the store and its ocCl.JPants. A major Colonbian drug dealer lea~r and his accanplice were killed, aJ1d two irmoc~t vict.ims were WO\\lil~d. As the machinggunners left the store, they sprayed the parking lot .with rrpre bullets in an . . 36 attenpt to keep Wl.tnesses away.\u00b7 Similar :incidents occur frequently in Miami, as rival groups struggle to control the :incredibly ~~rative be identifiep.38 In addit:i,.on, they mBnage ta. leave the country, in one way or another, if . they becare suspects :in \u00b7' C. Effects of Violence Ironically, there is considerable evidence that the presence of a powerful organized crime group may actually suppress certain crimes, incl1J,ding violent crime. 40 La Cosa Nostra is known to cultivate good public relations, and one aspect of this policy may be protection for neighborhoods .in which it lives and operates. OrganiZed crime, in short, does not tolerate street crime. La Cosa Nostra is able to accomplish What legitimate law enforcement cannot because of the fear and respect it evokes in other cr'llni.ru:tls. In scm:! urban areas , crime is tightly controlled and violent crime rates are startlingly low. \u00b7 As one law enforcement expert said -- ~1keep the streets a lot safer than the cops do. As effective as sorre groups may be at suppressing scm:! forms of violent crime, the overall effect is, however, minimaL Cities knOwn. to have powerful organized crime groups do not in fact have lower violent crime rates than those that do not. 42 Indeed, Florida aside, there is no discernible difference in the violent crime rates of major cities with and without strong organized cri.ne groups. Or~anized crirne is, on the other hand, indirectly responsible .for a great deal of violent crime. The addict who must steal to support his ,-;. 50 percent of all. street crime was carmitted by addicts. 43 It is not kn<:Mn how many llllrders or assa4lts are cannitted by people under the influenGe of drugs, offenses that might n()t have been Carmitted had the offender been clear-headed. Nor is it kncmn how nuch violent crim:! ccmnitted by s~reet gangs and other 171 young thugs can at least .in part be attributed to youthful enulationof successful and highly'vi~ible roobsters~ 44 D. Emerging .Patten1s of Violence With the large, hut irnp~rtant exception .of the Florida drug traffic, the chief emphasis of the rredia' s attention to organized ' cdne' s violence has been La Cosa Nostra, partially because. it\u00b7. is .the only natiqnwide syndicate~ but also .because roore is known about it than other organization.s ~ A brief discussion of s~ of the other organized cri.rre groups and. their violent tendencies is, therefore, in order. 1. Motorcycle G~s Motorcycle gangs can be extrerrely .Violent. They are apparently ready to kill anyone who gets in their way, including the sort of law enforcenent officials who La Cosa Nostra has traditionally avoided. Most bike \u00b7groups are referred to as dangerous, .even psychopathic by t:~ FBI. 45 . The gangs with the roost violent tendencies include the Hell's Angels in the West, the Banditos in the South, and the Pagans in the Northeast.46 \u00b7The brutal character of the violence is difficult to believe. One Pagan, who att;empted to quit the .gang, was injected with sulfuric acid, s.tabbed dozens of t~s, e surv1.ve . 2. Drug Traffickers As. pr~viously noted, the rropensity of those groups now invqlved in drug trafficking for competitive violence is well-established.48 Drug traffickers also use violence for reasons .other than canpetition~ There are at least seven situations that give rise to violence in the drug t \u00b7 ... \u00b7.&:'f\" 49 . rcu: ~c. (1} A or plans to rob nal;\"cbtics or m:mey without an exchange; 172 \u00b7.~\u00b7 :.1 '','< (2) Revenge or retaliation for a past drug ripoff or homicide; (3) \u00b7 Money or drugs not delivered by the courier, source, or buyer; (4) A battle for ascendency withii1 the group; ( 5) Belief that. the victim was cooperating with a governrrent agency as an informa.nt (Security) ; (6) Elimination of witnesses to a crime (Security) ; \u00b7and (7) Hijacking drugs. 3. The . Dixie Mafia The Dixie Mafia is a loose confederation of burglars, bank robbers, und other property-oriented criminals operatir1g in the South, who have associated together, . assisted each other., and on occasion :interacted 50 with other organi~ed crilre groups. The FBI tenn..s this group fairly violent. 51 4. The.Israeli Mafia The Israeli Mafia consists of a group of Israeli citizens in Los Angeles, who began by victimizing other Israelis. They have nCM ex~ panded their activities into such crilres as drugs,\u00b7 extortion, and fraud. Recently, they were responsible for a gruesane disnanberrrent murder of two suspected drug dealers in a dispute over payment.52 5. california Latino Groups There are a number of other organized crirre groups in the country. . 56 In Chinese carrmuni ties, there are local groups called Tongs. In Hawaii, ther:\u00b7e is a group known as the Yakuza, which is involved in t. . . d d 58 narco 1cs,. extort1on, an mur er. In addition, there are Black organizations, saretirres called the Blackrrefia, involved in the narcotics and numbers rackets. 58 All of these groups have varying propensities for violence. 173 ~\u00b7\u00b7 G. Other Organizc.>d Crirre Grqups There are a number of other organized cr:i.Ire groups ih the countLy. 56 In Chinese cornnuni ties, there are local groups called 'l'ongs. \u00b7 In Hawaii, there is a group knawn as the Yakuza, which is involved in na;cotics, extortion, and murder. 57 In addition, there are Black organizations, sanetirres called the Black f.lafia, involved in the . 58 ' narcotics and numbers rackets. All of these groups have varying propensities for violence. E. Law Enforcerient Response Ultimately, the success of. any law enforcetrent effort depends 6n the support of public opinion. Nevertheless, the public is seemingly unconcemed with the problem of organized crirre, including its violent aspects, often contrary to the belief of sane figures in organized crirre itself. Victims. of organized crime violence are too often perceived as pe6ple who probably deserve what they got. 59 Indeed, victims of brganized crirre are frequently organized criminals themselves. Alm:::>st all other victims are people who sanehow became involved with organized crirre. Accordingly, organiz~ crime is generally not thought to be respopsible for the violence that victimizes the average person~ who has .. no connections . with the rrob. Society, too~ demands many of the goods and seryices proviqed by organized crirre. By using these goods and. services, its Ireinl::)ers . contribute to the power and growth of organized crirre. As organized crirre continues to flourish, so will its use of violence and threats of violence. These ambivalent attitudes taward organized crirre make, acts of violence by organized crime. difficult to solve. In Miami, less than ~0 percent of all dtug-,related murders result in arrest, and only half .of 174 tho 1 . . . 60 se resu t 1.n conv1.ct1.on. In Chicago, of 999 gangland murders between 1919 and 1966, only 17 resulted in convictions by 1966.61 Violence itself is, of course, a major reason why organized crilre figures are so difficult to prosecute, and the roob's vast financial resources that enable it to bribe. public officials lessen successful . 62 prosecut1.ons. 175 CJIAI.YrER III.

Introduction Like the role of organized cr.irre .in violence, its role in corruption must not be either minirrlizE..>d or exaggerated. Instead, it must beseen in the larger context of official corruption generally, which is itself not a phenomenon that only recently appeared with the Watergate scandal of th~ 1970s. Official corruption has in fact enjoyed a long and full history in the United States at all levels of government: Federal, state and. local. Indeed, several well-respected. ccmnentatc>~s have viewed it as inherent in the political system, 1 or at 1 . '1 2 east ~s \u00b7a necessary ev1 . No one really knows whether official corruption is on the rise or whether out society has only becare. rrore acutely aware of. it. 3 In the early 1800s, for example, it was comron practice for Ireinbers of Congress and rcanbers of the executive to represent private interests in bringing claims against the government. In fact, sate of the IIDre enterprising officials actually advertised for custarers in major Washington newspapers. Everyone knew that influence was openly for sale and the .influence peddlers had no need to show false humility or subtleness. 4 By the mid-nineteenth century, however, the nation had begun to develop a rrore critical attit\\lde toward official rrorality. 5 Between 1853 and 1854, Arrerica adopted its first follr conflict of interest statutes .aimed at ending official representation of private interests. 6 Yet these statutes by no rreans ended the problem. In the 1860s and 70s, railroad manipulators disbllrsed hundreds of thousands of dollars. in bribes to eager congressrren. 7 Congress, however, held no rronopoly on corruption. Scandals developed out of the post~ivil War era that 177 1/: soiled the reputation of major figures in the Grant Administration.8 Henry Adams sumred up the situation best when he stated: \"One might search the whole. list of Congress, Judiciary and Executive during the twenty-five yearf:l 1870-1895 and find little but damaged reputation. n9 \\'latergate, too, was not the first White House hunti.lation . The Credit Mobelier and the Teapot Dare .scandals are on par with Watergate. Althoughnot directly touching the President, like Watergate they became codewor(ls Jor offical corruption in their respective administrations . \u00b7. . . \u00b7Credit Mobilier was the catc~rd for all the corruption of the Grant Administration.10 Oakes A:ines, a Massachusetts republican, headed the Union Pacific 1 s railroad-milking Credit: Mobelier of America. To insure the venture's success, A:ines placed 200 shares of the carpany' s stock. with his fellow congressrren where, he explained to his as$C)Ciates, . . . 11 \"they will do the rrost good to us.\" He also sold stock to both of Grant's vice presidents., Henry Wilson and Schuyler Colfax. 12' Corruption in .the Grant Administration, rroreover, was not limited to the Credit Mobilier scandal. In 1876, the United. States Senate tried the .iJrpeachrt'ent of w. W. Belknap, Grant~s Secretary of War, for selling trading postships in the Indian territories. The Senate fell. short by 5 ... h' 13 votes to conv1.ct llTI. General Orville E. Babcock, secretary to Grant, was alsO tried on charges of blocking investigation of the Whiskey Ring . . scandal, a scandal that involved distillers and Internal Revenue collectors, who falsified records to. defraud the federal governrrent of . . 14 whiskey taxes. Teapot the Harding Administration whclt Credit t-Dbilier rreant to the Grant Administration and Watergate to 178 D .. I the Nixon Administration. In 1926, the first criminal trials of the Teapot Darre oil scandal began15 with a cast of characters that included Secretary of Interior Albert B. Fall, Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, Veteran Bureau Director Colonel Charles R. Forbes, and Jess Smith, operator of the farrous \"Little Green House,\" which was part brothel and .part speakeasy. 16 Secretary Fall secretly leased goVe:rnment oil reserves at Elk Hills, California to Doheny ai1d Teap::rt Doheny's bag containing $100,000 to Fall. Sinclair, gave $233,000 in liberty bonds, $85,000 in cash and a .herd of cattle for Fall's ranch. Fall was convicted of receiving a bribe, fined $100,000 (which he never paid) , and. sentenced to a year. in jail. 17 \u00b7 Daugherty and Smith sold inrnuni ty fran .prosecution, gove:rnment appointrrents, criminal\u00b7 pardons, and liquor permits. Daugherty stood trial for his involvement in bribery and attempt to defraud the governrrent. He was acqUitted, but forced by President Calvfu. Coolidge . 18 to res1.gn. Fod)es swindled the country out of oore than $200 million, depriving disabled veterans of bandages, bedding, and drugs. Forbes sold these provisions at a fraction of their cost for a kickback~ he was sentenced to two years in the penitentiary. Smith shot himself, as did . . . .\u00b7.. . . .\u00b7 19 Forl~s' legal counsel, as a result of the Veteran' s Bureau scandal.\u00b7 The Nixon Administration, of course., had its scandal. Shortly before 2 a.m. on June 17, 1972, a security guard at the Watergate Office BUilding found tbe latch of a basement door opened. Police \u00b7found and arrested five men inside the offices of the Democratic National 179 I ' \u00b7\u00b7 ccmnittc.--e, 20 an incident that led to investigations and revelations that 'li.ould make \"yvatergate\" synonynous with corrupt official practices. 'l'he \\'~atergate scandal revealed' not only that principal aides of the President had engaged in illegal political espionage against political opponents, but also that .the President himself had repeatedly lied to the American public in his attempts to avoid being linke(l to a series of disclosures about i.llegal and unethical activities. The Watergate break-in itself was part of an intelligence:-. gathering, political espionage scheme engineered by G. Gordon Liddy and approved by fonrer Attorney General John Mitchell. The scherre was backed by funds fran the Corrmittee to Re~elect the President (CREEP). 21 The break-in generated the cover-up conspiracy, which included the payrrent of hush rroney to the burglars.,. the destrl,lction of evidence, and an. attempt to inhibit FBI investigation of the matte.r. Subsequent in.;_ vestigation demonstrated that the President and his aides were involved in or had knowledge of these illegal activities. 22 Other abuses of official power were also uncovered as a result. of the Watergate investigation. In 1969 the. President, without a court qrder, ordered darestic wiretaps of J:teiTbers of the rredia and White House aides in an atterrpt to discover leaks about the sec~et cambodian banbings. 23 He used the IRS to harass those who made his \"enemies list. \"24 The White House proposed creation of the \"plumbers,\" an extra-:. legal,. private, White House operation which was responsible fbr .the Ellsberg.break:....irl.25 The President was also financially enrichedby his office; the GSA reported that the United States spent $1.9 million th . . h 26 on e .NlXon c::rres. On August 8, 1974, Pre.sident. Richard Nixon announced his 180 . ' I '' resignation. About a week C.'<.~rlier, the House Judiciary Ccmnittee had approved .three articles of impeachm:mt, charging Nixon with obstn1ction of justice in connect:.ion with the Watergate scandal, abuse of presidential powers, and attempting to impede the. irrpead11rent process by defying comnittee subpoenas for eviQ.erice.27 Nixon,\u00b7 however, was not the . . ' only casualty in Watergate. Many of his aides and associates also went to jail for their roles. Among those sentenced to jail were Nixon's personal attorney and fund-raiser Herbert. W. KalJiliaok as well as forrrer CREEP officials Jeb ,Stuart Magruder, Frederick c. LaRue, and Herbert I~ . , ' ' ' Porter. White. House aides John w. Dean, Charles w. c<Jlson, D..vight L. '' ' ' ,' Chapin, John D. Ehrlichrnan and fonrer White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman also went to jail. .. Fo:rner U. S. AttoJ:ne:X Gefl.eral and director of CREEP, John P. Mitchell, was convi~ed for his role in Watergate.28 The Watergate scandal\u00b7 thus shocked .a nation and brought to tne forefrol'lt the problem of of~icial corruption; it. alSo brought about a closer pul:::>lic scrutiny of offic.i,al conduct. A1 though corruption is hardly ne.v' it nonetheless remains a serious challenge in a free society~29 Governrrel)t has becare a major force in '\u00b7 ., ' ', our econany; it regulates rrore than half o:ff' the gross natio:qal product and it detennines to sane degre~:= ' who will get rich. 30 Accordingly' abuse of official position and power has becare attractive to many gavernrrent officials. In the past decpde, the. number of public ' ' . . . : . . ' ' '\" ' ' ' officials and their confederates who have been. indicted by. the\u00b7 Fed~ral governrrent on corruption~related charges; has increased 1,100% the past ten years, 2,850 Federal, state, anq local officials have been ' ' '\" char ed . th fed 1 ff 32 Th . .. w~ \u00b7 \u00b7 era o enses. \u00b7 \u00b7 e ma]or~t~. ve \u00b7 conv~c. .. . The guilty have included a Vice President of the United States, 181 1. I .,. . . 34 governors, Federal judges, and rrembers of Congress. While organized crime plays a significant role in official corruption, it cannot be credited .with all or even rrost official corruption. In fact, organizE:rl crirre 1 s. invol venent in corruption is often exaggerated. At the sarre tirre, it is often used for political 35 purposes. The Mafia, for exarrple, is hardly the principal source of economic crimes; that status belongs to copniving white collar businessrren.. The kickbacks or other favors. that sdre coqx:>rations give h<Mever, .is. a ltEans of survival for organized crirre. 37 For this reason. organized cr~ families are willing to invest heavily in the cultivation of political friendships and favors. 38 Appar~ntly, each .crirre family has at least one pers6n who acts \"the corrupter\" of law enforcerrent officials and political officials.39 To survive, organized crime.1s goal rrust be to influence, evade, or nullify . 40 .. \u00b7the processes of governrrent. Indeed, official corruption is so l i.rrport:ant to organi:l;ed crirre. that any effective battle against organized crirre nn.Ist include a front against official corruption.41 B. Patterns of Corruption 1. .J;\u00a3:gis1ative In 1894, Mark Twain, with his usual cynical wit, wrote: \"It could probably be shONn with f:acts and figures that there is no distinctly Anerican criminal cla~s except Congress. \"4 In 1976, it was speculated ' ' . ' that \"Congress is probably cleaner than usual and in tl)e midst of a major transition to a rrore open, professional, and effective body.n43 Scandals in the past few years have. revived and nourished the old ' '. ,, . ' cyi1icisn . toward the nation 1 s legislators\u00b7. and \u00b7\u00b7 182 legislatures. Legislative corruption offers many rewards; it also takes many forms.\u00b7 Often.it is rrore effective, as well as. rrore efficient, to receive favorable legislative treatrrent than. to try to frustrate f f . . 1 44 en orcement o ex1st1ng aws. Probably the most common--and most farniliar--f6rm of legislative corruption is bribery.

At \u00b7 . e . era eve , an area of abuse that has . received. receilt attention has been so~ici ting and accepting bribes from aliens in the United States, on whose behalf a c6ngressman may introduce a special bill authorizing citizenship. 48 Although such bills are rarely successful, their introduction may significantly delay depOrtation proceedings.49 Closely related to bribery, extortion i~ another camon form of legislative corruption. \u00b7 Legislators have been .accused\u00b7 of extort:.ing money from persons or companies who could receive preferential or adverse treatrrent at their hands. 50 Hisappropriat;:ion of public funds has also occurred. Legislators have been convicted of padding the payrol~L and extorting kickbacks fr~ their. staffs, 51 as well as padding their payrolls with friends and ;elatives. 52 They have also taken kickbacks fran the awards of federal grant funds. 53 In addition, legislators, have cast votes in favor of powerful benefactors instead of \u00b7their constituents. Often, because such conflicts of interest, although not. exactly ethical, are not illegal, the legislature itself or the voters IYU.lSt take action .to correct the situation.55 Unfortunately, legislative or .voter action cannot always be depended upon; and even after conviction, legislators have been 183 D D 56 re-elected. What began in the spring of 1977 as an undercover investigation of art theft, securities forgery, and counterfeiting, grew by February 1980 into an exposure of one of the rrost far-reaching scandals in congressional history. A srrall scale anti -fencing investigation developed into the elaborate corruption probe--called Abscam--that eventually cost $800,000., involved rrore than 100 FBI agents in five cities, and resulted in the exp:::>sure of eight national legislators and at least two dozen lesser officials.58 The initial sting operation involved a professional confidence man acting as an agent for a fictitious free-spending sheik. Supposedly, the sheik was seeking to make all the rroney he could before his country fell to religious zealots, as Iran had; he also desired pernanent sanctuary in the United States, which would require the introduction of . . . . pr1 vate 1.ITrn1grat1on 1 e FBI us set a stage across 1c a host of public officials would parade, who eagerly bargained away their public trust for personal rronetary gain. One of the first public officials to becare involved in Abscam was th f arrd 1 . h . 60 h 1 ed e Mayor o c en, New Jersey, Ange o Err1c ett1, w o a so serv as a state senator in New Jersey. Errichetti proved himself a valuable participant. Not only did his participation uncover the ease with which one might buy a casino license, 61 but it was also responsible for the delivery of a United States Senator to the Abscam team~ 62 Errichetti told New Jersey Senator Harrison Williams63 about the benevolent sheik. After rreeting with the Abscam team, the Senator was convicted of agreeing to take shares in a titanium mine located in Virginia in exchange for using his senate seniority to get defense 184 I' .. ~ '' ~ ,\u00b7, .\u00b7~ contracts for the nane and for introducing an inmigration bill on behalf of the sheik. 64 \u00b7. ~Jilliams, a key man in. goverrnrent and defense contracts, knew the 1\\rrerican govcrrnrent1s need of titanium as well as the potential value of invo],verrer).t with the mine;. he also knew that he . . . ' was cannitting a federal offense in helping the mining venture in return for: a share of the profit. Nonetheless, Williams accepted phony stock ce~tific~tes in exchange ~or his cooperation--in front of hidden FBI 65 cam=ras. oth~r cong:r:-essrren eager to assist the sheik included Michael ' 66 '.\u00b7 . d Led '67 and ' hn for their pranises t6 sponsor personal inrnigration bills. 69 Murtha agreed on film to a~cept and split $50,000 with other politicians, although he never showed. to 70 collect. The congressional partiCipants were not limited to Pennysylvania congressrren. New Jer~y Congressman Frank Tharpson pranised to help the sheik solve his inmigration problem in exchange for $50 , 000, while NeW' York Congressman. John Murphy took a bribe to insure the passage of Federal legislation that would ~e the sheik 1 s $hipping indw:rtry nnre ,,.

Although there were indications that rcore public officials may have been willing to sell their public trust,78 the Abscam investigation was tenninated in February 1980.79 \\Vhen publicized, the FBI's sting confinred the public's cynical attitude that rconey can buy a legislator's loyalty and influence. 2. Executive \u00b7\u00b7Corruption of the executive branch apparently exists at all levels of goverrurent~ It does not matter whether the executive actively ,.. ' participates in corrupt activities or sinply turns his head, for\u00b7 corruption Cc3.Il flourish through sins of anission as well as . . 80 cormu.ss~on. At the Federal level, the Nixon Administration serves as the npst notorious exanple of executive corruption\u00b7 in recent yec1rs. 81 Not only did a President Fcsign under a cloud of suspicion, but. also a Vice President resigned while under indict:rcent. In 1973, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned fran office arid pleaded nolo. contendere to a charge of failing to report $29, 000. of incare. ?.4 At the tirre, Agnew was ' ' ' ' tmd.er investigation. for multip~e. charges .of alleged conspiracy, extortion, and bribery; he was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation andfined $10,000.83 In 1981, a Maryland judge ruled tnat, despite years of denials, Agnew took thousands of dollars of bribes while he was Governor of Maryland and Vice J?resident. 84 The judge ordered Mr. Agnew to repay the. state $147,500 in kickbacks, with interest 6\u00a3 $101,235. At.torneys for the taxpayers in the case clairred that the decision served as a rressage to. public officials\u00b7 that they \"can't tcU<.\u20ac it with them ... 85 186 ' At the state level, Mother Marylander was involved in corruption. In 1975, Governor MarVi.p Mandel and five associates were indicted. on rrail fraud and racketeering charges. The twenty-three count indict:rrent alleged that l'1andel accepted :E.i.nancial interests in two friends 1 \\ businesses in exchange for influencing racetrack legislation.86. Mandel and his codefend.ants were found guilty in 1977.87 A rressage seerred to errerge from the Mana.\"' 1 case that misconduct by \u00b7 \u00b7 public officials that might have been tolerat,OO il-:~\u00b7\u00b7the past would be attacked today by the press and pro~cutors}8 \u00b7 \u00b7 Fom~r Tennessee Governor Ray Blanton, who was. acCUSed of one cou:h.t of C'-'rtspiracy, one count of extortion, and eight counts of rrail fraud, did not hc<;rl t:l1e rressage. In test:Urony during Blanton 1 s kickback trial, Jack Ham, a liquor store owner and forrrer Blanton supporter described an alleged arrangerrent that. required him to \u00b7return twenty percent of his profits to Blanton in exchimge for an exclusive retail liquor license. Mr. Ham also said that he paid about $23,000 t.c:Mard retiring a.bank. loan for . . 89 beverage chainnan, S. J. King, testifia.: . that carrnission officials voted the. way the Blanton organization wanted them to vote on granting and transferring of liquor liCenSes as \"the way -we could. help friends.\" One of the biggest controversies of the. 'Blanton administration centered on his decision to pardon a murderer who was the son of one of his .leading patronage officials. H~ also granted .executive clerrency to 51 other prison irunates. As Mr. Blanton prepared . . to finish his term df office, aides and relatives went frrnr one state regulatory agency to another securing licenses f~r themselves}0 Mr. Blanton .is only the third governor to be tried on Federal criminal \u00b7\u00b7 charges. 91 187 Corruption is the trOst pervasi~e and least. controlled at the local leve1.92 The corruption of the mayors in New Jersey provide a classic example of old style big.:..city corruption.93 A Federal- grand.jury indicted Hugh J .. Addonizio, l-1a.yor of Newark, New Jer:sey1 s largest city, and 14 others, including 10 public officials qnd a Mafia leader, on charges of sharing $1.5 million in kickbacks extorted fran contractors doing business with the city. pn July 22, 1970, Addonizio was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $25,000.94 AbQut 10 y~ars later, another New Jersey mayor brought New Jersey back. i.rito the lilrelight of official corruption. \u00b7Angelo J. Errichetti, \u00b7 Mayor of canrlen, New Jer8ey during the Abscarn investigation, offered or gave FB;I: agents hot dianonds, guns and rnunitio~s, forged C.D. 1 s., counterfeit trOney, stolen .paintings, leasing contracts,. rnunicipal. garbage contracts, unregistered boats for dope running, the use of Port . . canrlen as a nareotics depot, Atlantic City zoning changes, a list of . . thirteen bribable state and city officials, as well as the vice chainnan of the State Casino Control Carmission, the chainnan of the New Jersey State Derrocratic Comnittee, and directly <?I\" indirectly five Unit\u00a2 of bribe:ry. Subur~ corruption, a fonn of .local corruption, is also a rapidly growing pattern of official corruptiOn in the ~ecutive branch. 99 Professor John A. \u00b7 Gardiner, of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, observes: In recE:!I}t years we I ve seen riassi ve corruption in connection .with .. suburban real estate~ . crossroa.ds towns [are] having .to make decisions in which large dollar apounts are at stake.

Suburban voters were willing to pay handsomely to get to work and contractors were willing to do most anything to get a piece of the action.\u00b7\u00b7 The absence of effective bidding regulations placed a great deal of power over governrrent contracts in the Baltirrore COpnty \\ ' ' ' ' I executive. 99 Both Spiro Agnew and Marvin ~\u00b71ande.l. got t.lleir starts as l. .

In At antl.C CJ.ty 1 a pattern of close relations between casino developers and local governrrent officials has errerged since gambling. was approved in 1976. 102 Other regulatory agencies are often similarly vulnerable to corrupt practice~.103 Liquor control boards are ofteil involved in corruption.104 It is a common fact that liquor licenses are sold by local politicians and that operating violations are ignored in return for undE:!rc:over :pa:yrrents in the form of canpa.igrt contributions. As such, corrupt businessrren as well as organized crim= have a major stake in the Criminal Justice System The existence of organized crime-~r any other form of systematic unlawfJil behavior--depends on favorable treatrrent frcm the crirniniH justice system.106 the justice system--law enforcerrent, prosecution, arid courts--are interrelated.

Often, the appointrrent of such a prosequtor is the aim of organized crime's considerable political influence. Next. to the corruption of the pr9secutor, the corruption of a judge proves to be most valuable to organized crime. Patten1s of scheduling, adjudication, and sentencing all fall within the court's discretion. Trial judges may be paid116 or demand favors117 for favorable rulings At the trial itself, verdicts may be directed, instructions may be tailored to produce not guilty verdicts, or the process aborted by . '. ,' ; . ' After conviction, appellate judges., too, may be bought.119 Not only is prosecutorial or judicial corruption difficult to detect, but once detected it is difficult to prosecute. Conventional \u00b7 evidence-gathering tools are often insufficient. As elected or appointed officials, judges and prose.cutors ,are figures of stature in the carmunity. .Since bri.bery is a private act between willing participants, the prosecution of a bribery charge depends primarily on ' ' the testinony of an accarplice, a witness whose crediliility can be ''', . '\u00b7: easily impeached. The involverrent of organized crime figures guarantees that any witnesses are likely to be fearful bf \u00b7 testifying. 120 . . Nonetheless, significant indictrrents and convictions have been obtained, if only fo~ perjury rather than for the substantive offense.121 191 b I . . 122 nvest1.gat1.ve Law enforcerrent officers are on the front line of society's war against crine. Perhaps that is why there are so many casualties among thtz3group - not from bullets but from corruption. Corruption among investigative agencies has been a serious problem for many years. Since before the turn of the century, for example, major probes of police corruption in New York City have occurred on an average of one every twenty years. Corrupt concli b.ons exposed by one investigation seem substantially unchanged .when the n~xt investigation cares along.124 Although not the only fonn. of corruption, l. . . . tutes a s ::;tantl.a. port1.on. e s eer numbers of police present more opport~ities for corruption.126 It is also possible to corrupt a police officer in more overt ways than a . 127 . . judge or prosecutor. Pol1.ce corruption presents a special area of concern. When the law enforcerrent apparatus of a camuJnity is tainted, 128 corruption can flourish in the whole system. \u00b7 One of the most important concerns, too, is the public attitude police corruption creates. To most people, the police officer is the. law. An individual officer' s corruption, therefore, may be interpreted as corruption of the 129 entire system. From the perspective of corruption, police officers have been classified into three groups: . I call them the birds, the grass ea:tc!rs, and therreat eaters. The birds. just fly up high. They don't .eat anything either ~use they are honest or because they don't have any good opportunities. You've got to figure that half the force is in jdbs . The Tactical Police Force and\u00b7the Safety Division, for exanple . where there are lit tie or\u00b7 no pickups. The grass eaters, well .. they'll accept a cup of coffee or .a free ~al or a television set wholesale from a rrerchant, but they draw a line. The rreat eaters are different. 'l'hey're but looking. They're on a pad with gamblers, they deal :j..n jUnk138r they'll carpromise a homicide The tenn \"soliciting\" descril;:les the actions of the \"rreat-eaters,\" those officers who aggresively misuse their police :power for per,sonal \u00b7gain. The activities of such police officers ~e part.ially conditioned ' ' ' l by the opportunities their assignrrents present to them, that is, plainclothesnen generally have rrore op-pJrtunity\u00b7than.uniforrred PJlice and those entrusted with control of vice generally have rrore opportunities than thOse assigned to d.:i.rect traffic. Accordingly, the kinds and sources of payqffs providB a \u00b7convenient org~izing principal. for exainining the , \u00b7\"Pads\" paynent o~ rroney for violations of the 1a:w.131 A Pad may q.e .. arranged under threat of arrest or .canplaint. Under sare circumstances, a person starting an illegal operation will arrange beforehand to make payrrents in order to :i.rrprov'e his op-pJFtuni ties for bargaining over the siz.e of the tribute.132 Typicc:tlly 1 pads are cooperative ventures that pr~tect. in-q=ntionall y unlawful . activities. Thus, canplaints are few, and all participants have a vested interest in ~ing their conduct as hard to trace as -pJssib:le. Pads \u00b7a.re collected by a ''bagman\" and pooled for di9tribution to those \u00b7iD on the action. Command officers sametirres have a separate pad, and when they participate in the general pad, it is\u00b7 usually on a multiple share basis.133 The share per man or the arrount paid by a briber is known as the \"nut.\"134 Understandably, long...;.tenn fiXed-location enterprises are the rrost frequent source of pad~.135 'lhe numbers racket and other overt gambling operations present a clear opportunity for this kind of bribery 136 .. The Knapp C<mnission. reported. that the nut for protection of gambling in sa:re New York City districts ran as high as $1500 per policeman per rronth. \u00b7 Reassigrnrent 193 ' I.\u00b7. \u00b7\u00b7. of entire plainclothes squads resulting fran corruption investigations. indicates that the practice was widespread and pervasive,138 In addition gambling pads often involve supervipory police persorme1.139 The pad in a gambling operation pays for protection fran all but token police harrassment. The services bought include. freedan fran arrest by officers on the pad\u00b7 and J?reventiop of or warnings about ~ding raids by those not on the take.140 When arrests under I pressure of a quota .. are needed, the gqmb).er often is allowed to select . . ' \u00b7 an .underling, with a relatively clear record, or a paid~ff addict as a 11 tand u141 s J,n. \u00b7 I;Ieavily regulated legitimate industries are another lucrative source of police payoffs. The construction industry must deal with a maze of regulations concerning building techniques, specifications of practices, stapdards, and safety rreasures, A large construction project, inNew York City, for example, may be required to. obtain as many as 130 permits to achieve technical carrpliance with all regulations, a task which is virtually impossible to fulfill. Those. charged with enforcerrent, including the p:::>lice, have been paid for many years to ignore minor .infractions.142\u00b7 The pads for. police, usually solicited unde~ threat of harassrrent, 143 tend to be small, since only minor penalties are inposed for building code violations. Motels, hqtels, restaurants, . and nost . inportantly, liquor ~tores and bars are licensed premises subject to regulation and J?\u20acriodic license \u00b7renewal. The depertd,ence of these bUsinesses on the continuation\u00b7 of their license status has traditionally put them at the\u00b7 rrercy of those persons charged with. enforcing the\u00b7. ~89Ulat:ions controlling such establiShnents, including the p:::>lice.144 The .rrethod solicitation 194 :;,\\:\u00b7 .I is comtotu 145 tl1c policemcm finding a technical violc:ttion threatens to <::mdanger the operation's license by filing an official rcp::>r:t.

'l'he noney paiO. protec-ts the licensed premises .from harassment, and in. the case of bars, it may also pay for altering police reports of fi<]hts between i)atrops.146 Since protection of the license is vital to continuation of the business, the tributes demanded ' ,1, are likely to be large~\u00b7\u00b7 rrhe situation is exacerbated by the freque~1t . . use of bars by persons involved in other illegal conduct,\u00b7 including prostitutes, drug dealers, and\u00b7 petty fences. Other bu13inese;es seeking protection from enforcenent of laws affecting them may also pay tribute. Where parking restrictions are strict, restaurants, cab and trUcking carrpanies, \u00b7and manufacturers may pay to have violations overlooked.147 Unlicensed bars may pay in order to cont.inue in operatien.148 Pads may also be paid for non .... enfG>rC\"err\u20acnt of Sabbath laws and regUlations concerning pedQlers.149 Prostitution, particularly in fixed locations such as brothel$ and massage parlors, is 1 . . . \u00b7f. 1 150 a so a \u00b7 regu ar paytrents. A \"score\" or \"shakedown11 is a one-titre pa~nt that buys the freedom of a person sfuject to arrest.151 Particularly in narcotiqs 152 153 cases the payoffs can be. startingly large. narcotics..:.relat.ed bribery has been tre~.ditionally r:-egru::ded mores and high profits motJ.Vat.J.ng mcreasmg relaxation of the traditional inhibitionagainst such briliery.154 In addition, lenient courts give police a ra:tionalization for procet..Xiing vigilante-style to \"punish\" dru9 offenders. r.'btorists and .small 195 :,1\u00b7.\u00b7.\u00b7 lr:\u00b7 ). scores. \\'Jhen-a his livelihcx .xl and carJ lose it for too Illi:;l:ny t.raffic citations, he may be teitpted \u00b7to offer a bribe for overl(X)king an infraction. 15.5 'row truck companies o\u00a3\u00b7ten obtain repair business from the \u00b7 owners of vehicles they tow.

Conplaints are IIOJ:'e frequent :tn score cases than in pad cases, particularly if the extorted party cares to believe that he could have avoided conviction after the payoff. \u00b7 \u00b7 'rhe illegal withholding of money or contraband seized while making an arrest is closely related. to the score. No:r:mall y, noney and contraband are held as evidence.

These practices. are best\u00b7 described as \"accepting.\" 'l'hey are inportant because of their pervasiveness and the resultant climate in which a \"code of silence\" ' ,', ', aiiDng policerren develops.175 Policemen who are themselves vulnerable are less likely to expqse other corrupt policemen fpr fear of endangering their own. positions. Accordingly, it has been. theorized that the pervasiveness of \"accepting\" encourages those policemen w~th a predilection for engaging in IIDre serious. fonns of corruption.176 Finally, acceptance of gratuities may care to be regarded as a right . . . .. 177 that is enforceable bY extort~on. The JIDst widespread fonns of accepting involve free neals, drinks, hotel rooms, .and other day to day axrenities. A restaurant or bar nay decline to charge a policeman for food or drin]<s or may charge at a reduced rate. The establishrrent may be ~rerel y expressing good will .or 198 may be encouraging police presence in hopes of avoiding trouble from patrons. \u00b7 'l'he establ.i.shment may be buying consideration, discretion, and quick response in the event of future trouble. Silni1arly, hotels will frequently give gratuities \u00b7to policerren in the fonn of free or reduced rate rooms and neals. The comer drugstore may donate an occasional }:kl.Ck of cigarettes and the grqcery. an occasional candy bar. Abuses of these \"privileges\" are possible.

It. is PJoSible, for oxa111plc, to adopt the policy of a \"wide-open town. n185 It is also possible \u00b7to have -the department orgc.~nized so that the need tb corrupt i::; minimized or the possibility of effective police action virtually eliminated. A . I . 1.. . \u00b7 puttern . Police .c:tc-tivity against the major endeavors of orgartizC:.>d crime is centralized ih one special squad in \u00b7the departrrent. Men not assigned to tl1at unit are required to refer organized matters to the exclusive unit. It is thus necessary only to corrupt thaturtit to subvert polic~ activity. Indeed, it rnaynot even be necessary to oorrupt that unit.

Se ect1ve law enforcerrent has its advantages. It helps cr~ate an illusion of honest enforcernent, while it secures the reality of illegal monopoly. It\u00b7. is possible, too, to build planned illegalities .. into enforcement techniques, which will cause even honest courts to throw out cases. on the grounds that constitutional rights have been violated. The practice 1s known as the \"tipoVer raid.\"189 It lS d1ff1cult to p1npoint the causes of corruption. Several \u00b7 theories have been advanced. First, the \"bad apple\" theory190 :::nggests that it is not reasonable tu look for an explanation of corruption for. two reasons: 1} corruption is limited to a few \"bad\" policemen; and 2) generalities concerning the cause of police corruption, if there are 200 \u00b7~\u00b7 \u00b7,', '' ,,,,, any, will b0 found in the canton personality characteristics of :individu~tl corr\u00b7upt policemen~ 'I'ypically, the strongest proponents of this theory nre. nenlbers of the upper. echelons of JX)lice hierarchies,. theory seems \u00b7to prescribe vigilance and strict discipline as a solution to corruption within .<l c1eparanent\u00b7 0nd Btrict screening procedures to keep the depc1rtnent clean. Unfortunately, this theory is also sorreti.rres used to cover up departmental .inability or unwillingness to copewith a substantial problem and make systemic refonn. Nevertheless, . this explanation fails to account for the widespread practice of \"accepting, '1 and to the degree that it acts as a . rationalization for failing to make needed. refonns, it may be hannful. Second, several investigations have advanced the theory that the inhe.rent pressures of police work make corruption inevitable. Rubinstein in particular believesthat.the pressures t0 make vice arrests compel behavior patterns that tend to lead to corruption.191 Various segrrents of society, honest and otherwise, often attempt to buy official good will, official protection, or official inaction in response to the perseivect benefit or threat that a pqliceman p<?ses. Policerren as a group. tend to perceive society as hostile to their \u00b7ro~e}92 These factors carbine to create a climate in which peer pressure makes it hard for a rookie to remain honest, despite his cqnscious \u00b7 bitentiou to do su.193 This Ureo:ry suggests that UreLe rue few practical techniques shOrt of massiye decriminalization of police regulatory activity for combatting corruption, .other than intensive . . campaigns to .prosecute citizens who atterrpt. to bribe policaren. . . Third, the Knapp \u00b7comnission also advanced the related .theory 201 I. I tha\u00b7t the cmforcem.:.m\u00b7t of .certain classes of laws placed policerren into sit:uations wher\u00b7e the temptation to slip into corrupt practices is \u00b7too strong. 'l'heir recomrrenda\u00b7tions are. \u00b7the decriminalization of many practices now covered by the vice l4ws and the shifting of enforcen~nt responsibilities for other laws from the police to agencies in which \u00b7. 194 society can !~utter afford cor-rup\u00b7t1on. 'l'he failings of this theory are its apparent. acquiescence the problem and the counterproductive precedent that the solution it proposes might. establish. Lit\u00b7tle can be accomplished without a massive shift--tmlikely tooccur--in regulatory roles.. E'urtherrrore, if every corruption hazard we:~::e rerroved from :the province of police enforcerrent, it would then be possible to. envision the day when }_X)licc forces were left with nothing to do but control. the corruption of \u00b7other E' lL-_, mt agencies. Fourth, several comrentators have expressed the belief that the. widespread practice of'accepting gratuities creates a climate in which policen~ pred;i.sposed to aggressive \"soliciting'' may proceed with little . . . fear of harassrrent. The \"code of silence\" created by this practice protects \"acceptor\" and \"solicitor\" alike. 'I'his theory presents both a rerredy and an investigative tooL \u00b7If the acc::ceptance of ~ratuities can be curtailed by prosecuting both those who offer and those who acc~pt gratuities, then policemen entering a department will not became involved, and the \"code of silencc::e\" will. eventua~ly be broken. A policeman willing to test1fy abOut pol1ce C:orrupt1on may prove very valuable.196 Yet, the obvious problenlS presented by the prosecution of every restaurant owner who offers a free neal and every pbliceman who acce}?ts it underscore the practical limitations of this theory. Fifth, policemen in sane cities are comronly regarded to be on the 202 I. .,., \\~ ' t. 197 . tclke even if they are honest, an attitude that tends, according \u00b7to sone, to become as u self-fulfilling prophesy. In gencrul, people tend to act. as others expect them to ac-t. Consequeritly, the result is the creation of a cl.ilnat.e in which corruption becanes the expected. norm. Sixth, along rnore practical lines two related thebries speculate that. weak c:ci.minal scmctions and ta.x enforcem:mt ac-tually produce corruption. Where convictions are obtained in a la.v percentage of prosecutions and the sentences iniposed are minimal, the police may be tempted to nP1.ll1ishn \u00b7a r:erceived criminal vigilante-style. The result may be a narcotic score or ~ gambling pad. Illegal investigating techniques may also be used to harass an illegal operation. Although inapplicable to all forms of corruption, this theory does suggest that prosecutions that lead to a higher conviction rate and stiffer sentencing may renove the rationalization supporting sorre corrupt police practices.\u00b7 Seventh, along s...rr~:~\u00b7. ~ines, low conviction rates199 and mild sanctions suffered by corrupt policemen may encourage a policeman to take his chances with profit.able corrupt practices. Indeed, l3are police departments will allow corrupt policemen to retire\u00b7 with pension while d . . er mvest~gat~on or corrupt~on. ne to rethink these . policies is nanifest. It would be comforting--at least for sare--to believe that law enforcement corruption was. limited to the local level. Unfortunately, no agency--local, state or Federal--is, apparently, irrmune fran corruption. The FBI, for exanple, enjoyed a reputation of incorruptibility. Forner FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, it has been suggested, ma.Cie possible this reputation by having agents solve bank 203 ,'\",! h0ists and kidnapping. r::l'f\u00b7h -than cor.rupt.iou\u00b7 201 among ag~nts. Many observer\u00b7s believe that Hoover s concern with int.crnal corruFtion explains his ref1,1sal for so long to admit to the existence of organized crirre.202 Hoover feared, according to some, that its huge fin<:lncial resour:\u00b7ces might pe too much for some F'BI agents \u00b7to . 203 res1st. There may be some truth to Hoover's reputed fears. Now that organizeo crime and white-collar cr:i.ne have becare top FBI priorities, agents have, in fact, become nore vulnerable to corruption. Indeed, a recent series of twenty-three murders of FBI underworld informants and rx:>ssible goverrunent witnesses in a t:wo-year period have raised questions of possible leaks or sellouts within the FBI. 204 While maintaining their traditional cool on the outside, the killings so disturbed FBI officials that they set up a special squad in Washington to investigate the matter, completely revamped their procedures for handling underwo~ld informants, 205 and came to think the unthinkable: that the Mafia may ha d d . ' . ' th', ' 206 ve succee e 1n penctrat1ng e FBI. In 1975, Irene Kuczynski, then 22, of Bayonrte, New Jersey, testified that wher1 she worked as a clerk typist she stuffed photoc~py ,documents into her purse and girdle and gave them to her husband, woo sold them to John DiGi:Lio. Arrong the doc'UIIertts were ~s of informants, two of which \u00b7were arcong the victims of the \u00b7 22 caliber killings. Mrs. Kuczynski was the first FBI employee to be convicted of 21l7 a felony since 19 24. \u00b7-:. \u00b7-'8 are indications, however, that had she been an agent her corruption would not have been so thoroughly 208 .exposed. 204 ';)', ' j ',', rl'hc fo'BI office i.n Indianapolis was . . . suspicion of the agentu were tram;fcrred within a year.

Depe:u::tnent of Justice is the focus of efforts to control organized crime and official corruption. Several divisions within the Uepartm:~nt have jurisdic\u00b7tion i.n these areas. 'l'he 'i'ax Division is responsible for representing the United States and .all i\u00b7ts officers in both criminal and civil litigation arising ' ' \"~27 priority fm:\u00b7 1980.228 .~ crilninal tax prosecution program is responsible for prosecuting and deterring violations of the criminal tax laws of the United States. This program .constitutes a substantial corrponent of the De~nt' s White Collar Crime Program; it also provides support tO the Justice Depart:Irent' s Organized Crime Program, by contributing apprOpriate attorney staff assistance and expertise in the review, investig.:-tinn -:ond prosecution of organized crime figures ' ' f ' . 1 . 229 or tax v1o at1ons.

Recognizb1g the\u00b7gravity of the official corruption problem, the Justice Department also crea~ the Public IntegritySectionwithin the Criminal Division in 1976.232 The Public Integrity .Section is charged with enforqerrent of. the Federal criminal statutes dealing with 207 1'-;' t\u00b7 governnental j .. provides a central authorit.y for handling C.;lSes involving the violation of a wide variety of statutes by public servants. 'l'he Public Int.egrity Section is designed \u00b7to consolidate C:riminal DiVi$ion supervision of.and participation in enforcement of statutes aimed primarily at abuse by publicofficialH (graft, elt?ction offenses, bribery, conflict of interest) . and \u00b7those statutes' capable of being violated by others' where . such officials ar\u00b7e involvE:.'<i (extortion, fraud, racketeering, perjury, obstruction .of justice) The similarity of criminal activity in both situations, along with .the need. to canbat corruption through the use of a broad spec~ of statutes, r~r this consolidat-ion essential. 233 'l'he Public Integrity Section's' responsibility for direct litigation and litigation support requires close liaison with all United States ''' ,I I ,' p.ttorneys 1 offices, various internal investigation components of the federal governrrent, and the Public C~rruption Units of the I''BI. 234 The Federal Bureau of Investigation, ano~ segrrent of the Justice Department, plays a most significant role iD the fight against placed major emphasis on organized crirre .. and white collar crime in fiscal year 1980.236 In its Organized Crime Program, tl1e FBI has established as its long term goal to curtail systemmatically, effectively, and progessively the sphere of organized criminal influence and smltaneously reduce J.tS J.Irpa.Ct on AlrerJ.can sC>c.l.ety. To attam : ,, that long term goal, the FBI has. set. for itself the short. term objective of directing innovati \"='. r-\u00b7\"''nsive, and effective investigative techniques ~n a sustained level at the organized criminal \u00b7.elerrent to 208 deprive it of its lucrative sources of revenue. This objective targets 'tl1o most. powerful leaders o:E \u00b7the organized criminal elenent <md \u00b7 Whi\u00b7te--collar crirre238 investigation const;Ltutes another:\u00b7 top priority of the FBI. As in organized crilre, white-collar crilre often involves official oon-uption. 239 \u00b7 'l'he PBI has established as the program's long-term goal to detect, investigate, and provide . . . ' 1\u00b7 ' h' te. 11 its short-term objective, the FBI emphasizes \"quality over quantity, II in an effort \u00b7to maximize effectiveness by concentrating on nore ,\u00b7 ,. ,', I ' ' productive investigations. 241 Public corruption is one. of the FBI's top I ' ' I inves\u00b7tigative priorities within the White Collar Crirre program. This selec\u00b7ted targeting of FBI resources242 is\u00b7 expected to achieve significant results involving. corruption of public officials.243 Akey to sucC!=!SS in organized crilre .and official corruption investigations has often been the cooperation of gover:nnvent agencies with each other. 244 At one tirre, the Internal Revenue Service was considered. law enforcenent' s nost effective weapon .. against organized cr:ine. 245 The 'l'ax Refonn Act of 1976246 severely restricts the ' ' ' . activities of tax investigatOrs and the infonnation they can share.with ' .247 other law enforcerrent. agencies. Sene contend that these restrictions severely inhib:Lt the fight against organized cri:tre.248 At present, ,\u00b7 249 ' t.l'lere l.S artiffiCln'lefis ' . 250 pronu.ses o c oser cooperat1.on. Clearly, the emphasis placed on organized c:d.ne and crime control inriova\u00b7tive :'\u00b7 techniques of law enforcenent,', techniques that include the a variety of 209 I -~. inveHtigat installations and consensual recording devices. Another aspect of the federal effort must be underscored. In rrost states, it has been federal rather than state law enforcerrent officials who have taken the lead in uncovering andprosecuting official corruption. Indeed, intensified fed~ral attacks against corruption appear one of the rrore hopeful responses to post-Watergate' s demands for .. \u00b7 251 . . . cleaner governrrent.. Federal prosecutors are attackmg state and ,' ' I ' local corrupt officials by stretching existing Federal statutes that . . . were original! y \u00b7targe-ted against other \u00b7types mail swindlers, organized \"252 'I'he Kerner, fonrer Governor of Illinois and forrrer United States Appeals Judge, is, for example, a najor. milestone in this respect. For the first t:i.Ire, the courts upheld the use of mail fraud to \u00b7 prosecute scherres \"to defraud the state of uncorrupted services of elected and appointed officials.\"253 Originally aimed at labbr violence, \u00b7the Hobbs Act. ha9 been used in New Jersey, Illinois, and Pennsylvania to prosecute public officials who, instead of making oyert threats against businessmen, use victims' fear of economic loss to . . . extort a. cut off the top of nrunicipal and governrrent contrac'l!s. 254 \u00b7\u00b7Federal prosecutors have used these laws to uncover official corruption that might otherwise rernain undetected. Most state and local authorities have been too preoccupied with street crime. 'I'hey are also functional! y unable .to reach these problems, as they too often lack the sophisticated investigative tools and personnel that are necessary \u00b7to establish a case of official corruption.255 210 One of the most successful tcdmiques in tmcovcring official corruption h;, for exc.unple, the corruption t, a tcch11ique lhat . requires trained account . .ing \u00b7 investigators. In New .Jersey, fonrcr U. S. Attorney Herbert Stein developed a technique of going into a community cold, subpoenaing the books and records, and combing through them for .r\u00b7 -d \u00b7 ' 256 Fed 1 to. :traces OJ.: grat t un corrupt1on. . \u00b7 era prosccu around the\u00b7. h 11 'ed-th' 1que. \u00b7. 'l'he undercover sting operation and the use of judicially\"-approvc:.u electronic sUrveillance installations or consensuq.l recording gevices are also ilT!pOrtant tools in uncov~ring official .corruption. Oftent the cr~s involved in official corruption are consensual crilres that do not armow1ce \u00b7thci\\ISelves. Undercover opera\u00b7tions and electronic surveillance allow investigators to go below the layers of secrecy and reach the most sophisticated and r::otentially the most dangerous criminals~25~ Without these techniques, a bribe between two. consenting individuals may go \u00b7 unrer::orted. If it j s report-ed, one o.f the. participants is often a les.:: than trustworthy crirre figure whose test:i.nony is often ~achable against that of a public official with stature in the conmunity. Undercover operations help the prose~tion present cases with solid, direct evidence as opr::osed to circums\"tflltial evidence. Test:i.nony cpu be taken from a. direct observer of the cr~ and augrrented by unimpeachable video and oral tapes. 259 The undercover operat1ons and electronJ.c\u00b7 surveillance techniques have been successful in linking same rnajor organized crirre leaders with ' ' \u00b7'' official corruption. In conducting an investigation of the Kansas City nob, the FBI oonitored more than 400 hours of conversation tl1rough telephone taps and bugs hidden in secret meeting places. 'l'he 211 transcripts revealed close. t.ies between nwsters and public oificials26\u00b70 and led to the conviction. of Nicholas C.ivella, \u00b7the rcpnLccJ boss of the I<ansas.

The indic;:t:Irent was basc'Ci largely on tapes from concealed. recording devices worn by FBI undercover agents. Other indictments resulting from the undercover investigation include those of Billy .Wayne Clayton, speaker of the. Texas House of Representatives and then Lt.

Heroin 1. Introduction Heroin is the primary addictive drug used .in the United States.1 In 1974, an est.inated 450,000 addicts used eight to ten tons of heroin a ') year.\u00b7- I\u00b7t is also the Iros\u00b7t lethal drug. For much of the period frorll 1965-1980, heroin was the number one cause of death between the ages of 15-35.3 \u00b7 In 1965, thE: b'-.._ ......... problem was confined pr.inarily to inner-city ghettoes. During the late 1960 1 s and early 1970 1 s, heroin use spread across the nation, becoming so widespread that the President of the United States declared narcotics Public Enemy Number One .in 1971.4 During the last decade, the flow of h~roin to the .United States has fluctuated, as the governii\"el1t has been able to curtail several sources of supply. Nevertheless, by 1980, despite all governii\"el1ta~ and law enforcement efforts, heroin remained plentiful, and its use was reported increasing.5 The manUfacture of herom 1s prohib:t.ted in nost nations by international code, 6 and virtually all of it entering the united States is produced illegally. 7 Illicit heroin is produced :from opium, the production of which is, legal in several nations, but nost of. the opium that is used in heroin manufacture is produced illegally.8 221 :\u00b7(\u00b7 ... II ,I rr\u00b7\u00b7 J?or many years, the main source of opium bound for the United States as heroin was 'l'urkey, switching during the last decade to Mexico and then Southeast l\\sia.9 In 1980, the \"Golden Crescent\" nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran ,supplied the majority of heroin reaching the United States.10 Opiwu is derived from the puppy plant, which may also be chewed .c:md snoked as a mild drug, but is nost valuable for its norphine content. Opium gum taken fran ripe poppy pods is chemically reduced in weight and volume by 90 percent to produce norphine base, an off-white powder that is the ma.in ingredient of heroin.11 The In:)rphine base is then smuggled to a laboratory, where it is refined through a relatively s:i.rrple process into pure heroin. rrhe heroin is then smuggled into the United States, where organized rings of distributors and pushers reduce purity to a street level of anywhere fran 3-10 percent.12 The price of the drug accelerates rapidly as it is refined and handled by different. organizations on its way. fran the poppy field to the addict. In 19651 a rn. --;_sh farner received an average of $350 .tor ten kilograms (about 22 lbs.) of opium gum.13, Converted to one kilogram (about 2.2 lbs.) of norphine base, smugglers paid $700 for it in Turkey.14 Refined to heroin in E'rartce, \u00b7the drug would sell for $3~500 per kilogram before shipnent to the United States.15 A New York wholesaler could.then sell the kilogram of pure heroin for an average of $18,000.16 Reduced to 5 percent purity and sold on the street at $5..:.8 for a bag containing 2 grams (about 1/220 oz.) of diluted heroin, the entire kilogram Of heroin was worth about $225,000.17 By the late 1970s, the average street price for a kilogram of diluted heroin w~s up $600 000 ' Y .. k C't lS to \u00b7 , . 1n . 1 y. 222 ' -~-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7-~ Alnost all of the heroin sold illegally in the United States is smugglc'<:l iu from outs ... c.k. \u00b7 \u00b7. _ country organiz~::;-.ct g~oups of criminals. 1 q .l,he largo number ot addicts and the high price they are willing \u00b7to pay for heroin make the Uni\u00b7ted States the principal world market. 20 La Cosa Nostra (I.CN) is thought to have controlled .95 percent \u00b7of the heroin traffic in the United States in i965.21 New.York City was the main distribution point for the rest of the nat.ion, and then u. S. Attorney Hobert M. Morgenthau stated in January 1965 that there was not a single large-scale narcotics importing activity in NeW York independent of LCN contro1.22 A network of Corsica:t~-French traffickers supplied LCN with Turkish opium, refined into heroin in Marseille and transported to tne . . d s b . 23 Un1te 'tates y cour1ers. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, LCN involvemmt in heroin trafficking lessened, primarily because of the collapse of the Turkish-French heroin network in 1972 and the continued convictions of important LCN rnembers.24 Yet, the 1974 conviction of Lucchese family boss Cannine 'l'ramunti for conspiracy to distriliute multi --kilograms of heroin and cocaine and Bonanno family boss Cannine Galante's heroin trafficking fran 1974-1979 derronstrate that even the most powerful LCN rrenbers continue to be involved in the traffic. 25 The LCN did, however, lose its near-monopoly in heroin trafficking. In .New 'York, Puerto Rican and Black groups began to daninare the distril::!ution of heroin, and throughout the rest of the United States Mexican organizations began the importation arid distriliution of low quality heroin fran Mexican poppy fields. By 1980, heroin trafficking had becane divided a:rron!.J r ...rrerous organizations, with no bne group corning near the I.CN monopoly of 'l'he response to organized heroin trafficking <Joined new. emphasis in 1971, with President Nixon 1 s \"declaration of war\" against narcotics. Fran 1970-1980, the federal governrrent1s expenditures on narcotics-related activities increased seventeen times, from $46.5 million t..c. $01 ~ niillion. 26 Despite the .increase in expenditures, the Drug Enforcerrent.Administration estimated in early 1981 that only 2-5 percent of the heroin entering the. counti:y was seized.27 Iri 1980, the heroin problem in the United states remained at a crisis level. Now Manhattan pis~ict Attorney, Robert ~. Morgenthau stated, \"It 1 s the single nost frustrating problem that I 1ve got. n28 Although heroin is no longer the pr:i.roary inccare producer anong illegal drugs--cocaine and marijuana now produce an estimated $33 billion in sales annually--heroin sales equalled an estimated $6.7-8.2 billion in 1979.29 Gover:rnrent. officials state \"that law enforcem:mt agencies. have been caught unprepared by the recent surge of heroin from the Golden Crescent. 30 Heroin will remain, therefore, a seveFe problerl1 in the United States at least until this new source of heroin is eradicated and . . the organized criminal syndicates i.nporting and di,stributing it are dismantled. 2. Technical ... chemical derivatives, and synthetic equivalents.1 Many opiates are nedically valuable, .such as no:rphine apd codt;!ine. Morphine is :primarily prescribed for pain relief in the United States.2 Heroin is an illicit 224 ' ' \u00b7;.,\u00b7\\ ' t ., dm~ivative of norphine, 3 which may be lawfully .,-d 'l mate Ire J.Ca purpose. Possession of heroin or participation in. any transaction involving heroin is a criminal uffensc.5 Heroin is a depressant: It relieves anxiety and' t,ension and diminishes tl1e sex, hunger, and oilier primary drives. It may also produce drowsiness and cause ine;~bility to concentrate, apatl1y and lessened physical acttvity. It can impair ~rental and physical perfonnance. When injected, the. heroin produ~es a \"rush\" of euphoria, followed later by drowsJness and relaxation. 7 It lowers the respiration ratE:; an . ' . ' ' 8 overdose .can cause respiration to cease. Heroin is also .;1ddictive. The bcx:ly quickly builds up a tolerance for heroin, along with a physical dependence. Without heroin, an addict goes into withdrawal, vhir.l-> -'~reduces seve+e vaniting, muscle aches,. 1,, ' \u00b7, ' cranps, chills, fever, and pain throughout the body for a riri.nimum period 9 of 24-48 hours. Heroin may be snoked, rolled in a cigarettE: like marijuana, or sniffed like cocaine.10 Most Arrerican users prefer \"main-lining, 11 intravenous injections, to maximize the euphoric rush.11 Once a person becares an addict, he needs heroin everyday. In . I 1964, the average user spent $12.50 per da.y and purchased an average of . ' 2.6 bags, for an annual expenditure of $5,000.12 In 19701 it 'Was estimated. consuned twelve $5 bags of heroin . a. day. 13 Each bag contained about 1 grain (1/ 440 oz. ) to \u00b7 1-1/2 grains of 5 percent pure herom.14 This averaged out to $60 a da}' or about $22,000 a year. In 1965, there were 52,793 known heroin addicts in the United 225 States.15 l3y_ 1970, the figure had risen to 322,000.16 Heroin use ' reached its highest level i.n.l974, whcm the Bureau Narcotics and '' \u00b7.. 17 Dangerouse Drugs (BNDD) reported 722,500 the number oi addicts had declinE:.xl to 400.,000 -450,000, but appeared to be . . 18 n.s1.ng. b. 'l'he. Poppy Plant The ultimate source of all heroin is the poppy plant. The poppy is grbwn throughout the temperate zone, primarily' in areas where little else can .be piiofit:ably .. cul~ivated. In the early 1970s, 80 .~rqent: of .the heroin in the Un.it~d States ccure fran. Turkish poppies.19 I ' ,' . .the Anatolian pl.3.t~au in Turkey, the poppy-seeds are sown: in the full. In Ux.! sprin<J, the :fl.c:Miers bloom with white or purple pe\u00b7tals, while the fields are weeded and hoed.2\u00b0 The plant ri~ns by late J\u00b7~e or early July, and the pod on top of the plari:t swells with opium gurn.21 .'I'.he pods have to be cut at the right rraten:t or the opium will be lost. If cut too soon, the opium spills to the ground instead of oozing out ,and congealing on the pen 1'\"' surface. If the cut is made tob late, the . . . 6d 1. turns 1.nt.o c e1.ne_, a ess power u narcotl.c. In addition, the incision has to be .correct; if cut too. deep, the. opium gum will be diluted by the plant 1 s other juice;s; if cut too sru:tllow it produce~ less , .

Opium The gum is the only part of the poppy not used by the fa.nrers themselves. ln rl'urkey, opirmt .is \u00b7 u~ed base; the leaves crre used for: salads; poppy seeds are used in bread; the enpty pods feed the livestock, and stalks provide ceiling materia1.28 Much of the opium produced from poppies is used for legitlinate nedical purposes. 29 ri'he United States prod~ces no opil.:un. Illicit opium production is widespread, often in the sane countries that legally grOW' it. In 1972, two-thinJs of the opitmt in rlurkey was sold illegally \u00b7to drug smugglers who paid 20 percent npre than the government. 30 'I'he main sources of illicit opium entering the l]ni ted States are the Golden Triangl~ countries of Burma, Laos, and Thailand and the C:Dlden Crescent nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. Turkey and !JJexico supplied the majority of opium to the United States during the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1962, Turkey reportedly produced 10 rretric tons for the illicit market, JIDst going to the United States. 31 During the sarre period, l'lffidcan production was aliiDst negligible, while an estimated 1000 rretric tons was illegally produced in the. Golden Triangle, aliiDst all of it for local consun:ption}2 Heavy F>roduction in the GOlden Crescent .was also for local consumption. Estimates of illicit production l:lecane more precise during the \u00b71970s. The World Opium Survey, produced by a u. s. cabinet cpnmittee in 1972, placed annual '.11 ; r:-~ production for 1971 at between 35-80 nEtric 227 ,',I 1 \"'I 1'.'\\ .t tons (1 ,000 k;ilogrc:uns) for illegal use, Mexico 10-20 metric tons, the Golden 'l'ri<mgle 700 m2tric tons, 1\\fghanistan 100 rretric tons und Pakistan 20..,.160 rretric tons. 34 By 1975, Turkish production for the illicit market had bt.--en reduced to v;irtually zero, while Mexico had . . d 1' od .. xl 450 netric tons, while Afghanistan produced 150 metric tons and Pakiston 200 n-etric tons. 36 By 1979, Mexicun production had been reduced to 10 rretric tons, while Golden Triangle prQduct;ion fell to an esti.nated 160 ~tric tons after a severe drought.37 The Golden Crescent nations n~ lead the world in production of illicit opium, with 1979 figures at 300 ~tric tons for Afghanistan, 700 metric tons for Pakistan and 600 ~tric tons 38 for Iran. If the opium is intended for the illicit market, the farmer shapes it into circular loaves that can be indefinitely stored until collected by smugglers. While the opium itself can be srroked or chewed as a mild drug, it is valuable because of its norphine content. Smugglers convert the gum to norphine base, un off-white powder that is the main . f h . 39 mgr . .1.ent o erom. Smugglers prefer to handle morphine base because it reduces the weight and vol\\.lll'e of the opium by 90 pe.rcent;., 40 and can be stored indefinitely. d. Morphine Base '1'0 produce norphine base, opitnn is placed in a barrel filled with hot water and calcium carbonate. 41 The opium is. broken down into norphine base solution and waste water. The water is filtered away, leaving the dark brown norphine base solution. 42 .Armonium sulfate powder is added, and the base solution is ventilated. The rrorphine base 228 I l:;c\u00b7ttlcs to tho bottom of. the barrel, and the waste is filtered out ugain. 'l'hc wet norphine base then either is placed \u00b7to dry out.sicle or dried ove1\u00b7 a fire. ~'Jhen dr.iE:.\"'d, it is placed in plastic bags and I 'dd 43 . 'I ' ' ' 1 d h th n en.

Sllllp e an c eap; e necessary eqUi:pment can be purchased for under $25. 44 Whatever, \u00b7 the origin of the opiwn or U1c lcx;ation of the 1abora:tory, the process is the same. e. Heroin !~fining cmd Processing Conversion of Inol-phine base to heroin is a much more complex process, which varies considerably fran area to area. The French chemists operating out of laboratories in and around Marseille prcxiuce. the purest heroin; they treat morphine base.with acetone and heat it to 212 degrees. 45 'l'he acetone is \u00b7then separated and r.enoved. Carbon black is mixed with the base to whiten it and chloric acid is added to neutralize it. The b~se is then baked, dried, anQ. crushed several tlll.:''\"' until pure heroin is prcxiuced. 46 Theprocess is not difficult, but it is dangerous, for if the mixture is improperly heated, it can explode. It is also tiring work, as the chemists .have to work straight through until all the morphine base is converted. The full process involves seventeen steps .and takes more than a full day. 4 7 The most efficient l-'Jarseille chemist, Joseph Cesari, was known to convert seventeen kilograms of morphine base into the sarre anount of hera.in in one day. 48 In Mexico, the transformation process is less precise, with resulting pur1ty levels\u00b7 far below \u00b7those of French heroin. Once heroin reaches the United States, its purity is diluted to a street level of anywhere from 1 percent to 30 percent, with a national 229 ')',., 'L .... .\u00b7 :.t ....... \u00b7 avu:r.age of 3.5 percent in 1979.49 The pure heroin arriving in the United States is adulterated by alm::>st every person that touches it, except the importer. A 1964 estimate stated that a kilograrn of 80 per\u00b7cent pure heroin would eventually be diluted into sixteen ldlograrns of 5 percent purity~ 50 In 1974, 'I'he Bureau of ~arcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) estimated that. when the heroin reached the addict it had been cut 45 tilres. 51 'l'he heroin is usually diluted with quinine, ~lk sugar, and rnannite. The quinine is added to heighten the initial \"rush\" fe];t when heroil'l is iQ.jected, and is the .nnst adulterate. 52 Mannite is an alnnst inert substance, wh:i,ch is mixed .in with the quinine and heroin to add volUJT\"e and weight. 53 Quinine, rnannite, and milk sugar are all identical in appearance to the ~eroin. But, while Quinine has the. scure bitter taste. as pure heroin, rnannite is tasteless and rn;i.lk sugar is sweet. Since an addict dealing with an unk.noWn pusher will taste-test the heroin for bitterness, distributors o;ften cut the heroin with bnly . \\ . avo1: \u00b7. swee taste. The adulterat~on OL the heroin causes many deaths. If the heroin content remains too high, an addict used to only 5 percent heroin will overdose. Too much quinine will ~nso produce an adverse effect upon :t:he bod . : . d .th 55 y, saretJires even causmg . ea Pushers have been known to dilute the heroin with :r;at poison .and. battery acid.56 .Unless. an .addict deals\u00b7 with. a regular pusher, ~.-.hose heroin is known to be good, ~ addict never }mows what he is shooting into. his arm. f. Heroin Distribution Each organization uses a different system to get the pure heroin \u00b7to the add:i.ct. Unless a person operates independently, he;miri cowes fl1to 230 the country through hicr:archical organization. 1\\n importer of heroin sends his rcpresen~.ative :to ar-range the deal with b1e overseas supp 1.er. 'I'he importer never physically sees or touches the heroin, but arrcmges the financing and importing of the heroin, usually dealing in quru1tities over 100 kilograms.58 The importer distributes the heroin to a. networ~ of wholesalers, who usually handle 10-50 kilograms and supply 2-5 kilogram quant.ities of heroin to jobbers. 59 Up to \u00b7this point, the heroin has not been adulterated. When a jabber supplies it to a retailer, the heroin begins to be diluted. 60 A retailer . may buy one kilogram of 80 percent pure heroin and dilute it to five kilograms of 20 percent heroin. At this point, each organization operates differently, but retailers usually either distribute kilograms to ''mills\" or \"factories;\" where the heroin is adulterated further, or to a street wholesaler, who sells heroin in ambunts anywhere from an ounce to 1/4 kilogram.61 From the factory or the street wholesaler, the heroin goes to a distributor, who adulterates it further, taking 1/8 of a kilogram (4-1/2 \u00b7oz.) and turning it into about 75 bundles. Each bundle consists of 25-32 bags of 5 grains of heroin. 62 A pusher, who rrost likely is an addict h;imself, buys a bundle and cuts each bag even further, fina~ly selling a five grain bag of 5 percent pure heroin for anywhere from five to eight dollars to addicts. 63 g. '!'he Addict The ~rican addict prefers to \"mainline\" or .inject heroin into his bloodstream.64 The addict places the heroin in a spoon or bottle cap and mixes it with W'lt-er. '1'11e mixture is then heated by a match and tL~ heroin di.ssolves, into the water. 65 The heroin is then filtered into an 231 :a ... t. ,'\u00b7\u00b7,,1 cycdroppe.t:' through co\u00b7Lto.n.

Early Heroin Trafficking Sys\u00b7ternatic diE;tribution of he:J:?oin began in .the 1920s. Racketeers . of Jewish extraGtion, operating p:dmarily out of New.York, controlled the major flow of narcotics in the 1920s ~dearly' 1930~.12 Af~r a ,' ' ' ',,'1 po.ver struggle, racketeers were mu:scled out, .and La Cosa Nostra {lL\"'riJ) had taJ(en over control of by thE: la'l::e 1930s.13 I\u00a3N control originated ~ith members of the New York Lucchese family, working together with :i,:mportant Jewish groups.14 Until World vvar II, I.CN' s main sources of supply for heroin w~e located in France and the Near .and Far. East.15 DUring. the war, these sources dried up COII1pl~tely 1 and addictiOn rateS drOpPoo to their .. lowest recorded leve1.16 During vvorld War II, New York I\u00a3N Irembers went to Mexico, and fran 1941-1943 suppliQd New York City Md other areas with limited am:mnts o~ Mexican heroin.17 Opium had been introduced. into Mexico during' the 1920s, supplying mainly .ethnic Chinese.18 ~ smuggled the Mexiccu; opium overland into California or Texas and converted it to heroin in laboratories in the New York area. 19 b. lVJOdem Heroin \u00b7Trafficking ( 1) \u00b7 The Italian Connection Modern heroin. trafficking beganafter World War Il, with I\u00a3N ca;npletely dominating .inportation and distributipn. 20 A Bureau of Narcotics official stated, \"They had this thing sewed up. over canplctely. \"21 TI'or a period of four to five years, n\\OBt heroin entering the cow1try cane from Italy, entering tlu::ough New York City. 22 Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano and Sicilian fvlafia leaders arranged the Italian connection for Alrerican lCN families.23 The heroin was also legitimately produced in Italy for rredicir1al purposes in Milan and Genoa, and it was often stolen by Sicilian Mafia rrerrbers and sent to the United States.24 (2) 1~e Corsican Connection In the, early 1950s; the Italian government bann19d the manufacture of heroin, and French Corsicans r~placed the Sicilian Mafia as the principal source of ~roin in the United States. 25 With the advent of Corsican control, Marseille bccarre the her\u00b7oin capital of .,the world, producing 80 percent of the heroin bound for the United States from the ' 26 early 1950s until 1972. Th~ Corsicans obtained IIDrphine base from Turkey, via Syria and Lebanon.27 The base usually was smuggled into Marseille by French searren, working on boats out of Beirut, Aleppo, or Istanbul. 28 .Lr: Marseille, chemists converted the base \u00b7into heroin. The Corsicans favdred two routes for smuggling heroin into the United States. Much of the French heroin went to Sicily, where th~ S' '1' Maf' ted ' Tr\"'l\\l ' Most o . e Sicilian heroin entered the country through false-bottomed txunks, furnished to uns:uspecting Ital1.an llffill.grants by The otl1er was hcU1dled by Corsicans tl1emselves, heroin by aut~onobile, diplomatic courier, or plane31 to Corsicans or French Canadian associates in l.:he lIontreal 234 ''II' '!'' enforcen~nt pr\u00b7essure in Canada becrnre heavy, the heroin was sent to 1'-bxico Ci\u00b7ty. 33 'I'he Corsicnn::; alternated between J.Vlontreal and l\"'e:...i~c City as a transshiprrent point throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.

The ICN controlled 95 percent of the heroin coming into New York City and supplied cities throughout the\u00b7East Coas\u00b7t, Midwest and Southwest United States. 55 I.CN received its heroin from the Corsican-Sicilian Mafia partnership and imported it through New York City, Mon\u00b7treal, Mexico Ci\u00b7ty~ and Miami.

(1) Introduction Fran 1965 through 1972, the manufacturing and importation of heroin arriving in the United States was controlled by a few large groups of. French Corsicans. 'l' .e ~:-\u00b7 __ ' Opium Survey concluded: The. rmst corrnon factor in virtually every majoi:'. trafficking group over the lc1i5t 20 years (1952~1972) is the prE!pon.derance of French Corsicans.

During the 1950s the 11Union Corse\" was known to smugg\u00b7le large anounts of cigarettes and.gold 54 throughout EurOpe. CoLsicans OLiginally became involved in drug .\u00b7 trafficking as far back as the 1930s, when Francois SpirQto and Paul Carbone organizea a heroin network ori<Jinating in the Nile Valley and 55 established Marseille's first laboratory.

It is also reported that several of the largest heroin traffickers received protection from the Mayor of Marseille.61 French efforts against tl1e heroin traffic proved so weak that between 1950 and 1972, when Marseille was the heroin capital of the world, French police discovered only tlrree heroin processing laboratories.62 Until 1969, the ~~seille anti-drug force numbered only eight well-known policenen,63 while French customs fielded only twelve . 1nvest1ga ors 1n e. en r o customs o. 1c1a s 1n t e Marseille area dropped front 943 in 1951 to 776 in evidence obtained by an agent posing as a buyer, and the lack of a requirerrent to report income from gambling and betting which provided an alibi for sudden increases in incone. 66 In addition, the Corsican code of silence, sworn between 244 I d 11 .. . d . . dl f d 67 d h d. . w1 erwor c J:~.gures an r~gl. an t a heroin pn:>ccssing headquartcJ-:-s.

Maintaining close political connections with Marseille Mayor Study rhe story or Michael Victor Mertz ties all the threads of the French Connection together. Mertz, a captain in \u00b7the SDECE, was a World War II Resistance hero who, as an undercover agent in the GAS, later saved President Charles DeGaulle's life.97 He also headed a ring that smuggled nure tlran one-tlriLd of a ton of heroin into the United States annually (worth 1/2 billion dollars in eight years) as a member of \u00b7 h 1 , 98 Josep Orsml. s CorsJ.cc:u1 gang .Bon1 in the Moselle area of France, Mertz was drafted i11to the occupying German a:-.-:\u00b7 1941. Deserting in 1943, he became a luc:.ul 247 J \\( ) leader in the French Resistance. Joining the SDECE after the war, in 194 7 he married Paula Scheller, the adopted daughter of Charles Martel, the owner of one of Paris' nost. fanous brothels. 99 By 1960, while Mertz was still in the ~DBCJ:!;, he and Martel were smuggling heroin \u00b7to the United States. The najor supplier for the organization was J\\nchille cecchi1li, chief :1 icut:cnant of Joseph Orsini luboratories, in the United States, who were Orsini rren.101 Mertz planned the smuggling, recruited couriers, and handled financial arrangements.102 Profits were divided equally between Mertz and Cecchini. On J!llarch 11, 1961, Mcrt~ sailed to New York on the liner Libcrte, with a Citroen containing 100 kilograms (220 lbs.) of heroin hidden in the paneling. 103 During 1961, Mertz also served as an SDECE undercover agent in the OAS. Serving tilre in an OAS internment carrp, he learned of a plot to kill DeGaulle.104 He contacted his superiors and the President's life was saved. The publicity rallied the divided nation behind DeGaulle.105 Directly supervising Mertz's activities were Jacques Foccart (cabinet Secret.al.\"Y in charge of counter terror against OAS) and Alexandre Sanguinetti (head of the national police) .106 OUt of OAS prison, Mertz directed the shiprrent of another 100 kilograms to New York, again in a Citroen.107 As the operation continued, associates bandl ed the shipping and escorting, but Mertz 6r his assistant, Jacques Bousquet, always collected the noney in New York.108 By the end of 1968, lVlertz had shipped over two tons of heroin, . tl . 1 f C::435 '1-. 109 h he .

Introduction With the denise of the French Connection, Mexico replaced France as the prlitBX:y source of heroin in the United States.1 From 1965~1971, while 80 percent of heroin arrived from lt,rance, a steady percentage (about 15 percent) came from Mexico. 2 Beginning in\u00b7 1972, Mexico became a wajo:t AneLican supply souLce,\u00b7and by 1974, 70-80 percent of the herom in the United States originated in Mexican poppy fields.3 Chicago and Los Angeles joined New York. and LVl.iami as major dis\u00b7tribution centers. 4 f.\" L11Jexican heroin began showing up in the East for the first t.irre in 1975, :J and Mexicans joined Blacks, Latins and LCN, as major traffickers .. , 6 261 I United States c.mthoritiE:!S were forct.'Cl to conclude that heroin control constituted a world problem and the 'l'urkish bnn alone would supp 1.es. b.

B l.''irst im}:XJrted into the United Sta\u00b7tes in small quantities by ICN nHnber:s during \\'Jorld War II, 9 ~~xican herbin held a small share of the l\\rnerican marke\u00b7t until 1972. After the war, I.CN cont::rol ended, and individual entrepeneurs and loosely controlled groups predominated .

'l'he lack .of purity produced a brown granular heroin, instead of the white power associated 262 :t with French heroin. In 1975, when illicit produc\u00b7tion reached itn peal<, r>exico produced 75 tons of raw opium, providing 85-YO percent of the 't d St t h . . 1 t 17 um. e \u00b7a \u00b7es ero1n mar <e-. d. Sn~\"'9S :: \u00b7:. Routes A 1975 DEA st:Q:Vey reported that Mexico was the primary source of heroin in virtually every 1\\mcrican .city. A study of confiscated samples showed 100 percent of heroin seized. in Chicago and Boston originated in Mexico, while. the New York figure was 83 percent. (1) Texas The main SllUl<Jg'lil)g rout,e for Mexican heroin went overland, usually across the 'l'exas border. 18 \u00b7 Land routes accounted for 80 percent of f.'.Jexican heroin in the United States, with 15 percent SITnlggled in Qy airplane and only 5 percent by ship.19 For much of the year the Rio Grande River dividing Mexico and Texas at El Paso is shallow enough to walk across without getting wet. 20 Even 1,000 miles down river at Laredo, the river can be crossed by four-wheel jeeps in surrmer. 21 If the smuggler chose not to ford the river, fifteen inte1.national bridges and two dams also cross the Rio . Grande }2 (2) Arizona Arizona served as another principal. route for heroin SllUlggling frau Mexico. 23 Heroin, cocaine, and marijuana were SllUlggled across the 360 mile Arizona-:t>'leXican border by plane, truck, autdl'Db1Ie, horse, and \u00b7 foot. Heasons for Arizona's popularity anong smugglers included its sparse popula\u00b7tion and its 2,000 clandestine landing areas, u.s well as that there were extremely well organized and financed smuggling organizations on bot..h sides of the border, and the state was the 263 '1,: Bhortest route J:x~t.-ween Mexico 1 s poppy and marijuana fields and the . .. d St t ~4 Un~te \u00b7a\u00b7es. 'l'wenty-thrce major smuggling organizations were identified in 1977, includin<.J Jive whoLly or partly controlled by LCN famili<.:~s from New York, Detroit, and Chicago. 25 rrhese groups operated along with thousand::; of t.matfilicl'ted traffickers. In 1977, the v01une 0~ drugs earning across the Arizona border was so high that American officials.could not even estimate the amount There. were hundreds of dirt trails, hidderf from the main highways, across the border. At the oorder t.own .. of Nogales, over 85 smuggling g:r:-oups were identified in 1977.26 The only good roads in the Sierra Madref; poppy rc~~ions lc..>d to Nogales, boos\"t.i.ng its importance as a smuggling center. Five minutes from Nogales, there were gaping. hoies large enough for a truck to drive through in the ten-fcx::>t high border fence. As the only major city near the border, one hour north of Nogales, \u00b7 Tucson was the prime .distribution point for narcotics. Large arrounts of narcotics also flCMed regularly into Phoenix, where an estimated 550 pilots made a full-time living flying drugs into fields near the city.27 Arizona law enforcerrent officials were understaffed and beset by corruption~ For a border covering fourteen counties and over 113,909 square miles, DFA and local narcotics units fielded only 18.1. agents. 28.

The complex refining process used in Marseille was eliminated, thus producing an impure brown heroin.66 The Berreras cut down the putity themselves, to about twenty percent, eliminating middlerren and increasing the profit. The Herreras sent over half their heroin to Chicago, where alnost every known major drug dealer in the city belonged to .tl1eir organization. 67 ICN involveneht wa~ nonexistent. .When asked to describe the relationship between ICN and the Herreras in Chicago, a policerran stated: Frau what .we're aware of, not a thing.

Introduction In the late 1970s, a new influx of heroin arrived in the United States fran the :poppy fields of the Golden Crescent, the nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. 1 By 1979-1980, the Golden Crescent had replaced the Golden Triru1gle as the major source of illegal narcotics for the United States. 2 In 1979, DEA estir\u00a3ated that because of the drought; Golden Triangle opium production fell to 160..,.200 .rretric tons~ while the Middle Eastern areas produced . record anounts. 3 Afghanist.G!n produced 300 tons of opium; Pakistan 700 tons; and Iran 600 tons. 4 The 1979 figures represented a five..,.fold increase over the previous five years in ciolden Crescent. p:rod.uction.5 In 1980, the GOlden Crescent area produced 1600 tons of opium, anywhere fran five6 to nine7 t:i.:rres the output of the rest of the world combined. As late as 1975-1976, Golden Crescen~ heroin accounted for only 1 percent. of the heroin entering the United States. 8 By 1977, the figure 286 had gr\"Own to 8 pe1~c<.mt, and in 1978, it j'lllll\u00a3.)Cd to 1\"/ percent. 9 In 1979, 34-35 percent of tl1e u. s. hc~roin market was supplied by Golden Crescent heroin,10 and the 1980 figures were. expected to grow even higher. Golden Crescent opium is produced in the border areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, where the national governrrents are extrenely weak. ~~'he opium is gr:~ .mainly by \u00b7tribal minorities that ure in rebellion a.gains\u00b7t the national gover11Il'ent and use opium to barter for SfLil1~3. 11 rl'he Russinn invasion of Afghanistan h~s reduced the national. govennnent 1 s )?OWer i.n the poppy provirices instability ... \u00b7ha~ forestalled. intemat.ional efforts to substitute new crops for poppies. 12 Finally, the Revolutionary Goverl1Irent in Iran is .tOO weak to control opium prdduction or .. 1\u00b7.\u00b7.. Even \u00b7. . before. the Soviet invasion, the governrrentlacked any real control over .. : ' fJOppy farrrers. The Helmand River Valley in southwestern Afghanistan is the principal poppy growing area.15 .\u00b7The other two ma.in poppy locations ' ' ',. ' . 16 are Badal>hshan and Nangarhar. For many Y!2!ars, nest of the opium produced in Afghanistan went to supply I:r:anian addicts, although as. \" ,' early as 1972 0. s. officials ):)egan tO worry about Afghanistan's potential as a source of supply for the United States. 17 One of t:he .IIDst primitive nations in the world, Afghanistan' s polic~ force had .a literacy rate of only 2 .percent in 1972,18 Government officials have \u00b7beeil indifferent to .smuggling, and the nation's borders have been alnost unpatroll,ed. 19 The Soviet occupation ., forces have virtually alxiicat.ed control over 1:he Afghanistan borders to 287 guerrilla forces th.:'t barter opium fC?r guns.

Introduction T,aw cnfor:cc~nw:-nt of:ticials es\u00b7tirnatc that half the heroin imported into the United States is used by addicts in New YorkCity.1 llero:in addict.s, too, have been blooed for over half the street crirres and burglaries in the city. 2. \u00b7 From 1965 .... 1970, the majority of the heroin traffic irrt.o New York City was handled by ICN or its close associates. 3 Dur~ the 1970s,. . . inde};)endent Black and Hispanic groups, however, successfully challenged I.CN control of \u00b7the market. 4 'VVhile I.CN remains an important factor in trafficking, the independent groups today handle the bulk of heroin \u00b7\u00b7 traffic in the city. Until Hexican and Asian heroin began to predominate frcm 1975-1980, \u00b7 New York City addicts were supplied almost completely with French Connection heroj,n. 5 During 1972, the city experienced a severe heroin snortage when the. consequences of the Turkish opium ban first began to diminish heroin supplies. 6 Nevertheless, the \u00b7traffic did not stop . . . . In addition, N<:..>W York State. in 1973 passed a harsh drug law, but, despite over one hundred convictions carrying mandatory lif~ :trrpri~SOIHIIent, Ut~ flow of narcotics into the city .1-vas not flppreqi al;lly slowed. 7 Indeed, by. tl1e end of 1975, .the heroir~ problem iri th.e city was be~g compared to the peak period of 1969~1970.8 \u00b7.\u00b7Apparently, t.he emergence of t.he.non-ICN\u00b7 dealers and a cutback in narcotics officers after the dissolutiul o+ J ..... French Connection c..untributed to the rise 9 . in usagr:~. J1Lmy investigators believed the huroin problem continued to worsen i.n the city throughout the late 1970s.10 b. La Co sa Nostra From the end of World War II until the late 1960s, New York City heroin traffickli~ was dominated by .the five LCN families.11 The LCN serviced a small.lllarket of addicts\u00b7 concentrated in the Black and .I?UeJ.\u00b7~-, Rican slrur~s .12 The. Lucchese (;irid Bonanno families were nvst heavily involved, putting together the origli1al Narseille-}1ontreal-New York .City route.13 In 1968, a state comnittee identified 600 LCN soldiers in . ', . ' ' Harlem, Bedford Stuyvesant, and t;:he South Bronx involved in heroin . traffick:ing.14 The identified LCN rerroers handled an estimated $116 million in narcotics in 1968.1.) One source put LCN profits in heroin 16 at over $90 million a year during the late 1960s. By 1970, however, LCN was no longer a major factor in street sales of heroin. Instead, it concentrated on :importation and wholesale distribution. 17 LCN stayed in the background and financed. shipments, letting others take the front-line risk. From a near rrpn()poly by LCN, the heroin traffic evolved into a loosel,y organiZed series of arm.s\u00ad lengtb .relationships among major independent operators, of which LCN wa~ but a major system.18 There was in fact no vast heroin conspiracy; with one boss; the popular conception of a ''Mr. Big\" in heroin did not exist. The .LCN's earlier exclusive control lessened for several reasons, ' ' ' . ' . ' not the least of which were a vast expans~ori o; the. herom market and a toughening of federal and state penalties for heroin selling.19 Inaddition, the expansion .in the nunber of addicts opened up opportunities to non;_LCN traffickers to service new areas.20 294 included the use of diplomats and cou~\u00b7iers on com:rercial airlines.

By 1975, control of heroin ~rafficldng \u00b7in New York City hctd shift~d \u00b7 to Blacks and Hispanics. 23 These new org~izationswere successfully t:i.ed in with Hexica:n and Southeast Asian traffickers, wher~ they gained r a source of supply independent of LCN control. For a long t me, the police intelligence system was directed at white groups;. it considered , .. \u00b7\u00b7 . \u00b7\u00b7 21; Blacks to be involved only in trafficking .on a very low .level. ' Accordingly, Black and Hispanic rings were left free from law enforcement pressure while their operations .were established.

The Southern District conspiracy group, headed by DFA agent Donald Ferrarone, concentrated on Bames.'79 In Septenber 1976, Ferrarone got his first big break. He received a call. fran the Nassau County District . . Attorney's office, reporting that. they had a shoplifter who claimed to know Barnes and his organization. The informant, \"Pranise'' Bruce, turned out to be a convert to Black activism, who wanted revenge on Barnes for\u00b7 What he was doing to Black people in the ghettoes.8P In October, Bruce set up heroin buys and sold marmite to a Barnes' l lieutenant. Ferrarone' s next break came when Robert Geronitoo, an FBI informant, agreed to help the DEA. 81 Ferrarone had Geronitoo work with a ~FA agent l'lBIIWad Louis Diaz, . who posed as a trafficker seeking a connection through Geronitoo. 82 Geronitoo and Diaz soon arranged to pl)rChase 1/4 kilogram of heroin from a. Barnes associate. Walking to meet the connectiqn, the contact, ''Wally\" Fisher, discovered a car carrying DEA agents ; and fled into a bar. 83 Five days later Diaz purchaeed the heroin. 84 Fisher talked freely and assured Diaz it was high quality heroin, haVing cooe ! frcm Barnes. 85 Two weeks later, Geroninn met with Barnes and a top lieutenant, and soon Diaz was laundering mney .\u00b7for Bames. 86 Subsequently, D:laz was able to purchase heroin.fran Steven\u00b7 Monsanto, another Ba:rnes lieutenant, who was himself on the list of New York' s rwst inportant deal~rs. 87 300 Imnediately after one purchase, Barnes came in and put his arm around Monsanto and talked with him for a long time. 88 On February 25, 1977, Gerohirro and Diaz arranged to buy a full kilogram of heroin for $55,000. Barnes' operatives were. overheard planning the details on a court ordered wiretap.89 Pranise Bruce also produced evidence. He sold a half block of mannite to Barnes himself, 50 cases of mannite to a lieutenant, .and purchased 250 bags of heroin on the street.90 : : On March 15, 1977, DEA agents arrested Barnes as his car ~s I .. .\u00b7.\u00b7. ! stopped at a Harlem stoplight. Barnes was chargedifu fe\u00aeial c'?urt with violation of the Continuing Cr~l Enterprise statute.91 SevJnteen others, including five chief lieutenants, were also charged.92 The charge against Barnes required evidence of substantial incq:ne fran narcotics. IRS returns ordered for the trial showed that Barnes and his colleagues put down. $250,000 each year in the category of miscellaneous income that they could not explain.93 The Barnes trial produced some of the heaviest narcotics sentences in New York history. 94 Barnes was cc;mvicted and sentenced to life without possibility of parole, and he was fined the maxinun penalty of $125,000.95 The judge stated that no narcotics defendant in recent years presenteO. a \"greater threat t.o society .\"96 Chief lieutenants Monsanto, St:eve Baker, Leon Johnson, Waymin Hines and John Haliku received 30 years each. 97 Joseph Hayden received 15 years as the #2 man in the organization. 98 The Court of Appeals99 upheld the convicticm, and the Suprerre Court refused to review it .100 By February 1979, Frank James and Guy Fisher had taken over tlJ.e Barnes organization, and they had became two of the chief heroin dealers . 301 )\u00b7.\u00b7 .. \u00b7 in the city.101 Operating a loose partnership, the two trafficked heroin, cocaine, and PCP, but at a level substantially below that of Barnes. Speculation that Barnes continues to c:ontrol the organization from his jail cell in Marion,.

In 1979, marty investigators believed that the overall drug coatrol problem in .the city had worsened and that there were more drugs on the street than' ever before.108.

B . . d usage a a \"crisis level\" in 1981 1 Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau listed the crucial law enforcement problems in the fight against heroin sale: 1) budgetary cutbacks; 2) lack of conmi~nt by the Carter Administration; 3) lack .of long terin planning; and 4) the bail system.111 Nqthing of significance has Changed since. L Scope of Problem It is not enough simply to describe generally the scope of the heroin use problem in New York City or to note the nature of the law enforcement response. Sorre .feel, tO(), rtust be obtained of its overall cii.nEnsions. In 1968, the city 1 s chief nedical examiner stated that diseases related to narcotics addictiOn (primarily heroin addiction) caused .IOOre deaths am:mg New Yorkers aged 15.-35 than nurder, suicide, accidents, or natural causes.ll2 Narcotics deaths accounted f9r '85 percent of all deaths in this age group. ll3 90, percent of the fatalities were m:m; 50 percent were Blacks, 30 percent were ~rto Rican, and 20 percent were white.ll4 The average age of those dying was listed at twenty-seven, clown from the 1958 figure of thirty-three.115 Beoween 1950-1954, there were 465 heroin fatalities in New York City .116 Fran1955-1959, the figure rose to 611, and fran 1960-1964, it increased to 1,299.117 The 1965-1969 figure rose to 2,935,118 with over 900 in 1969 alone .119 'There were 224 teenage heroin deaths in 1969, twenty under the. age of 15, one a:ged ,12.120 Almost ten years later. in 1978. there were only 246 heroin deaths 303 in New York. 121 By 1979, the figure was back up to 439 deaths, and the 1980 estimate predicted over 600.122 By the end of the decade, all indexes pointed to a rise in heroin use' in the city. In 1979, heroin emergency room episodes were up 46 percent fran 1978, from 480 to 702.123 Admissions to drug programs in New York State were up 26 percent in 1979, reaching 26,303.124 Methadone programs were up 22 percent and enrollment in detoxification . . 125 programs rose 40 percent between. 1978 and 1979. \u00b7 A 1968 New York T:i.Ires study indicated how severe the heroin problem bad bec()[re in parts of New Yor~. A four year survey of 1750 people on a sltm block in Spanish Harlem 'produced startling figures. 126 One .... third of the teenagers interviewed in the winter of 1965 bad beOOE heroin addicts by 1968 .127 Over three-quarters of adult addicts supported their habits by petty theft, prostitution, burglary, or pushing. 128 Only one-third of the addicts listed in 1965 bad successfully quit ak. h . 129 t mg erom. . i It is 1.mlikely that there will ever be an accurate listing of the mmber of heroin addicts in New York. Estimates in fact vary so widely that suspicion is cast on the validity of them all. In. 1968, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics listed 32,347 addicts in New York State (out of 62,405 nationally), while for several years the NYPD had been estimating the number in the city alone at beoween 50,000-100,000.130 A dispute arose in 1965, for example, when Mayor Wagner reported 23,000 addicts, 131 while a Harlan source stated there were 25,000 addicts in 132 that ghetto area alone. By 1967, the New York Times was reporting a census figure of 304 ' 100,000 addicts in the city .133 During the mid-1970s, the consertsus figure listed about 150 , 000 heroin addicts. By the end of the decacie, the consensus figurehad dropped to 100,000 aga:in. Yet a 1.972 report by the Mayor's Narcotics Control Cmmcil stated that between 196.4 and 1970 there had been a total of 316,918 narcotics . ' addicts in the city, 90 percent on heroin. 134 ,. The figure worked out to 1 out of every forty-four people in the city between the ages of 15-44.135 Despite largely inefficient law enforceimnt efforts, New York City \u00b7 has in f~ct been the location .of s~ of the largest heroin seizures in \u00b7 i the United States. The largest seizure of the 1960s--excluding 1that made as part of the French Connection investigation--occurred ui December 1969, when 35.2 potmds of heroin and 44. pot.lnds of cocaine were . d 136 ms1. a suitcase in apart::nent. Chileans and an Argentine with LCN . 137 connect1.ons were arrested. In 1970, police seized 220 pounds of heroin in a single raid.138 Worth $60million, the heroin was disco~ered in four suitcases and a small rretal t.nmk in a closet. Two Urugua.yains, one Chilean, and one Spaniard were arrested.139 Police had no idea how the heroin had entered the cotmtry. 140 In August 1970, police broke a national heroin ring that reportedly brought 850 kilograms of heroin a year, worth $1/2 billion, from Ma.rseille.141 Heroin was first discovered secreted in crevices in a washroom of a jet at JFK in 1968.142 The plane originatedin Frankfort and was to go on to Chicago. Agents watched a courier get on the plane 305 '' ' at. JFK, put the heroin in a s\u00a2tcase, get off the plane in Chicago, and then buy a ticket to New .York on another airline, thus avoiding going through Custorn..s with\u00b7 the heroin.143 Jack Grosby and Luis Stepenb~rg were indict~d for heading the organization, which had also irrported heroin .in .fish cans, cars, typewriters, and banana crates.144 306 t. Appendix A: National Addiction Levels In 1965, there were 52, 793 known heroin addicts. 1 The Ccmni.ssioner of the Bureau of Narcotics, Henry L. Giordano, stated that as of 1963, 48.33 percent of the known addicts lived in New York City. 2 Four states accounted for 80 percent of the known addicts: New York, Illinois, California, and Michigan.3 +llinois had 14.6 percent, California 14.1 percent and Michigan 3.6 percent. the report of the McClellan corrmittee stated: The ratio of male addicts to female is about 5 .to 1 while the ethnic distribution is 53.9 percent Negro; 11.7 percent Puerto Rican; 6.6 percept Mexican; the remain~r ,426. 9 percent in other groups, principally Caucasl.an. \u00b7 . By 1970, the m.mber of addicts had risen extr(iordinarily, and heroinwas no longer confined to the g11ettoes. 5 BNDD estimated 322,000 addicts in 1970, skyroCketing from the 1969 estimate of only 69,000.6 By. 1971, BNDD reported 560,000 heroin .addicts in the United States.7 The effect of the heroin increase. was felt everywhere. Newsday reported in 1973: Heroin had traditionally been considered to be an urban blight, and neighboring New York City its principal area of usage, but in the early 1970s, it beCC~Jre evident ... hard drugs were having a disastrous impact on Long Island--the nat~on's largest subUSh\u00ad -as well as other conm.mities throughout the United States\u00b7: Heroin was now a middle class suburban problem. ' Despite the Nixon Administration war on heroin, addiction lievels rose throughout rrost of the 1970s. By 1972, there were 600,000 : addicts. 9 The National Institute on Drug Abuse reported 6 77, 000 add;i.cts in 1973, 722,500 in 1974, 670,000 in 1975, and 685,000 .in 1976.10 307 During the end of the decade, with Nexican heroin in scarce supply, addict levels finally began to fall. But by 1980, there rerrained an \u00b7\u00b7 estimated 400,000-450,000 addicts and levels were reportedly rising. 11 308 D Year 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 .\u00b7 1978 1979 1980 Appendix B Appendix B: York Tines, 11 June 1974 II II Federal Drug Enforcement Hearings before the permanent subcarmi teee on investigations of the Cbm. on\u00b7 States Seriate, 94th . 1980 Sess.; 81 (1975-1977) For 1972-:1974.

INTRODUCTION In 1968, Americans spent approximately five million dollars on cocaine.1 In 1980, the Drug Enforcement Achninistration (DEA) estimated that the annual retail value of the cocaine trade. in the United States ranged from 12 to16 billion dollars. 2 Jqurnalistic estimates place the figure as high as 30 billion dollars.3 National drug abuse surveys for 1979 confirm previous estimates of incr~ased cocaine use, particularly ammg yotmg. adults aged 18-25.4 Between 1978. and 1979 use jtmped .69%. 5 In 1979, total cocaine-related injuries rose 76% over 1976.6 Today, cocaine is the top income producer in the illicit traffic in drugs.7 An estimated 25-31 metric tons of cocaine were smuggled into the United States in 1979.8 The coca leaf is illicitly produced principally in Bolivia and Peru and then converted into cocaine, mainly in Colarbia ( 70%) . 9 Florida is the chief gateway ( 40%) to the United States for the illicit traffic, 10 most of Which arrives by air . 11 passenger cour1er. Organized cr:i.ne' s involvemant in the traffic is mixed. The traffic itself is highly sophisticated, yet decentralized. No one etlmic group has had a m:mopoly over the traffic, but Mafia-type organized crine participation in it is surfacing, in both smuggling and distribution.12 The upward trend in cocaine use is not expected to abate, as . a vast new youth market is developing. 13 High cost, rather than restricted availability, is the principal deterrent to regular use am:mg less affluent persons.14 The picture for success of law enfqrcernent efforts at curtaibnent is bleak. 314 I '\u00b7\" I I 2. Technical Background The coca plant, from which cocaine is derived, grows principally in South America in altitudes from 1 ,500.~7 ,000 feet .. 1 The coca leaves are first harvested when the plant is two to three years old and can continue to be harvested from two to six times annually. for up to forty years. 2 The transition from coca leaves to cocaine :involves a relatively simple3 three-step process. First, the leaves are picked, then ccxribined with kerosene, water, caustic .soda, and other chemicals to form coca paste.4 Finally, the coca paste is chemically converted to cocaine hydrochloride., the desired result. 500 kilograms (1 ,100 potmds) ... of coca lekves are required to yield 1 kilogram (2.2 potmds) 6f . 5 cocame. Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colonbia are the principal areas of coca leaf productiOn in the world, 6 with Peru and Bolivia accounting for up to 90% of the world 1 s output. 7 Bolivian coca leaves are cultivated primarily on the eastern. slopes of the Andes Motmtains in the North and Soutl'l Ungas and Chapare Provinces. 8 In Peru, coca leaf production is centered in the high jungle of the eastern Andes slopes. 9 Heavily steeped in. tradition, coca production ahd consumption is accepted as a way of life in the Andean region.10 The ficas regarded the coca plant as a living manifestation of divinity11 and for thousands of years natives have. chewed coca leaves for relief fran htm.ger pangs, fatigue, and other aches and pains. 12 It is. estimated that 90% of the male and 20% of the female population in the .eastern watershed of the Andes Motmtains in Peru, Colunbia, and Bolivia chew the leaves daily.~3 Peru and Bolivia are the world 1 s only licit producers of coca 14 leaves. . Each country bas 25 ~000-30 ,000 hectares, about 315 250,000-300,000 acres under coca plant .cultivation, nine times that needed for licit us!=.15 As IIUch as 80% of Bolivia 1 s annual coca leaf production of 33,000-39,000 tons goes to the illicit ma.rket.16 .Altrost. all cocaine in the United States is derived fran Peruvian and Bolivian coca leaves.17 50%18 to 70%19 of the.cocaine earning to the United States. passes through or is refined in Colorrbia. Florida serves as the entry point for 40% of the cocaine that reaches the United St.ates market }0 Although cocaine is snuggled into the United States at a purity of 90%-95%,\u00b721 before it is taken by the ave~age user it will have been cut to a purity of 10-20;22 the average str~et purity is 12%.23 \"Cutting\" ,' ' I involves diluting the cocaine 1 s purity by adding ingredients such. as lactose, amphetamines, and prococai.ne.24 Cocaine (slang terms; blow, C, 25 . .. coke, snow, dust, white flake, etc.) can be taken by the user either orally, intravenously, intranasally, or can be SIIDked, a method called freebasing. Intranasal use, or \"snorting,\" is the dominant method. Although cocaine is not believed to be a physically addicting drug, 26 reported. cocaine-related injuries have tripled since 1974.27 Cocaine has also been shown in some cases to be psychologically ddi. . 28 a ct::1ve. 3. Use of Co.caine in the United States The coca plant first came to the West 1 s attention with the Spanish ' ' '\u00b7 ' ' conquest, hut it was largely ignored until the mid-19th century. Cocaine was isolated .in 1860 by a German phannaceutical fit:m, and from 1884-1906 it was heavily marketed in the United States by AnErican entreprene\\,U\"s, who found a great demand for the new drug. The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and t::he Harrison Act of 1914 effectively outlawed 316 '.';1 :'~!;\u00b7 I' If 1/ I II) . the non-prescription use of cocaine. By the 1930s illegal cocaine .use was minimal, confined largely to jazz nen, movie stars, and the rich.29 . . . . Today, cocaine is the conventional, and often m::>bile citizens. 1976 studies indicated that between 4 million31 and 7 tnillion32 Americans had used cocaine at l~ast once. Today~ it is estimated that between 10 nlillion33 and 15 million34 Americans have used cocaine. Of these individuals, use ten percent cocaine daily, and 70 per cent u~e cocaine at least twice a m::>nth. 35 According to the DEA, between 25 and 31 netric tons of cocaine are snuggled into the United States annually ,36 all from South America. 37 39 .. Other sources place the, figure at anywhere from 44 tons. . Govenment officials cbncede that .only 5-10 per cent of .the cocaine traffic is . ' . . full . d. d 40 s~cess y 1nter 1cte At the street level, cocaine costs between, $1,40041 an9 $2,50042 an ounce depending on the qualitY of the product. The average street value is appr<?JCimately $2, 200 an ounce, .. roughly five t:i.nes the price of g9ld. 43 An \u00b7 evetling' s dose of cocaine, 150 milligrams, 44 costs the user approxiinately $15-$25.45 In 1968, .Americans spent approximately five million dollars on cocaine. 46 In 1980, the DEA estimated that the annual retail val~ of the cocaine trade ranged from 12-16 billion dollars. 47 Other sources place the\u00b7 figure as high as 30 billion. dollars. 48 . . .. 49 . The increase in price along the chain goes as follows. 5.00 kilos . . . ' . ' of coca le~ves are sold by the fanner .for $250; it is then converted I into. 2.5 kilos of coca paste, which may be ~old .for $3,000 to $5:,000; the . .2.5 kilos of paste is then processed into one .kilo of cocai.r\\e base, 317 which may be sold for $8,000 to $11,000; it is then converted into one . kilo of cocaine hydrochloride, which sells for $15,000 to $20,000 to a United States beyer. On the East Coast of the United States, one kilo,. duly imported, net$ $38,000 to $40,000. 'Ihe wholesaler then cuts the cocaine to 50% strength, and it may be sold for $76, 000 to $80 , 000. By the time it reaches the street diluted to 12% of its original purity, it sells for $80 , 000 .50 . . .I increasing popularity, the traffic has attract:ed a full range of i independent traffickers as well a.s sophisticated criminal . . 4. Cocaine \u00b7 Traffi~ing a. The \u00b7 Independents I The cocaine traffic is far. less structured than the heroin traffic and is characterized by rrnre ntmerous deliveries.52 Be<=al:lSe of the great\u00b7 profits and the diminished likelihood that they will be caught, persons fran all walks of life, including doctors, lawyers, businessmen, and entertainers are engaged in. cocaine trafficking~ 53 'Ihe recent investigations at the Chicago Board of Trade illustrates that cocaine dealing, although associated with traditional criminal eletl'ents, is atso whi 11 . 54 a (1) 'Ihe Casual or Small-Time Dealer Ahmst anyone who buys cocaine can becone a.dealer by simply \"cutting\" his supply and reselling a portion at a good profit. A ntmber \u00b7 of young professionals reportedly add$10,000-$20,000 to their annual incooes by dealing cocaine. 55 'Ihe number of those who nm these SII~B;ll cocame . on the cocaine trade.

'The eight suspects travelled in t~ same circles , but they worked as individuals, not as a sophisticated drug ring. '!hey were dealing ,cocaine to anyone who wanted to buy. 56 The snia.ll-tine or casual dealer, nevertheless, obtains. his supplies Amariean squrce. But .because ~f the danger. and initial expense involved, this practice :Ls IIDre the exception '\u00b7 than the rule. In one case, an :independent dealer frqn Chicago flew to Colonbia and purchased $3,000 worth of cocaine. The cpca:ine was divided . :into 18 gram :incremmts , put in 4 7 envelopes and mailed to the United States at a profit of $25,000.57 (2) large-Scale Operations Individuals fran all walks of life are also :involved :in organizations that systematically distribute large quantities of1cocaine in the United States. Many. of theses organj.zations were fo~d within the last ten years 58 in an effort to reap the great profits :involved in cocaine trafficking. Evidence indicates that thes.e organizations usually obtain their supplies from organized smuggling groups within the United States. Since Miami is the primary cocaine port of entry, 59 distributors \u00b7 fran across the Unite,d States usually journey to the South Florida area to obtain the necessa,ry supplies. 60 Large scale independent operators occasionally establish contacts directly with South Amarican sources, but as with the small tine dealet.;, this practice is m::>re the exception than the rule. A case in point, 319 however, is that of James Joseph Boyle IIr.61 Boyle, a promising athlete, dropped out of Oklahoma State University in the early 1970s, and he fm.md himself in need of roney. In August, 1972, he took a cOliiOOrcial flight to Santiago, Chile,\u00b7 where he obtained five kilograms of cocaine for $10,000. Back in California, Boyle quickly sold the cocaine at a $4.0,000 profit. By the spring of 1973, Boyle had expanded to Kansas City, Los Angeles, and Dallas, and by the time of his arrest in September 1973, Boyle 1 s group had smuggled over ;fifty kilograms of cocaine into the United States. Boyle 1 s ring, though profitable, lack the necessary layers of insulation, which usually serve to shield the ringleaders of rore sophisticated criminal organizations. Large scale independent operators in the Southwest .often establish contacts with Mexican trafficking organizations, which channel the cocaine from South America. In a 1977 investigative report by Newsday that described the. major narcotics smuggling groups in Arizona, five of the nine cocaine smuggling groups indentified were headed by individuals who apparently bad no ties to any Mafia-type organized cr~ groups. Each .had entered the cocaine trade l:>y cultivating Mexican contacts. Gradually, their busineeses expanded; the organizations included; (1) The Cooper Organization: William Cooper fo~d this group saretilne between 1974 and 1977. According to customs offisials, the organization used a \u00b7 SJ.l)all fleet of 13 aircraft to transport cocaine and marijuana. Airports in Wisconsin, Alaska, and . Minnesota were used by this organization.. Associates included Peter H. Scheuer of .Minnesota and William M . Lechuga of\u00b7 62 Phoenix. 320 ... I (2) The Senn~r Organization: George F. ~nner III of Phoenix led this 30 rrember group, which supplied large quanti ties of cocaine to Phoenix and Colorado. . Pickup carrpers and horse trailers. were used to transport the supplies. Members included EdWard T. Gallegos and Ralph M. Chavez, both of Holbrook, i. . 63 ArJ.zona. ( 3) The Breen Organization: Headed by brothers Gary and Steven Breen \u00b7of Phoenix, this organization \u00b7dealt primarily in cocaine. Srna.ll quantiites were regularly smuggled to Phoenix frcm Mexico and distributed arrong the. friends of the Breens. 64 \u00b7 (4) ,The Lamb Organization: This organization was headed by William Vernori Lamb, and it supplied cocaine frcm Peru .and Colanba. to Denver, Las Vegas, and ~theseda,. Maryland. Membefs included John Price of Phoenix.65 (5) The Bond Organization: Based in Tucson, Arizona, this organization was headed by Jarres c. Bond. Cocaine and marijuana were smuggled cy air to Newport Beach, California, Canada, Boston,. and New York City. The orgariization was supplied by Rosenda Sanchez of Magdalena de Kino, Mexico. AssoCiates \u00b7 included Edward Caballero, Jr. and Glen Donuhue. 66 The number of large scale independent cocaine organizations in the United States is. \u00b7 inpossible \u00b7to detennine. '.',' ' . that their impact ort the cocaine trade is great, particularly below the ircporter level. b. Organized\u00b7 Crit:re Involvement Despite the large numbers of individuals involved in cocaine traffi~king, independent operators do not smuggle in the vast quantities 321 ;,\u00b7.\u00b7\u00b7.' I. of cocaine needed to supply the Arrerican marke1:.. Hank Messick67 put it well: \"You still have a few p:!Ople who will put ten or twelve thousand dollars together and send one of their m.nnber down [to South Arrerica] for one kilo .of cocaine, and if that is success\u00ad ful, the cocaine will be sold \u00b7and it will \u00b7 end there. BUt the bulk of the camercial smuggling ventures, where you get the multi- kilo quantities of ccoaine~ are being directed by well-organized, fairly experienced narcotics traffickers in South Arrerica and the United States.\" By contrast to the heroin traffic, the cocaine traffic has been substantially more decentralized with less penetration by Mafia-type organized crime in the United States market, 68 particularly :Qelow the i.nporter/wholesaler level. Nevertheless, by definition, the cocaine trade rrust be highly organized. 69 Only an organized group can regularly care up with the enonrous arcounts of money necessary for cocaine di trib . 71 1s 1s c ear y seen m cocame srrru.gg mg an s ut1on. Mafia-type organizations have never developed in tl+is area the kind of near monopOly they had in heroin in the 1960s. 5. The Colanbians a. The Rise of the Colarbians Since the rnid-1970s, Colanbian organized crime groups have been increasingly successful in taking over a major. share of the darestic ooca.tne traffic .in the United States'. 72 But Co~ia's present role in the cocaine trade can only be understood in an historical.context.. The CUb.3n revolution, ,which brought Fidel Castro to power, marked the birth of the \"Cuban Mafia.\" 73 The coca~e trade had flourished in CUba under Batista,74 and for centuries cocaine was accepted in Cuba as a luxury, 322 I' .' ranking with good rum and cigars as civi];;ized pleasures.75 After the fall of the J:!atista regime, thousands of. .Cubans fled to the United ' \u00b7 States. By early 1960s the CUban Calmuni:ties of Flori.d~ were a base for the continuation of organized crime networks previously established in CUba.76 These Florida-ba,sed networks then established latin Am::d.can cocaine connections with othel:' ousted CUbans. 77 The United States, on the verge of a turbulent aecade of social upheaval and political ..\u00b7\u00b7 . .

Fran .1965:;;,1975, '' ',, :: ' ', cocaine ilrports ~ Florida were~\u00b7 therefore, c9nt;rolled by particu1crrly colailbia.79 Until the rrQd-19.60s cocaine trafficking in Colombia had been largely confilled to in-porting and supplying cocaine foi' the danestic 80 \u00b7. . market. \u00b7 .. Only small anounts were sold to Mexican and United states custorrers. 81 By the rrQd-1960s, the Coli:Illbi~s had expanded their connections by jofning\u00b7\u00b7~ith CUban traffick~rs situated in the United States and by increasing the flow to Z.1exican traffickers. 82 Colombian traffickers. soon bee~ the major source of supply, operating gerterally ! in Colanbia but suppiying other trq:ffickers, who channel],;ed the \u00b7.

The Cc>lanbians TodaY : Despite assertions to the contrary, 89 Colanbian criminal. organizations, however, dO not have a :rronopoly over the United States cocaine trade. To COntrol traffic of the current magnitude would be nearly jropossible, for at least three reasons: . '\u00b7 ' ' ' (1) Because of the '\u00b7eno:rnous profits in cocaine .trafficking, independents, traditional organized crine elements , and newer organized criminal groups will be constantly seeking a share of the lucra~ive market1. (2) The large dewand for cocaine in the United States far exceeds ' ' the ability of any one group to control the trade fran coca plant to consumer~ (3) As cqca plant cultivation increases in response to demand and\u00b7 profits, cocaine becc:nes nore accessible to various trafficking' elements. Although the Colanbians do not nonopolize the cocaine trade, they . i . the d .

These factors explaJ.n why anywhere fran 50% \u00b7 to 70% of the . ' ! cocaine caning to the United States passes through or is refined in \u00b7 Colqrt>ia. c. . The Colanbian Organ.izations Although the Coldr!bia-based cocaine trafficking organizations vary ill size, nost started as wildcat operations with. about five rrembers. 98 In 1975, \u00b7United States authorities estimated. that between 60-80 major \u00b7 .Colanbian criminal organizations were involyed in cocaine trafficking. 99 Approximately half of theses groups contaiil.ed 50..;100 IneiTbers eaCh, with aiiJ?le capital, SOphisticated organization, and layers of insulations~ 100 The Colanbian cocaine traffic tOday, however, is. dani.nated by 14101 2s102 or goo-fathers.104 The_ pad.rinos use threats and bribes to stay ahead of the law and have bought into . legitimate buSinesses in Colanbia with their_ cocaine. revenues, lOS Experts in DFA argue that.

There are, they suggest, \\' I the six cyerational principles at work in the Colanbian cocaine ff'ck' . 107 tra ~ ~g organ~za ~ons: (1) Expertise: rrernbers of the organization must be thoroughly \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. acquainted with all aspects of the product;' ' :,1 ' .

' These relatively sophisticated Colombian organizations apparently control up .to 90% of the cocaine traffic through Colombia and fran 45% to 60% of the flow to the United States. Despite these i.Irpressive statistics, the Colombians in fact earn far. less than a third of the 1 , . f' 112 Th e argest \u00b7 goes to ruu:::rJ.can. criminal elerrents, 113 a. fact thataccounts for the rroverrent of the Colombian into th? American traffic itself. The character of the Colombian organizations may be illustrated. by an examination of the Herrera Organization. One of the rrost irrlportant padrinos in the Colanbian cocaine structure is Benjamine (Papa Negro) 114 Herrera Zuleta.

Cocaine Transport ( 1) Shipping by Seq Miami, Florida is the primary cocaine port of entry for the Qnited i States 1 followed OY IDS Angeles 1 Califorhia; and San Juan, routed ! , through the Yucatan Channel, b=tw~en Mexico and CUba.129 When sailing ' either of these first two ro\\ltes smugglers will consciously avoidCUba, a country known for its stiff drug penalties.130 The third route is. through the Mona passage, which is bordered by the Daninican Republic and Puerto Rico.131 Fran these three major routes, the smugglers can go into the Gulf of Mexico, to either coast of Florida, or north along the East Coast of the United States. 132 ( 2) Shipping by Air The predaninant method of transporting cocaine to. the United States is, however, by air. In. 1977, only 33% of the cocaine ~iprents to the United States were by air, 133 but by 1979 the figure ha.; .. .i'isen fran 5Q%134 to 65%}35 Sailing is tedious, nore vulnerable, and the larger loads. subject the shippers to stiffer penalties; 136 it is, therefore, :i.rrprUdent to ship large arrounts and rrore prudent to ship by air. Accordingly, smaller arrounts of cocaine, usually under four kilograms, 137 are transported on carrrercial flights by low:.,..level couriers called \"nn.1les. \"138 This method of smuggling accounts for th f th ff' 139 11Mul 11 \u00b7 '1 \u00b7 e greatest part o e cocame tra :~..c. es \u00b7 are eas~ y 328 I I 140 I recruited in Colanbia, and .they are expendable, se:rving as \"cannon fodder\" for organizations that hire them.

Finally, South Airerican trafficking groups, particularly COlanbian, i are seeking new and expanded markets in Westem \u00b7 Europe. 150 Direct I ', ! shi:prents to Europe are being increased and. a 9trortg market is ~.i.nning \u00b7 i . to develop there.151 \u00b7I I i 3. Cocaine Distribution .. The heaviest.\u00b7 .. concentrations of sopl;listicated Colanbian cocaine organizations, controlling every facet of cocaine flaw fran the \u00b7 :rrountains of Peru and Bolivia .to the Alrerican consurrer, are in Miami, New York, and IDs Angeles. Colanbian cocaine networks, although 'not :rronopolizing the market in these \u00b7areas, exercise their greatest c.ontrol in these cities. Outside of these three cities, the distriliutive networks .are, as yet, marked by less Colanbian involvement. The successful penetration by the Colarbians at the darestic distribution level has been nade possible, at least in part, by the existence of a large Colanbian tolony in the United,.States, many of whose rrembers have ties with cocaine traffickers iri Colarbia.152 Hec;1vy c6ncentrations of Colanbians are, in: fact, in Miami, New York, and ws Angeles. Not suprisingly, Miami is the najor cocaine .port of entry in the United States, follo.r~ed by Los ADgeles, and then New York.153 Jackson Heights, a middle claEis residential section of. Queens .in ' ' ',. ' ' New York City is illustrative of the Colanbian cocaine network that has developed within the United States. In. Jackson Heights, 200.,000 330 ~\u00b7\u00b7 Colanbian inmigrants live, and in the .early 1970s six Colanbian gJmgs, a I i network of about 1,000 individuals, established a cocaine connect~on .

Other Major Cocaine Distribution. Networks Aside from independent cocaine distribution rings, whose significance ought not to be underestimated, the following groups, along with the Colanbians, are actively involved in the cocaine trade. a. The Cubans Despite the relative decline in CUban involverrv:nt that accarimrleei \u00b7 the increase in Colanbian participation in traditionally CUban-controlled areas, Cuban groups are still heavily involved in United States cocaine distribution. 163 CUban cocaine .distribution 331 networks are particularly strong in South Florida and the New York City ' . . area. Evidence indicates, too, that Colanbian traffickers are .still the pripcipal suppliers of the. cuban networks. In 1975, the New. York Tirres repbrted \u00b7that four organizations controlled the bulk of cocaine imPortation and distribution in the .New York aiea.164 The. O:rganizat:ions were reportedly headed and Hugo Curbello, two whan were CUban, while the other two were Colqnbian.165 ; ' ',,, \u00b7;,I'' . I One primarily Co1anbian organization, with reported CUban involva:rentt. smuggled hundre!ds of kilograms of cocaine into the United ' . .. ' States fran Colanbia for distribution, primarily in New Yorkcity.166 Several key figures in the organization were cpnvicted in 1977.167 The organization was rrulti...:t.iered., with various members at different levels of carm:md.168 It was represented in the United States primarily. by it.s . . th . 1' . f J.Irq?Orters, Wl. \u00b7 courJ.ers s l.ppmg m an out o .. \u00b7 e country. . Muc \u00b7 o . the cocaine arrived in false-botttm shoes and suitcases, hollar,;ed-.out coat hangers, and double-lined girdles apd brassieres. 170 Accordingly, when cocaine reaches New York it usually goes to mijor distr,ibution rings 'that. are daninated by either Cubans or Colcinbians and are centered in ~eas with large Latin populations, such as Jackson Heig~ts,. the South Bronx, WaShington Heights, and Union City, ~ew Jersey.171 .These New York rings wholesale the qx:aine in kilogram ' ' ' ' ' '\" .

' \u00b7' , , I ' This lowest level of cocaine dealing is marked by the\u00b7 greatest diversity 1 ' 1 ' ' ' ' ' ' : ' of. individuals invol ve\u00a2l. 332 b. The Mexicans Apparent! y, Mexico is decreasing in importance as a cocaine oorridor to the United States. Despite ~ NewSday story in .1977 that labelled Mexico the \"dispatching center of Latin ~rican cocaine, n17 4 a ' ' General Accounting Offic~ study that same year suggested that Mexico was I in fact the source o:f only 33% of illicit United States cocaine \u00b7 I I supplies.175. Today, noreover, the ~st:imates are that only 25% ofl Uni~ States cocaine supplies flow into the country through Mexico. 176 ! Using I these DFA estimates,177 this translates irl,to approximately 4-6 tors of ' cocaine annually. The shift away fran Mexico as a cocaine sUpplier has been d~ to several factors. First, because of Mexican law enforcem:nt efforts in the mid\"\":l970s, there was a general shift fran Mexico to COlanbia as the major United States marijuana supplier.178 This. shift immobilized many ~ican trafficking organizations that had smuggled both marijuana and . ' cocaine to the United States. Second, the Colanbian cocaine traffickers, who had traditionally supplied ~ican traffickers, 179 began to srruggle cocaine direqtly to the United States in the rnid-1970s.180\u00b7 Accordingly, coeaine supplies to Mexican traffickers decreased substantially during this period. Finally 1 the relative ease of smuggling cocaine into Florida ccrobined with the proximity of Colanbia has made that state the ideal entry point for cocaine into the 'united States. 181 Despite Mexico's decline as a cocaine 5ource, Mexican criminal organizations still play a significant role in cocaine\u00b7\u00b7 traf:ficking \u00b7in the United Sta.tes. These organizations generally smuggle cocaine into the United States with other drugs, usually heroin. Well-organized 333 ~\u00b7. ) rings, centered primarily in the Culiacan region of Mexico, channel cocaine fran Latin Arrerica into the United States.182 \u00b7.The constant legitimate .CC\"~t~Tercial traffit: between Mexico and the United States makes smuggling a relatively easy task. \u00b7 In 1975, there were 157 million legal border crossings\u00b7\u00b7into the United States fran Mexico.183 \"Mules\" are paid to smuggle small anounts into the United. States. Private aircraft are also used to bring in cocaine ::rupplies. The scope of Mexican activity may be illustrated by examining several organizations. An organization headed by Jesus Manuel Araujo-Avila operated from lbs Angeles and supplied cocaine and heroin to major cities in the United States, fran Seattle and l;Ds Angeles on the West Coast to New York and Pittsburgh on the East Coast.184 Total law enforcement seizures from the Araujo-Avila organization included 93 pound f . . 185 ~'~-~ .~. wenty- ullt::liii.JI::rs o organ1zation were i indicted in August 1979.186 It is unclear how many other indivicluals were associated with the operation. Similarly, Jesus Camacho, a 'DFA fugitive, was .the boss of a large..:.scale heroin .and cocaine smuggling operation based in Nogales, Mexico. Camacho often used prostitutes to carry supplies across the border into the United States. Members included Rene Gaveno, Jorge Diaz, and Albert Nunez. 187 Sergi() Ramirez Alarcon heads another Nogales-basedoperation, which deals in heroin and coaine. Ramirez is reportedly closely allied with Johnny Grant Garez, a major heroin dealer also operating fran Nogales. Grant's organizat;.ion supplies cities as far away as Washingt;bn, o.c.188 Finally, Hector Arrbriz, also a DFA fugitive, runs a family drug network fran Nogales, Mexico. '\u00b7 The Arrbriz organization has dealt iri ~d cocaine; its nenbers Cruz 189 334 TwO other Mexican organized criire groups, La Nuestra Familia and I I the Mexicc;m Mafia, also are actively involved in narcotics traffiqking in the Southwestern United sta'tes. 190 La. Nuestra Familia \"~ as \"NF. \"191. There are 25q192 to I 1,000~93 West Coast rrembers. \u00b7 They have a boss who is known as thJ ! . . .J.zona ew . 1.co. The Mexican Mafia, or the \"are,\" is less structured than La Nuestra Familia.197 The street ccmnander of the \"arien is known as .the general \u00b7 or godfather 198 The lower echelon ranks are .the captains and lieutenants. 199 The ex:tent to Which the.se two crin\\inal organizations are involved in cocaine trafficking is, .\u00b7hoWever, unclear. Because of cocaine's popularity on the West Coast, it ImlSt be inferred. that La Nuestra Fainilia and the .Mexican Mafia are involved in the cocaine trade to sate extent. There has been less penetJ;ation by Mafia ... type organized cr~ groups in the Western United States, particularly in the area of . . 200 f th\u00b7. f . 1' . dru the . narcotics. Because e ease o smugg mg gs across . MexJ.can border into the United States, independents. and sophisticated criminal organizations both are involved in the cocaine traffice out of Mexico. The \"openness\" of the West is illustrated by the results of a 1977 Newsday survey of the major narcotics smuggling organizations in Arizona . Of .the nine cocaine smuggling organizations identified, only one had La Cosa Nostra ties, t.h.ree \u00b7were cx:>ntroll~ by Mexican syndicates, and five were headed by independent operators. c. The Israeli Mafia . . 201 202 . The \"Israeli Mafia,\" a group of 40 to 250 rrostl .uus :nuge es , ~ orn~a. This criminal organization is said to be channelling its energies into narcotics trafficking, and by one account controls 50% of the cocaine traffic in the IDs Angeles area. 204 Given the strong Colamianl presence in the .Los Angeles area, this figure is prObably inflated. Nevertheless, the Israeli Mafia has capitalized on the generally unorganized nature of criminal activities in Los Angeles, and it is presently believed tp be .worth up to 100 million dollars. 205 The Israeli Mafia obtains its cocaine supplies fran Miami as well. \u00b7as Mexico City.20~ Ca:rmercial aircraft facilitates th flow of cocaine fran Miami to IDs Angeles, 207 while supplies fran Mexico enter the United States, either overland or by private aircraft. Reportedly, the Israeli Mafia also has ties with La Cosa Nostra elarents in the IDs Angeles area. David Bachisiyan, Arie Bachisiyan and Raphael Ben Sim:::>n, reputed merrt>ers of the Israeli Mafia, have docul:rented ties with La Cosa Nostra in IDs 1 208 d th . . .. 1\u00b7 1 ' k' th 209 Ange an e two groups occas~ona \u00b7 y wor toge er. d. The Bolivians Though nearly ever Latin Arrerican may be involved to sare degree in cocaine trafficki.I1g,210 Bolivia's role is becaning rrore pranin.ent. The illegal cocaine trade earned an estimated 500 million dollars for Bolivian traffickers in 1979. 2\u00b711 There are at least 50 new millionaires in Bolivia because of the cocaine trade, and several of these ' individuals are believed to be worth in, excess of 30 million dOllars. C the . . 1 f '1' . 213 Santa ruz, cocaJ.ne cap1. ta o Bo. 1.

Scire Bolivians are :calling this the \"cocaine coup.\"2~7 The United States ended all cooperation with the Bolivian governrrent on narcotics control in 1980, whe~ it was discovered that defirrite financial connections existed between the current ITiilitMy junta and large scale cocaine traffickers. 218 Rudy Landivat, a :r;ight ~irlg cqalition ~eadeir, in ~livian t:oeaine tr~e. 219 This has led to allegaticins that tre gove:r:nnent itself may ,be involved in drug running. ', ' ' 'I Ttlere is, havever, little evidenc~ of direct Bolivian involvemant in, cocaine distribution within the United States. Bolivian suppl~es are apparently shipped to the United States either through <::olarbia or Mexico. 220, There is also evidence that Bolivian, cqcaine is being sent directly to the West Coast are~. 221 Bolivian involvemant in the, novetrent of cocaine seems, ,to be mini.nlal, implying that organized trafficking groups purchase cocaine in Bolivia and are then, responsible for transport;.ing it to the United States. If this is the case, cocaine traffickers in tbe United, States could conceivably .bypass ,the ,Colari>ian ' ' . ~ . ' ' ' ' ' Connection arid open routes directly frcm Bolivia. ~ scope of typical Bolivian operations may be illustrated by one incident. Alfredo Gutierrez,, a Bolivian, was arrested ii:l May 19ao in eonnection with a nine milliondoll~ d0Whpayt1ent m a t:oeaine deal thatDFA officials valued at 200 million dollars. He forfeited his $100,000 bail and presurrably left the country. 222 e. La Cosa Nostra ,There is little direct evidence ~t would indicate the precise 337 extent of La Cosa Nostra involverrent in cocaine trafficking~ Based on . the existing infonnation, however, sate tentative conclusions can be dr A 1 17 Ti\"'t.., f '1' 223 and 117 kn . La Cosa Nostra' s presence in the Florida area, where 40% of the nations's cocaine enters the United States,225 suggests the t \u00b7 possibility of considerable involvarent in cocaine trafficking, ,. ' ' .l particularly when revenues fran. it run to six billion dollars annually. 226 While there is no direct evidence of an I.CN cocaine ':; chann~l to South America with ICN elerrents transporting its supplies to the United States, tl:lE! evidence of such. direct.LCN involverret:lt in the ' marijuana trade suggests tha:t I..CN may be. similarly invol'\\red in the. i. eocaine traffic fran South America.. In addition, goverrnrent agents pesirig as LCN leaders have been readily accepted in Colombia as legitimate purchasers of rnulti\"'-kilo quantities of cbcaine, 227 arguing :, .. \u00b7. that \u00b7.there may be I.CN involvarent in actually transporting eocaine to the United States. Although ICN elarents have the resources, experience, and expertise needed to smuggle cocaine into the United States, 228 the available evidence .indiqates that :r.CN groups nerely purchase large an:ountsi of cocaine after it has been. Sml.lggled into the country by Latino groups, 229 , pr.imarily Colanbians. Since LCN is by far the best organized criminal\u00b7 group in the United States, with 26 families and up to 50,000 confede~tes, 230 \u00b7 there is a natciral netwOrk for the cocaine supplies ~ Obtained in Florida. The impoJ:ter/wholesaler roles are, of course, the. nost profitable links in the cocaine .distribution chain. An. importer wil.l pay approxbnately $38,000-40,000 for a kilogram when it has. been smuggled into. the United States. 231 By the tine it is adulterated;. or 338 ) ,',\".1 o I '' ..,,-> '\\'!,, ,~' ~\u00b7' '), cut, by the wholesaler, the street value of the cocaine is as high as ' ' $800,000.232 An organization with established distr~tion networks like I.CN cOQld turn great profits in the cocaine tra<:le, , if supplies were assured. David Vidal, a writer for the New York Tirres, claims \"the lion's share [of eventual cocaine profits} goes to \"the Arcerican ! ' ' ' ' ,\u00b7. underworld. \"233 Presumably, I\u00a3N figures praninently in this division of profits. i . ' The existing evidence of LCN, penetration in the cocaine ,market may Qe grouped in three ways. First, LCN nas in fact acted :in concert with Latin organizations that have been actively involved in the cocaine 2~4 ' ' trade since the early 1~60s, rrostly in South Florida. \u00b7These inclu\u00a2ie Colanbian, CUban, and Mexican organizations. 235, LCN involvenent with ' ,\u00b7 M:!xican organizations also takes pl.:;~.ce in the West., Because the Florida drug trade, .is , so large, these various groups manage to coexist, 236 ' . 237 saretirres even peacefully. Second, LCN has apparently taken mler sare existing co\u00a2aine di. \u00b7 ibu \u00b7 f \u00b7 , \u00b7 the. u\u00b7 \u00b7ted. s 238 The. , t has taken over, however, have been generally independent, as opppsed. to . ' the established CUban. \u00b7or Colcnbian organizations, since the \u00b7\u00b7Q.lbap. and Colarbian organizations are often too p:::Merful to daninate. In addition, Colcnbians control the bulk of supplies. Nevertheless, should LCN cultivate alternate sources such as Bolivia, ,LCN could conceivably challenge ccilanbian, d~ce of the coca~ market. Third, I.CN has evidently bought its way into the market in scree areas by purchasil;lg large quantities of cocaine aoo driving out the i independents. 239 Because of these LCN efforts, the coca~ tra~ is, therefore, becatd.ng increasingly centralized at the irrp:>x;tation ! I ' ,' ' I 339 1 1 240 Th . d. d . . . 1 . eve e ~ epen ent organ1zat1ons are, at east 1n same cases, either being driven out of the business or taken over by I.CN elements. The efforts of Colanbian groups to exercise greater control over United States distribution has also contributed to this centralizatiol). LCN involvement may be illustrated by looking at two drug organiza;t,ions. First, from the late 1960s until 1975, Richard Cravero headed' one of the largest marijuana and cocaine operations in South Fl . da 241 ' . . f cravero obtained. his supplies from a Colant>ici-based group which included Otto Archfuald, Alberto Rainirez, and Aldopho The narcotids woul~ ' ' care fran Colcrr:bia on a large sh:Lp an(l transfers .would \u00b7I 11 r\\corlhr.::. , sma er s 1.ps o anu. coast me. st o ravero s s~~ts would land at Cod Sound in Monroe County. 245 The cocaine and marijuana \u00b7 would then be shipped to the ,Atlantic coastal states, into the Midwest, and the South. 246 Although Cravero chose not to becace a 11madei11 member of I.CN, his organization clearly owed allegiance to the Gambino fqmily of New York.247 Cravero often associated.with Ralph Broccoli, a soldier in the Gambino family, 248 and he picked up noney from Charles Gambino to finance drug purchases. 249 , Accordingly, the qperation of the Cravero organizatio~ ~hasizes four significant points about LCN .involvement in the cocaine trade. First, LCN .has been involved to same degree in cocaine traffickirlg at least since the late 1960s. SeGond, South \u00b7 Florida is the area of greatest LCN fuvolvement in the trade. Third, LCN groups use their resourc;es ,to finance large purchases of cocaine, assuring themselves o.f a good return on their invest:Irent. Fourth, LCN groups often purchase cocaine from established Colanbia-pased organizations, \\\u00a2ich in tUrn. transport the cocaine to the United States. 340 ' ill ) -------------\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 A second LCN related organization is that of Peter Licavoli, Jr. , son of LCN boss Peter Licavoli, Sr. , who runs his own Arizona branch of the old Zerilli-Licavoli crime family of Detroit. Licavoli is in fact the boss of a drug ring operating fran Tucson, Arizona, which smuggles both cocaine and heroin to St. Louis; Detroit; Youngst:c:Mn, Ohio; Anah e L~cavo ~ orgaruzat~on, therefore, illustrates three additional points about LCN involvement in the cocaine trade: First, although LCN groups obtain the bulk of their cocaine supplies fran the South Florida area, Mexico is also a source whe ' ' ' 1 ' ' 1 I.CN 251 d Ti\"kT Secon , ~~ groups establishing themselves in the West have turned to drug irrportation as a source of revenue. Third, I.CN cocaine importation operations may be very profitable because the supplies can be channelled into existing nationwide distribution channels. 7. Law Enforcement Response Stenming the South American cocaine flow is cited as a key objective by the DFA. 252 Nevertheless, federal efforts to check this flow have been less than successful. Only 5-10% of the cocaine flow in the United States is-seized by law enforcement agencies. 253 Because cocaine is smuggled in small arrounts and in a variety of ingenious ways, enforcem:mt efforts have little effect on the cocaine traffic. Seizures may be sumnarized as follows: Administration: 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 Danes tic 427 239 537 700 675 492 pounds. .141 Cocaine Seizures: Coast Guard 1973-74 1. 1973-1979 1975 1976 -0-2'0 (in 1979 -.04 Cocaine Seizures: CUstoms, 1977-19802~5 Number of Seizures Quantity (in lbs. \u00b7) Street Value \u00b7 (millions of dollars) 1977 1,025 925.1 CUstoms: Size of Average Seizure (in pounds) 1977 .92 1978 1.67 1979 1.14 1980 1,307 4,742.9 1,528.826 1980 3.62 Cocaine traffickers are often better equipped than 'the DEA and CUstoms.256 Traffickers etr1?loy sophisticated intelligence networks, high performance vessels and aircraft, arid the latest communications equiprent. 257 Because these groups nonitor the radio bands, the DFA agents have to talk in code over their frequency. 258 \u00b7\u00b7 Corrp:>unding the law enforcen:ent frustrations is the frenquent reluct:ance of judges to convict for s:i.rrple possession of cocaine. 259 Convicted . couriers draw average jail te:rms between two and three years: female couriers: 24 nonths, male couriers: 36 nonths. 260 These convictions do J.,ittle ~r nothing tc) stem the cocaine flow. ~use interdiction is a technique of limited :i.rrpact, the traffic nust also be hit at the source through crop eradication, crop sub . . d strategy effective . . . f 262 cocame en orcen:ent. Since .Peru and Bolivia are the principal coca leaf producers in the world, the. extent of the. cocaine traffic depends . 1 th . ff . 1' ' ' od 263 great y on \u00b7 e~r e orts to lllUt pr uct~on. n \u00b7 .. \u00b7\u00b7~.Peru undertook a limited coca plant eradication program at ,the urging of t;.he 342 264 .. United States govemnt. By most accounts the effort was a failure,265 although the United States remains hopeful about the Bolivian approach to c~a plant control at first seemed promising. Registration of coca land began in 1977 in an effort to limit. excess production.267 Nevertheless, the foreign demand pra:npted many Bolivians to expan(l their coca fields in defiance of the governrrent, and coca fields have been expanded to such an extent that the country m,ay sqon have a problem feeding its ~ll:'eady undernourished population.268 The preSent governm:IDt' s reputed tieswith cocaine traffickers2q9 has ended the United States governrrent' s hope of enlisting Bolivian cooperation.. 270 Even assuming that Peruvian and Bolivain coca leaf growth were totally stopped, coca \u00b7leaves could easily be cultivated in other parts of the . 271 world., such as Java, Madagascar, British Guyana, and Ceylon. The prospects for success, are in short, not bright. Henry L.. Giordano, fm:n:er Corrmissioner of the Uni tE!d. States Bureau of Narcotics, testified before the McClellan camiittee in July ~964. Giordano cc::::mnented on the problem of coca leaf chewing by natives of Peru and Bolivia. 272 Giordano concluded that \"the Indians\" had ~ be converted i from chewing the coca leaf into a nonnal diet so they can eliminate their growth of coco leaf~ \"273 Giordano's cooments illustrate; the .major difficulty in the eradication approach: the role of tradition. The coca leaf is the chewing .gum and the aspirin for a vast region stretching from Colanbia into Chile .and Argentina. 274 Large scale coca leaf eradication would be as popular as a prohibition against tObacco in the United States. 275 Coca leaves are as much. a part of life in the Andes as the. bananas, citrus fruits, coffee, and vegetables that 343. are grown on the sarre terraced hillsides.276 Consequently, crop arrl incare substitution must be considered as alternatives to crop destruction.277 Although source control is the nost effective method of curbing the oocaine flow in the United States, enforcement efforts in Colanbia could also be fruitful. Since the majority of South American cocaine passes through Colanbia, effective enforcement in that CO\\mtry could substantially affect North American supplies. Every kilogram of cocaine seized before it enters the United States prevents eight kilograms of cut cocaine fran reaching the American streets. Colombian law enforcement officials occasionally disrupt major networks in Colombia. Operation Kitchen, a 1975 joint DFA-colombia effort, imrobilized seven processing laboratories and resulted in the seizure of a ton of cocaine.278 A September 10, 1978 raid on three other laboratories resulted in an 800 kilogram seizure. The street ! value of the cocaine was estimated at 400 million dollars, 279 twice the Colombian national budget. Nevertheless, the blun truth is that! this avenue of attack does not hold out much pranise of success. D. Marijuana 1. Introduction In 1968, Americans spent approximately one hundred million dollars on marijuana.1 In 1979, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) --- -\u00b7 -\u00b7\u00b7 --\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7-\u00b7-\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 -----\u00b7-\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7---\u00b7 -------\u00b7-\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7---\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7--estimated that the annual retail value of the marijuana trade in the United States ranged fran 15 to 22 billion dollars. 2 Journalistic estimates (Tine Magazine) placed the figure as high as 24 billion dollars. 3 An estimated 43 million Americans have srroked marijuana, 4 of which at least 1Smillion are regular users.5 These figures have risen 344 j .. sharply fran 1970, when of the 12 million Anericans who had tried marijuana, about three million were regular users.6 .\u00b7An increase in consl.lltption by users age 18 and over rrore th.an carpensat.e\u00a21 for a leveling off, in use by youths aged 12-17.7 Today' marijuana is the nmnber two illicit incare producer of the illicit traffic ip d.rugs.

The traffic itself is highly sophisticated, yet decentralized.. No. one ethnl,c group has had a oonopoly over the traf~ic, but Mafia'-type organized crine participation in it is surfacing, both in smuggling. and distribution.15 Marijuana use is likely to remain at high level, although total consl.lltption may decline, principally anong children and teenagers where ~e rates appear to. have stpbilized and the population is declining.16 User. preference for higher-potency marijuana will favor thedevelop:rent c>f a d.anestic industry. 17 Here, too, the prospects for success of law enforcement efforts at curtailment is bleak. 2.

' ' : mail order business, which saretiires covered several states. :tn fact, one Texas druggist established a riic;til business for mariju.ana, whiqh served ~starers in Texas, Arkansas, Arizona, .Kansas, and Coloraoo. 21 The first great Arrerican entry point for marijuana, however,, was . ' New Orleans . 22 During World WAR I, West Indian and South American sailo:r.-s brought maijuana into the city, and they were joined by Mexicans who had recently slipped over the border. 23 Black and Creole jazz rr.:m :fo\\Jl1d marijuana very appealing and consequently introduced. it to Chieago on .large scale as the jazz-fever spread north in mid 1920s. 24 Mezz Mezzrow, a white clarinetist s~tiires referred to as the \"Jol1nny Appleseed of Weed,\" travelled\u00b7 frcm Chicago to int!;cxluced marijl.lanCi to N~ York City. of.the 1930s, it was estimated that there were 500 marijuanadealers in Harlem alone.26 Harry J. 'Anslinger, appointed Conmissioner of the Federal Bureau of .347 ) .. Narcotics in the late 1930s, depicted marijuana as a menace to society and a corrupter of youth and morals. 27 Largely as a result of Anslinger s efforts, Congress passed the Marijuana Tax Act in 1937, effectively outlawing the use of marijuana in the United States. 28 The Narcotic Control Act of 195929 provided severe penalties for use or possesion of marijuana. Under this act, possession of any anount of marijuana brought a minimum sentence of 2 years for the first offense, five. years for the second, and ten years \u00a3or .third and . S'llbsequent offenses. Conviction for sale of marijuana was punishable by a minim:nn sentence of\u00b7 five years for the first offense with ten years for second and subsequent offenses or any sale by em adult to a minor. Every state in the Union followed the federal lead, sare providing e\\Teh harsher penalties.30 Not until passage of the Controlled Substances Act of 197031 was ! s,i.rrple possession of small arrounts reduced to a misdemeanor. 32 Mandatory min;i.mum sentences were. also abolished for all convicted offenders except large traffickers. 33 By this. tine, marijuana had care to be associated with the social. upheavals of the sixties,34 and its use had increased dramatically~ b. ~ern Marijuana\u00b7Use Marijuana is today the most widely uSed illicity drug.35 I Marijuana use in the 1970s becarre no longer restricted to any paftieular group \u00b7\u00b7or. class . within the general population. ! The United States marijuana market. has grown substantially ~inqe 1970, when an estinated 650 tons satisfied the . . . . 38 .. By 1977, the market had grown to 7,000 to 10,000 rretric tons. \u00b7.\u00b7\u00b7 . Today, Arrericans cons'l.llre 220,462-397,713 qaily, for an annual total of 13,600 tons. 39 One source (Tiire. Magazine) places the annual Atrerican cons'l.ID\"ption of marijuana tons, or 131,000 40 poun s per day. The Arrerican marijuana market is supplied primarily by two foreign I sources: Colanbia41 and Mexico. 42 In 1970, approximately 80% to '95% of i the. marijuana consuned in the United States carre fran Mexico. I i Presently, the estimates range fran. 70%43 to 75%44 to 90%45 Arrertcan Colanbia. 3$, 000 to tons of, a!lp\"Ually.47 tnat 70~000 ! ..

In recent years, then, Mexico's share of the Arrerican marijuana mar~et haS dropped to less than 20%.49 Apart from Colombia's dominance in the market, Jamaica accounts for the balanee of foreign marijuana / : supplies50 althoUgh small amounts fromThailand51 and Africa52 are finding their way into the Uni.ted States. Califomia and Hawaii are the principal darestic.produc:::ers, supplying betWeen 5~10% of the Arrerican market.53 One of the ITQst std.king illustrations of 1;:he dramatic increase in the marijuana trade is the size of present law enforcement seizures. In all of 1965 1 5 .1 tons of marijuana were seized by U.S. CUstans. 54 In 1978, during just two days of hearings before the Select Ccmnittee on ' ' ,, ' . ' ' Narcotics Abuse and Control, U.S. law enforc:ment agencies seiz.oo 4 7. 5 tons of marijuana in the Florida area alone. 55 At the street level, marijuana has cost between $22.0056 and $60.0057 an ounce, depending on the quality ,of the product. Presently the average street value is approximately $50.00-60.00 an ounce, roughly 349 ) $600.00 a pound.58 The average consumer generally purchases marijuana in ounce quantities or less. \"Lid\" and \"bag\" are tenns connoting a quantity equivalent to an ounce.59 75-100 marijuana cigarett can be made from a lid or bag, depending on the size of the cigarette. 60 They are typically called \"joints\"; other slang tenns for marijuana include: Acapulco gold, hay, hemp, J., Jane, Maryjane, nota, mutah, Panama red, pot, 61 reefer, stock, tea, and weed In 1968, Americans spent approximately one hundred million dollars on marijuana.62 In 1979, the National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Ccmnittee (NNICC) estimated that the annual retail value of the marijuana trade ranged from 15.48-21.9 billion dollars.63 A recent publication placed the figure as high as 24 billion dollars.64 According to NNICC estimates, marijuana accounted for about 30% of all incare from drug transactions in the United States in 1979.65 The retail revenues generated from the sale of marijuana, however, fall below cocaine, making marijuana the number two revenue illicit drug. 66 As in the cocaine trade, marijuana trafficking has generated enonrous profits throughout the distributive chain except for, perhaps, the peasant farrrer. Of the price paid in the United States, it is estimated that the grower earns 1%, the middleman, usually Colanbian, 19% and the Airerican 80%.67 Colanbian marijuana prices along (based on as -follCMs:\u00b7- \u00b7PUrchased from the fanrer: 70 beach or a1rcraft ($80,000-$160,000 a ton) $40 -80; smuggled into the United States ($230,000 a ton) $115;72 wholesaled in minimum~ ton lots $600.74 350 '\u00b7 . \u00b7~\u00b7.\u00b7 4. Marijuana Trafficking Although law enforcement officials fear75 increasing participation of sophisticated criminal organizations in the marijuana traffic,76 77 it remains remarkably open. \u00b7 \u00b7 The bulk of the ca11rerical Sirn.lggling ventures, which involve multi-ton quantitites of marijuana, are in fact directed by\u00b7well-organized traffickers inSbuth America and the United States. 78 Nevertheless, independent operators are also heavily involved in. marijuana smuggling fran South Alrerica, particularly Colanbia. 79 Organized criminal groups in Colcmbia purchase marijuana fran local 80 gr<Mers. The o:r:;ganizations then stockpile large. supplies .in warehouses, ~sually located on the Guajira peninsula~81 Fran there, the marijuana is transported to the United States bY large-scale criminal organizations, as well .as small-tiire independent operators. 82 Colanbian organizations deliver multi-ton loads to organizations ~sed in the u.s. Colanbian freighters, called 11notherships,\" hover outside the U.S. wat:ersi the stateside organizations then shuttle smaller loads to locations in Florida. 83 Non-colcmbian \u00b7 Sirn.lggling groups al~ ~chase marijuana: in Colcmbia, and then transport it to the United Sta~s by plane or by ship. Up to 30% of ,the nation 1 s marijuana flCMs. into the country lthrough . ' Florida~ 84 A large portion of it is brought in along Florida 1 s West . . . 85 Coast between Key West and St. Petersburg. Once in the United States, the typical distributive chain is as foliCMs: LEVEL 1. Main distributor 2. Large distributors 351 QUANTITY PURCHASED :m:l-1 PREVIOUS LEVEL 25,000-50,000 wholesaler 100-500 ' 89 pounds 5. Upper-level dealers ' 90 4-50 pounds 6. Lower-level dealers 1 ounce-4 pounds 91 Fran the main distributor level to the street, the evidence indicates that, the involverrent of criminal organizations steadil~ decrea~es. The roles fran irrporter to distributor are the nost i ! profitable and nost insulated !ran law enforcement activity. The average Arrerican consurrer purchases fran,either an upper-level ~aler or ! ' a lower-level, dealer. Below the l<JV..Ter-level dealer stage, there are i , often even lower distributive levels dealing in amounts as small,as a single marijuana cigarette. a. Scope of Involvement Individ~ls fran all walks of life, includings attorneys, college students, and businessmen are involved in tQe marijuana trade.92 Several factors explain this widespread involvement, in marijuana trafficking. First, the enorrrous quantities of marijuana needed to 93 supply the Anerican market, roughly 30-50 tons daily, require the participation of many people; from large-scale SllUlggling rings ,all the 94 way to small time srrugg:)..ers. Because marijuana is so bulky catFU\"ed to cocaine or heroin, no one group can control its flow into the United States. Second, the large and diverse number of Anerican users necessarily requires a large and diverse distributive system. Third, marijuana is also nore easily distributed among friends than a drug like heroin. 95 Since heroin networks require rrore syndicate help in distribution, 96 considerably less noral stigma is attached to the trafficking of marijuana than to other drugs, like heroin.97 Finally, 352 ia since rrarijuana is relatively inexpensive $50-$60 an ounce~\u00b7 $2,200 an ounce for cocaine, entrepreneurs are .attracted to small tine marijuana trafficking. b. The Dealers The number of marijuana dealers in the United States is impossible to detennine. One New York City wholesaler estimated that there is at least one marijuana dealer for every block in New York ~ at least one wholesaler for every ten blocks. 98 Several years ago the govermrent estimated that there were approximately 175,000 marijuana dealers in the United States. 99 The dealer may be a Puerto. Rican child . op:mly seiling nickel bags, $5 worth of marijuana, at a New York stoplight, 100 a doo:rman at a fine hotel,101 a cabdriver who sells td his riders,102 a high school or college student, 104 a lawyer, or a businessman. Iri short, there is no \"typical\" dealer. As one official testified, \"Everybody is getd . .ng into th damn t .. 105 e ac The lower level dealer generally buys marijuana from an upper level dealer in pound quantities. A dealer who obtains a pol.lild of marijuana for $400.00 can show a profit. of $240.00 .after selling the pound in $40.00 one ounce quantities. Other level.dealers may be only interested in supplying their own marijuana needs. Besides channelling marijuana to a maxinrurn number of consl.llTers, the large number of dealers acts to insulate the higher levels of the distributive chain. Many lower level dealers cannot possibly know where their suppliers obtained their marijuana. 5. \u00b7 , The Independents . a. The Smugglers 353 I I 1. Colarbia 1 s daily marijuana flor..v to the United States, 27.7 metric tons, 107 demands widespread participation iri Sirn.lggling activities. In fact, Colanbian sources seem willing to sell to any individual or organization that displays the ability to :rrove large quantities of marijuana, and according to DFA Administrator Peter B. Bensinger, \"it isn 1 t always a criminal syndicate. \"108 Florida, the nation 1 s primary entry point for marijuana, lies only 1,100 miles to the north of Colcmbia, within the range of nost privately . 109 owned aircraft and pleasure boats. Entrepreneurs engaged in smuggling marijuana fran Colcmbia can also purchase surplus aircraft or ships fran the United States governrrent relatively cheaply. 110 The C-54, a plane with a cruising range of 3,500 miles and a carrying capacity of 2.5 tons, can be purchased for as lor..v as $15,000.111 In a matter of weeks, the independent operator can purchase a plane, establish contacts\u00b7 in Colcmbia, and bririg a load to the United States. 112 Florida 1 s 250 registered airports serve as convenient and unloading centers in the United States.113 S 1 sh. 118 d . tel ___ .... . 1 114 urp us 1ps an pr1va y uw1~ vesse s are also used by . . independent operators to bring shiprrents of marijuana into the United States. For exarrple, a Morgan 41-foot, two-mast sailboat can be purchased for $50,000 new or $25,000 used.115 After the boat is stripped for smuggling purposes, it can hold 3.5 tons of marij~.116 Other boats are much nore sophisticated. Costing as much as $250,000 118 ' and able to reach speeds of up to 70 nph, many of them --called' \"cigarette\" boats after the tobacC0\"7bootlegging vessels of the 1930s119- f. ted 'th dar. inf ed scopes.121 The surplus ships cary tons of marijuana and rendezvous with 354 these snall boats 50-60 miles off the Florida coast.122 The smaller boats then ferry the drugs ashore, 123 vanishing into the sane 3000 miles of Florida coastline. Once the marijuana has been successfully brought into the United States, one of three options is available to the independent smuggler. 124 First, he can sell his load directly to a rrain distributor for approximately $115 per pound. Second, he can sell the marijuana to. wholesalers from around the country at $215-$315 a pound if he has adequate storage facilities within the United States. Mditiona~ manpower will also be required to ensure the security of the marijuana supplies. Third, he can atterrpt to establish his own distributive system within the United States, although the independent smuggler rarely has the expertise or the resources available to successfully distribute below the wholesale level. Srrn.lggling marijuana from South Anerica is an extremely lucrative entreprise. 125 An independent smuggler earns between $80,000 and $160,000 on each ton of marijuana sold to a rrain distributor in the United States. If the smuggler is able to wholesale the marijuana itself, his earnings will range between $310,000-$510,000 per ton. From these earnings, an independent can easily pay the expenses involved in transporting a load of marijuana from Colarbia to the United States. More .inp:)rtant, the profits can be put towards an .even larger purchase in the future. Srrn.lggling marijuana fran Mexico requires less of\u00b7 an initial investlrent, and is also very lucrative. In Grass Roots, Albert Goldman describes how easily an individual can establish himself as a successful smuggler: 355 I. I t 11 r a t nn '$ I 1:!: ?:Z dW'S' '.'m Ubt\u00bb_w_,i ____ Now suppose a kid buys a Pound of high-quality weed for $350.00. He breaks it down into sixteen ounces at $45.00 an. ounce. .

A properly financed independent organization possessing the necessary conta~s to rrove large quantities \u00b7of marijuana within the United States can show enoriiDus profits acting as a main distributor. AcCording to Frederick Rody of the DEA.' s Miartri. Office, \"you I can \u00b7 negotiate for 10 tons of marijuana and tbey' 11 deliver it to you~ like Sears, ROebuck 12 miles outside th~ United States. coast. \"127 bnCe the. main distributor brings the marijuana into the United States it is quickly sold to upper lev~l wholesalers, thereby m.:inimizing ~tLJra~ and I I the independent distribt.rtor ltlaY oftentilres.be ~ting with sophisticated criminal position in the rrarijuana netWo:r'k, tlXJugh lucrative, can be very dangerous. The. independent upper level wholesaler .obtains large quanti ti~s of \u00b7 I I or ~re, fran main distrilmtors. The ffii#:lence \u00b7 \u00b7. \u00b7 \u00b7 ' ' ,: - indicates that independent wholesalers usually traVel to the South 356 i'j ) ' Florida area and drive the loads back to the~r res~cti ve. areas. Once in the United States, marijuana is relatively easy to transport, although, because of its bulkiness, it is shipped primarily by notor vehicle rather than by plane. The insignificance of carrrerical airline use for marijuana smuggling is reflected in Miami I~te~tional Airport seizure statistics for the the years 1975-1978:128 Marijuana Seizlires (in POunds) 1975 l976 1977. . 1978 10.0 3.1 1.8 1.0 :, Cantercial airlines, insignificant in' d.c:xrestic marijuana distribution, are a key rrean$ of cocaine distribution.

The Black Tuna gang, one of the the best organized ever encountered by the DFA 130\\-!as run by Robert Platshorn and Robert Meinster. 131 The rrarijuana inp:>rting operation was conceived in 1974132 and in the next two years the organization brou.ght 35 loads into the u.s.133 Five hundred tons of marijuana, wholesaling at 300 mill~on dollars, was Smuggled in during this period. 134 The organization netted \u00b7 approximately $500,000 a week.135 A used car agency served as Meinster 1 s and :Platshorn 1 s front. 136 '1he Bl~ck Tnna Gang employed 35-60 pedple, 137 and .it used a fleet of :, ,, ' ' ' ' .. \u00b7. ' ships and planes to bring marijuana into the United States.138 Meinster ' ,\u00b7 i and Platshorn hired fol:1TY2r cam~ercial pilots, who dnew gaps in Coastal radar networks.139 :tn addition, fa;lse water lines were painted on the , hulls of the boats so they would appear empty when full. 140 The Black TUna gang received supplies from Pedro Davila~ a marijuana,.kingpin 357 in Santa Marta,. Colanbia.141 A box of diapers would be sent to Davila as a \"go signal,\" indicating that \"baby11 was ready for \"nother,\" i.e., the nothership.142 Although the Black Tuna gang obtained a great .deal of its supplies fran Colanbian notherships,. evidence indicates that the organization also brought loads directly fran Colombia.143 DFA and FBI agents broke .the Black Tuna gang in 1977 in \"Operation Banco.\"144 Through an examination of 478,915 currency transaction reports, these agencies were able . to trace large bank deposits to the Black Tur1.a organization. ~45 Twelve defendants were charg~ in a: dred indo ahd th' 0 ' 0 1 146 one-hun page . 1.ctrrent, .\u00b7 e1.r tr1.a .. ast our non s.

' ' ' ' illustrates that the marijuana trade attz:acts individuals fran all walks of life, is extremely profitable, even for a small-time operation, and is relatively easy to enter, even for a novice. The case alSo i denonstrates the shift away fran Mexico to , sourc~ on a $11 ' . . . scale, as well as that sare marijuana shi~nts_ enter the United l Sta~s i through the East Coast. c. Other Roles Not evt;rryone 1 of course, possesses the expertise or desire\u00b7 to , organized a srruggling, irrporting, or wholesaling ring~ There are, however, other parts the average individual can play in the marijuana trade. \"Mule,s,\" for eXample, are the individuals who are paid to smuggle small quantities of marijuana into the United. States on their person or in their luggage. Since najor marijuana sntuggling organizations cannot rrove supplies effectively in this nanner becau's~ .of the bu,lk product, \"Imlles\" also include persons paid to drive lpads of narijuana across the Mexican border. In a typical case, Jesus ApodaCa., '359 .D ) a Mexican, was paid $800.00 to drive a 1,370 pound load into the United States.163 The rrules involved in these sorts of activities rarely know the narre of their employers. Apodaca, for; example, was approached by \"unl<nown rren. n164 Accordingly, they play an essential insulating role. A pilot, unlike a driver, can earn approximately $50,000-$100,000 for a ro\\,lildtrip flight fran Colanbia tO Floric1a165, each part of which takes about 6 to 7 hours 166 The entire round-trip take's well under twenty four hours. \"Ferry-nen,\" the \u00b7individuals who supply the equiprent and manpower to shuttle marijuana from notherships into the United States,. earn up to 10% of the cargo's value.167 \"Off. loaders\" are the individuals who unload marijuana from planes and ships in. the United StateSi they can earn between $10,000 and $15,000 for work.168 nake up d e 1n epen ent operators ~e r1s e financiers supply the noney. Finally, \"Professional Services Types\" are the lawyers,. bankers, real estate agents, brokers; like any business with a large cash flow, a marijuana trafficking organization requires legal and financial services.171 These people, too, make .the t~ffic possible. 6. Organized Crilre Once largely confined to young Arrericans backpacking the drug across the Mexican border, marijuana SIIU.lggling now rivals the. heroin trad:e in tenns of organized crirre involvemant as large, sophisticated criminal organizations with the assets to purchase ocean-going 360 freighters and sophisticated electronic equi.prent. becare involved in large-scale marijuana sm1ggling.172 According to Senator Lawton Chiles, \u00b7~e have to forget the image of marijuana as a couple of giggling teenagers behind the high school gyrrnasium srcoking a. joint. We are talking al:xru.t cold-blooded killers , and organized cri.rce, an international financial operation .which floats billions of dollars fran bank to bank around the world.\" 17 3 The evidence indicates, in. short, that organized crbre bee~ involved in marijuana trafficking at least as early as the 1970s.174 \u00b7. It was at this ti.rce that multi-ton marijuana seizures began to occur with \u00b7 ' f 175 Ac d' . A W'l . 1 mcreasmg requency. cor .\u00b7 . son, a spec1.a agent for the Florida Depa.rt:rrent of Law Enforcercent, \"These seizures were m<roe up in the panhandle. area of the state [Florida] , which was the off-loading site, 7 tons in one instance, 20 tons in another.

Second, marijuana trafficking, as noted above, .is extrerrely lucrative . 179 Third, .when Colanbia replaced Mexico as the pr~ marijuana supplier in the mid-1970s, organized criminal groups were in a position of being nore able \u00b7to control the flow of marijuana into .the United States.

In addition 42% of the marijuana carne in lots over 4.4 pounds, large enough to be considered carmercial. 198 Accordingly, the average Arrerican buyer with the proper connections and know-how could arrange a deal on the MeXican side of the border. and bring the shiprent in ~lf.199 ..

Today As noted, Mexico supplies less than 11% of the U.S. narijtiana market. 213 50% of Mexican marijuana is smuggled into the United States via aricraft. Pilots land at clandestine airstrips in the U.S. or drop the marijuana into deserted regions; smaller\u00b7 arrounts tcn'e\u00b7 overlapd. 214 in the early 1970s most Mexican marijuana flqws into the United States through California, Arizona,. and Texas. . Arizona is a particularly popular dl:ug corridor because of its sparse popul.ation, J.tS est:unated 2,000 clandestine landing .. areas, and. the well-established srrn.Iggling organizations on both sides of the border. Indeed, .the available evidence indicates that Mexico and Central AnErican may hlso be used increasingly to ship Colombian marijuana to the United States.215 Law nforcement efforts in the Carribbean area have forced 365 traffickers to consider alternate rbutes to. the United States. 216 Presumably, each organization was involved in the marijuana trade when Mexico was the pri.rrary source. Nevertheless, the extent of\u00b7 the La Nuestra Familia and Mexican .t-1afia involvem:mt in the marijuana trade today is unclear. Other i.rrp:>rtant groups include the Samaniego-Meraz organization I headed by Manuel Samaniego-Meraz I and based. in Agua Prieta, Mexico.

The Colanbians a. Introduction Colanbian involvem:mt in the marijuana trace can only be understood in a historical context. After Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 I thousands of CUban nationals flooded into South Florida. These CUban a:mnunities fonted the matrix out of which sohisticated narcot,ics \u00b7 \u00b7 2W trafficking organizations arose and sought South Airerican sources. Accordingly, Colcrnbia becarre a major cocaine source in the late 1960s; although it sent, only small arrounts of marijuana to the .. Cuban and ~rican networks in Florida at that tine. In the early to rnid-1970s, 366 ~\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u00b7 .. Colanbian traffickers becarre directly involved in u.s. distribution, as effective Mexican law enforqerrent efforts and the paraquat scare caused traffickers to :.tum to Colaribia for u.s. mctrijuana supplies. 221 traffic;:king in $ee ways bes.ides growing the plant: First they .sell to foreign purchasers in Colaribia. ]\\vailable evidenCE: indicates that Colaribian sources are willing to sell to any individual or organization that displays the ability to .rrove large quantities of mctrijuana fran Col~ia to the Un.ited States. Second, they shiJ:> ; Colaribians control . oceangoing vessesls that transport large quantities of marijuana to the u.s. 222 The loads are 9enerally: delivered to Colaribian, Cuban or Airerican networks in the u.s. Third, they apparently directely distribute. marijuana within the U.s. Since the market is so large, .no one group can control distribution, but that is the Colaribians least significant role. And, despite great. Cola'rbian involvarent in the trade, the darestic distributors get 80%. of the price. I . ' that U.S. marijuana conswrers pay the while the Colanbian middlerren receive only and the foreign grower 1%.223 Colaribian soil224 and clirnate225 are ideal for marijuana cultivation. One growing season follows .the otht=r, maximizing crop output.226 The bulk of illicit cultivation is on the Guajira peninsula,227 where 100,000228 to 250,000229 acres are devoted to of this ,illl.Cl.t fanrers grow marijuana, and the mctrketing provides a other 233 One acre of mctrijuc:ma 367 ~ .\u00b7 yeilds approXimately 250-350 pounds of marijuana. There is evidence that organized criminal goups are also involved in large scale ~ijuana growing. In 1977, for example, the Wbrld.' s largest marijuana plantation ed. . . . . th G ' ' . 1 234 Th 1 .

Selling After a Colanbian organization obtains t;le necessary supplies, it will often smuggle the marijuana to large warehouses on the quajira P=ninsula. 236 There are at l~ast nine ait:strips in Colamia, 237 where each has a warehouse containing 100,000-l,OOO,OOO pounds of marijuana. 238 Foreign purchasers involved in directly smuggling marijuana fran Colamia to the United States are invariably Arrerican using aircraft as the mode of transport.239 A well-connected foreign buyer is typically taken to a Warehouse where he Will inspect the product before\u00b7 purchasing. After a deal. is concluded, the Colamian supplier will select. a t.ine and place for the buyer to land in Colamia . to. pick up his load. 240 Hundreds of Clandestine. airstrips hq.ve J J.ra I;\"egJ:on. ere are so many. 1 \u00b7 ega . . '. 242 \u00b7airstrips we don't really count them\", says a Colamicu;t officer. At the appointed tirre and place, the Colanbian supplier will have up, to 50 anred Indians. guarding the landing area. 243 After the plane lands, .the Indians load the marijuana bales. (typically 2 'x2', Weighing 244 . . 245 30 pounds), .. and refuel the plane. Tl1e fee for loading arid refueling is cheap; a two-engine plane can land and load for\u00b7$1,200. 246 The Co;Lanbia organizations that supply marijuana to foreign purchasers are probably rrore nunerous than the organizations that ar~:: directly 368 ,'' 'i', involved in smuggling to the U.S. Overhead expenses are relatively minimal when an organization supplies groups ibat carry out the actual smuggling. There is evidence that sare Colanbian organization are in fact involved both in sales to , foreign PUJ:\"Chasers in Colanbia as well as direct smuggling to the U.S. An illustrative case is that of the Pedro Davila organization. As of late 1978, Pedro Davila operated one of the largest marijuana rings in Colarbia. 24 7 His father is the mayor of Santa ~, Colanbia and hi 1 . th f th Gua,, De 248 s unc e l:S e goven1or o e , J Jia , part:Irent. Davila'EI custorrers fran the, U.S, are able to land and lOad at the Sinon Bolivar Airport. 249 Davila hires military and police protection to ensure the safe exchange of marijuana and noney. 250 The police and aney troops will stand by until the plane is airborne, safely on its way to the u.s.251 In addition, it was apparently Davila's organization that sent motherships northward to supply the infamous Black Tuna gang.252 c. Shipping Colombian criminal organizations control the shipping of marijuana to the United States. 253 Although there is evidence that non-col~ian groups also smuggle marijuana to the United States by sea, the ' Colanbians apparently handle, the vast majority of multi,..ton, shi~nts. They purchase expensive oceangoing vessels to transport marijuana to the United States. Enonrous profits pennit the'Colanbian marijuana the luxury of, \"throw away\" oceangoing vessels. 254 'Four out of five loads could, in fact, be interdicted without destroying the profit. 255 A hundred foot vessel. can carry 50 toris of marijuana, while a four hundred ,foot vessel can carry a 100 ton load. 256 Three primary sea routes exist fran Colarbia to the United States; the shortest is 369 ' ,, ,), ~ough the windward passage, between CUba and Haiti, 257 another is through the Yucatan Channel, between Mexico and CUba; 258 when sailing I either of these routes, smugglers will conseiously avoid CUba, ai country kn f . . . d 1 . 259 rug pena t1es. Ano er J;Opu ar route 1s oug the Mona Passage, bordered by the Daninican Republic and Puerto Rico. 260 ' ' Fran these three major routes, the srnuggle+s can go into the Gul! of ,' ' 261 Mexico, the coast of Florida, or north along the East Cost. , ~use of federal enforcarent efforts in the Florida area, 262 marijuana' traffickers have. begun to alter t,heir routes, expanding aWa.y 'fran ' .

West Coast~264 Colombia vessels depart from .the Guajira peninsula with .loads up to 100 tons265 and then wait offshore the United States in il'lternational waters. 266 The rendezvous .J;Oints can vary. :fran the American c~st.267 ;fran Colanbia often fly a false flag, the rrost typical being the flags of Panama, Venezuela, or ColQTlbia. 268 An\"eri.can ~uthorities cannot board foreign ships in international waters unless they can prove a violation of American law. 269 In those situations where a ship is suspected of being involved in illegal activity, tfie country whose flag is being flown,will usually grant the Coast Guard permission to board and investigate the vesse1,270 but cOlombia often ,\u00b7\u00b7 ' ', . ' '' ' ' '\u00b7 denies the Coast Guard pennission to board its vessels. Colarbian srnugglers contract with 1ver ~pec1 1 quant.),t1es o, ~1Juana. \u00b7 ':J:heSe Stateside OrganizationS are primarilY CUban 1 AmeriCan 1 and Co1ambian.273 These groups s.et up off-loading operations, requiring 370 purchasing or renting smaller ships to shuttle the marijuana to the mainland. Shrimp boats and speed-boats are ideal for off-loading , operations, each of which is able to carry 1-2 tons of marijuana per trip.274 The marijuana is usually unloaded at a Florida hare near the coast. Traffickers are. increasingly using the Bahamas and other islartds for transhiprent points to the United States. 275 The Bahamas are a perfect Staging .area for. refueling oceangoing Vess;els aS well aS plime 1 the Bahamian goverilrrent is notoriously lax in .its drug enforcerrent efforts. d. Distribution Although Colanbian groups are involved\u00b7 in marijuana (listribution within the United States, they in no way daninate the market. The volUJre of marijuana needed to supply the u.s market coupled with the. bulkiness of the product makes it impossible for any group or nationality .to control dQernstic distribution. Colc:nbian dattinance in the marijuana trade stops at the u.s. border. There is evidence, however, of sophisticated Colanbian \u00b7 networkS within the United States. These netwOrks operate alongside other cri.roi.nal syndicates as well\u00b7 as independent groups to nove marijuana to the American consUJrer. Co;Lanbian marijuana networks are particularly strong in cities with .. large Colanbian populations, including Miami.,. IDs Angeles, and New York. e. Law Enforcenent Response Operation Grotiper, \u00b7\u00b7a major interdepart:nental law enforc:emmt effort,, illustrates the law enforcment response to Colanbia' s tole in the marijuana trade. 276 Operation Grouper in marijuana traffic~s by art infonnant. 277 \u00b7 The four agents established a marij~ off-loading service in the Bahamas i they were so efficient ,that they had to tum business away. ~ agents. 'i-Kmld il)form the COast Guard, CUstans 1 and the DFA about marijuana vessels lx>u,nd for the United States. Thirty vessesls were seizErl as a result of this information. 278 The,. vessels were seized by various agencies in a variety df ways so as not .to attract suspiciOn. One shiprent was even all~ to land in the u. 5 ~ .and bee loaded, onto a\u00b7\u00b7~.

First, Col.att>icm organizations are. ' ' . . ! ' ' ' ' inwlved J>\u00b7l' .' ) a transship-cent ahd off-loading point. Third, since several CUbans and Arrericans were arrested, Colanbian organizations appar~tly frequently deliver large .shiprents to these groups. Fourth, Colanbians deliver,\u00b7 rrarijuana to Gulf Coast and East Coast states as well as to Florida. . . .\u00b7 Fifth, the ease of the DEA agents establishing a successful off~ loading service suggests that Colanbians rely on other groups to distribute marijuana within the U.S. If the Colanbians had a vertical m::>ndpoly fr001 marijuana plantation to the Arrerican user, the key off-loacling position would have been st;affed by Colarbians. SiXth, c]espite the impressive arrest and seizure statistics,. there is no\u00b7 indication that these organizations have been i.nm:>bilized. ~r individuals will rrerely step into new roles. 9. The CUbans Cuban .involvement in marijuana trafficking pegan in the early 1960s in south Florida. The available evidence indicates .that the Cubans are primarily involved in danes.tic distribution, obtaining supplies fr001 Colanbian sources. South Florida is .still feeling the violent reverberations of the Colanbian rroverrent into dc;nestic cocaine distributions in. which Colanbian groups clashed. with the Cuban criminal \u00b7 elerrents, whO had traditionally controlled drug distribution in the South Florida area.. \u00b7 Henry Messick, investigative reporter and author, reports t:l)at ' 'I ' ' ', ' '.' ' ,' \u00b7, ' I \" ' ' allegedly a peace agreerrent has been signd between CUban and Colanbian \u00b7. ' . ' ' organizations in South Florida. 284 CUbans can still handle cocaine,.\u00b7 but they must purchase supplies f;:001 th~ Colanbians. 285 The Colanbians and . . the Anglos can still wholesale nBrijuana, but bringing it north will be . 286 largely controlled by Cubans. :ii\u00b7 The Sicilia-Falcon Organization, illustrative of CUban involverrent in the traffick, is one of the largest marijuana trafficking organizations ever uncovered. It was headed by Alberto Sicilia-:Falcon, a CUban national. Sicilia was in charge of a worldwide drug cartel responsible for multi-tons of marijuana flowing daily fran Mexico ~to the United States daily fran Mexico in the early 1~70 1 s. 287 The group distributed marijuana throughout the United States fran its base in San Diego, California. 288 By tbe spring of 1973, mar:i,.juana was being delivered by way of oil.t.anker trucks that: .carried three tons per l~d.289 Julio Bell-Guinart of Tijuana, Mexico supplied the Sicilia-Falcon organization. 290 On June 23, 1974, the DEA seized tow tankers in San . . . 1 f l.S ' seizure, the Mexican\u00b7 Federal seized an additional 42 . . . . 292 tons of narijuana in an underground cache. \u00b7 \u00b7 A1.berto Sicilia-Falcon was arrested by Mexicari police in 1975 . 293 By 1977, over 1,600 individuals had been identified as part of or \u00b7 ted' \u00b7th\u00b7 the s\u00b7 \u00b71\u00b7 F. con consp1.racy. 10. La Cosa Nostra La Cosa Nostra is no stranger to the marijuana trade.. In 1938, ' ,, Carlos Marcello, now the reputed New Orleans family boss, was sentenced to 10 nonths in an Atlanta penitentiary when federal ager1ts broke up. . \u00b7, ' ' ' \u00b7., \u00b7, .. ' . '\u00b7' ,\u00b7,'\u00b7 . \"the biggest marijuana ring in New Orleans histocy. I by the 1960s, there was little evidel'lce of La. Cosa Nostra involverrent in rrarijuana trafficking. 296 In 1968, federal agents in fact denied t;.hat LCN had rroved. into the marijuana trade, claiming that .\u00b7the profit wp.s too little and the traffic too loosely structured.297 Mexico, the .majpr 374 ~\u00b7\u00b7 ) source of supply at that ti.Ire, was easily accessilile by any individual or group interested in purchasing marijuana . In addition, the canpeti tion from t.ravellers crossing :the border was too intense to make LCN efforts. worthwhile. In 1969, Tirre speculated that .one unforeseen \u00b7 consequence of a governrrent crackdown on the marijuana trade would be an ICN rronopoly. 298 \"If the in(iependents are driven out, the rrobsters might find it as profitable as heroin.\"299 Today, marijuana trafficking is in fact one of the rrost lucrative smuggling activities.3\u00b00 Since. the profits are so huge and the risks so 1, .LCN ha . ed the . . . de 301 .. ' C 1-1-\u00b7 .o . 302 The shift fran Mexico to Colanbia as ~ major source of marijuana aided I.CN by creating a rrore \"controllable\" flow in~ the United States. , .

At least 17 I.CN families al1.d 117 kna.vn teN. trenbers are presently domiciled in Florida, 304 where revenues fran drug dealing run to six billion dollars annually 305 Since the traffic in the westem part of the Uni~ States is still largely in the hands of indpenderits \u00b7and Mexican groups, it appears I.CN involverrent in. the marijuana trClde is cente,red in Florida, 306 although there is evidence of I.CN activity in .the Northwest marijuana market. As in the cocaine trade, I.CN has penetrated the marijuana market in three different ways. First, I.CN has acted in concert with Latin organizations, which have been actively involved in the marijuana trade since the early 1960s, rrostly in the South Florida. 307 . Second, LCN groups have taken over existing marijuana distribution outfits in the 375 , .. United States.308 1CN groups have also been\u00b7 kiclnappings of individuals associated with la:r:ge-scale narijuana organi~ations that .\u00b7.. 309 cduld afford the ransoms. Independent operators easily f~ll prey to 1CN influence, while the :rrore established CUban and Colanbian organzations are too :pawe:r:ful to daninate. In addition, LCN rel.ies upon the Colanbians for supplies.. Third, I.CN has bought its way. into the narket by purchasing large quantities of marijuana and driving out . . . d in the cocaine .trade. Neve~l~ss, I.CN groups are still just one elenent arrong the organizations involvoed in narijuana , ,\u00b7 ' an advantage over other trq;fficking 9rganizations, hCM~er, since it is the best organized criminal group in the United .\u00b7 . .\u00b7 . 311 States, with 25 families and up to. 50,000 confederates. An . . organization with established distribution netwOrks like I.CN can turn g~at profits in the marijuana trade. Evidence indicates twcr-fold LCN involv:em:mt in the narijuana First, I.CN purchases multi-ton quantities of narijuana fran Col\u00a2:mbian. groups, which smuggle the The groups bring directly fran Colanbia, using ships and planes. Yet I.CN groups have traditionally stuck to the impOrter/:wholesaler roles in drug trafficking,313 as these roles are the :rrost profitable and the least risky. The Lucchese, Colanbo, Bonnanno and Genovese families have all in the_ narijuana trade.314 Cannine Galante, for exarrple, was believed to have pushed the Bonnanno family heavily into drug 376 ' . d ib groups are mvo v various cr:i.mirial enterprises, large sums of :rroney are , available to buy multi-ton quantities of marijuana. Evideri.ce of r.m involvertY:mt in ' ' so-called 11Mount Pocono Incident. 11, On December 14, 1976, a DC-6 airplane landed at Mount Pocono Airport in Pennsylvania carrying eight f ,',,,' . . 316 cu o marl.Juana. , stans agents, agents o ,' e DEA ,an,, lLICLLILJ\\::rs o the Pennsylvania State Police317 arrested 5 indiv;iduals and seized ,'.

The, Mount Pocono seizure illustrates three points about ~ involvEm:!nt in the marijuana trade: First~ LCN groups have estpblished I direct ties with traffickers in Colanbia. Second, I.CN groups have used large 1ong-rc,mge planes. to transpOrt marijuana directly to the East Coast fran Colanbia. A DC-6 plane can haul marijuana directly to or ~ints Third, LCN hav~ and expertise to, distribute lGrrge quantities of ~ijuana, thereby realizing great profits. The Co~anbO family, now headed by John 11Sonny'1 Franzese, began large scale marijuana srruggling fran Latin Anerican directly to New York City in the fall of 1978.322 The ColcrtlbO organi~ation began making, . .

First, in marijuana smuggling directly fran Colamia using oceangoi..Ilg 1essels. These ships can carry loads up to 100 tons, suggesting serious ~ involvarent in marijuana trafficking. Second, LCN groups have shipped narijuana directly to East Coast areas, where distribution netwqrks are strongest and the narket for marijuana is great. When \u00a2e Colanbo family first entered .the :rro~rship :rrethod was errployed; \u00b7the marijuana was shuttled into Florida and then shipped by truck to New York. 328 The sarre :rrothership technique used in Florida operates off the New England coast. 329 Six major marijuana smuggling rings have been identified in the New England area, all with ties to ICN groups. 330 Third, the image of. selling marijuana is not bad for LCN. According to Salerno, \"You're not talking about hooking ghetto kids on heroin. Instead you're providing a camodity \u00a3or college kids and the middle class.\" 11. Smuggling Patterns In 1979, it was estimated that 60 percent of the u.s. marijuana supplies were smuggled in by sea, 35 percent by air, and 5 percent by land, with overland smuggling usually taking place acrosp the Mexican 378 I'\"\" \u00b7 ;\u00b7 I. I . I border. 332 The predaninance of .snuggling by sea is reflected in .. the u.s.

The DFA reported a 700% increase in the nmrber of illicit labs between 1975 and 1979.35 In 1978, there were only 19 states in which np . . \u00b7.: The heav1.est concentrat1.on of clandestl.Ile labs are apparently in los Angeles, Detroit, Washirigton ,.

The operators of the lab~ need no special skills, as the dr:ugs are sinple to produce. 49 In addition, dangerous drugs are often Sl1lllggled into the Uni;ted States. Authorities estimate that 75% of .the drugs SllUlggled in are . . . 50 transported by land, 10% by ~ir, and 15% by boats. Most dangerous drugs care either fran Colurrbia or Mexico, and are chalmelled through Florida or the Southwest. . In 1972, scme officials reported that 80% of the dangerous drugs in the coUntry arrived fran ~ico, 51 while others . estimated that only 33% were of Mexican origin. 52 Appateritly, ~y of these drugs are licitly manufactured .or produced, :i.nto tne u.s.

National attention was not first focused . .. on it with the President.' s. Crilre Ccmnission .in 1967. Indeed., the nation has g6ne through a n\\.1Il'lber of\u00b7\u00b7 cycles . etforts to eliminate, control, or profit frbrC\\ it.1 In the 17th and 18th. centuries., garrbling practices and public seritiirents Ql:x:>ut t,hem were broadly New E,ngland oppb$ed gaming, eschewing it\u00b7 out of distaste for the perceived corrUpt lifestyle of the ,English upper classes arid a res~ct for the harsh rlecessi ties of pioneer society _2 I ,,\u00b7 In 1633, an enact:Irent Thirteen years later, the Cplony pranulgated the ~;irst law in the new country directly ~ttacking garrbling. 4 In the 1670s Ma.ssachu~tts and Conneeticut. passed specific bans. on cards, dice and lotterie's. 5 Contrary to popular.\u00b7 belief, these laws were not wholly rooted in. religious doctrine.\u00b7 Earthly r1eeessities decided public ' , , \u00b7., :, , , I policy; those distracted .work in the sl.li'\u00a3IDer. could not hope: to suzyi ve in .the winter~ 6 Garrbl.thg restrictions, th~refore, reflec~ a . vieW not just of religion, but of life, particularly the preferred . relationship between Iifuor \u00b7anCfil.tS f~ts. Ohly after abihlical :Justification for . anti-galtbling legislation a England. \u00b7 law was, haw~er, tranforrrfK]. fran the hand of the IDrd punishing sin to \u00b7 an agent of the state maintaining public order. 8 Accordingly, while 396 blasphemy laws passed from public view, restrictions on ganbling remained, as they were root~d . in a broader .view of proper public policy. New .Amsterdam established an early reputation for social liberali&m. 9 When the Dutch surrendered the colony in 1664, the area tha.t is now New York had already.bec~ a pocket of vice on the Eastern seaboard, offering a variety of anrusements, including bull-baiting, cock 1 ,' ' 10, ' fighting, and horse racing. Life was not viewed in stem and earnest tenns. \u00b7 In the Southern colonies, where many of the ... settlers rapidly . acquired wealth, as irr .. wagering acceptabl,e.11 Following the lead of England, aristocratic TidewaterVirg:inia also regulated gambling to proroote the public order, but IIDre importantly, to preserve the stability and economic viability of a land-based ec~omic system. 12 . Securities and conveyances given to satisfy of gambling debts were voiOed, and provisions were enacted to recover losses and prohibit fraudulent play.13 2. The 19th Ce1ltury By the beginning of the 19th century, geographical distinctions were becaning obscured. The Arrerican population itself was constantly on the iOOve., ever westward, and new .waves of imni.gration brought new practices and attitudes to the new cotmtry .' In the East, an an:ti,-lottery. '\\' ' ,'' sent:immt arose in the. tnid-1800s, \u00b7 and a coalition of revivalists and Jacksonian DeiWcrats fought the state-chartered lotteries in an effort to stop the exploitation of the poor, end corrupti9t1 and privilege, and. uphold the symbolic relationship between effort and profit in the yot.mg Republic. 14 In the weste;m ~ng and cattle towns, gamb~ing wa:s a 397 widely-practiced form were of :hels, and bars, rc~presenting a male-dominated lifestyle that lusted until the area developed farming comnunities.15 But .it was in the towns alo1~ the Mississippi that the illegal \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7-1' . 1 ] built inNew Orleans by J\"olm Davis.. While it catered only to the wealthy, lower class houses soon developed that were aptly described as stinkholes of creation.1117 Chicago, too, became a gElmblirig. center, having by the late 1840s ntJre first class gambling houses and big-time ambl h. \u00b7 h c\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 s\u00b7 18 g ers eLt ~r . ll1CJ.nnatl. or t. l.S . In the East, New York remai(led what it had always beeri. By 1850, it was estimated that there were approximately 6,000 gambling houses in the city,19 a figure hard to accept since that would have been one for every 85 residents, 20 Everywhere, gambling establishments were usually maintained by extensive systems of police and. political corruption. 21 Powerful machine politicians exploited the sent:i.nents of the various segroonts of the population. Generally, rural areas, reflecting earlier views, were intolerant of gambling, while urban areas, characteri~ed by a new mix\u00b7of peoples and religion, were tolerant. 22 The level of public tolerapce \u00b7 toward all fonns of gambling, however, peaked in the 19th century. Thereafter, anti-ganbling and good government groups came te>gether, and .:reforms were widely adopted. Race tracks, for example, were. closed down. Indeed, by 1915, only seven states contint1ed to allow. the running of races.23 3.

Few public iJ.upr:essions at:\"e further from. the hard facts. llaller rightly obs\u00b7erves: The years from the 1880s. to about 1905 \u00b7IllCiY, indeed, have been the period when activities t;hat are often called \"organized cr:i.ne\" had their greatest impacit\u00b7upon American society. During this >]?eriod ganblers., and vice entrepre\u00ad neur~:> generally, exercis~d an influence on locaL politics and law enforcement that has se1d.Olll been eqtlB.lled since that tine~ In IImlY neighborhoods, it was not so nuch that gambling syndicates influenced local politiqal organi;zation; rather, gambling syndicates were the. local political organ:i;zatic;ms, .and had, in addition,. a broc;td :i.rrq?act\u00b7upon .. other aspects of \u00b7Uroan life. Ih the cities of the East ;md Midwest, the\u00b7 Irish d()m:i.nated gambling enterprises; theywere also disptqportionately and police. To. sorm. extent. then, polhic~ . l gambling were tied together by.'cOOtn:>n ethnic bonds, as well as conm:m organi.Ze1tional structur~s. Gambl:i,~ \u00b7 entrepreneurs were crucial in the prOIWtion .\u00b7 and financing .of the professional sports that arose du}.\"ing that pe,:riod, i{l~luding horse racing, boxing and baseball. .. there was,. furthernnre, a close interrelatianship betWeen th~ extensive and.:infonna:llyapproved red-light districts and the corrnercieil nightlife entertainment iof the cities. Long before national. prc;>hibition and the development . of bootlegging then, there had. already been close ties.\u00b7 annng gambling syndicates, vice activities, po!!tics., sports and enter.:. tainment. (emphasis in orignal) . \u00b7 Nevertheless, Prohibition was a period of economic growth and .\u00b7 diversification for: organized crilre, and it acted as a powerful catalyst for syndicated and streamlined gambling operations. The men whb had cooperated With each other\u00b7 and amassed fortunes while the country :was \"dry\" needed, after the Noble Experiment, a new field of enterprise. Those who ran gambl:i,.ng operations With considerable expertise took advantage of \u00b7the capit.;3l and. influence of ex':'bootleggers. 26 . All irrmig7\"ant Europeans hungered for financial success. Italians were especially ripe for syndication nost having emigtated during the 1880s. In 1920, they had been in tlk lfnited States for a generation without realizing the \"American Dream\"\u00b7 of nDney .and Power through le~itimate channels, In the 1920s, Italians had the poo]:\"est health of 199 \u00b7~\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. any foreign group ir.1 New York. Infant nnrtality was double that of the rest of the city'~.; population. The illiteracy rate was 60%--the highest of any foreign group. Recent :inmigrants tended already to be clannish and wary of outsiders.27 Accordingly, a life free of crime held little promise of material success. ~rofits tnade during Prohibition whet long-unsatinted appetites for property and aroused a curious sort of ethnic pride. 111e .men were predisposed t() organize. Prohibition provided an excuse, and gambling sustaineathe organization after Prohibition. In.all citie~ where bootleggers policy the. IOOchanism was estabtished through a partner,.. ship. The original partners or th~ir associates continued as managers or partners. The boot\u00ad leggers. <often provided a variety of services. in return fo+ a share of the profits. These .services included political protection, _\u00b7ir..-.:-. . l backing, regulatioh of compet:Ltio~8 and legal representation in. case of arrest. Various forma of illicit gambling grew in popularity during the Depression and World War Two. During the Depression, massive numbers of unemployed hoped to escape their economic rut by hitting it bigwith the \"numbers,\" as do many players today. The numbers gane itself appeared. during the Depression, when it largely replaced an older fonn of lottery called \"policy.\"29 Policy itself had originated as sideline bets taken 30 by 18th ceqtury London lottery houses. By the t:i.ne of the Civil War, most state lotteries in .this country, which were similar to \"policy,\" ' ' ' . ' ' ' ' ' In had .been outlawed, and policy began to develop on its own. addition, it was one of the first forms of gambling to become syndicated. Apparently introduced to New Y()rk City by West Indian Blacks, numbers replaced policy in the 1920s in the eastern part of the 400 32 country. Numbers, too, was, until. after World War II, largely under the cuntrol. of Black operators. 33 When the cenb,:l.ry opened, horse racing and had reached its peak of popularity. 3l1 Boolanakers operated openly at the tracks. In a fifteen year period' however' some 95 tracks on the national circuit had to \u00b7 close, chiefly because of anti-gambling crusades. 35 When racing made its comeback, chiefly during the Depression, it took the form of a combination of a track and state sanctioned system of parimutuel betting. The daniriant role of the bookmaker at the. track was ended. Off track betting, on the other hand, continued to flourish at . bars, barbershops, cigar stores and similar places. 36 The rapid spread of the telephOne in the 1920s made posible conplex systems of betting and rebetting called the \"lay off,\" which permitted a bookmaker to off-set the bets he accepted with those bet elsewhere and lessen his risks of too heavy a loss . Along with Western Union facilities , the telephone made possible the coom.mication of up-to~the minute race :infonna.tion. The advent of the so-called race wire services , however, also made the 1cdal bookmaker dependent. on a product that lent itself to control by organized crime, and the Cap~ organization in Chicago gained a domil.1.ant role in .the industry. Following World War II, revelations by the Kefauver corrmittee investigation in 1950 and the McClellan comnittee investigations in 1963-64 brought about: et~IU&.LLL-.Jtrative. and legal refonns that substantially curtailed various forms of illegalgambling throughout the United States. 37 A series of Federal laws, for example, proved effective in largely eliminating illegal slot machines and closing down the few op<:!n cities--Newport, Kentucky--Hot Springs, Arkansas-- 401 that had survived the state level reform that ccum on th(:! heels of the Kefauver conntittee ?~\u00b7'Jhr.> .: .. 1950. Walk-in bookie joints, too, that hau existed throughout the United States, disappeared. Accordingly, the principal forms of illegal gambling. today a:re bookmaking, both off-track horse betting and sport$ wagering, numbers and to a lesser extent illegal casino~::: gambling machines. (t'!J ' .~'5\u00b7 ct has been aroong law enforcen~nt officials since the Kefauver comnittee .investigation in 1950 that.illicit ganlbling is the chief of revenue :for orgc:Jriized crilre. In 1974~ for eXaiiiple the U.S. Department of Justice prefaced a policy stateJ:'!'eilt by obserVing: It is the unaninnus conclusion of the . President:, the Congress, and law enforceJ:'I'ent officials that illegal organized gambling is the largest single sourceof revenue for organized cr~~ .. it provides the. initial investment fer narcotics trafficking, hijacking oper~tions., pro~\u00a7itution rings, and loansharking schemes. However true. that conclusion may have been in 1950--and it appears it was--little evidence supports it today, for substantial changes have . ' occurred in the gambling field in recent \u00b7years as a. resuH: of law enforcement efforts as well as general social and political developments. Nevertheless, impressive. figures are often bandied about when it comes time to estimate the volume of illegal gambling in the Uhited States today. Robert F.\u00b7 Ketmedy, as Attorney . General in 196.3 , testified that illegal gambling had an annual net volume of seven billion dollars. 39 Similarly, the Crime Conmission.called into operation by President Johnson in 1967 estihai.. .... ~ ... 3 net. of illicit gambling. at six to seven billion dollars each year on a gross of upwards of 20 billion dollars. 40 402 lt ... Such estimates, however, nlllst be placed in context. As Ralph Salerno obs.erved: If the [estimated] profits from gambling had been invested since the Kefauver investigation [1951-1968], so as to earn only 5%. m1 the principal the sun would today be sufficient to purchase every single share of common stock in the ten \u00a2frgest coporate complexes in the UnitedStates. Contraste~ in <:Ulother ,fashion, in 1967 the United States spent about thirty billion dollars on the. Vietnam War, and the total budget for foreign aid was about two billion dollars.42 In short, these . . estimates of the gross of illegal gambling seem incredible. Nevertheless, the Justice Departm:mt in 1974 told the Nativ~.::tl Ganhling Connri.ssion that it estimated the gross voltll'l'E at between 29 and 39 billion dollars each year. 43 In 1976, the University of Michigan, however, perfonned a tnassive analytical study of gambling in the United States in 1976 .for the Commission, and it estimated Americans wagered only five billion dollars illegally each year and that illegal operators realized only about one billion dollars as profit. Allowing for standard error, the. researcher concluded that a gross volume greater than eight billion was \u00b7unlikely, and a ~oss greater than ten billion was statistically impossible.44 That .the law enforcement corrmm:Lty generally shares the traditional view was demmstrated, however, by a 1976 survey of police depart:trents throughout the country, which found that 73% of policemen agree that \"profits from gambling ... are the main . source of income for organized crilre. ''4 5 2. Relationship to Organized Crime The popular myth of nonopoly ownership of illegal gambling operations by Hafi.a-type organized critre figures is not supported by hard evidence. In fact, the extent of syndication of various \u00b7 fonns of 403 , gambling varies dramatically from fm:m to fonn and place to place. As the Canbling Comnission observed, there is, in short, \"no unifonnity of traditional organized cri.Il'e control over illegal gambling throughout the country.\"46 In some cities, such control exists, but it does not exist in others. \"Even where organized crime is a factor, the extent of its . l~ 7 involvement varH~s.\" As of 1974, the Justice Depart:Inent estimated regional control gambling by La Cosa Nostra as follows: Far West, 29%; Mid-west, 41.4%; Northeast, 53.2%; Southeast, 35.7%; and Southwest, 2%.48 Accordingly, operations not associated with organized crime often are \"purely local and may have no ties to any other criminal activity. \"49 Indeed, the popular literature, too, is beginning to reflect the better opinion that a swJstantial, even major, share of gambling is controlled by persons only slight!~\u00b7, if ~r. all, connected to organized crime.50 In the past fifteen years, for example, a number of groups, composed of Blacks and Hispanics, have \"wrested control fran the Mafia.\"51 On the other hand, it has never been necessary for organized crime to GWrl the various gani>ling operations in order to take monopoly profits out of them. As long as monopoly control can be maintained over an essential service, that service can be the instrument through which organized critre extracts its monopoly share. Increasingly, it is being recognized that that service is loansharking. As the Penns1lvania Crime Camlission obse'I\"J\"!'E!d in 1980, \"Gamblers are an easy market for the illegal rroney lender.' 52 In fact, it may well be that loansharking is the chief way in which organized cr:i.n-e is a partner in the profits but not the losses of many gambling operations. 53 404 ' 3-. Relationships to Corruption Writing in 1962, the Penrument Subcannitee on Investigations reported: While local law\u00b7enforcement officials and prosecutors are honest and dedicated in their efforts to stamp out organized cr'ime, too often local ~r:iminal statutes are not vigorously enforced or prosecu~ed be.cause a dishonest policemen or prosecutor. is mti~~ted solely by financial or political gain. Senator Henry Jackson, a member of the Cbumittee, put it rrnre dramatically: \"You and I know what the problem is. They buy off the judge, they buy off the prosecutor, tj}ey buy off the sh~riff, and they buy off the law \u00b7enforcement officers .. \"55 llnlawful gambling, in short, cruu1ot \"operate on a large scale in a community without the .cooperation 56 of sane segment of the governmental structure.\" The type of gambling determines the level of necessary corruption. Numbers operations, which are visible and involve many people, have a difficult tune surviving in the face of determined police efforts. Accordingly, nunbers account for a high level of local corruption. \"If you Wtite $1,000 worth of numbers per day,\" one elderly writer cornplained, \"then the first 12 days of the rrnnth you work for the cops.\"57 Other forrns of gambling, which are less visible and have fewer players ru1d employees occasion less corruption. C. Types of Gambling and Participation The five ~OL -}T~~ ~ illicit gambling in the United States to~y . are bookmaking, numbers g~s, lotteries, casino operations, and ' . 58 gamblwg mgchmes. 1. \u00b7 Bookmaking Bookmaking is by far the largest money maker of all forms of illegal gambling. Recent estimates by researchers working fot the i 405 1,, 'c .. , Gambling Comnisssion suggest that the take exceeds $3.7 billion per year.59 More than ~'>/.3 bi'llion is bet on sports events, while ttK! rer:;:... t 1. bookmaker lk:mdles this voltm-e like a broker, accepting bets from various individuals; he seeks to take in more from his losing bettors than the must\u00b7 pay out to his .. wirming bettor'~::. Any balam.:e in.hip favor is his brokerage fee. 61 The scale of such bookmaking operations ranges from individuals who take bets in pool rooms to huge organizations headquartered in elaborate offices. 62 The roore successful bookmakers use middlemen to gather and record client' s bets and to funnel them to the bookmaker hilpself. The middlemen, paid on a percentage basis, are. nb.t concerned with balancing the bets in the bookmaker's favor. The diverging objectives of the bookmaker and his tniddlen~n may easily lead to friction.63 Because bookmakers. cannot count on their middlemen to help balance the bets in their favor, they often resort to the process known as \"laying off\" bets on other bookmakers. Smaller bookmakers avoid the risk of having roore ''winners\" than \"losers\" by transferring s~bets to large bookmakers, who use the &waller bookmaker's bets as part of thei~ own balancing 64 process. In addition to soliciting, recording, and balancing bets, the\u00b7 bookmaker needs fast communications to operate his business. First, many bets are placed by telephone.65 Second, bookmakers must have iumedhtt:e access to changing odds and handicaps for sporting events and races.66 Third, they must quickly learn he. winners of those events, so that they can make fast collection and payoffs. Finally, bookmakers .must find out the po:...t ...:.:: . of races, so that they will not get \"past posted,\" that is defrauded by bets placed after the winner of race is known.67 406 Although not a .necessnry element of bookffiaking, one of it.l:: fJC.~condary ei:fects also deservds n-ention. Betting on sporting events may . 68 lead to \"fixed\" races and gcures. Sports betting is prirrarily a hcibit of the affluent.09 Withhuge stakes riding on sone contests, it becorres v.;orthwhile for a professional gambler to try to influence the outcorre of events by bribing or interfering \\4th the participants or officials. 1\\ccord.ingly, an apparently \"victimless\" pastt.llre may lead to collateral \u00b7 social problems. 2 N\\.ll'l1bers After bookmaking, the numbers gcure is the second largest IIDney-1llclker in illegal gambling. Numbers, rLU1 mainly in \u00b7 Easter1.1 c::..11.c:! Midwcs\u00b7ten1 citieB, is a form of lottery that; bec;ause of its annual billion dollar take and ~rethod of operation, merits special att.ention. 70 'l\"'hough variations of the garre exist, the typical operat.ion follows thus scenario: First, ubl. 71 t p 1c, accep .s the collector, \u00b7who maintains\u00b7 close ties with the a wager72 from the bettor. Unlike the nonnal lottery bettor, however, the numbers player chooses his own three-digit number between 000 and 999, writes it. on a slip, and gives it to the collector. In large operations, a \"pick-up man\" takes the slips and noney from the collector to an area \"contr9ller\" responsible for several collectors . The controller nay make preliminary tabulations before he forwards the day's receipts to the \"bank,\" the central office of the mnnhers operation. 73 The winning number, drawn daily, may. be used on. a va:dety of numerical occurences, ranging from stock market sales to parli1utuel 74 totals. \u00b7 rl'he odds against\u00b7 winning on a three..,.digit numbers game are 1,000 to one. The average payoff, hOwever, is only 55-l. 75 If there are execessive bets on certain numbers, banks, like bookmakers, . will lay-off bets on other impo~.\u00b7tant charac;:t.eristic of m.umers garres is the large vol.lu1e of records which must be kept. 'l'o maintain a srrooth flow of business, nUITibers ope.rators .must record all bets, collections due, and winnings T/ payable. rl'hese extensive records . may be almost as useful to law enforcem:nt officials as they are to the gamblers themselves. 3. Tot:teries lottery schemes are similar to numbers operations, but handle only about $200 million a year and net. $50 million. 7B Most of the illegal wagers on lotteries are made on the Irish SWeepstakes and other foreign scherres. 79 In rrost lotteries, the operator or his agent sells the bettor a printed ticket, usually displaying a number, which entitles the\u00b7. bettor to win a prize if by chance the m;unber is drawn.80 Many variations on this theme. also constitute a lottery, bu~ three essential . 'd . han d c ce, an a pr1.ze. Bingo, for example 1 is a form of lottery. The play~r gives consideJ::ation for his card and wins by chance if the appropriate number or letter/number combination is drawn.82 ~he use of punchboards arid punchcards also constitutes lottery scherres. The operator sells. the bettor. a chance to pick a hole in a board containing a slip of paper or \u00b7 to punch out a cardboard disc \u00b7\u00b7in a card~ If the player is lucky erough to pick the correct hole or disc he wins a prize.83 Hence, these garres . . also include the elements of a lottery, althOugh they are n\u00aet. as prevalent as the I:r:ish Sweepstakes and other wj del y played 1 otteri es:. 4. Casinos Illegal casino .operations hqndle about $110 million annually. 84 Beyond estimates of the handle and take, little can be calculated about the extent of the illegal casino\u00b7 industry. Casinos range in size fran dingy backrooms to plush chlbs, although since .the late 1950s the plush 408 J clul.> has nearly vanished.; they often operate in conjtmction with fcxxl, liquor, and cnl:ertuinncnt cntmpril:;eB.85 Legal casinos derive~ half of their revenues from craps and dice ganes, another quarter from blackjack, and the last c:ruarter from roulette, slot machines, baccarat, and side games such as poker.86 Illegal casinos, on the other hand, , -f 1 \u00b7-. . d bl of\u00b7 e.r on y tlcxrting crap an aC(Jac ganes. Casinos frequently offer gambling devices (e.g. slot machines) us well. 5. Gambling Machines Gambling machines. today came in a myriad of for.rns, but the classic (\"one arm bandit\") slot machine is still the mainstay of the business. Gambling machines, other.\u00b7 than those used in casino operations, have been esUJnated to provide an illegal ne\u00b7t profit of about $70 million from a handle of about $400 million per year.88 Though such devices. are illegal in nost parts of the country, they apparently are tolerated in a few localities. The traditional slot machine, paying off on a certain percentage of occasions, often retains as much as 50 percent of its handle. 89 To evade the prohibitions of certain detailed laws, gamblers have developed many variations of the \"one-a.nred bandit.\" For example, sorre machines have human operators who the players pay to throw the switch; the nachine it-Self does not operate by coin. 90 Gamblers have also developed pinball machines with \"free gaire\" counters and reset buttonS\" so that 91 players can redeem froo gawes.for .cash.\u00b7 In addjtjon, to avojd prohibitions against gamblers . . ueVJ.ces WIt no noving parts~ 6. Participation Ultimately, gambling operations succeed only.because so many 409 Alnericans patronize them. widowexl, those that did high .. school, and rrembers of Bible-oriented f~ntalist sects does gambling participation fall below 50% ru1d 93 there is substantial overl~p among these groups. Among thos~ who gamble, specific factorscorrelate with a high level of gambling. Current and childhood exposure to gambling and the availability. of legal or illegal facilities are the factors thGlt consistently distinguish gamblers and non-gamblers.94 Catholic and Jews gamble nnre than n~mbers of other religious groups. 96 Four-fifths of Northeasterners report same gambling act.iyity, .'while only two-fifths of Southerners do.97 There .also seans to be a positive relationship between past and present geographic nobility~98 In addition, those with past or present military affiliation.s tend to gamble m::>re. Those predisposed to gamble carpulsively also tend to marry more often, spend m::>re noney on recreation and vacations, venture a greater proportion of total family inc(.)Jl'C on gambling, and sustain losses eight to fifteen t:i.rres as great aproportion of their income c=ts rrembers of the general population .99 On personality tests gamblers display a greater propensity to t~ risks and \". .appear to desire nore stimulation\u00b7 in their lives in te:rms of leisure-time activities than do non-gamblers.\"100 Less than 50% of those.with no religious. preference gamble.:.-a lower percentagen them in any religious. \u00b7 . Barring personal and deroographic variations or differences in the amount of. activity, m::>st Airericans patronize sane type of gambling operation. Researcilt .:e -F, .._.he Gambling Corrmission projected that in 1974: < ; ~' r J 61% of ndult. Ame:r.icans place soo-e kind of bet for rroney. Of these less than 13!b confined their gambling exclusively to bct.s with friends. 'l'hc r.cst., sare 69 million 1\\rrt?ricans, ventured average of JB7 billion on COllllErical gambling. which includQd 8 legally available gam2s (horse racing, casinos, bingo, state lotteries, c.bg\u00b7 races, :jai and only illegaliy (numbro7., spor\u00b7ts. cards, and Letting un horses or sports with a bookie) \u00b7 Significantly, however, only 11% <;>f adults in the Unit.ed Stat;es . 103 participated in a fornt of an illegal game. The two principal illegal games, m:nnbers and sports betting, have a clearly distinguishable clientele. The typical numbers player lives in tho Northeast, where 8% of the g.dult population play the mmb9rs, as compared with 3%. of the adult. population els~here. He is likely to be non-white; eith\u00a3~r The am:>unt a munbers player. bets \u00b7tends to increase proportional to his incorre, until the income of $15,000, at which point it ievels off. or decreases. Virtually all mmlbers plu.yers live within ?5 miles of the nation's 25 largest cities.104 'l1he typical custorrer of illegal bookies, who handle primarily sports bets, lives in a Northeastern or North central state, holds a college degree or has sane college education, earns more than $10,000 per year, and is a white male between the ages of 18 and 44 }05 Similarly 1 sports cards afford the economically less-advantanged a chance to speculate on sports events. Many people gamble, but a slllCill number of bettors annually wager a large proportion of the dollu.r volurre bet.. Only 14% of bettors surveyed by the researchers for the Gambling Corrrnission in 1976 wagered more than $200; one-half of bettors wage,red. less than wagers I?Cr bettor, fran $448 per person at casinos 411 and $590 per person on legal and illegal horses \u00b7to $623 per bettor with illegal sport~:; books. In contrast, prtrt.icipants in less active garres, including lotteries, bingo, and numbers, venture considerably smaller anounts, $25, ~?74 and $123 respectively. 107) Usually, gamblers frequent both legal and. illegal operations; lX'Ople Who particip:rte in COllltercic~lly available legal ganes are also more likely to ganblc illegally, and illegal garrblers are, in fact, the heaviest bot\u00b7tors on legal garres and with friends. AlmJst no one usese illegal channels exclusively.108 The determinative factor in whether a gambler will play an illegal game apparently is its structure and psychological characteristics, for games \"with s~lar structures and psychological charac-teristics appear . complerr:entary \"109 Examples include state sanctioned lotteries and numbers, betting at a racetrack or legal off-t.rack betting parlor, illegal betting with a bookie. and patronage of both legal and ~llegal casinos. Each gambler rationalizes his gambling differently; he may consider gmnbling harmless and recreational; he may fli1d the excitement satisfies psychological needs; or he may feel a \"win\" constitutes his only chance of brightening a bleak financial horizon. Light bettors and sorce sport bettors often fall into the first category. Individuals with high. needs for risk and stimulation fall into the second. These bettors cormonly patronize games with a high degree of social interaction and excitement; they generally prefer games of skiJJ _to_garnes of chance7 and_their __________ _ psychological needs seemingly parallel the needs of heavy investors in the stock or conm:xlities markets. They also, apparently, resort to COJ:IIrercial games because legitimate investrrents are economically prohibitive or inaccessible. Finally, some gamblers evidently see a win as their only vehicle out of a depressed and desperate financial rut. 412 j: .... ,.\u00b7 ,Jarres F. Guyoy, professor of political science at:.

Case Studies A better insight .\u00b7into gambling. in the Uni too States today can be gathered from the pages of :newspapers. and other sources in several areas of the. country than. from reviewing nore scientific studies of gambling. What follows is.a brief sampl~ of several newspaper articles in one city and \u00b7two 'sta-tes in the Northeast--New York, Connecticut and }?ennsylvania,one state in the Midwest--MiChigan--one state irt the Southwest-- Oklahoma--and and three special cases,;..-Florida, New Jersey and\u00b7 Nevada. l. Ne\\v York Cit.y ( The City of New York supports varying degrees of rtoErt. types of . . . legal Tl1e state 197.1, and it now licenses off-track ~tt.ing parlors, which resemble the traditiona.l \u00b7 walk-in boolmaking operations. The rrost extensive operations are in New York City. In 1971, state officials pr~icted that II in five years the [arB] corporation WQtl.d nrr\u00b7Ti_dc at least. $100 million per ye;;~r in revenues .. ~and forecast that it would throttle illegal bookmc1kers .. \"111 Unfortunately:, the predictions have not come true.

Numbers remain popular in New York City's slum areas, particularly ant>ng Blacks and Puert.o Ricans. Salerno reporte:.\"<i in 1969 that the \"highest pe;r capita incidence of numbers gall'iQling in New York [was] founo in Harle.m and the Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, both ghetto slums . \"113 While in 1970 Donald Jansen of the New York .Tines hypothesized that. today most bookies and numbers operat.ors small-time. b .,,114 Ul:ll.nessnen earlier reports indicated that major organized cri.ne figures were, in fact, implicated in gambling operations. For example, in 1975 the Ne~v-. York Ti.nes reported that: James Napoli Sr. , long identif-ed as a leading underworld figure, and eight confederates were convicted yesterday of operating a $35 million a y~a:t policy and horse race gambling ope7ation-- . 115 reportedly the largest m the nation . \u00b7 .\u00b7\u00b7 In l'Jay of 1975, the New York Tines also reported that \"18 persons were arrested in what police said was a $50 million a year gambling operation controlled by the Vito Genovese family.\"116 Such incidents may be isolated, or nm against current \u00b7trends in illegal operations, but they indicate that the present role of known organized criminals cannot be wholly dismissed.

In the last \u00b7two or thiee years legislators in New York have considered legalizing casino gamf.)ling in the state--employing the \"if you can't beat them join them\" :l-ogic comron in such deba-tes. Opposition to legalization rests on fears about.the social and economic cos\u00b7ts to local.i tics, concern about. orgnnized cr:i.Ire, and doubts concerning how much revenue gambling would produce for the state. 'ro date, the opposition hus prevailed. i ~\u00b7~d\"' 2 Connect.:i:efts Connecticut' s frontons, OT.B parlors with live telecasts of racing from New York, and lott.I=L..L<o!-.

The Mo.tning Call of Decemer 5, 1980 \u00b7.stated: 'Ihrough lax enforcenerit and unclear guidelines the State Depp.rt..Irent of .Revenue, which runs tlw lqttery, has become a powerful,. if. unwi ttihg, partner in the scores of bookmakers who rake in an estimated $500 million ih untaxed income through their illegal 1Jt~sing operations in Pennsylvania each year.

Higher payoffs to the. gambler on an illegal game are pOE?sible because the illegal. operator has comparatively low administ:.rative costs und pays no taxes. Illegal g~s are also more att.ractive to the winner because he can easily not declare his winnings as taxable incare. 4.

In 1975, the Oklahoma City Tires ran an extensive expose of gambling in Oklahana City.129 Oklahoma City was, it'reported, a prime candidat.e for syndicate infiltration of existing srrct-11-tine gambling operations. \"!<lobsters begin eyeing such fresh turf when they receive increasing pressure from law enforcement authorities, such as the special Justice pepartrrent Strike.

Attitudes and \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Practices Apparently, the police and the public \u00b7share an ambivalent attitude toward gainbling. Police enforcement efforts tend to follow ci.t.izen canplaints, and both citizens and police senerally consider gambling a public nuisance, net necP\"' .... ~:dly a problem in itsel\u00a3.184; Joseph Veydova, of the New York Police Department, surrmec1 it up: ty. If \u00b7police c~oncentrat.e on gambling at all, usually they focus on visible, social, street, and neighborhood games. Even if police arrest a substantial number of gc::unblers, the arrests seldom make m::>re than good statistics, for too often police value quantity over quality Police rc~::ist gambling assignnents. More serious crines absorb their attentions, convictions and high sentences seldom follow indic~nt, and ];X)lice recocJnize their own vulnerability to corruption.186 Generally, no one is assigned tQ gambling full-tiire. If an officer works for a tiire only in gambling, he is usually switched to other divisions to avoid corruption. This policy li.Illits expertise. No officer considers gambling his specialty. Lesp than 1 percent of LlJI:;, manpower in police departments (and a comparable percentage of prosecutorial and court. tirce) is now allocated to enforce anti-gambling 1 187 W'th th ' .. ib'l't' 1 f f' d aws. ~ o er press~g respons ~ ~ ~es, aw en orcement ~ s gambling violations easy to overlook. Law enforcement officials do, however, recognize the role of organized crilue in gambling.. If gambling laws are enforced, officers and chiefs of police rate \"fighting organized criire\" as the nost . . ' rtant . f f. ' th 188 N th 1 . ed ' JJrp::> reason or. en orc~g \u00b7 em. ever e ess, organ~z .. c;rme members and leaders at .the top of hierarchy are out of the reach of the cop on his beat and inaccessible through a nabbed. numbers player or small-tine ope:rator. Realizing the objective of \"fighting oLgauized criire\" is, therefore, unlikely to happen with current priorities cmd practices. The public also places low priority on illegal gambling, as ed t the thr. t . . qaitUJ ~ng operations that constitute a public nuisance to be eliminated and expect 427 t {X) lice to re~pond to complaints, but remain largely unconcerned about backstage involven-en-t of organized crime. Often, they do not .associate the! neighborhood ntuubers dealer or a friendly bookie with organized crime at all. Journalistic exposes. or a major raid may ttigger public vigilance, but generally low-profit gambling operations remain \"out-of-mind\" as well as \"out-of.:.s~ght.\" The public may lose respect for law enforcerent as unenforced laws remain on the books. In 1967, following the Newark, New Jersey riot, fonrer Governor Hughes appo.:i;nted ari. investigative camri.ttee to look .:j.nto the riot 1 s causes. The dcmnittee repPrted that a major contributing factor was the Black Conmunity 1 s loss of confidence in the 'police, based largely on {X)lice corruption .and lenience in enfo;cing gambling iaws.190 Another survey, and the attitudes it revealed, illustrates two possible constitutional objections to laws against public social gambling, which are only sporadically enforced .. First, to the. extent which the crite:t;\"ia for. making arrests for public gambling include .an actual or potential disturbance there is necessarily considerable discretion involved in enforcerent. Second blacks apparently gamble mbre often in public places. Because laws against s6cial gambling are more easily enforced in public than in private the . enforcement .of laws against social gambling. ~ ~. <;U'e disrg-fminatorY in effect though not in mtent. \u00b7 \u00b7 The Commission on the Review of the National Poliey Toward Gambling observed that: \u00b7\u00b7 Although blacks account for only about 11% of the total population of the United States they accounted for 72.8% of the gambling arrests in 1974 Visibility rather than race is the basis for these an\u00b7ests . Black \u00b7participation in the public social gambling (i.e. card garres or dice garres) and numbers writing is high r~ared to the participation of whites. \u00b7 \u00b7 428 One could ar9.ue that inqonsist.ent enforcem?nt of public social grunbling laws violates due prcx:ess and civil rights~ This dilemna.led the Gcmbling Commission to recommend that the laws against private social gambling be rerroved from the books cmd that law enforcen-erit agencies focus on the bankjng for and connections of illegal o:perations rather tl1an hassling highly visible garrblers and operators.193 .Such a policy would. redirect attention to the root of the gambling problem, avoid discriminatory . . . . practices, and help to. restore confidence in law enforcement .. \u00b7 Laws. pertajning \u00b7to gambling appear to be generally .. gambling results fran inadequate\u00b7o~ and investigation efforts. AJ.m:>st all state laws prohiPit gambling in public, and the majo~ity prohibit gambling in private, both cc:amercial and social. Most states have syndicated gambling statutes. The general intent of the laws\u00b7 is to differentiate betv.;reen cas\\lal social gambling anong individuals and \u00b7syndicated\u00b7. gambling operations 9Dd to provide severe J?\u20acnalties. for persons involved in the .. latter. In .addition, states that operate sone form of gambling games may have laws designed. to protect the credibility of the. industry. State governments regulate the owner~hip, employment and patronage, of the casino industry. Similar legislation applies to lotteries, jai alai, racetracks, and off-track betting. Yet, such preventive 'legislation', is o:nly as good as the quality of its enfmcenent, which, at least in Nevada, has not been the best.195 hr. fFd 11 .. \u00b7t amb. 1' . t195 era aws aga~ns g ~ng ex~s governrrent prohibits interstate transportation of gambling <equ~prrent and parapherna],ia, and illegal use of commmication facilities.

In addition, if exp:mditur.es obviously exceed gross income declared, it. may constitute grounds for furt!-~Pr inves\u00b7tit;:)ation and may substantiate. 9harges of tax evasion~ Third, the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 mru<e~ illegal gamDling a substantive offense, so long as the operation ~s of $Ufficient size, takes in a certain volume of wagers, operates for a long period, or operates in violation of state law. The Act gives the Federal goverl1llEnt jurisdiction over garrblirig operations which involve tive or ntore\u00b7 persons in the conduct, financing, directing, managing or ownership of a gambling business doing a gross volume of $2,000.00 per day or which operates continually over a 30 day per,iod and which is in violatt~f} of the; law in the state where it occurs. \u00b7 \u00b7 Previous to the Act, Federal authorities relied on tax laws and laws against interstate conmerce in prosecuting gamblers. The thrust of the Act has, Peen to make it a FeCteral offense to conduct a gambling business. in violation of state law. Federai authorities can use their own resources and personnel to investigate and indict and then refer to a state statute to convict 'known gambling offenders in Federal court. With other supplerrentary legislation, these laws, though well-drafted and technically adequate, have only a little detere.ant value. Operators of illegal gambling and those illicitly iAvolved in the legal gambling industry, do not ahmys .. talre ].a~v enforcenpnt seriously. Illegal operations are often igl1ored, and if a defendant is convicted on a garnbling relat-:.ed charge, he usually faces little threat of confinenent and a relatively small fine, \"one Connon rreasure. for the appropriateness of a fine is whet~r or not the fine significantli redUces the profit a person is realizing illegally, [yet] the typical 430 gamblir:tg fine. arrDunts to only a. day or two of illegal profits.197 Organized crirre figures easily disregard light fines or cover them for subordinates. Major organized crirne figures and serious gambling offenders generally are not sentenced to jail. If they do serve a term in prison, it is usually short: in light of tlu:~ir operation and offense. Nicholas Civella, a I<ansas City syndicate leader, was sentenced to 42 nonths, the longest term for a Federal gambling conviction ever given in the\u00b7 district.198 In 1977, James V. Napoli, who headed a policy ring .. grossing an estimated $50,000,000 annually W(iS sentenced to only five years and fined only, $20 ,000; I.Duis A. Khow:y, a leader of the Det;ro~t syndicate numbers operation, was sentenced to only 18 nonths and fined only $10,000; Samuel Ebare, ct leading syracuse, New York bookmaker, received his first jail term of one year and one day. 199 Similarly~ the New York.Tirnes reported that twenty \"rrembers of the Gambino organization \"were involved in 39 cases, Irost of ~{hich concerned gambling, .fran 1969-79.\" There were convictions in 15 of the cases, but the defendants, sare with long criminal recordS, received no jail sentences. The penalty was usually a fine. ~OO. 1\\nd early relea~ for good behavior ,-,\u00b7 ' may nak.e a short sentence even snorter. If gambling in the U.S. is declining or if organized crirne is :finding other pursuits, the trend apparently does .not result from strict \u00b7law enforcem:mt .and . deterrent penalties, but frmt diminishing retums and. greener pastures. The courts prescribe lenient treat:nent of ganbling offenses for a nurrber of reasons. 8om2 judges and juries simply believe gambling offenses are not serious. A gambling report to ~.layer Kocl'l in New York suggested that \"courts do not irrpose the maximum because if they did the defendants would not accept plea bargains and would demand trials.\"201 431 I.Dng dockets and lack of resources may cause courts to deprecate gambling offenses. Presentence reports may not be presentod, request<:..'Ci or well-prepared, and judges may be unaware of a defendant's organized crime affiliations and the need for more co:nscientious sentencing. 'rhe Commission on the Review of the National Policy Toward Gambling reconmendc-'d.: em increased use of pre-sentence reports in gambling cases. The sentence should take into account both the prior record of .. the offende.r and any evidence ... that concerns organized crime act.ivit:i,es Where the offender.\u00b7is a qajor gambling figure and is involved in organized cr.ime a signifiqant jail 2-0~ together with a s'l.lbstantial fine should be given. . Some courts resist sentencing defendants based on who they are and whether they are associated with organized cri.rre, although the United States Code provides for such consideration. They prefer to focus on the particular offense and previous crllninal record. These courts oppose sentences designed to fit the criminal rather than sentenL:cs which fit the cri.rre. If the case is no:t stro:ng enough to substantiate a conspiracy co:nviction, such courts disregard infonnation about organized crime affiliations. Finallyl sare judges hesitate to punish gambling offenders for conducting games ~dly distinguishable from those the state sanctions and operates. Major efforts against gambling took place in the late 1960s; attention directed toward gambling offenses and offenders ~s, however, declined steadilyduring the .1970s. The 196.8 Qmibus .and Crirre Control act, for example, provided for the use of electronic surveillance by Federal investigative agencies--an invaluable.tool in investigating. gambling. Bet\\-Jeen l969 am:1 1974, the gove~t installed 689 tapes in the gambling area. out of total of 958 (71 percent) 203 Nevert:heless, in 1981, only 9 tapes out of 106. were in the gambling area, marking the .A32 l. ,, sixth c;::dnse~tive year u.~: u.t:..~line.204 Indeed, since 1978, the Attorney General has not nl.?ntioned controlling organized cr.i.ne' s influence in gambling in. his annual J.X>licy statenents. 205 . Instead, he 1resourc:es\" on \"labor managenent, rackeetering, public official corruption, infiltration of legitimate b . d t. ff. 1 1.cs tra 1.c ung! \u00b7 These. policy statements evidence a shift away from gambling in Federal efforts to contain organized crime. Federal, as opposed to state and ],.ocal, efforts. against organized crirce are crucial. Most syndicates .cannot be detected or fully prosecuted within the boundaries of a single state, or without extensive resources, .specialization, and rrodern equipment. Federal intelligence agencies must disseininate information to state and local agencies ru1d conduct investigations preliminary to cracking multi-state organizations. Otherwise, organized crine figures remain insulated in the upper echelons of the hierarchy, beyond unsophisticated and over-extended state and local law enforcerrent. The Federal shift in policy from gambling invites nmlti-state organization and syndication of gambling operations. 2. \u00b7 Investigative Techniques Fruitful tecJ:miques in investigating gambling include physical\u00b7 surveillance, use of info:rmants\u00b7or.undercover agents, conscientious response to and \u00b7follow-up of COlfiPlai:nts, use of electronic devices, and extension of inmuni ty to low-level gambling operators will:i.ng t<.; t t. f 207 es ~s y.

Infonnants enforcenEnt infiltrators can supply authorities with enough infonnation t.o get a warrant and prosecutors with materic;ll sufficient to get a canviction. l~y police departments rely on infonnants. Ninety-five percent of the departirents surveyed by the National Gambling Comnission reported that the use of infonnants was their major investigative teehnique.213 Dependence on this strategy may mean that only a fraction of gambling operations are ever exposed to authorities. Participants in syndicate operations still observe a code of silence. The penalties for not talking, even when offered irrmunity, meted out by the crinrinal justice system are less feared than punis.hnents for \"ratting\" on a superior. If an individual does ::,;of0r:m, he may be using the system to avenge himSelf against a bookie or 434 j' ~\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 operator who bas not paid off his wins or a superior who has held back his cut.
