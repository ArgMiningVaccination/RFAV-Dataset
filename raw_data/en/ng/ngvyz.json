The faculty currently participating in the program can be found below. Leadership [John Tavis, Ph.D.](#) Molecular Microbiology and Immunology The Tavis lab's primary focus is antiviral drug discovery targeting the Hepatitis B Virus ribonuclease H (RNaseH). The lab has developed a suite of biochemical and cell-based assays to evaluate how inhibitors of the RNaseH affect the enzyme and viral replication. Its key resource is a small but chemically diverse set of nuclease inhibitors and their analogs. The lab routinely conducts cytotoxicity assays using MTS (mitochondrial function), neutral red retention (lysosome function), crystal violet retention (DNA accumulation, usually interpreted as cell growth), and LDH release (plasma membrane integrity) to gain a more comprehensive view of how its compound affect the cell. The lab collaborates with medicinal chemists in the United States, France, Greece and China and are actively pushing forward two anti-HBV RNaseH hit-to-lead optimization projects. They work closely with other members of the SLU-DDG, including Feng Cao, Ph.D.; Maureen Donlin, Ph.D.; and Getahun Abate, Ph.D. Through these collaborations, the lab has demonstrated that the inhibitors in its library can have high selectivity for one virus or cellular organism over the others, opening a pathway to antimicrobial development targeting nucleases. [Marvin Meyers, Ph.D.](#) Chemistry, Pharmacology and Physiology [marvin.j.meyers@slu.edu](mailto:marvin.j.meyers@slu.edu); [Website](https://www.meyerschemlab.com/) The research in Marvin Meyers' lab is focused the application of medicinal chemistry towards the discovery of potential drug candidates to treat people with rare and neglected diseases. It collaborates with experts in infectious disease biology, including malaria, tuberculosis, infectious diarrhea (cryptosporidiosis), cryptococcal meningitis, hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus. The lab also has ongoing collaborations with experts in oncology, FSHD muscular dystrophy and infant short-gut syndrome. The lab uses synthetic organic chemistry techniques to prepare new compounds, which are analyzed by its collaborators to assess their biological properties. Using medicinal chemistry and structure-based drug design principles, the lab optimizes the potency, pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of compounds with the goals of identification of tool compounds and, ultimately, candidate drug molecules for clinical trials. [Silviya Petrova Zustiak, Ph.D.](#) on hydrogel biomaterials and soft tissue engineering, with emphasis on developing novel biomaterials as cell scaffolds, drug screening platforms and protein delivery devices. 3D biomaterial-based models are crucial for closing the reproducibility gap between 2D tissue culture and animal models by providing a cell environment that mimics real tissue. 3D systems could have an immediate impact in the development of platforms for toxicology screening, addressing concerns of drug failures in clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unforeseen side effects. The laboratory also develops injectable and biodegradable hydrogels for sustained localized drug and protein delivery. This research is highly multidisciplinary, merging engineering, materials science, and biology. [Fran and Molecular Biology [fran.sverdrup@health.slu.edu](mailto:fran.sverdrup@health.slu.edu); [Website](https://biochem.slu.edu/people/sverdrup/) Fran Sverdrup's lab is focused on drug discovery in human genetic and infectious diseases. They perform target identification and validation, drug screening and preclinical evaluation of drug candidates. Their major project targets facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), one of the most common forms of muscular dystrophy for which there is no treatment. They have identified druggable pathways that modulate expression of the toxic DUX4 gene responsible for FSHD and are translating those finding into potential therapies. They are currently advancing three exciting classes of drugs, identified through high-throughput screening, that turn off DUX4 expression. This includes a robust lead optimization program involving close collaboration with their medicinal chemistry colleagues. Svedrup is moving these compounds into animal model testing and have established a key collaboration with a pharmaceutical partner to eventually advance into human clinical trials. A second interest is in anti-infectives research with recent programs targeting malaria, lymphatic filariasis and African sleeping sickness. To accomplish these activities, Sverdrup maintains a network of collaborations with disease experts, medicinal chemists, pharmaceutical/biotech companies and foundations. Fran Sverdrup is also the Director of the IDBI Discovery Services Core, including ADMEPK pathogen Group B Streptococcus. While present in the normal human vaginal microbiota, pregnant mothers are routinely screened and treated with broad spectrum antibiotics to lower risks to immune-na\u00efve newborns. This has unintended consequences for later development of a newborns healthy microbiome, leading to increased inflammation, asthma, and immune-disorder risk. Janowiak studies the interaction between GBS, the microbiome, and the healthy or altered immune system, and regulation of glutathione synthesis and metabolism as a means to reveal novel, specific and selective treatments for GBS. Janowiak also collaborates throughout the university, providing expert guidance on tools and strategies for studying the microbiome, oxidative stress, and antioxidants in multiple systems. Finally, Janowiak has a strong passion in training the future generation of biomedical scientists, as evidenced by her mentoring 5-10 undergrads and 1-3 grad students in biochemical and microbiological research per semester.

Toth's expertise is in vivo drug testing; they developed the Syrian hamster model to study human adenovirus infections. Syrian hamsters (unlike mice and rats) are permissive for human adenoviruses, and develop pathology similar to that in humans. They use this model to evaluate the therapies against disseminated and respiratory adenovirus infection. Toth also develops Syrian hamster models for other viruses, including enteric norovirus and SARS-CoV-2. Over the past several years, Toth has conducted over 60 studies with 17 drug candidates as a contractor to the NIH Animal Models for Infectious Disease program, forming collaborations with academic and industrial laboratories in the USA and Europe. [Rita M Heuertz, Ph.D.](#) Clinical Health Sciences [rita.heuertz@health.slu.edu;](mailto:rita.heuertz@health.slu.edu;) [Website](/doisy/faculty/heuertz-rita.php) Rita Heuertz studies the production, maintenance, and antibiotic resistance of bacterial biofilms and biofilm associated infections, which account for more than 80% of microbial infections. Specific roles of bioactive compounds and components of the innate immune response have not been elucidated for bacteria in the context of biofilm and remain incomplete and poorly understood. Heuertz research is defining the roles and mechanisms of anti-biofilm responses in fighting biofilm-associated infections.

[Duane Grandgenett, Ph.D.](#) Institute for Molecular Virology, Molecular Microbiology and Immunology [duane.grandgenett@health.slu.edu;](mailto:duane.grandgenett@health.slu.edu;) Duane Grandgenett's laboratory has been studying retroviruses since 1970 and discovered the viral integrase (IN) in 1978 in avian retroviruses. IN is responsible for integration of the viral DNA into the host chromosomes. Since the early 1990's, they have focused on HIV-1 IN and helped Merck & Co develop the first major lead inhibitors directed against IN. The first FDA-approved inhibitor, Raltegravir, was in 2007. Two other companies are marketing similar active site inhibitors, one of which (Dolutegravir, GSK) is far superior at the clinical level. Their current efforts are directed towards understanding the mechanisms associated with the assembly of HIV-1 and Rouse Sarcoma Virus (RSV) IN-DNA complexes and their analyses at atomic resolution level. There are no HIV-1 IN-DNA complexes where detailed active site inhibitors can be thoroughly evaluated, except though a very distantly related surrogate prototype foamy virus IN-DNA model. They are now investigating whether the RSV IN-DNA complex can be utilized to study HIV-1 inhibitors at the atomic level. Their recent publications strongly suggest that RSV IN will serve as an excellent surrogate model for HIV-1 IN inhibitors. RSV and HIV-1 IN are similar genetically and structurally and, are equally inhibited in vivo and in vitro by the HIV-1 clinical inhibitors. [Alexei Demchenko, Ph.D.](#) Chair, Department of Chemistry [alexei.demchenko@slu.edu;](mailto:alexei.demchenko@slu.edu;) [Website](https://glyco-world.com/) The Demchenko laboratory, Glycoworld, has trained more than 150 researchers and has developed many innovative tools for the synthesis and application of carbohydrates (glycans or glycoconjugates) in five major areas: - New synthetic reagents and building blocks; - Reactions for stereocontrolled glycosylation; - Expeditious strategies and automated technologies for oligosaccharide synthesis; - Biomedical studies on the development of glycopharmaceuticals; and - Integration of glycans and nanomaterials in carbohydrate nanotechnology.

[Long Ping Victor Tse, Ph.D.](#) Molecular Microbiology and Immunology The Tse lab focuses their research on Virology, particularly coronavirus, dengue virus, and adeno-associated virus. Virology is one of the most exciting fields in biology, from the on-going COVID-19 pandemic to viral-based gene and cancer therapies. In the Tse Lab, we seek to understand viral pathogenesis and transmission (zoonotic, enzootic and pandemic) at the molecular level to inform and develop new guidelines, vaccines, and antivirals for public health. In addition, we engineer pathogenic viruses into harmless nanoparticles for use in gene therapy and vaccine development. Evolution is the best engineer in nature. Inspired by the elegance of evolution, we use multiple innovative technologies, including saturation-mutagenesis, directed-evolution, molecular engineering, CRISPR genome-wide screening, and multiple -omics sequencing, to recapitulate, direct, and accelerate the natural evolutionary process in a controlled laboratory environment. These methods are used to: 1) Dissect each facet of viral infection and improve our understanding of viral pathogenesis and transmission, and 2) Convert such knowledge to engineer viruses into novel nanoparticles for medical uses. [Jianguo Liu, M.D., Ph.D.](#) Internal Medicine - Infectious Disease The Liu laboratory studies gene regulation and immune responses during chronic inflammation, with a particular interest in identifying the roles of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in regulation of immune evasion during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and breast cancer development.

[Rajeev Aurora, Ph.D.](#) Molecular Microbiology and Immunology Rajeev Aurora studies mechanisms that lead to chronic inflammation in the context of osteoimmunology, osteoarthritis, and bone degeneration. His lab uses mouse models and human studies, employing computational and laboratory tools to understand the genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that lead from acute inflammation to chronic activation of the immune system. The Aurora laboratory has developed a treatment that promotes the crosstalk between the immune and skeletal systems to restore homeostasis. It has been recognized that cytokines produced by proinflammatory T-cells leads to activation of osteoclasts, cells that resorb bone. Persistent exposure to the cytokines leads to erosion of the bone in several diseases including postmenopausal osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. The laboratory discovered that osteoclasts, in addition to their bone resorbing activity also are antigen presenting cells. He holds multiple patents on treatments for bone degeneration diseases.

Gonzalo's long-term research interest is to understand the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the genomic instability that drives aging and cancer, with the ultimate goal of targeting these mechanisms therapeutically. Nuclear lamins orchestrate genome organization, forming a scaffold for tethering chromatin and protein complexes regulating many nuclear functions. Lamin dysfunction impacts nuclear architecture, chromatin structure, as well as DNA transcription, replication and repair. These data, and the association of lamins dysfunction with dozen of degenerative disorders, premature aging, and cancer, provide evidence for these proteins operating as \"caretakers of the genome.\" Gonzalo's research focuses on identifying mechanisms whereby lamins regulate genome stability and function, as these mechanisms are key to identify therapies that ameliorate the progression of laminopathies in patients.

[Laurie metabolic dysfunction cause various co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, reproductive dysfunction, respiratory abnormalities, psychiatric conditions, and certain types of cancer. A combination of lifestyle modification, dietary alterations and pharmacology is necessary to combat obesity. Yet, attempts to ameliorate obesity, especially in the long-term, have not been successful. One reason is that a complete knowledge of how metabolic organs function is lacking as all the metabolic components have not yet been identified. The Chakraborty laboratory focuses to determine functions of novel proteins or pathways in metabolism. The goal is to develop drugs that ameliorate metabolic diseases by modulating these targets. With the help of Institute- and NIH-funded grants, the group discovered that the inositol pyrophosphate biosynthetic enzyme IP6K1 is a potential target in metabolic diseases such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The team determined the mechanisms by which IP6K1 promotes metabolic dysfunction. Moreover, they demonstrated that targeting this pathway is a pharmacologically viable approach to treat metabolic diseases. Currently, The Chakraborty lab aims to address two of the important issues in IP6K1 research. 1) The mechanisms that regulate IP6K1 in vivo have not yet been identified. They discovered a novel protein that regulates IP6K1 in vivo. 2) The available IP6K1 inhibitor compound is a pan-IP6K inhibitor, and it does not possess drug-like properties. Therefore, the group tests in vivo efficacy of the newly developed IP6K inhibitor compounds, developed by various collaborators. Published genome-wide association, transcriptomic and proteomic studies together with the lab's ongoing studies identified many novel proteins that regulate metabolism.

Despite tremendous recent success, translating immunotherapy into a reliable treatment option for most cancer patients is still not a reality. One of the major challenges to successful immunotherapy is the induction of T cell tolerance within patients. Tolerance is multifaceted, involving both the death of tumor-reactive T cells and the induction of anergy, which renders any surviving T cells inert. Research in the Teague lab aims to identify and therapeutically target the molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell tolerance as a means to boost anti-tumor immunity, and ultimately to inform translational efforts to provide enhanced immunotherapy for patients with cancer.

Microbiology Immunology Research Scientist, St Louis VA Healthcare System [jacki.kornbluth@health.slu.edu](mailto:jacki.kornbluth@health.slu.edu) Jacki Kornbluth studies the role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in the immune response to tumors and pathogenic infection. Her laboratory has developed the only normal NK cell line (NK3.3) to date and continues to characterize key molecules mediating NK cell activity. They recently found that when activated, NK3.3 cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are extremely potent in killing a broad array of tumor cells but do not kill normal cells. In addition, EVs can be produced in large quantities, and are stable when frozen, stored and thawed without loss of function. Therefore, NK3.3-derived EVs have the potential to be an \"off-the-shelf\" product for treatment of many different types of cancer. Mouse models of human myeloma and breast cancer are being used to test the ability of NK-derived EVs to mediate anti-tumor activity in vivo as proof of concept that EVs have therapeutic potential. Preliminary results indicate that NK3.3-derived EVs kill these tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. NK cells also kill cells infected with herpes, influenza and hepatitis viruses. The ability of NK3.3-derived EVs to treat viral infections remains to be determined but may have tremendous therapeutic potential.

Znosko, Ph.D.](#) Chemistry Research in the Znosko laboratory focuses on the thermodynamics and structural features of RNA motifs. While sequences of many important RNAs have been determined, little is known about structure-function relationships of RNA. One reason for this lack of information is that there is little definitive secondary and tertiary structural information about RNA. X-ray crystallography and NMR methods are providing an increasing number of RNA structures, but it is unlikely that these methods will keep pace with the rate at which interesting sequences are being discovered. Thus, there is a need for reliable, rapid methods to predict secondary and tertiary structures of RNA. Being able to predict secondary and tertiary structures of RNA provides a foundation for determining structure-function relationships for RNA and for targeting RNA with therapeutics. A broad, long-term objective of the laboratory is to improve RNA secondary and tertiary structure prediction from sequence.

[AJay Jain, M.D.](#) Pediatric Gastroenterology, Pediatrics Ajay Jain's research interests include pediatric liver and gut diseases and nutrition. The Jain lab evaluates strategies targeting liver and gut injury noted in short bowel syndrome (SBS), which results from bowel resection or lack of functional gut. SBS patients require intravenous nutrition through a process called Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). Despite being a life saver, complications in SBS include life threatening and potentially fatal, intestinal failure associated liver disease (IFALD) as well as gut injury with gut mucosal atrophy and increase gut permeability. The lab studies many aspects of SBS and nutrition, including the role of gut microbiota in TPN associated injury, and markers of nutritional status and injury. Jain lab is currently evaluating novel molecules in mitigating injury associated with SBS, under a $1.9 million grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. Jain is the director of the M.D./Ph.D. program at Saint Louis University School of Medicine, and medical director of the pediatric liver transplant program at SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital.

They have developed and utilized an array of biophysical methods for high-throughput screening of compounds binding the Germ Cell Nuclear Factor (GCNF), which holds great promise to the future of stem cell therapy and the development of anti-sterility drugs for men. Their goal is to identify the endogenous metabolite of orphan nuclear receptors using in-silico molecular docking of compound libraries to orphan NR targets, in tandem with a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics platform. The deorphanization of NRs could provide crucial clues to the structure of synthetic compounds that would fit the binding pocket. They will use X-ray crystallography to structurally confirm specific binding of drugs and endogenous metabolites to NRs, and NMR spectroscopy techniques to characterize the interaction dynamics. The invaluable structural and dynamics information will aid structure optimization of synthetic compounds for better drug potency and efficacy. They will be working closely with other members of the SLU-DDG, including John Tavis, Marvin Meyers, Feng Cao, Maureen Donlin, Lynda Morrison, and Getahun Abate on drug discovery efforts. [Duane Grandgenett, Ph.D.](#) Molecular Microbiology and Immunology; Institute for Molecular Virology [duane.grandgenett@health.slu.edu ](mailto:duane.grandgenett@health.slu.edu?subject=); Duane Grandgenett's laboratory has been studying retroviruses since 1970 and discovered the viral integrase (IN) in 1978 in avian retroviruses. IN is responsible for integration of the viral DNA into the host chromosomes. Since the early 1990's, they have focused on HIV-1 IN and helped Merck & Co develop the first major lead inhibitors directed against IN. The first FDA-approved inhibitor, Raltegravir, was in 2007. Two other companies are marketing similar active site inhibitors, one of which (Dolutegravir, GSK) is far superior at the clinical level. Their current efforts are directed towards understanding the mechanisms associated with the assembly of HIV-1 and Rouse Sarcoma Virus (RSV) IN-DNA complexes and their analyses at atomic resolution level. There are no HIV-1 IN-DNA complexes where detailed active site inhibitors can be thoroughly evaluated, except though a very distantly related surrogate prototype foamy virus IN-DNA model. They are now investigating whether the RSV IN-DNA complex can be utilized to study HIV-1 inhibitors at the atomic level. Their recent publications strongly suggest that RSV IN will serve as an excellent surrogate model for HIV-1 IN inhibitors. RSV and HIV-1 IN are similar genetically and structurally and, are equally inhibited in vivo and in vitro by the HIV-1 clinical inhibitors. [Sergey Korolev, Ph.D.](#) Biochemistry and Molecular Biology [sergey.korolev@health.slu.edu](mailto:sergey.korolev@health.slu.edu?subject=); [Website](https://biochem.slu.edu/faculty/korolevwp/) The Korolev lab studies mechanism of protein function using X-ray crystallography combined with biophysical and biochemical methods.

They are developing high throughput inhibitor screening assays for DNA binding and peptide interacting proteins. Systems of interest include 1) recombination mediator proteins (RMPs) important for genome maintenance, DNA repair and implicated in cancer and other diseases; 2) DNA helicases involved in DNA replication and repair; 3) calcium-independent phospholipase critical for inflammation, calcium homeostasis and implicated in a wide spectrum of diseases from ischemia to neurodegeneration. They work closely with other members of the SLU-DDG, including John Tavis, Duane Grandgenett, and David Molecular Biology [nicola.pozzi@health.slu.edu](mailto:nicola.pozzi@health.slu.edu?subject=); [Website](https://biochem.slu.edu/faculty/pozzi/) Pathological activation of the complement and clotting cascades leads to thrombosis and chronic inflammation, and is linked to the onset and progression of autoimmune disorders. In Nicola Pozzi's laboratory, they study the unknown biology of complement and clotting factors, investigate their structure-function relationships, identify new ligands and define their mechanisms of recognition. Finally, they engineer novel constructs with the desired functional properties to correct the disease state. To achieve their goals, they routinely express recombinant proteins from bacteria and mammalian cells for biophysical (single molecule fluorescence, DLS, analytical centrifugation, calorimetry) and structural analysis (X-ray crystallography and SAXS). They develop and perform kinetic and binding assays based on absorbance, fluorescence and luminescence spectroscopy, and surface plasmon resonance. The recent development of a novel family of anticoagulant fusion proteins to ameliorate the outcome of patients suffering from thrombosis in acute clinical settings such as sepsis and stroke is a representative example of their work. [Brent M. Znosko, Ph.D.](#) Chemistry Research in the Znoskol aboratory focuses on the thermodynamics and structural features of RNA motifs. While sequences of many important RNAs have been determined, little is known about structure-function relationships of RNA. One reason for this lack of information is that there is little definitive secondary and tertiary structural information about RNA. X-ray crystallography and NMR methods are providing an increasing number of RNA structures, but it is unlikely that these methods will keep pace with the rate at which interesting sequences are being discovered. Thus, there is a need for reliable, rapid methods to predict secondary and tertiary structures of RNA. Being able to predict secondary and tertiary structures of RNA provides a foundation for determining structure-function relationships for RNA and for targeting RNA with therapeutics. Therefore one broad, long-term objective of the laboratory is to improve RNA secondary and tertiary structure prediction from sequence.
