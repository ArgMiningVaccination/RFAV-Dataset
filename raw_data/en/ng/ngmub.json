In fullling its mandate, the Task Force has developed recommendations for public policy on a host of issues at the interface of law and medicine, including: the determination of death; withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment; organ transplantation; surrogate decision-making; physician assisted suicide; assisted reproductive technologies; and genetic testing. Task Force recommendations have taken various forms, including proposals for law, regulation, and public education. Many Task Force recommendations have become New York State law, and have also served as models for legislation in other states. This report examines dietary supplements, focusing on their safety, use by consumers, and regulation at the federal and state levels. This topic is markedly dierent from previous Task Force reports, which have addressed more classic issues in medical ethics, primarily at the beginning and end of life. However, the Task Force nds troubling ethical issues within the domain of dietary supplements. Informed choice is a signicant issue within medical ethics, and has been a major focus of many Task Force reports. Informed choice depends upon access to adequate and accurate information, and occurs within a context of beliefs about the safety of available options. Consumers may presume that all dietary supplements are safe and the Task Force believes that this condence is unwarranted. The presumption rests on the belief that dietary supplements are safe because they are \"natural,\" because the federal government closely monitors them, and because health professionals are well informed about the risks and benets of dietary supplements. Each of these bases for the presumed safety of dietary supple - ments is flawed, as we examine in this report. The Task Force addresses the relative lack of sound scientic data on dietary supplements, their limited government regulation, and the current decits in education regarding dietary supplements. The Task Force recommendations call for greater attention to each of these three areas to help New York consumers make well-informed and safer choices.

Millions of American consumers ingest these supplements; recent surveys report nearly half of the American adult population routinely use dietary supplements.1 The consumer turns to dietary supplements to maintain or improve health\u2014perhaps to supplement a vi - tamin deciency, lose weight, or support organ function\u2014often believing them to be more natural, potent or pure than food or pharmaceuticals. Dietary supplements with a broad range of health claims are widely avail - able, and the consumer may think that they have been proven eective. Dietary supplement labels need not list risks or contraindications, and the consumer may assume that supplements are safe. In each case the consumer may be wrong. Dietary supplements are dened under federal law as products that are intended to \"supplement the diet\" and that contain certain \"dietary ingredients\" such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids.2 Dietary supple - ments are regulated as a class of foods, not as drugs. Like foods\u2014and unlike drugs\u2014most dietary supplements are not screened for safety and eectiveness by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Federal law does not permit dietary supplement labels to contain drug claims, such as assertions that supplements are in - tended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent or cure diseases (absent prior government approval in specic cases). Yet the airwaves are lled with advertisements touting the health-promoting properties of dietary supplements, without mention of risk. The line between permissible and impermissible health claims for supplements is not always clear to the consumer, who naturally may misconstrue the apparent bounty of medicinal-sounding risk- free benets. But while many supplements may be benecial, they are not without risks. As discussed in Chapter 3 of this report, these risks include the following: \u00b7 Certain dietary supplements have been associated with severe side eects (e.g., kava with liver failure, aristolochic acid with kidney failure); \u00b7 Certain dietary supplements have known side eects comparable to those associated with pharmaceuti - cals; \u00b7 Persons \"self-medicating\" with dietary supplements may delay necessary eective conventional medical treatment, and exacerbate disease; \u00b7 Dietary supplements may interact with common prescription and over-the-counter medications; \u00b7 The misperception that \"if a little is a good, more has to be better\" can lead consumers to mega-dose, risking toxic eects even from \"safe\" dietary supplements.Executive Summary Dietary Supplements: Balancing Consumer Choice & Safety10It is hoped this report is a rst step toward giving New York consumers the power to make more informed choices about dietary supplements. The Task Force is recommending state-level actions because current federal oversight of dietary supplements is inadequate. Measures by New York State are warranted until the federal government implements adequate standards and enforcement for manufacturing, safety, and eectiveness. The current scope of federal oversight of dietary supplements was established primarily by the Dietary Sup - plement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994.3 Among the provisions of DSHEA is an expanded denition of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients; guidelines for advertising and marketing of dietary supplements; requirements for dietary supplement product labels, and the authority for the FDA to establish good manufacturing practices for dietary supplement manufacturers. The supplement industry has long maintained that the FDA has ample authority under DSHEA to regulate supplements and even remove them from the market when necessary. The Task Force strongly disagrees. Con - sider ephedra, once the dietary supplement industry's biggest moneymaker, whose sale the FDA nally restricted a decade after serious health concerns emerged. The FDA was aware of serious adverse events associated with ephedra as early as 1994.4 Yet not until 2004 did the FDA determine that ephedra posed an \"unreasonable risk\" of illness or injury when used under its suggested or ordinary conditions of use, and issued a regulation that essentially banned the sales of ephedra supplement products nationwide.5 Then in April 2005, a federal district court questioned the method by which FDA had shown unreasonable risk, and struck down the ban, at least as it applied to certain \"low-dose\" ephedra products.6 The lesson of ephedra is that states must be prepared to act when the FDA does not, or cannot. Indeed, a number of states, concerned by delays at the federal level, acted independently to regulate ephedra. In New York, Governor George E. Pataki signed into law a statewide ban on dietary supplements containing ephedra, eective in October 2003, citing his concern for the health and well-being of New Yorkers.7 The Task Force supports state action in light of the following facts, among others: \u00b7 DSHEA does not require dietary supplement manufacturers to submit safety data to the FDA before their products are sold to consumers. \u00b7 DSHEA does not require manufacturers to report adverse events associated with dietary supplements to the FDA or any other entity. \u00b7 DHSEA does not require manufacturers to include risk information on product labels, even for dietary supplements that have been associated with serious adverse events. The federal government has the ability to address these problems. Unless and until these problems are rem - edied at the federal level, however, New York State action is required. * * * The following recommendations contemplate an Expert Committee to consider specic dietary supplements in depth, and to advise the Department of Health on provisions for ensuring the safety of New York consumers by mandating appropriate collection of data from adverse events and research, and by permitting an ecient re - sponse to evidence of risk through changes in labeling and retail restrictions as needed. An education campaign is also recommended to ll the gaps in public information.11Recommendation I The New York State Commissioner of Health should create an Expert Committee within the Department of Health to evaluate the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements on an ongoing basis. The Expert Com - mittee will assess available data and make specic recommendations to the Commissioner of Health. Data on the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements emerge continually from scientic research, adverse event reports, and other sources. Therefore, the Task Force recommends that an Expert Committee be cre - ated under the auspices of DOH to collect, evaluate, and retain all available data on the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements. The committee will also evaluate dietary supplements to determine what (if any) danger they present to the public. These evaluations will result in specic policy or regulatory recommendations to the Commissioner of Health. These recommendations might range from issuing a public advisory to banning the sale of a particular dietary supplement or dietary supplement ingredient. The Expert Committee should consider the following policies supported by the T ask Force based on current information: i. Institute mandatory reporting by dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors of adverse events associated with dietary supplements, with continued support for voluntary reporting by consumers, health care practitioners, and others. The FDA denes an adverse event as an incident of illness or injury that may be associated with a dietary supplement (or a range of other products), whether or not there is a clear cause/eect relationship between the adverse event and the product. A serious adverse event is one that results in a death, life-threatening illness, hos - pitalization, disability, congenital anomaly, or medical intervention to prevent permanent injury or damage.8 The FDA system for tracking adverse events related to dietary supplement use is inadequate. By its own estimate, the FDA tracks few adverse events (as few as one percent in 2000).9 From 1994 to 1999, the FDA received less than ten reports of adverse events from dietary supplement manufacturers. Since they are not required to collect such information, some manufacturers had no data on adverse events, while others had in - formation that they did not share with the FDA.10 The Task Force believes that mandatory reporting of serious adverse events related to dietary supplement use will enhance the ability of DOH to detect patterns of illness or injury resulting from individual products that may be adulterated, contaminated, or otherwise dangerous. In addition to mandatory reporting by manufac - turers and distributors doing business in New York, retailers, consumers, and health care practitioners should be encouraged to report all dietary supplement-related adverse events that occur in New York State to the FDA. The Expert Committee should consider the following policies supported by the T ask Force based on current information: ii. Create a state-level registry of dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors doing business in New York State, or other equivalent mechanism for 1) assuring compliance with mandatory reporting of adverse events, and 2) facilitating communication with dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors. The Expert Committee should consider the most eective means for the state to ensure compliance with mandatory adverse event reporting. One possible solution would be the establishment of a registry of those entities from which reporting is required.12The Expert Committee should consider the following policies supported by the T ask Force based on current information: iii. Obtain statutory authorization for the Commissioner of Health to require, by regulation, specic la - beling of dietary supplement packaging by manufacturers on such terms as the Commissioner may deem reasonable. Current federal dietary supplement labeling regulations fail to ensure that sucient information is provided to facilitate consumer understanding.11 State-level labeling mandates can address decits by 1) alerting consum - ers that particular products have not been determined to be safe and/or ecacious, and 2) informing consumers of risks that are reasonably suspected. The Expert Committee should consider what the Task Force believes are necessary steps to ensuring the flow of accurate and sucient information to consumers. First, the power to require dietary supplement labeling should be explicitly assigned by the Legislature to the Commissioner of Health. The Task Force recommends that the Commissioner of Health mandate that dietary supplement products that have not been proven safe during pregnancy and lactation carry a warning label. Also recommended is the labeling of specic products that have known associated risks. Finally, the Expert Committee should consider recommending that the Commissioner mandate that the labels of all dietary supplement products sold in New York State bear the FDA MedWatch toll-free telephone number, to facilitate adverse event reporting.12 The Expert Committee should consider the following policies supported by the T ask Force based on current information: iv. Obtain statutory authorization for the Commissioner of Health to ban the sale to minors or to all per - sons in New York State of specic dietary supplements found by the Commissioner to be unsafe. The Task Force is not recommending actions directed at specic dietary supplements. However, in the course of research, the Task Force evaluated a number of dietary supplements that might be deemed unsafe. As two initial projects in this areas, the Expert Committee should (1) review the evidence for banning the sale to minors of dietary supplements that are marketed as legal alternatives to illegal drugs, and (2) review data and consider banning the sale of aristolochic acid, comfrey, and kava to all consumers in New York State. Recommendation II The Department of Health should undertake a major public health education campaign on dietary supple - ments, with variations specically directed to dierent target groups. The public education campaign will provide information about dietary supplement risks and benets, as well as guidance for consumers in deciding whether or not to purchase dietary supplements, and how to respond to adverse events arising from dietary supplement use. Portions of the campaign should be tailored to dier - ent target audiences, including physicians and other health care professionals, complementary and alternative medicine practitioners, coaches, educators, parents, and adolescents. * * * These recommendations strike an appropriate balance between two legitimate state purposes: respecting consumer freedom to purchase potentially benecial products, and protecting the health and safety of those consumers. The proposed Expert Committee on dietary supplements would develop state-level measures for 13tracking serious adverse events associated with dietary supplements, increasing supplement-related information available to consumers, and reacting to developing scientic literature on dietary supplements. An accompa - nying DOH education campaign would give consumers and health care providers a broader understanding of the potential risks and benets associated with dietary supplements, thus allowing New Yorkers to make well- informed choices about dietary supplements.

Ephedra: A Case Study in Dietary Supplement Safety In February 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published a regulation prohibiting sales of dietary supplements containing ephedra, ten years after the agency rst issued warnings about ephedra-based products. The eort to restrict ephedra has been surrounded by enormous controversy, pitting bereaved family members against advocates for consumer choice and industry representatives. In April 2005, one year after the FDA ephedra rule went into eect, a federal court stoked the re by ruling in favor of a manufacturer's challenge to the regulatory ban.1 This chapter reviews a number of case histories that provide a sense of the emotional intensity of the debate over ephedra, and then examines the process that resulted in restricted ephedra sales. This process will provide a lens through which we can understand how dietary supplements are regulated, and will generate suggestions as to how the process can be improved, both on a national level and in New York State. Case 1: A 23-year-old baseball player arrived at spring training, overweight and out of shape, to begin condi - tioning drills in the hot, humid Florida weather. He collapsed during a workout and was rushed to the hospital, where his body temperature reached 108 degrees. Doctors performed emergency treatment for heat stroke. Back at training camp, a bottle of an over-the-counter dietary supplement containing ephedra was found in his locker.2 The player, Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler, died the next day, February 17, 2003. The ocial cause of death was multi-system organ failure preceded by heat stroke. According to the medical examiner, signicant amounts of the dietary supplement containing ephedra contributed to Bechler's heat stroke. Also found in Bechler's blood were small amounts of two other stimulants, pseudoephedrine and caeine.3 Bechler's death was the most highly publicized adverse event associated with ephedra, but it was by no means the rst. Case 2: In 1998, Anne Marie Capati, a Huntington, NY, mother of two died after consuming an ephedra- based weight loss supplement under the written advice of her personal trainer. During a workout geared toward shedding her post-pregnancy weight, Capati collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. Later that night, after doctors determined that Capati had suered a stroke, excessive and uncontrollable bleeding in her brain led to Capati's death. The doctors conrmed that the dietary supplement Capati was taking had elevated her blood pressure to a dangerous level, causing the stroke.4 Case 3: In 1996, 20-year-old Peter Schlendorf went to Florida with his friends for spring break. A resident of Asharoken, NY, he was a football player at the State University of New York at Albany. During the vacation, Schlendorf took an \"herbal ecstasy\" product purchased at a T-shirt shop. After Schlendorf took the pills, his heart \"began to race uncontrollably.\"5 His friends left him in the motel room, and when they came back, he was dead. An autopsy report concluded that Schlendorf had died from \"cardiac arrhythmia caused by an herbal supplement containing the drug ephedra.\"6 There was no other evidence of drugs or alcohol in Schlendorf's system at the time of his death.16The case reports of Bechler, Capati, and Schlendorf created signicant media attention; their family members have played signicant roles in the eort to ban ephedra.7 These cases and others like them illustrate the inten - sity of the controversy generated by ephedra, and serve to draw attention to the scientic and regulatory issues surrounding dietary supplements. * * * T raditional Asian medicine practitioners have used ephedra to treat asthma, allergies, colds, and hay fever for more than 5,000 years. Ephedra is a natural source of the is regulated as a pharmaceutical-grade drug.9 Many over-the-counter cold and flu remedies and prescription medications for bronchial asthma contain synthetic ephedrine. Both controversial and lucrative, ephedra was most often used among American consumers for weight loss and to enhance athletic performance. Estimated sales of ephedra in 2003 reached approximately $1.4 billion.10 Scientic data on the pharmacology of ephedra indicate that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alka - loids pose short- and long-term health risks.11 One study found that the relative risk for adverse reactions among ephedra users is 10- to 40-fold higher than the risk among those who use herbal products generally.12 Ephedra, especially when taken with caeine,13 increases such side eects as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric symptoms in - cluding anxiety and mood swings, and autonomic hyperactivity and palpitations; serious adverse events associ - ated with ephedra and ephedrine have included deaths, heart attacks, cerebrovascular accidents, and seizures.14 The Long Road to Federal Ephedra Regulation The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)15 curtailed the federal government's ability to regulate ephedra and other dietary supplements. Under DSHEA, no pre-market safety testing or approval of most dietary supplements is required and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is limited to post-market surveillance. Unlike prescription and over-the-counter drugs, the burden rests on the FDA to prove that a dietary supplement is unsafe, rather than on the manufacturer to prove that the product is safe. Further, the ability of the FDA to identify problems is limited, because DSHEA does not grant the FDA the authority to demand reports of dietary supplement-related adverse events from manufacturers.16 The FDA was concerned about ephedra and about the lax regulation of dietary supplements generally at the time of DSHEA's passage.17 To lay the groundwork for regulation, the FDA \"gathered and thoroughly reviewed a prodigious amount of evidence about epehdra's pharmacology,\"18 eectiveness and associated risk. In 1994, the FDA began issuing medical bulletins and consumer alerts highlighting the dangers of ephedra- based dietary supplements and warning against individual brands that appeared to be especially hazardous.19 When it was able to identify ephedra products that were adulterated with synthetic ephedrine, or were marketed as alternatives to illicit drugs, or were otherwise clearly unsafe, the FDA conducted enforcement actions against manufacturers. These included warning letters, court-authorized cease-and-desist orders, and seizure actions in the most urgent situations.20 (See Appendix B.) In 1996, more than half the members of the FDA Food Advi - sory Committee could not identify a safe level for ephedrine alkaloids in dietary supplements and recommended that they be removed from the market.21 By June 1997, the FDA had received over 800 adverse event reports linked to ephedra\u2014more than for any 17other dietary supplement\u2014related to products containing ephedra.22 The increasing number of adverse event reports23 and the FDA analysis of existing scientic literature led the FDA to conclude that ephedra supplements represented a signicant public health threat.24 The FDA published a proposed rule for ephedra-based supple - ments that would have set a recommended serving level and maximum daily dosage, would have required labels warning consumers not to use the product for more than seven days, and would have prohibited the combina - tion of ephedra with other stimulant ingredients such as caeine.25 Supplement manufacturers responded with aggressive lobbying eorts against the proposed rule.26 In July 1999, the U.S. General Accounting Oce ( GAO) published a study critical of the proposed rule.27 It recognized that the FDA lacked the authority to demand that manufacturers turn over their adverse event reports and therefore had to rely on voluntary reports.28 The GAO also stated that the specic dosing and usage guidelines were insuciently supported by evidence.29 The FDA eventually withdrew the proposed rule.30 However, concern about ephedra did not cease. In 2001, the Marine Corps and the Navy restricted sales of ephedra-based products from base exchanges.31 In 2002, in response to ephedra-associated deaths of young soldiers in training, the Army and Air Force removed all ephedra products from their on-base military stores.32 The National Institutes of Health Oce of Dietary Supplements and the National Center for Complemen - tary and Alternative Medicine sponsored an evidence-based review by RAND Corporation to assess the clinical ecacy and safety of products containing ephedra or ephedrine alkaloids.33 A thorough review of the scientic literature and the evaluation of adverse event reports revealed ve deaths, ve myocardial infarctions, 11 cere - brovascular accidents, four seizures, and eight psychiatric diagnoses. The RAND researchers concluded that the use of ephedra is associated with doubled or tripled risk of psychiatric, autonomic, and upper gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as heart palpitations. The study found that the number of adverse events in young adults warranted further study of ephedra's physical eects, and that the use of ephedra in combination with caeine was associated with numerous adverse events.34 The study also found that, although ephedra may promote mod - est short-term weight loss in clinical trials, there were no data regarding long-term weight loss. Finally, RAND found that the evidence supporting the use of ephedra to enhance athletic performance was insucient.35 In October 2002, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson asked the FDA to evaluate the available scientic evidence and recommend the strongest possible mandatory warning label for ephedra products.36 Meanwhile, the American Medical Association, the American Heart Association, and numerous other professional health organizations urged the FDA to ban the sale of dietary supplements containing ephedra.37 In August 2002, at the request of the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation to determine whether Metabolife International, Inc., manufacturer of the ephedra-based product Metabolife 356, had issued false statements to the FDA concerning adverse event reports. The FDA had unsuccessfully sought to obtain these reports from Metabolife International, Inc., even through litigation, since 1997.38 The GAO analyzed the Metabolife International, Inc. records in 2003 and found reports of 92 serious events (heart attack, stroke, seizure, or death) associated with Metabolife 356.39 It noted that the types of events report - ed were consistent with the types of events reported to FDA, with the known physiological eects of ephedra, and with the RAND study.40 The GAO also found that, where information on dosage or duration of use was included in the reports, most of the serious events \"occurred among consumers who reported using the product within the guidelines on the Metabolife 356 label.\"4118By the end of 2003, the FDA had compiled scientic evidence it considered sucient to conclude that ephedra presented an unreasonable health risk.42 The FDA found \"little evidence of ephedra's eectiveness ex cept for short-term weight loss,\" and conrmed that ephedra raises blood pressure and stresses the circulatory system\u2014reactions which have been \"conclusively linked\" to signicant adverse events including heart ailments and strokes.43 On December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a consumer alert and letters to manufacturers of dietary supple - ments containing ephedrine alkaloids, indicating its intent to restrict sales of these products.44 FDA based its regulatory actions upon the standard of \"unreasonable risk,\" under which FDA's burden of proof \"is met when a product's risks outweigh its benets in light of the claims and directions for use in the product's labeling or, if the labeling is silent, under ordinary conditions of use.\"45 Almost ten years after the FDA issued its rst warning about adverse events associated with ephedra,46 the sale of dietary supplement products that contain ephedrine alkaloids was eectively banned nationwide as of April 12, 2004.47 The FDA announced that \"dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury when used according to product label instructions (or under conditions of ordinary use) and are therefore considered adulterated under Section 402(f)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\"48 The rule applied to all ephedra-containing dietary supplements, rather than to individual products or brands. The FDA announced that it could enforce the rule through a variety of actions including product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution of violators.49 In the years between the 1997 proposed rule and the 2004 nal rule, the FDA received numerous comments asserting the safety of ephedra as used in traditional Asian medicine.50 The nal regulation did not apply to ephedra used in most traditional Asian medicine preparations,51 since these products are not regulated as dietary supplements under federal law.52 The ephedra regulation represented the FDA's rst attempt to impose restrictions on the sale of a dietary supplement under DSHEA's regulatory framework.53 Without prescribed authority to ban products, the rule articulated a legal standard by which FDA could take actions against dietary supplements under current regula - tory restrictions.54 One year after the FDA's ephedra rule went into eect, a federal judge in Utah struck down at least part of the regulation. In Nutraceutical Corporation v. Crawford ,55 the U.S. District Court decided that the FDA had treated ephedra more like a drug or medical device than a dietary supplement; at least with respect to supple - ments containing low doses of ephedra, the FDA had exceeded its authority under DSHEA. In formulating the ephedra regulation, the FDA had considered a risk-benet analysis as a proper measure of DSHEA's \"unreasonable risk\" standard, and announced in the ephedra regulation: \"In the absence of a suf - cient benet, the presence of even a relatively small risk of an important adverse health eect to a user may be unreasonable.\" But the Nutraceutical court felt this risk-benet analysis \"places a burden on the producers . . . to demonstrate a benet as a precondition to sale, and that is contrary to Congress' intent [in DSHEA].\"56 In addition, the court found that the FDA had lumped together all ephedra supplements as posing an unreason - able risk of illness or injury under labeled or ordinary use, and that this broad restriction failed to give adequate consideration to low-dose ephedra supplements such as those sold by the plainti. The court \"remand[ed] to the FDA for further rulemaking\" consistent with the ruling. The media widely reported that the FDA ban had been struck down. But despite some words from excited manufacturers at the 19time of the Nutraceutical ruling,57 it appeared likely at the time this report went to press (in May 2005) that FDA restrictions would remain in place against sales of dietary supplements containing more than 10 milli - grams of ephedrine alkaloids.58 At press time, it remains unclear whether any ephedra products will return to store shelves.59 * * * Even before the FDA's ephedra restrictions were called into question, and with the ban on ephedra supple - ment sales in place, consumers continued to face dangers from other dietary supplements. The federal ephe - dra regulation increased the incentive for dietary supplement manufacturers to develop new ingredients and products, some of which may also pose signicant risks. Restrictions on ephedra caused dietary supplement manufacturers to reformulate many of their weight-loss supplements; some new formulations include bitter orange, which contains synephrine.60 The FDA is gathering data about the possible health impacts of a number of dietary supplements, including bitter orange, kava, usnic acid,61 and aristolochic acid.62 Concern about the risk of dietary supplements other than ephedra exists in other nations as well. Due to the popularity of alternative medicines in Germany, the German Commission E was established as part of the Sec - ond Medicines Act in 1978. The Act required \"scientic review of all medicines in the [German] pharmaceutical market, including conventional drugs, medicinal plants, and phytomedicines.\"63 Commission E was responsible for evaluating botanical medicines. Manufacturers of botanicals provided the Commission with product quality information; the safety and eectiveness of 380 ingredients were determined by thorough review of scientic literature.64 The Commission E monographs were rst published in English in 1998, with an expanded version published in 2000.65 Among other ingredients, the Commission did not approve Roman chamomile and yo - himbe because of safety concerns.66 Chaparral, comfrey, foxglove, and germander were classied as potentially unsafe.67 The Need for State Action Barriers to eective federal regulation of dietary supplements led state and county regulators to act in advance of federal restrictions on the sale of ephedra-based dietary supplements. New York State, in particular, was a leader in protecting its citizens from the risks of ephedra. Westchester County banned sales of ephedra-contain - ing dietary supplements to minors, and subsequently to all county residents.68 In February 2003, the Suolk County legislature enacted a ban on the sale to all consumers of dietary supplements containing ephedra; it was the rst legislation of its kind in the country.69 In the months that followed, Rockland County also banned sales of dietary supplements containing ephedra.70 Eective October 2003, Governor George E. Pataki mandated a statewide ban on dietary supplements containing ephedra, citing concern for the health and well-being of New Yorkers.71 The April 2005 Nutraceutical case xed a spotlight on the FDA's limited ability to regulate supplements. As discussed in chapter 4, the agency does not have the authority to require proof of safety before most dietary supplements are marketed or to demand adverse event reports after they are sold. Once a dietary supplement is on the market, the burden remains on the FDA to demonstrate that it poses an unreasonable health risk, rather than on the manufacturer to prove that it is safe. The overall regulatory picture suggests that the FDA may not be able to act swiftly and successfully to protect the public from other hazardous dietary supplements.20State-level action is necessary because of DSHEA's restrictions on federal oversight.72 Some states have taken preliminary steps toward regulation by imposing warning labels on ephedra-based supplements,73 or forbidding secondary school personnel from distributing dietary supplements to their students.74 Prior to the FDA regula - tion, Illinois and California, in addition to New York, banned the retail sale of ephedra supplements. However, these state actions have occurred largely in response to a specic dietary supplement hazard and do not address systemic gaps in the regulation of dietary supplements. DSHEA's limits on FDA are highlighted not only by the Nutraceutical decision, but also by the fact that it took FDA ten years to nalize a regulation before that court decision. Regardless of whether any ephedra regu - lation survives the Nutraceutical decision, the Task Force remains concerned that the system by which dietary supplements are regulated is flawed, and that there are insucient mechanisms at the federal level for protecting consumers from those dietary supplements that are unsafe. Therefore, states must be prepared to address ongo - ing health risks and regulatory issues regarding dietary supplements where fedreal law does not preempt them from doing so. A well-designed system for assessing and responding to new data and risk information regarding dietary supplements with authority clearly assigned to state-level agencies is needed. The Task Force strongly believes that the current regulatory structure for dietary supplements leaves New York consumers insuciently protected. The remainder of this report presents the evidence for this conclusion and proposes solutions. Chapter 2 reviews the denition of dietary supplements and reports on the extent and reasons for their use. Chapter 3 describes the benets and risks of dietary supplements and examines the data currently available in order to make these assessments. Chapter 4 covers the history of federal regulation of dietary supplements, while Chapter 5 addresses regulatory eorts made in New York, in other states, and by pri - vate organizations. Finally, Chapter 6 oers the Task Force recommendations for providing additional oversight of dietary supplements in New York State. Notes 1. Nutraceutical Corp. v.

The regulatory authority of states is discussed in Chapter 5. 73. See, e.g., additional labeling requirements on ephedra products in Texas Administrative Code (2002), Title 25, Part 1, Chapter 229, \u00a7 229.463. 74. See Michigan Compiled Laws, \u00a7 380.1317 (1)(a), (1)(b). Exceptions are provided for employees providing otherwise legal supplements to their own children, or providing supplements to students in activities entirely unrelated to school (and with whom the employee has no in-school contacts). Michigan Compiled Laws, \u00a7 380.1317 (2)(a), (2)(b).2425The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) denes dietary supplements as prod - ucts, not drugs, that are taken by mouth and contain an ingredient intended to supplement the diet.1 The dietary ingredient can be a vitamin, mineral, herb, amino acid, a substance used to increase total dietary intake (e.g., an enzyme), concentrate, metabolite, constituent, or extract. The ingredient can stand alone or be com - pounded to create a desired therapeutic eect. This denition is substantially broader than previous legal and commonly used denitions.2 Dietary supplements are produced in a variety of forms including teas, powders, tablets, capsules, tinctures, and oils. Vitamins are organic compounds that cannot be synthesized by the body, but are necessary for its proper functioning. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble3 and can be stored for the body's future use. Water soluble vitamins, including vitamins B and C,4 cannot be stored by the body and therefore need to be replenished through diet in order to avoid deciencies. Vitamin deciencies can interfere with metabolic processes and cause severe illness. For example, pellagra is the result of niacin (vitamin B3) deciency; scurvy is the result of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) deciency; beriberi is the result of thiamin (vitamin B1) deciency; and rickets can result from vitamin D deciency. Minerals are inorganic elements and salts extracted from the earth. The human body requires a substantial amount of the major minerals\u2014 calcium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and sulfur\u2014for healthy survival. The minerals\u2014 chromium, copper, fluoride, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc\u2014are needed in much smaller amounts. Like vitamins, minerals need to be acquired in the diet to avoid decien - cies such as anemia, which can result from insucient iron intake.2. Consumer Choice: Dietary Supplement Utilization A dietary supplement is dened as an ingested product, intended to supplement the diet, which bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: \u00b7 a vitamin; \u00b7 a mineral; \u00b7 an herb or other botanical; \u00b7 an amino acid; \u00b7 a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing total dietary intake; or \u00b7 a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described above. Source: United States Code (2003), Title 21, \u00a7 321 (ff)26Botanicals are referred to in a number of dierent ways, including herbal remedies, phytomedicines, and phy - topharmaceuticals.5 An herbal remedy is a plant or plant part (root, flower, leaf, fruit) that is used for its medicinal or therapeutic properties.6 The potency of herbal products can vary depending on each plant's growing conditions, level of maturity when harvested, and the processes used to dry and store each ingredient.7 Historically, approxi - mately 2,500 dierent herbs have been used for medicinal purposes.8 Other dietary supplement ingredients include amino acids, metabolites, and extracts. Amino acids are the constituents of proteins. Amino acids can be categorized into three groups: indispensable (essential), condition - ally indispensable, and dispensable (non-essential). Indispensable amino acids must be consumed in the diet.9 Conditionally indispensable amino acids10 can be synthesized by the human body under most conditions, but may require dietary supplementation under certain pathophysiological conditions, such as catabolic stress or neo - natal prematurity.11 Five amino acids are dispensable,12 meaning that they can be synthesized from other amino acids or complex metabolites. Metabolites are substances that are produced by metabolic action or are necessary for a metabolic process. An extract is a substance, usually a biologically active ingredient of plant or animal tissue, prepared by the use of solvents or evaporation to separate the substance from the original material. Prevalence Note: Inclusion in the following discussion does not constitute endorsement of particular dietary supplement prod - ucts or dietary supplement ingredients. An estimated 29,000 varieties of dietary supplements are on the market with 1,000 new products being introduced each year.13 Dietary supplements are sold in a variety of retail establishments. Because they are not considered drugs under federal or New York State law, no prescription is required to purchase or dispense di - etary supplements in New York, and they can be sold in health clubs, supermarkets, pharmacies, health food stores, and other retail establishments. As part of their practice, traditional Asian medicine and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers may dispense supplements. Thousands of dietary supplements are also available for purchase via the Internet. The online purchase of dietary supplements is particularly attractive to minors. A 2004 report estimated that 18 million children be - tween the ages of 12-17 years have used the Internet.14 Data from 2001 indicate that approximately 25 percent of teenagers using the Internet have searched for information about diet, exercise and general health.15 The same study revealed that approximately 14 percent of these teenagers lied about their age in order to access age-re - stricted web sites. The ability to bypass age-related safeguards and access products that are not intended for use by children is disconcerting and potentially dangerous. More than 100 million Americans use dietary supplements,16 spending $18.7 billion on them in 2002.17 Data on the consumption of dietary supplements vary widely. Inconsistent research indicates that as few as 3 percent and as many as 97 percent of Americans take dietary supplements on a regular basis.18 Other studies estimate that at least 30 percent of Americans use vitamin and mineral supplements regularly19 and approximately 33 percent use at least one nonvitamin and/or nonmineral supplement regularly.20 Among cancer patients, the use of \"unconventional\"21 medicines, including herbal therapies, has been reported to be as low as 5 percent22 and as high as 60 percent.2327Excluding industry surveys that are generally used for tracking and marketing purposes, national survey data do not provide a clearer estimate of the number of dietary supplement consumers. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)24 is a data collection system within the National Nutritional Monitoring and Related Research Program.25 It provides the best available data regarding individual consump - tion of foods and beverages in the United States. Historically, it placed little emphasis on the use of dietary supplements.26 However, the 1999-2004 survey (which at press time has not been released) included questions regarding the use of dietary supplements and laboratory tests for vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and D, selenium and eight dierent phytoestrogens.27 In 1999, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on the estimated preva - lence of dietary supplement use within the American population; results were stratied by various demo - graphic and descriptive characteristics.28 The study incorporated data from NHANES and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the years 1988-1994. The survey did not specically question use of herbs, amino acids, metabolites, or other biologic extracts; therefore, the prevalence of dietary supple - ment use may be underestimated.29 The report found that approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population use dietary supplements. Women are more likely than men to use dietary supplements and non-Hispanic whites are more likely to take dietary supplements than non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans.30 Several other studies also emphasize the high prevalence of dietary supplement use by women,31,32,33 and non- Hispanic whites.34,35,36 Based on data from 2002, the CDC released a report that provided a more comprehensive review of dietary supplement use in the United States. The report included a descriptive chart on the use of nonvitamin, nonmin - eral natural products and listed echinacea, ginseng, ginkgo, garlic, and glucosamine as the ve most frequently used dietary supplements.37 Rationale for Use Members of certain ethnic groups may rely on herbal remedies, that are available in the United States as dietary supplements, as part of their cultural tradition.38,39,40,41,42 For example, \"[herbal medicine] has been an integral part of Chinese culture and medical practice for nearly 1600 years.\"43 Many Hispanics also integrate herbal medicines with their reliance on conventional medical practitioners.44 In one study, Hispanics were more likely to grow their own herbs and more likely to obtain information on herbal use from a family member, sug - gesting that use of herbs is more integrated into cultural practices in this group than in non-Hispanic whites.45 Additionally, some Indian populations practice Ayurveda, a traditional medicine system46 with a \"a rich tradi - tion in plant pharmacotherapy.\"47 Consumers also use dietary supplements in their attempts to ensure general health and nutrition, improve athletic performance, enhance personal appearance, and to avoid the harmful or unpleasant side eects associat - ed with pharmaceuticals and other forms of conventional medical treatment.48,49 Herbal remedies, in particular, are taken for reasons other than nutrition.50 Some consumers will use supplements to treat benign self-limited conditions (e.g., echinacea for the common cold), while others will use them in an attempt to manage the symp - toms of serious and/or chronic illnesses (e.g., saw palmetto for benign prostatic hyperplasia or glucosamine for arthritis). 28Ensuring Health and Wellness American consumers often cite health promotion as a reason for using dietary supplements.51 In an eort to ward o infection, treat and prevent age-related eye diseases, including macular degeneration and cataracts, and to abate chronic ailments such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer, many people use antioxidants including vitamins A, C, and E, and the mineral selenium.52 By neutralizing free radicals, antioxidants, whether consumed individually or in a multivitamin compound, are thought to prevent cell damage.53 Specically, antioxidants are promoted to inhibit oxidation (which can exacerbate degenerative diseases)54 thus potentially reducing risk and alleviating symptoms of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Allicin, the chemical that gives garlic its distinctive odor and flavor, is also marketed as a medicinally active ingredient that promotes health and wellness. Crushed garlic bulb, oil, powder, and tablet supplements are used to lower blood pressure,55 to reduce cholesterol in an eort to abate cardiovascular risk,56 and to prevent athero - sclerosis.57 In Europe, garlic is approved as primary prevention of atherosclerosis and as an adjuvant treatment for high cholesterol.58 Ginkgo biloba is another commonly used dietary supplement in the United States59 that is approved as a medicine in Europe.60 In Germany, ginkgo is used to treat cerebral circulatory disturbances, reduced functional capacity, vertigo, and tinnitus.61 Germany has also approved ginkgo as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease based on claims of its ability to enhance memory. Americans use ginkgo biloba for a host of ailments including de - mentia, intermittent claudication, and macular degeneration. Improving Athletic Performance The use of \"sports supplements,\" including branch amino acids, choline, glutamine, l-carnitine, and whey protein, is very common at all levels of athletic competition.62 Athletes often use these supplements in an at - tempt to meet or exceed the nutritional demands of organized sports or competitive bodybuilding. Androstene - dione (andro)63 was once consumed as a dietary supplement until it was placed on the federal list of controlled substances along with other steroids and precursor compounds under the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004. Among the more popular sports supplements still available are creatine and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Creatine is a non-protein combination of three amino acids produced in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas to generate and release energy. Because creatine generates brief surges of energy and acts as a catalyst for muscle contractions, athletes believe it can enhance athletic performance.64 Common preparations include tablets and caplets, a powder that can be mixed with juice or water, and a concentrated solution. Creatine is also a common ingredient in energy bars and sports drinks. The FDA banned DHEA in the early 1980s, but as a result of DSHEA, it was reclassied as a dietary supple - ment in 1994. Once inside the body, DHEA is metabolized into other androgenic substances including andro - stenediol, androstenedione, and the steroid hormones estrogen and testosterone. Although not supported by evidence,65 DHEA manufacturers claim the supplements boost immunity, treat fatigue, strengthen bones, build muscle mass, reduce fat, and reduce injury recovery time. The supplements are available in capsules, chewing gum, or drops that are placed under the tongue. DHEA was specically excluded from the 2004 Anabolic Ste - roid Control Act.66 Some products purported to be \"sports supplements\" do not meet the DSHEA denition for dietary supple -29ments. One example is the synthetic steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), which gained notoriety in 2003 when the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) announced that a track-and-eld coach had reported that U.S. and international athletes were using an undetectable steroid. The USADA received a syringe contain - ing the substance, and forwarded it to a laboratory at the University of California at Los Angeles.67 Chemical testing of the contents of the syringe revealed THG, whose chemical structure resembles that of other banned steroids.68 Shortly after, the FDA disputed THG's status as a dietary supplement. The FDA announced that \"purveyors of THG may represent it as a dietary supplement, [but] in fact it does not meet the dietary supplement deni - tion\" and is instead a \"purely synthetic 'designer' steroid derived by simple chemical modication, from another [USADA-banned] anabolic steroid.\"69 The FDA also announced that it considered THG to be an \"unapproved new drug that cannot be legally marketed without meeting the agency's approval standards,\" that it had \"little knowledge of THG's safety,\" and that \"its structure and relationship to better known products leads the FDA to believe that its use may pose considerable health risks.\"70 THG is now banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), whose list of prohibited substances is used by the USADA and the International Olympic Committee.71 THG was included among the steroid precursor compounds added to the federal list of controlled substances under the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004. Enhancing Personal Appearance Modern high-fat, high-calorie diets combined with physical inactivity have contributed to the epidemic of overweight and obesity in America. Based on 1999-2002 national data, approximately 65 percent of U.S. adults are either overweight or obese.72 In 2002, 57 percent of New York State adults were overweight or obese.73 Evidence indicates that higher levels of body weight and body fat are associated with an increased risk for the development of numerous adverse health consequences, including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, osteo - arthritis, sleep apnea, psychiatric disorders (mainly depression and anxiety), and stroke.74 Seeking to avoid these ill health eects and to enhance their personal appearance, Americans spend $30 billion per year on weight loss aids including dietary supplements.75 Prior to the federal regulation of ephedra in April 2004, it was estimated that approximately 2 million adults took ephedra-containing weight loss products daily.76 In anticipation of the regulation, many manufacturers created \"ephedra-free\" supplements that are promoted to enhance weight loss without harmful side eects. The most popular \"replacement\" ingredient in these products is citrus aurantium, also called bitter orange. Many major manufacturers of ephedra-containing products, including New York-based rms,77 now sell weight loss products that include bitter orange.78 However, bitter orange contains synephrine, which, like the ephedrine alkaloids, increases blood pressure and increases the risk of cardiovascular events.79 In addition, bitter orange contains compounds that inhibit metabolic processes and can increase the blood levels of many drugs.80 Chitin/chitosan and chromium are also common ingredients in dietary supplement weight loss products. Chitin is a dietary ber derived from the shells of crab, shrimp, and lobster. Chitin molecules have the ability to latch on to heavy metals, amino acids, and fat through chelation.81 This may enable chitin to capture fat before the body is able to absorb it. Chitosan is a synthetic version of chitin, that is also promoted and consumed for 30body weight reduction.82,83 Chromium is an essential trace mineral required for sugar metabolism.84 Reported eects include increases in basal metabolic rate and lean body mass and a decrease in body fat percentage.85 The most popular formulation, chromium picolinate, is marketed as a \"fat burner\" and is available in pills, chewing gum, sports drinks, and nutrition bars.86 Avoiding Pharmaceuticals The use of dietary supplements is common among people with chronic and/or recurrent conditions87 including arthri - tis, chronic back pain, or other musculoskeletal pain.88 Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in America and is the leading cause of pain and disability, including lost time from work.89 An estimated 21 million Americans suer from osteoarthritis, a number expected to grow due to the aging of the population and high rate of obesity.90 Osteoarthritis suerers often take dietary supplements in combination with or instead of prescription anti- inflammatory medications. Patients use dietary supplements hoping to relieve pain while avoiding the gastro - intestinal side eects common to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The most commonly used \"anti-arthritic\" supplements are chondroitin and glucosamine. Consumers can take either supplement as a stand-alone therapy, but most often use a combination product. According to Information Resources Inc.,91 total glucosamine and chondroitin sales were $274 million between January 5, 2002 and January 5, 2003.92 Chondroitin is a naturally occurring compound found in mammalian cartilage, 93 bone, cornea, skin, and the arterial wall. It promotes and maintains the structure and function of cartilage. It is marketed to oer pain relief of osteoarthritic joints and to have anti-inflammatory properties.94 Glucosamine is essential for the construction of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in articular cartilage; reduced GAG content corresponds with the severity of osteoarthritis.95 Therefore supplementation may be benecial. * * * Several factors contribute to the increasing consumption of dietary supplements in America.96 Consumers are drawn to dietary supplements because of their nonprescription status, direct-to-consumer advertising, and the per - ception that natural products are inherently safe.97 Additionally, widespread media attention to dietary supplements sends the public the message that they can self-medicate for many conditions.98 Unfortunately, most Americans have misconceptions about the regulation of dietary supplements, believing that supplements must be approved by a government agency, that manufacturers can make claims about safety and eectiveness only if there is solid scientic evidence to support them, and that warnings about potential side eects or dangers are required.99 On its consumer website, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine advises those seeking information on dietary supplements to speak to their health care provider, consult a dietitian or pharma - cist, or to conduct their own research on the supplement they are interested in.100 This advice is also endorsed on the FDA website.101 In theory, it is good advice. However, in practice, some physicians receive only limited train - ing in clinical nutrition102 or complementary and alternative medicine.103 And, the majority of dietitians perceive themselves as having little or no knowledge regarding herbal supplements.104 Therefore, conventional medicine practitioners may lack the information necessary to eectively discuss the use of dietary supplements with their patients. There is also widespread skepticism about the proliferation of complementary and alternative medicine practices among conventionally trained practitioners, with deciencies of evidence as the predominant reason cited.105,106,107,108 31Additionally, consumers may not be adequately or accurately researching the dietary supplements they are considering using. Searches for health information are one of the most common reasons that consumers use the Internet; specically, \"80 percent of American Internet users have searched for information on at least one major health topic online.\"109 Unfortunately, evidence indicates that most consumers never check \"About Us\" sections of websites, never try to identify the authors or owners of the site, and never read disclaimers or dis - closure statements when they are available.110 These oversights are especially risky for current and prospective dietary supplement consumers because the quality of website information varies and many sites are aliated with manufacturers or paired with online order catalogs.111 In addition, the Federal T rade Commission has taken legal action against a number of websites that contain incorrect and deceptive information.112 * * * In summary, as dened by DSHEA, dietary supplements may be vitamins, minerals, amino acids, botanicals, me - tabolites, or extracts. Using dietary supplements for health and wellness, improving athletic performance, enhancing personal appearance, and as a substitute for pharmaceuticals, most consumers are misinformed about the regulation, safety, and eectiveness of dietary supplements. Dependent on the limited training of physicians on CAM and clinical nutrition, along with unreliable Internet information, most consumers have misconceptions about the risks associated with dietary supplement use. As discussed in Chapter 3, these misconceptions may have dangerous consequences. Notes 1. Public Law No. 103-417 (October 25, 1994), codied throughout U. S.

National Center for Complementary and Alternative \"Herbal Supplements: Consider Safety, Too,\" website: http://nccam.nci.nih. gov/health/supplement-safety/ 2005. B for specic examples.35Recognizing that the word \"natural\" is not synonymous with, or necessarily correlated with, the word \"safe\" is important when considering dietary supplement use. Although established pharmaceutical and nutrition companies manufacture some dietary supplements, the industry is largely unregulated and nonstandardized. Some critics believe that there exist manufacturers that comprise \"a signicant section of the industry that is willing to take advantage of the unregulated environment and take chances with public health in order to make [money].\"1 Further, credible scientic knowledge about the ecacy and safety of many readily available dietary supple - ments is inadequate. Because there is no regulatory requirement for dietary supplement manufacturers to perform pre-market clinical studies, formal research on the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements is uncommon. Some manufacturers and consumers mistakenly consider historical use as a proxy measure of the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements, especially for herbal remedies that have been used for hundreds of years. How - ever, reliance on historical use as a measure of safety is problematic for several reasons. First, herbal treatments vary widely in the concentration of active ingredients from one preparation to another; assumptions about safety based on one preparation may not apply to another. For example, the discovery of wide fluctuations in potency and risk helped determine the safe use of foxglove for digitalis preparations.2 Second, side eects that develop slowly may be especially dicult for practitioners to link causally to particu - lar herbal remedies, especially when multiple herbs are used over time or in a single preparation. For instance, the severe liver damage that can result from kava use may develop over many months.3 Third, while traditional healers may have extensive knowledge about which parts of plants to use in which ways, and when and where to harvest them,4 this knowledge may be lost in the transition of a remedy from tra - ditional settings to the modern context; for example dierent plants or parts of plants may be substituted with dangerous eects. In one noted case, Belgian physicians decided to add a plant named han fang ji (stephania tetrandra) to their clients' regimens. However, their suppliers substituted a plant named guang fang ji (aristolo - chia fangchi), resulting in more than 100 cases of renal failure, requiring dialysis and/or kidney transplant.5 Fourth, patterns of current use may dier greatly from traditional use. For instance, ephedra was tradition - ally used for short-term symptom management, such as nasal congestion associated with colds and the flu. Contemporary practice has included longer-term use, for instance as a tool for weight loss, and therefore may carry greater risks.6 Finally, genetic dierences may explain the ability of one group to tolerate a particular substance, though it may pose greater risks to another group or to the general population. Risks associated with alcohol, for instance, are varied for dierent genetic sub-groups of the population.7 Similarly, genetic dierences in the liver's ability to metabolize kava may increase its toxicity for some consumers.83. Safety: The Benefits and Risks of Dietary Supplements36Not all dietary supplements can claim a long history of use, and for these products even less may be known about safety. Many dietary supplements have been developed in recent years. Evidence of the safety and ecacy of prod - ucts now on the market is inadequate and not likely to improve under current regulations.9 Evidence The existing literature on many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices, including dietary supplement use, is of highly variable quality.10,11,12 For the purpose of this report, primary evidence includes only original research with valid data collection that results in peer-reviewed published articles. Secondary evidence includes review articles, compilations, and opinion pieces based on primary evidence. Although a substantial amount of secondary evidence on the use, safety, and ecacy of dietary supplements is available, there is a dearth of primary evidence. Among the obstacles to obtaining useful primary evidence on dietary supplements are poorly designed trials, diculty retrieving quality literature, and the impracticability of using an evidence- based approach to evaluate available studies.13 Primary Evidence There are several limitations and methodological flaws in the available literature including insucient sta - tistical power, sampling errors, absence of control groups, and incomplete reporting.14,15,16,17 A review of almost 3,000 clinical trials of T raditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) found major methodological flaws in most stud - ies.18 Specically, the method of randomization was often insuciently described, blinding was rarely used, and only a few studies had adequate sample sizes. Further, eectiveness was rarely quantied or reported, and over half the studies did not report data on baseline characteristics or on side eects. However, most trials claimed that the tested treatments were eective, indicating that publication bias may be common.19 Many studies on dietary supplements are designed to assess benecial eects and thus do not provide com - plete safety information.20 And, although there is agreement that dietary supplements should be evaluated in light of present knowledge of pharmaceutical sciences and medicinal chemistry,21 there is a widespread lack of interest in herb-drug interactions within the pharmaceutical and herbal industries.22 The lack of research can also be ascribed to limited funding for clinical trials.23 Secondary Evidence Several sources of secondary evidence are available for evaluating dietary supplements.24 Unfortunately, sys - tematic reviews and meta-analyses provide little information on the safety of dietary supplement products aside from repeating the adverse events recorded in primary research.25 Among the leading sources of information are the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Sup - plements (IBIDS) database, the Cochrane Library, and the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database. IBIDS is compiled by the Oce of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health and oers access to cita - tions and abstracts from international scientic literature.26 The Cochrane Library is a collection of evidence- based medicine databases that includes the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.27 Cochrane reviews are considered to be extremely rigorous and they have been favorably compared with systematic reviews published 37in medical journals.28 Reviews on dietary supplements such as kava, glucosamine, and garlic are included in the Cochrane Library. The Natural Medicine Comprehensive Database contains over 1,000 monographs detailing the potential safety and ecacy of individual dietary supplements.29 Additionally, the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) organization has published the PDR for Herbal Medi - cines (First edition 1998, Second edition 2000), the PDR for Nutritional Supplements (First edition 2001), and the PDR for Nonprescription Drugs and Dietary Supplements (2004). These reference books include informa - tion on the indications, usage, and risks associated with many commonly used dietary supplements. In 2005, at the request of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published a framework for assessing dietary supplement safety.30 The framework includes a process for critically reviewing available scientic evidence and properly evaluating the benets and/or risks of particular supple - ments. Guiding Principles for Evaluating Dietary Supplement Risk: \u00b7 Absence of evidence of risk does not indicate absence of risk. \u00b7 Proof of causality or proof of harm is not necessary to determine risk. \u00b7 Integration of data across different categories of information and types of study design can enhance biological plausibility and identify consistencies, leading to conclusions regarding level of risk. Adapted from: Institute of Medicine, Dietary Supplements: A Framework for Evaluating Safety (Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 2005) Potential Benets A number of dietary supplements have benecial health eects that are substantiated by scientic evidence. For example, researchers agree that during the rst weeks of pregnancy, folic acid in higher doses than typically consumed by diet alone has benecial fetal health eects.31 Therefore, to prevent neural tube defects including spina bida, the U.S. Public Health Service recommends 400 micrograms of supplemental folic acid daily for all women of childbearing age.32 The New York State Department of Health advises all women, including young girls, to either consume a 400 microgram supplement or eat fortied food daily.33 Since January 1, 1998, all flour and uncooked cereal grains in the United States have been supplemented with 140 micrograms of folate per 100 grams of flour.34 For people that do not consume a variety of foods, selected dietary supplements, including vitamins and minerals, can be taken to ensure adequate consumption of required nutrients. For example, physicians may recommend supplements for elderly patients that are fatigued due to low iron levels.35 Also, because vitamin D deciency is common among older people, experts recommend that all older adults routinely take vitamin D supplements.36 It is important to note that some, but not all dietary supplement use correlates to decient dietary intakes.37 As discussed in Chapter 2, consumers use dietary supplements for a variety of reasons ranging from weight loss to pain management. Information on the benets and risks of these supplements is often unavailable or incon -38clusive. The lack of evidence of harm does not necessarily indicate that a dietary supplement is safe but rather that there is no evidence to the contrary.38 An example of a dietary supplement for which there is no known evidence of harm is saw palmetto.39 Saw palmetto is the most commonly used herbal supplement for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hy - perplasia (BPH).40 BPH is the non-cancerous overgrowth of the prostate that aects up to one-third of men in the fth decade of life and about half of men in the seventh decade of life.41 T reatment options for BPH include medication, surgery, and dietary supplements. Prescription drugs provide some relief for some patients but are associated with the risk of diminished sex drive. Because nerves surround the prostate, surgical procedures are associated with increased risk of impotence and incontinence.42 Saw palmetto supplements are eective in reducing the diculties associated with prostate enlargement,43 including urinary flow44,45,46 and excessive night - time urination,47,48 but they do not reduce glandular enlargement. Other dietary supplements are known to have side eects that are comparable to those posed by non-pre - scription and over-the-counter drugs. A variety of dietary supplements fall into this category including phytoes - trogens that are used to prevent and treat the symptoms of menopause. In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative, an eight-year study of the eects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in menopausal women, was halted after ve years because researchers detected an increased risk of breast cancer and coronary heart disease among the participants taking a combination of estrogen and progestin. The American Medical Association advised its members of alternatives to oer their patients including phytoestrogens.49 Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that act similarly to human estrogen, though they are generally less potent and have fewer and less severe side eects. The three classes of phytoestrogens are isoflavones, coumestans, and lignans. High concentrations of each are found in legumes such as soybeans and chickpeas. Additionally, several pharmaceutical companies manufacture and/or distribute phytoestrogen-based products to supplement the diet.50 One such product is red clover, which contains the isoflavones genistein, daidzen, biochanin A, and for - mononetin. Genistein has the greatest bioactivity of all of the isoflavones.51 Red clover has therefore been used to reduce menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and mood swings. It may also aid in the maintenance of bone density in the lower spine of menopausal and perimenopausal women,52 and has been associated with a signicant increase in the cortical bone of the radius and ulna.53 The phytoestrogen black cohosh may be an eective treatment for some symptoms of menopause includ - ing palpitations and hot flashes.54 Therefore, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists added black cohosh to its published clinical practice guidelines for the short-term (six months or less) treatment of vasomotor symptoms.55 Black cohosh is approved in Germany as a treatment for dysmenorrhea, premenstrual discomfort, and other menopausal symptoms including irritability, nervousness, sleep disturbances, vertigo, sweating, tinnitus, and depression.56 Black cohosh interacts with hormones to produce an estrogen-like eect, which may decrease certain meno - pausal symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats, and psychological disturbances.57,58 In 2000 black cohosh generated $6 million in U.S. sales.59 Black cohosh preparations have shown a low incidence of adverse side eects, which have included stomach discomfort, headache,60 heaviness of the legs, and weight changes.61 Long-term safety data on black cohosh are not available. 39Potential Risks The FDA does not evaluate the safety, ecacy or quality of dietary supplement ingredients or products. Therefore, consumers, who often assume that \"natural\" is synonymous with \"safe\" may be taking dietary sup - plements at their own risk. Mega-dosing, delaying conventional medical treatment, the concomitant use of supplements and pharmaceuticals, and contraindicated use are potential risks associated with popular dietary supplements. And, because dietary supplements are not subject to standardized quality control measures, con- tamination, adulteration, and dosage inconsistency are common. Another potential risk is the increasing use of dietary supplements by children. Additionally, there are other dietary supplement ingredients and products that for various reasons, including their inherent toxicity, should be considered unsafe. Mega-dosing A concern with all dietary supplements, even those that are not known to be harmful, is the consumer misperception that \"if a little is a good, more has to be better.\"62 This mega-dosing of even \"safe\" dietary supple - ments can cause toxic eects. Adverse eects of consuming excessive calcium may include high blood calcium levels, kidney stone formation and kidney complications.63 Chronic and acute hypervitaminosis A, or vitamin A overdose, can be poisonous. Chronic hypervitaminosis A can lead to bone and skin alterations, can cause liver abnormalities, and can have adverse eects on the central nervous system.64 Symptoms of acute hypervitamin - osis A include nausea, vomiting, headache, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, vertigo, blurred vision, and lack of muscular coordination.65 Excessive vitamin D intake has been linked to hypercalcemia.66 Delay of Care Some dietary supplement use bears the risk of delaying necessary and eective conventional medical treat - ment. For many people this delay may exacerbate their disease. For instance, sexually transmitted diseases such as the human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus II require treatment by a physician. Although visible manifestations of these diseases may dissipate, signicant internal complications may remain, and must be treated. For instance, certain strains of HPV are linked to cervical and vulvar cancer.67 Herpes is associated with cervical cancer and encephalitis.68 Herpes infection of pregnant women can lead to neonatal infection, causing meningitis and other serious complications, including death.69 The dietary supplement beta-mannan, an aloe-based pill, has been marketed as a treatment for both herpes and HPV.70 Clinical trials are inconclusive regarding the ecacy of oral or topical aloe vera for herpes.71 Fix-It Oral Antiviral is another dietary supplement that claims to heal and suppress herpes outbreaks.72 Fix-It supple - ments contain over 20 ingredients including dextran sulfate, pentosane polysulfate, chondroitin sulfate, heparin sulfate, glucosamine 6-sulfate, echinacea, and elderberries.73 None of these ingredients is part of the standard treatment of these diseases.74 Because of the stigma associated with sexually transmitted diseases, those infected may be particularly susceptible to promises about treatments that do not require a doctor's visit. However, time spent using ineective treatment increases the potential risk to this group, to their sexual partners, and to the ospring of infected women.40Concomitant Use Millions of people (an estimated 18.4 percent of prescription drug users75,76) take conventional medications concurrently with herbal supplements or high dose vitamins.77 Specically, one in six patients taking prescription drugs also takes one or more herbal or other dietary supplement.78 As described in further detail in Appendix A, dietary supplements can interact with a number of common prescription and over-the-counter medications. Interactions between dietary supplements and pharmaceutical drugs can be classied as either pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic. Pharmacokinetic interactions interfere with the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs; pharmacodynamic interactions alter the pharmacological activity of drugs.79 The risk of interactions is especially high among the elderly because older people take more medications than younger people do80 and because adults over age 60 are the most likely to take more than one dietary supplement.81 Examples of supplements that interact with drugs include valerian, which should not be used concomitantly with barbiturates because of the risk of excessive sedation, and ginseng, which may aect blood glucose levels and should be avoided by patients with diabetes mellitus.82 The concomitant use of St. John's wort or calcium with prescription medications can also cause signicant harm. Hypericin, the active ingredient in St. John's wort, is a prescription medicine in Germany83 that is used for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Its alleged antidepressive eect may be due to the ability of the herb to inhibit re-uptake of serotonin and other neurotransmitters.84 St. John's wort interferes with the therapeutic mechanisms of a variety of pharmaceutical drugs including irinotecan (an anti-tumor drug), oral contraceptives, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (anti-hypertensives). These interactions can have serious consequences. For example, the herb can decrease the plasma concentration of cyclosporine levels in organ transplant patients,86 thus endangering the success of the transplant.87 Calcium, an essential mineral, is the major constituent of bones and teeth. It is required for many physiologic activities including muscle contraction, nerve conduction, heartbeat, and blood coagulation. Calcium is gener - ally obtained through the diet. Insucient calcium intake contributes to reduced bone mass and is a risk factor for osteoporosis.88 Though generally considered a benecial addition to the diet, calcium can interfere with the pharmacokinet - ics of a number of prescription medications. Orange juice fortied with calcium can decrease the eectiveness of certain antibiotics including ciprofloxacin. The absorption of other quinolone antibiotics, including gatifloxacin and levofloxacin, may also be impacted by excess calcium.89 Pharmaceutical manufacturers have issued warnings that these medications should not be taken in conjunction with calcium supplements or food products enriched with calcium. For example, the label on the ciprofloxacin bottle states that the drugs should not be taken with milk or calcium-fortied juices. The interactions caused by concomitant use can often be avoided if patients discuss their supplement use with their conventional medicine practitioners. However, a seminal study estimated that 70 percent of patients do not reveal their herbal remedy use to physicians or pharmacists.90 Unfortunately, even when they do report their supplement use, some patients cannot accurately describe the ingredients or dosage because products con - taining the same herb often dier in potency, composition and labeling.91 Patients bear only part of the responsibility for discussing dietary supplement use. Despite increased public awareness and government interest, many physicians do not ask their patients about their use of dietary supple -41ments.92,93 When patients report their dietary supplement use, practitioners should be aware that the supple - ments \"may be bona de herbal extracts, may be potent pharmaceuticals packaged to resemble herbal extracts, may be herbal extracts adulterated purposely with pharmaceuticals or unintentionally containing heavy metals, or may not be herbal extracts at all.\"94 Many factors hinder eective doctor-patient conversations regarding dietary supplement utilization. As discussed earlier in this chapter, the literature supporting or refuting the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements is evolving. Neither patient nor practitioner may be fully aware of the current state of evidence. Also, because of wide variations in product labeling, neither may be fully aware of what has actually been ingested.95 Contraindication Contraindication refers to any symptom or condition that renders the consumption of a dietary supplement inadvisable for a specic person or group of people. For example, with few exceptions, including folic acid, dietary supplement use is generally not advised during pregnancy because little is known about the placental transmission of most supplements. A number of dietary supplements are also contraindicated for surgical patients. Morbidity and mortality associ - ated with herbal medications, including heart attack, stroke, and excessive bleeding, may be more likely during the perioperative period96 because of the potential eects of supplements on the cardiovascular and immune systems, wound healing and drug dosing.97 Echinacea, ephedra, garlic, ginkgo, ginseng, kava, St. John's wort, and valerian are commonly used herbal supplements that are known to pose a risk during the perioperative period.98 Contamination Contamination can occur at any point in the production cycle of a dietary supplement. Pesticides, herbi - cides, heavy metals, and bacteria absorbed from groundwater and soil can pollute raw materials. The chemical processes used to extract minerals from rocks and ore can contaminate them,99 and the processes used to extract and combine active ingredients can contaminate herbs. Heavy metal contaminants including lead, arsenic, and mercury have been found in Ayurvedic herbal medicines100 and other dietary supplement products.101 Addition - ally, the level of manganese in some dietary supplements exceeds the government recommendation for safe consumption of the element.102 Dietary supplement products are often compounds of ingredients including herbs, minerals, and animal sub - stances that can augment or attenuate each other's eects. These combinations can lead to adverse health eects. For example, in 1989, a combination sleep aid product containing L-tryptophan was linked to an epidemic of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a potentially fatal, systemic connective tissue disorder characterized by severe muscle pain, tenosynovitus, edema, skin rash, and neuromuscular disorders. It was the most serious outbreak to date of illness and death caused by a dietary supplement, with 1,500 cases of EMS, including 37 deaths being reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).103 Initial reports suggested that specic L-tryptophan products were contaminated, but additional evidence indicated that it might have been the ingredient L-tryptophan itself that caused or contributed to the development of EMS.104 As a result, the FDA \"[could not] determine that oral dosage forms of [L-tryptophan] and related compounds ... can be safely used as dietary supplements.\"10542Adulteration Adulteration is the intentional addition of undeclared herbs or drugs to dietary supplements. Adulterants are often used to enhance, if not produce, the claimed eect of the product.106 One of the most egregious cases of adulteration involved two supplements manufactured by BotanicLab of California. BotanicLab marketed the supplements PC-SPES and SPES to treat prostate cancer and bolster the immune system. Approximately 10,000 men with prostate cancer used PC-SPES in 2002.107 PC-SPES lots manufactured between 1996 and mid-2001 were adulterated with diethylstilbestrol (DES), a potent synthetic estrogenic drug, and the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin.108 DES was once prescribed to prevent miscarriages but in 1971 it was linked to birth defects and the FDA cautioned against its use and added strong warning labels.109 DES is linked to increased risk of illness in both the mothers who took it and the children they were carrying. Research indicates that mothers have an increased risk of breast cancer, daughters are at increased risk of clear cell adenocarcinoma and infertility, and sons are at increased risk of non-cancerous epididymal cysts.110 In February 2002, after conducting an investigation, the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services, conrmed that PC-SPES and SPES were adulterated with \"undeclared prescription drug in - gredients\" and warned consumers to stop using the dietary supplements.111 Lots of PC-SPES contained the antico - agulant (xanax). BotanicLab voluntarily issued a nationwide recall.112 Dosage Inconsistency Although the therapeutic eect of dietary supplements depends on their potency, there are no federal stan - dards for dosage and purity, and the dose-nding studies that are mandatory for pharmaceuticals are rarely, if ever, performed. For many products, active ingredients have not been identied and the quantity needed to derive an eect has not been determined.113 Inferior manufacturing practices can lead to inaccuracies in product labeling (products may actually contain greater or lesser amounts of ingredients listed on their label)114 and the concentrations of active ingredients can vary among and within brands. Consumers may not know how much of any particular ingredient they consume. Dietary supplement manufacturers are not legally required to use any standardization processes to ensure batch consistency of their products, nor is there any legal or regulatory denition for dietary supplement stan - dardization.115 Private scientic bodies including the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)116 have attempted to standardize the active ingredient concentration of some dietary supplements. After \"an exhaustive study of the available data on amino acids\" FASEB found insucient evidence to establish a safe intake level for amino acids in dietary supplements, and concluded that \"their safety should not be as - sumed.\"117 FASEB has also conducted studies on ginkgo biloba extract and chromium picolinate. Use by Children Although dietary supplements are not necessary for most healthy children who consume a variety of foods,118 \"many pediatric patients, especially those with chronic or recurrent conditions, use dietary supplements.\"119 These supplements are marketed for a host of childhood ailments ranging from ear infections to upper respira - tory infections.120 43With only 45 percent121 of caregivers discussing their child's use of dietary supplements with their conventional health care provider, pediatricians are often unaware that their patients are taking dietary supplements. This lack of communication puts children at risk because dietary supplement marketing can exacerbate parents' fears re - garding pharmaceuticals and lure them away from traditional medical care. Because it is not legally required, most dietary supplements have not been tested for safety or ecacy in children.122 There are no dosage guidelines for the administration of dietary supplements to children; therefore, appropriate dosage may be dicult to ascertain. The dosage levels of most dietary supplements are generally set for adult usage, with many children's dosages expressed as fractions of an adult dose. The absorption, distribu - tion, metabolism and excretion of dietary supplements dier in children and adults. In addition, \"children may be particularly susceptible to the eects of dosing variations [because] of their smaller size and dierent capacity for detoxifying chemicals.\"123 Dietary supplement use by children, whether caregiver directed or self-initiated, can be classied in three categories: 1) to derive a health benet; 2) to enhance physical appearance or athletic performance and; 3) use as alternatives to illegal substances. Health Benet Echinacea and chamomile, both used for respiratory disturbances, were the most frequently used herbs in a 2001 study of patients seen in the pediatric emergency department at the New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn.124 They were also the most commonly used among pediatric surgical patients at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.125 Echinacea, which is \"not eective in shortening the duration or decreasing the severity of upper respiratory infections in children,\"126 has been linked to anaphylaxis,127 rash, and sudden onset of stridor.128 Chamomile, which may be eective in calming infantile colic,129 can cause anaphylaxis in children allergic to ragweed.130,131 In a study of pediatric cancer patients, dietary supplements, including antioxidant vitamins, were commonly used to prevent and treat non-cancerous conditions such as cold and flu. This adjuvant use could be dangerous because \" antioxidants, such as Vitamins C and E, can reduce the eectiveness of chemotherapy [and because] children receiving anti-cancer medications\u2014including cisplatin and anthracyclines\u2014are especially susceptible to cardiac, neurological, and renal impairment. \"132 The concomitant use of dietary supplements can exacerbate these complications. Enhancing Physical Appearance or Athletic Performance In one study American adolescents reported a higher prevalence of overweight than any of the European countries or Israel.133 Consequences of overweight in childhood are often psychosocial.134,135 \"The most immedi - ate consequence of overweight, as perceived by children themselves, is social discrimination.\"136 Physical eects include cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and abnormal glucose toler - ance.137 It is not clear which weight loss interventions are the most eective for children,138 but many parents are supplementing or replacing food-portion control and exercise with dietary supplements. Additionally, adoles - cents with eating disorders frequently use herbal supplements to control their weight.13944PediaLoss was a weight loss supplement marketed exclusively for children. Advertisements for PediaLoss claimed that \"children can enjoy their favorite foods but with slower absorption of carbohydrates and faster and safer fat burning without using stimulants.\"140 In 2004, the Federal T rade Commission (FTC) led a complaint stating that the manufacturer of PediaLoss \"did not possess or rely upon a reasonable basis\" when making these claims.141 The Skinny Pill for Kids, another weight loss supplement marketed for children ages 6 to 12, contained nia - cin and a mixture of herb diuretics including uva-ursi, juniper berry, and buchu leaf.142 When taken as recom - mended, the Skinny Pill for Kids provided four times the upper limit of niacin recommended for daily ingestion by an eight-year-old.143 Additionally, the PDR for Herbal Medicine lists uva-ursi as contraindicated for use by children under the age of 12.144 In January 2004, the FTC led a complaint in federal district court alleging that \"the scientic research to establish that use of the Skinny Pill for Kids causes weight loss in, or is safe for, children 6 to 12 years old is false.\"145 The use of dietary supplements to enhance athletic performance is also common among adolescent146,147 and college-aged student athletes.148,149,150 By using supplements, many athletes believe they can gain a competitive advantage without the consequences associated with anabolic steroids or steroid precursors. Creatine monohydrate ( creatine) is one of the most popular dietary supplements used by male and female college athletes.151,152 In 2004 approximately 28-41 percent of student athletes at National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) institutions used creatine.153 These athletes use creatine to increase their overall strength and to enhance their ability to complete intense work-out repetitions.154 Although most dietary supplements are not illegal, high school and collegiate athletic associations discourage the use of some products and ingredients. The National Federation of State High School Associations warns coaches and school sta not to recommend or distribute any supplements to athletes, and lists creatine as a harmful substance.155 The supplements bitter orange (citrus aurantium), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and human growth hormone (HgH) are all included in the 2004-2005 NCAA Banned-Drug Classes list.156 Alternatives to Illicit Substances Some adolescents use dietary supplements as alternatives to illicit substances. Although these alternatives \"cannot meet the legal denition of a dietary supplement because they are not intended to supplement the diet, promote health or reduce the risk of disease,\"157 some manufacturers market herbal products as safe sources of a natural high or euphoric feeling. \"Adolescents and young adults are particularly easy targets for such promo - tional tactics.\"158 Though not illegal, these substances can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behavior and are therefore considered particularly dangerous for minors. Legal herbal supplements have been marketed as alternatives for illegal drugs such as gamma-hydroxybutyr - ate (GHB) and methamphetamine and as alternatives for other intoxicating substances including sedatives and barbiturates. The Partnership for a Drug Free America denes herbal ecstasy as a combination of herbs that are legal, inexpensive, and marketed as a natural high.159 One \"legal high\" retailer includes alternatives to speed, mushrooms, and opium among their top ten best sellers.16045Unsafe Supplements The National Toxicology Program (NTP) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services161 selects herbs and active or toxic ingredients found in some herbs for study. These studies focus on characteriza - tion of potential adverse health eects, including reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, and immunotoxicity, as well as those associated with acute high dose exposure and chronic exposure to lower doses. Studies also look for possible herb/herb and herb/drug interactions and contraindications such as age and pregnancy. Among other supplements, the NTP has studied androstenedione, black cohosh, echinacea purpurea, ginkgo biloba extract, ginseng, and kava extract. For reasons other than inherent toxicity, the FDA has taken action against a number of supplement products and ingredients that it deemed hazardous to the public's health. For example, the FDA has issued health warn - ings on liver damage associated with use of the herbal supplements chaparral and germander; kidney failure, seizures and deaths associated with use of yohimbe; and the negative eects of lobelia on the autonomic system.162 Union163 listed chaparral, germander, yohimbe, and lobelia on its list of 12 read - ily available, unsafe supplements that consumers are urged to avoid.164 The list also included aristolochic acid, kava and comfrey, which have long been under FDA scrutiny. Aristolochic acid is found in all members of the aristolochia family of botanicals. Aristolochia plants and plant parts are often used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines. Often, because the Chinese names for dierent plants are similar, Aristolochia plants are substituted for other plants including stephania. As indicated below, the substitution can have dangerous consequences. More than 100 people who consumed aristolochic acid in a Belgian weight-loss clinic between 1990- 1992 experienced nephropathy. At least 70 clients required renal transplant.165 Later research also con - rmed 18 cases of urothelial cancer.166 In the United Kingdom in 1999, two aristolochic acid consumers who were ingesting the supplement to treat eczema experienced \"Chinese herb nephropathy\" and required renal transplant.167 In 2000, the French Medical Products Safety Agency reported one case of conrmed urothelial cancer, one case of suspected urothelial cancer, and the presence of lymphoma on a graft in consumers of aristolo - chic acid.168 The FDA issued a warning letter to the dietary supplement industry in May 2000 after receiving reports on life-threatening adverse events. Citing carcinogenic and nephrotoxic risks, the FDA advised that products containing aristolochic acid not be allowed to enter the U.S. marketplace.169 In 2001, the FDA issued another warning regarding the safety of aristolochic acid citing further examples of nephrotoxicity and malignancies.170 The FDA re-emphasized the need for manufacturers to review their current manufacturing practices and have adequate processes for adverse event collection and reporting.171 Further, the FDA warned consumers to dis - continue use of botanical products that contain aristolochic acid.172 FDA has taken no public action on aristolochic acid since 2001; the lack of action apparently is not due to quieted concerns, given that then-Commissioner Mark McClellan announced in January 2004 that the FDA would give more scrutiny to aristolochic acid and two other supplements: bitter orange and usnic acid.173 Kava is a revered herb in the South Pacic islands where it is used for traditional ceremonial purposes and as a medicinal relaxant.174 American consumers use kava preparations for \"relaxation (e.g., to relieve stress, anxiety, 46and tension)\" and to relieve insomnia.175 From November 2001 through November 2002, kava generated more than $34 million in U.S. sales.176 However, kava is associated with severe liver-related illness and injury. Regulatory agencies in countries including Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have taken actions ranging from advising consumers about the potential risks of kava use to banning the sale of kava-containing products.177 For example, Health Canada does not believe there is enough evidence to support the use of kava-containing products; kava is considered a drug with no acceptable food uses.178 In December 2001, the FDA informed healthcare professionals that products containing kava were impli - cated in Europe in at least 25 cases of serious liver toxicity including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure.179 By March 2002, the FDA had received several reports of liver-related injuries, including a report of a previously healthy woman who required liver transplantation after consuming kava.180 Based on these reports, the FDA warned that persons who have liver disease or liver problems, or persons who are taking drug products that can aect the liver, should consult a physician before using kava-containing dietary supplements. Other dietary supplements, including comfrey, can endanger consumers long after they stop using the prod - uct. Comfrey is a medicinal plant indigenous to Europe. Teas, tablets, tinctures and lotions made from the root and leaves of the herb have been used for hundreds of years as blood puriers, antiasthmatic agents, and ulcer remedies. A more common, current use of the herb is as an ingredient in oral anti-inflammatory supplements. In July 2001, the FDA issued a warning letter noting comfrey as a source of pyrrolizidine alkaloids that pres - ent a serious health hazard to humans.181 The pyrrolizidine alkaloids, in addition to being potent liver toxins, are known carcinogens. Based on evidence of the association between pyrrolizidine alkaloids and serious illness and the lack of valid scientic data to establish a safe level of exposure, the FDA declared that comfrey should not be an ingredient in any oral dietary supplement. In December 2003, Health Canada issued a statement advising consumers not to ingest products made with comfrey because they may contain the liver toxin echimidine.182 * * * In summary, credible scientic knowledge about the ecacy and safety of many readily available dietary supplements is either inadequate or unavailable. While some dietary supplements are proven to have benecial health eects, others are known to cause serious harm. Consumers often take dietary supplements, or give them to their children, at the risk of delaying conventional care and without knowledge of potential interactions with other medications or of contraindications for the supplement's use. There are no legally enforced quality control standards for dietary supplements, which puts consumers at risk of taking contaminated or adulterated products; dosage can vary from bottle to bottle or from pill to pill. Because of these risks, a number of dietary supplements are and should be considered unsafe. Notes 1. A. Grollman quoted in R. Cohen and S.

For the sake of national uniformity and ease of interstate commerce, certain aspects of food and drug manufacture, handling, and marketing are subject only to federal regulations. In those cases, Congress has preempted states from impos - ing their own regulations that vary from federal standards. Other aspects of food and drug regulation are subject to state-by-state variation. States retain their traditional \"police powers,\" which allow them to protect the health and safety of their citizens. States can exercise these powers (via legislation, regulation, or enforcement activities) in areas where the federal government has not preempted independent state activity. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal T rade Commission (FTC) regulate dietary sup - plement labeling, advertising, and marketing. The FDA assumes primary responsibility for food and supplement product labeling, while the FTC regulates food and supplement advertising and marketing. The two agencies maintain a cooperative relationship and frequently coordinate enforcement and education eorts.1 A Brief History of Food, Drug, and Dietary Supplement Regulation Major eorts at food and drug regulation did not occur in the United States until the 20th century and often came in the wake of public tragedies resulting from adulterated or otherwise unsafe substances.2 Early in the century a wide range of proprietary or \"patent\" medicines was available to consumers, often marketed under exaggerated testimonials and without disclosure of ingredients, though some contained alcohol or narcotics.3 Often, foods were likewise mislabeled, misdescribed, or adulterated.4 Public outcry over stockyard conditions, patent medicines, and food contamination led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act (PFDA) of 1906.5 The PFDA was the rst federal statute to address the adulteration and quality of foods and drugs transported in interstate commerce by allowing oending products to be seized and condemned.6 Under the statute, drugs had to meet standards of purity and quality set forth by committees of physicians and pharmacists or meet indi - vidual standards chosen by their manufacturers and stated on their labels. The law also prohibited the adultera - tion of food by the removal of valuable constituents, the substitution of ingredients, or the addition of harmful ingredients.7 In 1938, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) was passed in reaction to the \"elixir of sulfa - nilamide\" tragedy, in which a cherry-flavored tonic that included diethylene glycol caused the deaths of at least 73 children.8 The FDCA required that drugs be tested for safety,9 but did not require that drugs be eective.10 Although the 1906 PFDA authorized the government to challenge blatantly false labeling, drug claims that were merely misleading were not prohibited until the FDCA.11 The FDCA established a category of foods for \"special dietary use\" and required that the labels on these products indicate their vitamin, mineral, or other content.12 The rst requirement for proof of drug ecacy appeared in the Harris-Kefauver Amendments to the FDCA in 1962.13 In the 1950s and early 1960s, the sedative thalidomide was prescribed to pregnant women who subse -4. Federal Regulation of Dietary Supplements54quently gave birth to children with severe birth defects. This tragedy prompted the Amendments.14 For the rst time, the federal government implemented strict scientic requirements for testing drugs prior to marketing. These included preclinical toxicity studies and evidence of ecacy, and controlled clinical trials by qualied re - searchers.15 The Amendments also required that the FDA review the ecacy of all drugs approved for marketing between 1938 and 1962.16 The FDA focused on safety and wholesomeness of foods marketed for \"special dietary uses\" and barred false and misleading labels. The FDA often took enforcement actions against vitamins, minerals, and herbs, because they were touted as treating or preventing disease (claims which can only be made for drugs), or as having some eect on the structure and function of the body (claims which could be made for foods but not botanical prod - ucts).17 In the 1960s, the FDA and FTC brought hundreds of court actions against misleading nutrition claims and product advertisements, and \"undoubtedly expended more enforcement resources in the area of nutrition than in any other single eld.\"18 In 1973, the FDA attempted to implement a new dietary reference standard\u2014the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance\u2014and to restrict the amounts and combinations of vitamins and minerals that could be marketed as dietary supplements. Products with higher levels or dierent combinations of nutrients would be subject to review by an advisory committee as part of the FDA over-the-counter drug review.19 After several lawsuits relat - ing to FDA's implementing procedure,20 the FDA withdrew the regulations.21 In addition, Congress responded to pressure from vitamin and mineral manufacturers by passing the \"Proxmire Amendments\" to the FDCA, which invalidated many of the proposed FDA regulations, in 1976.22 The Proxmire Amendments revoked the FDA authority to classify a vitamin or mineral as a drug solely on the grounds of exceeding potency, or because vitamins and minerals are marketed in irrational combinations.23 Following the Proxmire Amendment and in light of setbacks in the courtroom, the FDA scaled back its ef - forts to regulate dietary supplements.24 This regulatory environment encouraged the growth of the dietary sup - plement industry. The number of dietary supplement products and manufacturers grew signicantly through the late 1970s and 1980s, accompanied by a growing number of reports of serious illnesses allegedly attributable to particular supplements.25 During this time, the FDA took action against dietary supplements only when a product's labeling or advertising made claims that the product performed drug functions such as treating a disease.26 Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) in 1990. The NLEA allows food prod - ucts to make disease-related health claims if the FDA certies that the claim is supported by \"signicant sci - entic agreement.\"27 The FDA has, for example, certied claims regarding the relationship between dietary fat intake and the risk of certain types of cancer.28 Subsequent regulations issued by the FDA similarly allowed dietary supplement manufacturers to make disease-related health claims under the signicant scientic agree - ment standard.29 In practice, some conventional foods, but almost no dietary supplements, were able to meet the signicant scientic agreement standard for health claims. In the early 1990s, the FDA rejected all but one dietary supplement health claim application.30 At the same time, the FDA began interpreting the federal denition of food additives (substances which become a component of or aect the characteristics of a food) to include single-ingredient dietary supplement capsules. This required manufacturers of these dietary supplements to show a reasonable certainty of safety be - fore the FDA would approve sales or determine that the substance was \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS).31 55The FDA's broad interpretation was ultimately struck down in federal court, however, and its eorts at regulat - ing dietary supplements as food additives proved unsuccessful.32 In 1992, after intense advocacy by the dietary supplement industry, Congress passed a one-year moratorium on the application of the NLEA scientic agreement standard to supplements.33 In response, the FDA reiter - ated its position that dietary supplement claims ought to be held to the same standard as food claims, and further asserted that some products were inherently drugs and not dietary supplements, and that many dietary supplements should be considered unapproved food additives.34 In 1994, the FDA indicated that no supple - ment currently marketed had the scientic support necessary to make a health claim.35 This stimulated industry, congressional, and consumer support for new legislation that would enable dietary supplement manufacturers to make health-related claims for their products without prior FDA approval.36 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 For dietary supplements, the most signicant amendment to the FDCA is the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994.37 The provisions of DSHEA dene and expand the meaning of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients; establish a new framework for assessing safety; outline guidelines for literature displayed where supplements are sold; provide guidelines for the use of claims and nutritional sup - port statements; require ingredient and nutrition labeling; and grant the FDA the authority to establish good manufacturing practice regulations. DSHEA also requires the formation of an executive level Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels and an Oce of Dietary Supplements (ODS) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). DSHEA denes dietary supplements as products (\"other than tobacco\") that are intended to supplement the diet, and contain a \"dietary ingredient.\" The dietary ingredient can be a vitamin, mineral, herb, amino acid, a substance used to increase total dietary intake (e.g., an enzyme), concentrate, metabolite, constituent, or extract. This denition is substantially broader than previous denitions of nutritional supplements and foods, as the category now includes substances that are not consumed as foods and have no nutritional value as dened by nutritionists.38 DSHEA regulates dietary supplements as a special category of conventional foods. Therefore, pre-market safety approval is not required and most dietary supplements are subject only to post-market regulation.39 The only ex - ception to this standard is that manufacturers of \"new dietary ingredients\" (those not sold in a dietary supplement before October 15, 1994) must notify the FDA at least 75 days before marketing these products and must provide the agency with information substantiating the conclusion that a dietary supplement containing the new dietary ingredient is \"reasonably expected to be safe.\"40 Additionally, DSHEA applies existing food standards for adultera - tion to dietary supplements but requires that such a determination be based on conditions of use recommended on the product label or, in the absence of such recommendations, on ordinary conditions of use. Guidelines for Literature, Claims and Labeling DSHEA established federal product labeling guidelines for dietary supplements and instructed the FDA to issue regulations specifying detailed requirements. The information that must be disclosed on every dietary sup - plement label includes: serving size; directions for use; net quantity of contents; dietary ingredients that have a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV), as well as ingredients for which RDIs and DRVs 56have not been established; botanical ingredients; proprietary blends; and nutrients required in the labeling of conventional foods.41 Labels must include a statement of identity containing the words \"dietary supplement,\" and any ingredients not listed in the \"Supplement Facts\" panel, as well as the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.42 However, the law does not require that information about manufacturers and distributors be included on dietary supplement labels\u2014information on one is sucient.43 As the Depart - ment of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Oce of the Inspector General (OIG) has concluded, this can leave both consumers and the FDA uncertain of the identity and location of the manufacturer of a product.44 Generally, DSHEA allows the use of various types of statements on the label of dietary supplements, although claims may not be made about the use of a dietary supplement to \"diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat, or cure\" a specic disease. DSHEA allows manufacturers to describe a dietary supplement's eect on the \"structure or function\" of the body or the \"well being\" achieved by consuming the dietary ingredient. Under DSHEA, manu - facturers can make these structure/function claims without prior FDA approval, as long as the label contains the following disclaimer: \"This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\" 45 Further, a \"structure/function\" claim is one which: claims a benet related to a classic nutrient deciency disease and discloses the prevalence of such disease in the United States, [or] describes the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to aect the struc - ture or function in humans, [or] characterizes the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or describes general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient.46 \"Calcium builds strong bones\" is an example of a structure/function claim that does not require FDA ap - proval. In contrast, a statement that a calcium supplement mitigates the eects of osteoporosis is a claim to \"diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat, or cure\" a specic disease and would require FDA approval.47 Structure/function claims are exempted from the signicant scientic agreement standard that health or drug claims must meet.48 Under DSHEA, manufacturers are required to have evidence that the structure/function claim is truthful and not misleading, but the quality and quantity of substantiating information is not specied in the law. DSHEA does not grant the FDA authority to inspect food or dietary supplement manufacturers' records to verify the substantiation requirement.49 Manufacturers do not have to disclose to the FDA or con - sumers the basis for claims regarding the benets of their products.50 In November 2004, the FDA released a draft Guidance Document noting that it intends to apply a substan - tiation standard of \"competent and reliable scientic evidence\" to claims relating to the benets and safety of dietary supplements.51 Although the new guidelines put industry on notice of a new recommended benchmark for substantiation, the FDA still lacks the regulatory authority to demand substantiating information from manufacturers. DSHEA does not regulate promotional materials that are displayed where dietary supplements are sold. Publications, articles, and abstracts are not subject to DSHEA labeling restrictions as long as they are displayed separately, are reprinted in their entirety, are not false or misleading, give a \"balanced view\" of the available scientic information, and do not promote a particular brand of dietary supplement.52 Thus, though not on a product's label, health/disease claims may be made in literature displayed in retail establishments without signicant scientic agreement or FDA approval.53 Also, the law does not dene what constitutes a \"balanced 57view\" of the available information. Even where the only \"available scientic information\" is non-clinical trials performed by the manufacturer itself, DSHEA allows such information to be displayed.54 Federal activity subsequent to DSHEA has also addressed the claims and labeling allowed for dietary supplement products. In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) was enacted. FDAMA allows \"nutrient content claims\" to be made for dietary supplements based upon an \"authoritative statement\" of a scientic body of the federal government or the National Academy of Sciences. Nutrient content claims describe the amount of a nutrient or dietary substance in a product, often using such terms as \"good source,\" \"high,\" \"low,\" and \"free.\"55 In the 1999 case of Pearson v. Shalala , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that, under certain circumstances, the FDA must allow dietary supplement labels to make \"qualied\" health claims.56 These are health claims for which there is emerging evidence, but the evidence is not yet sucient to meet the rigorous signicant scientic agreement standard.57 If the FDA nds that there is more evidence sup - porting the claim than against it, the FDA may exercise its discretion and allow a qualied health claim indicat - ing that the supporting evidence is still limited. Since Pearson , the FDA has approved nine qualied health claims for food and dietary supplements. These include claims pertaining to cancer ( antioxidants and selenium), cardiovascular disease risk (nuts, walnuts, omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and olive oil), cognitive function (soy phosphatidylserine), and neural tube birth defects (folic acid).58 T wo examples of FDA-approved qualied health claims are: Selenium may reduce the risk of certain cancers. Some scientic evidence suggests that consumption of selenium may reduce the risk of certain forms of cancer. However, FDA has determined that this evidence is limited and not conclusive. and As part of a well-balanced diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, Folic Acid, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 may reduce the risk of vascular disease. FDA evaluated the above claim and found that, while it is known that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol reduce the risk of heart disease and other vascular diseases, the evidence in support of the above claim is inconclusive.59 An example of a health claim the FDA did not approve is: \"Consumption of 320 mg daily of saw palmetto extract may improve urine flow, reduce nocturia, and reduce voiding urgency associated with mild benign pros - tatic hyperplasia.\" The FDA considered this a health or drug claim to cure, mitigate, or treat an existing disease, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the determination.60 Moreover, the Court found that First Amendment protection of commercial speech did not bar Congress from determining the nature of drug claims.61 In response to the qualied health claim requirements established in the Pearson case, in December 2002 the FDA announced the Consumer Health Information for Better Nutrition Initiative, which aims to encourage makers of conventional foods and dietary supplements to make accurate claims about health benets, and to enhance enforcement against marketers who make false or misleading claims.62 As part of the initiative, in Sep - tember 2003 the FDA implemented interim procedures for receiving, prioritizing, and responding to qualied health claim petitions.63 Some commentators express concern that the labeling and advertising of dietary supplements can mislead 58consumers to believe the products treat or cure disease. At least one survey found that substantial numbers of consumers perceive structure/function statements as claims that a product will prevent or mitigate illness.64 Other surveys indicate that consumers interpret the mention of the FDA in the disclaimer as a statement that the administration has approved the product.65 Other commentators observe that the boundary between structure/function claims and health claims is not entirely clear.66 There is also speculation that manufacturers and marketers ignore the boundaries set by the FDA and FTC. A 2002 study of 34 commercial dietary supplement websites reported that 92 percent claimed that a supplement could prevent cancer, 89 percent claimed that a supplement could treat cancer, and 58 percent claimed that a supplement could cure cancer. The majority of websites claiming cures for cancer through herb use supplied no evidence to support these claims. Fewer than 40 percent recommended that consumers consult a doctor prior to their use of dietary supplements.67 In 2003, the OIG assessed supplement labeling and found many deciencies in current requirements and practices. Specically, ingredient information is often dicult to interpret, safety information is often incom - plete, statements of intended use often provide limited information, and directions for use are often incom - plete.68 Furthermore, information that is provided is often dicult to understand because labels lack a stan - dardized format, display complex language, small font size, and imbalanced information on benets and risk.69 Regarding safety information, OIG found that the majority of labels lacked information about adverse reactions or side eects, interactions, maximum dose, or contraindications, and many lacked information about expira - tion.70 Most labels failed to make clear which ingredients were active and which ingredients were absorbed by the body; all privately-held formulations reviewed (proprietary blends) lacked information on the amount of individual ingredients.71 The OIG recommended a standard template for dietary supplement labeling, including display of known safety information, adequate directions for use, and the production source and batch or lot number.72 Safety information would include potential concomitant use problems, contraindications, and possible side eects and adverse reactions, as well as warnings to consumers to cease taking a supplement if they experience adverse reactions.73 These recommendations have not been implemented. The OIG research reported supplement users to be particularly interested in safety information.74 Consumer advocates noted that health professionals may lack training about potential interactions, contraindications, or other adverse eects; consumers were particularly concerned about the lack of warnings for women who are pregnant or nursing, and some believed that supplement labels should automatically bear such warnings unless proven to be safe for pregnant or nursing women.75 Good Manufacturing Practices DSHEA empowered the FDA to issue current good manufacturing practices (GMPs) for the dietary supple - ment industry.76 These GMPs are to be modeled on current GMPs for food,77 not pharmaceuticals.78 In March 2003, the FDA exercised this authority by issuing proposed current GMPs that would establish industry-wide standards to ensure that supplements are manufactured consistently as to identity, purity, quality, strength, and composition. The proposed current GMPs include minimum standards for design and construction of physical plants, quality-control procedures, testing nal products and raw materials, handling consumer complaints, and maintaining records. They would apply to all rms (domestic and foreign) that manufacture, package, or hold 59dietary supplements or dietary ingredients distributed in the United States; this includes any rm involved in distributing, testing, quality control, packaging, and/or labeling of dietary supplements or dietary ingredients.79 The proposed current GMPs do not address the potential ecacy or toxicity of a product's ingredients. They are aimed at preventing harm from super- or subpotency (too much or too little of listed ingredients), drug contaminants, other contaminants (bacteria, pesticide, lead, etc.), wrong ingredients, improper packaging, and mislabeling.80 To date the FDA has not issued a nal rule.81 The Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels DSHEA created the Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels to consider the appropriate legal standard for health/drug claims.82 In 1997, the Commission issued a report, in which members expressed concern that some \"statements of nutritional support\" are in fact more akin to health claims and recommended that both dietary supplements and foods alike continue to be held to the \"signicant scientic agreement\" standard for health claims.83 Members were divided about the appropriateness of structure and function claims that were associated with signicant clinical conditions, such as heart disease. Some members believed such claims were a fundamental flaw of DSHEA, creating a loophole for quasi-drug claims.84 The Commission urged the FDA to take swift enforcement action against potentially unsafe dietary supplements and to improve postmarket surveillance systems.85 The Oce of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health DSHEA authorized the establishment of the Oce of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at NIH. The ODS was created in 1995 within NIH's Oce of Disease Prevention. ODS does not have a regulatory role; a central purpose of ODS is to promote scientic research on dietary supplements.86 DSHEA denes ODS' specic responsibilities as follows: T o explore more fully the potential role of dietary supplements as a signicant part of the eorts of the United States to improve health care To promote scientic study of the benets of dietary supplements in maintaining health and preventing chronic disease and other health-related conditions To conduct and coordinate scientic research within NIH relating to dietary supplements To collect and compile the results of scientic research relating to dietary supplements, including scien - tic data from foreign sources To serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary and to the Assistant Secretary for Health and provide advice to the Director of NIH, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration on issues relating to dietary supplements.87 Other Federal Activity Within the limited provisions of DSHEA, the federal government has made sporadic administrative and regulatory eorts regarding dietary supplement safety and ecacy. 60Adverse Event Reporting One important dierence between regulation of pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements is the requirement for reporting adverse events. Manufacturers of prescription drugs and medical devices are required to report adverse events to the FDA through its MedWatch system.88 There is no such requirement for dietary supplement manufacturers. Because manufacturers of dietary supplements usually need not provide any evidence of safety before these products are sold to consumers, methods for assessing safety once dietary supplements become publicly available are all the more critical. The FDA denes an adverse event as an illness or injury that may be associated with a dietary supplement (or a range of other products). The person reporting the adverse event need not be certain of a cause/eect re - lationship between the adverse event and the use of the product. A \"serious\" adverse event is one that results in any of the following: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization, disability, congenital anomaly, or medical intervention necessary to prevent permanent injury or damage.89 Adverse event reporting is the FDA's main tool for identifying safety problems. However, the FDA system for tracking dietary supplement adverse events is inadequate; deciencies have been well documented, most signicantly in a critical report from the OIG in 2001.90 The OIG report Adverse Event Reporting for Dietary Supplements documented gaps in four critical phases of the FDA system as of 2001: detecting adverse events, following up and obtaining adequate medical and product information related to the event, assessing informa - tion, and pursuing appropriate safety actions. An FDA-commissioned study estimated that less than one percent of all adverse events associated with di - etary supplements were reported to the FDA.91 A principal reason for this deciency is that manufacturers are not required to report adverse events to the FDA or to any other party. The OIG reported that the FDA received ten reports of adverse events from supplement manufacturers from 1994 to 1999, although roughly 100 million Americans took supplements during those years. Since they have not been required to collect adverse event information, in the past some manufacturers have possessed no data on adverse events, while others have had information that was not shared with the FDA. For instance, as discussed in Chapter 1, the Department of Justice began a criminal investigation in August 2002 to determine whether Metabolife International, Inc., manufacturer of the ephedra-based product Metabolife 356, had issued false statements to the FDA concerning the existence of adverse event reports. The FDA had unsuccessfully sought to obtain these reports from Metabolife International, Inc., even through litigation, since 1997.92 Manufacturers are not the only potential source of adverse event reports, and not the only source from which reporting could be improved. Poison control centers, a network of sites often based in hospitals and academic medical centers and dispersed throughout the states, received more reports than the FDA during the study pe - riod of the OIG report. The OIG recommendations include closer cooperation between poison control centers and the FDA adverse event reporting system. Another source of adverse event reports is the health care provider. Physicians and other providers forwarded fewer than 20 percent of supplement-related reports to the FDA during the OIG study period. Providers have little information that would help them link specic symptoms to supplements, thus making them unlikely to report. In addition, patients may be far less likely to tell providers about dietary supplement use than about use of prescription drugs,93 again contributing to the diculty in establishing causality between supplements 61and symptoms. Consumers, too, are far less likely to report adverse events associated with herbal remedies than those linked to over-the-counter treatments. Thus, many adverse reactions to herbal remedies go unmonitored, illustrating the need for greater public awareness that adverse reactions to herbal remedies do exist and should be reported.94 Both providers and consumers might report more events if signicant eorts were made to increase their understanding of the potential risks associated with dietary supplements. The OIG report relied upon the MedWatch database to document a number of deciencies in the FDA re - porting system. When the FDA receives adverse event reports, the quality of information recorded is often very poor.95 The FDA had diculty obtaining adequate medical information about a signicant number of events that were reported, and product labels and samples were missing from the majority of reports.96 The FDA could not determine the manufacturer for roughly one-third of the dietary supplements associated with reports.97 Because of the diculties obtaining information, OIG recommended that dietary supplement manufacturers be required to register both themselves and their products with the FDA to help in tracking problems and com - municating with the industry.98 The FDA is empowered to take appropriate action in response to information it receives through its adverse events reporting system. However, the OIG report points out that the FDA took only 32 such actions against dietary supplements during a six-year period. The number of actions the FDA could responsibly take was lim - ited by the aforementioned system decits. For instance, the FDA proposed a rule in 1997 to require warning labels and dosage limits on ephedra-based dietary supplements. After industry protests, the Government Ac - counting Oce ( GAO) issued a report that was highly critical of the FDA data, citing a lack of information about many specic adverse events and the absence of scientic research to substantiate particular dosage limita - tions. The FDA withdrew the proposal. In June 2004, U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, who had previously proposed legislation requiring adverse event reporting for supplements, and DSHEA co-author Senator Orrin Hatch agreed on the floor of the U.S. Senate to work together to craft legislation establishing a mandatory reporting system for serious adverse events related to dietary supplements.99 The Senators discussed the possibility of attaching such a provision to the Anabolic Steroid Control Act, but that law passed Congress without any dietary supplement adverse event language and was signed by President Bush in October 2004. In comments on the Senate floor before the January 2005 conrmation of Michael Leavitt as DHHS Secretary, Durbin noted that Leavitt has promised to review adverse event legislation.100 Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Adverse Events Reporting System Although no person or entity is legally required to report adverse events associated with dietary supplements, the FDA has attempted to improve its adverse events reporting system.101 In 2003, the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)\u2014which regulates foods, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and food and color additives\u2014implemented its Adverse Events Reporting System (CAERS).102 CAERS is a computerized system that integrates information from individual CFSAN oces, from the FDA MedWatch system, and from events reported directly to its website. Reports are categorized, aggregated, and analyzed by CFSAN medical sta for trends and other indicators that FDA action is needed.103 CAERS sta attempt to contact the source of an adverse event report, whether a medical facility, poison control center, practitioner, or other source. Sta also attempts to contact the person who suered the event and seek authorization to view their relevant medical records.62CAERS aims to improve upon previous methods of tracking adverse events by creating a mechanism for follow-up on the reported adverse events that facilitates the assessment and comprehensiveness of the informa - tion received.104 CAERS emphasizes the aggregation of reported adverse events to promote more expedient, ap - propriate policy decisions.105 However, as a voluntary system, CAERS is only as useful as the number of reports it receives; at the time of CAERS's implementation, one FDA ocial estimated that voluntary systems receive reports of only one or two percent of adverse events.106 Federal Ephedra Regulation FDA attempted to ban the sale of dietary supplement products that contain ephedrine alkaloids by regulation in 2004.107 The FDA rule states that dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids present an unreason - able risk of illness or injury when used according to product label instructions (or under conditions of ordinary use) and are therefore considered \"adulterated\" under Section 402(f)(1)(A) of the FDCA.108 The rule applied to all ephedra-containing dietary supplements rather than to individual products or brands. As with other prod - ucts declared \"adulterated,\" the FDA announced it could enforce the ephedra rule through a variety of actions including seizure of the product, injunction against the manufacturers and distributors of such products, and criminal prosecution of violators.109 As discussed in Chapter 1, a U.S. District Court in Utah struck down at least part of the FDA ephedra regulation in April 2005.110 In Nutraceutical Corp. v. Crawford , the court ruled that the FDA had improperly used a risk-benet analysis in determining that all ephedra supplements posed an \"unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\" At the time this report went to press, it appeared that the FDA ban would remain in force against sales of dietary supplements containing more than 10 milligrams of ephedrine alkaloids per recommended daily dose (the amount contained in the \"low-dose\" ephedra products sold by the plainti in the Androstenedione The sports \"supplement\" androstenedione (\"andro\") was reclassied as a controlled substance by the 2004 Anabolic Steroid Control Act.111 Prior to passage of that bill, and in response to safety concerns raised by con - sumers, medical organizations and members of Congress, the FDA targeted 23 companies that manufactured, marketed, and distributed products containing andro with warning letters requesting that they cease distribu - tion of andro-based products or face enforcement actions.112 The FDA warning letters described dietary supplements containing andro to be adulterated under the FDCA, albeit on dierent grounds than those on which ephedrine alkaloid supplements were declared adulterated. The FDA warning letters classied andro supplements as containing \"new dietary ingredients.\" Products containing andro failed to meet the safety requirements for dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients, and therefore could not be legally marketed.113 Enforcement of Labeling, Advertising and Marketing Standards The FTC enforces federal consumer protection laws, which address fraud, deception, and unfair business practices. When the FTC identies a violation\u2014e.g., claims for products with unproven benets, claims to 63treat or cure serious diseases, or claims which present signicant safety concerns for consumers\u2014it may obtain voluntary compliance by entering into a consent order with the company, pursue an administrative agency ac - tion before an administrative law judge, or bring an action in federal court. Depending on the type of action, the FTC may secure a cease and desist order and/or civil penalties.114 While the FDA assumes primary responsibility for dietary supplement labeling, the FTC assumes primary responsibility for advertising, including supplement advertising on the Internet.115 In recent years the two agen - cies have brought coordinated actions against supplement companies who violate both advertising and labeling guidelines and they chair an interagency health fraud steering committee which includes U.S., Canadian, and Mexican agencies.116 The FTC and the FDA have also produced various publications to educate consumers on how to spot deceptive advertising and avoid falling prey to unscrupulous marketing of health-care products, including supplements.117 Though its enforcement resources are limited, the FDA has taken a number of actions against supplement companies in recent years, in addition to those against ephedra and androstenedione. Typically action was taken against products that contained drug ingredients or were marketed as treating disease, or because potentially unsafe products were imported to the United States. The FDA gives highest priority to products it considers a direct hazard to public health. The FDA initially warns the manufacturer or marketer and works with them to correct the problem voluntarily. If this is ineective, the FDA may request that the marketer recall the product, or may seek injunction and/or seizure through the court.118 In December 2002, as part of the Consumer Health Information for Better Nutrition Initiative, the FDA announced enhanced enforcement eorts against misleading health-related claims. Since that time the FDA has increased its actions in priority areas such as misleading claims to treat life-threatening diseases like cancer, lupus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).119 As part of that eort, the FDA reports improved co - operation with the FTC in identifying the worst oenders and coordinating enforcement actions. For instance, in June 2003, the two agencies initiated joint actions against two manufacturers of seasilver, a supplement promoted as a safe and eective treatment for 650 serious diseases including AIDS, cancer, and diabetes.120 In March 2004, both manufacturers agreed to cease manufacture and distribution of the products.121 \"Operation Cure.All\" is an ongoing collaboration between the FDA and the FTC. Through coordination of the activities of the FDA, FTC, Health Canada, and various state Attorneys General, \"Operation Cure.All\" is a law enforcement and consumer education campaign against the fraudulent marketing of dietary supplements and other health products on the Internet.122 Since the launch of \"Operation Cure.All\" in 1999, the FDA eorts have resulted in at least 12 product seizures, 11 product recalls, 43 arrests, and 22 convictions.123 The FTC has brought 13 law enforcement actions against Internet marketers for unsubstantiated health claims and estimates that more than 100 other websites have taken down their sites or removed their claims after the FTC contacted them.124 A list of selected FDA enforcement actions from 1994 to 2004 is included in Appendix B.125 * * * Federal regulation of dietary supplements is far from comprehensive. Though some dietary supplements may be used more like drugs than like foods, they are generally regulated as foods. Given the lack of eective federal oversight of the manufacturing process, supplements are regulated less strictly than conventional foods. Manu -64facturers may make claims that dietary supplements aect or maintain the structure or function of the human body, or provide a benet related to treatment of a classic nutrient deciency disease, or promote general well being, without having to provide substantiating information to the FDA. Though a supplement may interfere with drugs taken concurrently, may be contraindicated for certain medi - cal conditions, or may be inherently harmful, its safety usually does not need to be demonstrated before it is marketed. The burden remains on the FDA and FTC to identify dangerous products or misleading claims after they are on the market. Though federal lawmakers have periodically proposed changes to DSHEA, necessary legislative action has not been forthcoming. Additionally, some members of Congress have worked with the dietary supplement industry to support restrictions on the regulation of dietary supplements. Therefore state-level eorts must ll the regulatory gaps left by DSHEA. Unfortunately, as described in Chapter 5, current regulation by states is also inadequate. Notes 1.

Many states impose no regulation beyond that required by federal law. Those that have attempted state-level regulation have, for the most part, followed one or both of two tracks: 1) labeling and marketing requirements that supplement federal requirements, and/or 2) restrictions on the distribution and sale of particular dietary supplements. Prior to the 2004 FDA action on ephedra, most state-level regulations had dealt specically with ephedra-based dietary supplements. This chapter reviews the scope of state power to regulate dietary supplement manufacture, marketing, and sales, and discusses regulatory actions taken in New York State and initiatives by private entities. State Regulation Federal Preemption of State Law Under the \"Supremacy Clause\" in Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, federal law is the supreme law of the land. Congress may legislate only in areas in which it is granted power by the Constitution. Once Congress has validly enacted a law pursuant to its designated powers, such as its power to regulate interstate commerce in food or medicinal products, a state law that conflicts with either the letter or policy of the federal law is invalid as a matter of preemption. Sometimes, Congress occupies an entire eld or subject area, and then any state regula - tion in the eld may be preempted.2 Preemption is always a matter of congressional intention. If Congress wants to exclude state legislation that lies within the federal domain, its intention governs. Sometimes, Congress makes its intent to exclude parallel state legislation explicit, as it did with regard to nutritional labeling pursuant to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA).3 In the absence of an explicit congressional determination about preemption, Congress' intent must be inferred. With regard to health and safety regulations, Congress often sets a federal minimum intending to leave room for additional state regulation. Sometimes, though, Congress perceives a need for na - tional uniformity and itself balances commercial and safety needs, in order to create an exclusive federal regula - tory regime. State laws may conflict with federal laws in a variety of ways. When there is a clear and direct conflict, state law will be preempted. Conflict may arise when it is impossible for a citizen or legal entity to comply simulta - neously with one law without violating the other, or where the laws are otherwise directly contradictory.4 If a state law penalizes or discourages conduct that federal law specically seeks to encourage, courts will likely strike down the state law.5 Likewise, where an individual state action interferes with a federal policy that supports national uniformity, it will likely be struck down.6 5. State Regulation and Private Sector Initiatives70State laws may also conflict where Congress has \"occupied the eld\" by reserving for itself an entire area of regulation. Where Congress has occupied an entire eld, even state regulation that does not conflict in any way with the federal scheme will be invalidated.7 Federal courts, however, will rule that Congress has occupied a eld only where they nd clear congressional intent to do so. Such clarity is not often found in federal legisla - tion.8 In the absence of a clear statement of congressional intent to occupy the eld, courts apply various tests to determine whether prior federal action indicates such congressional intent. A broad federal regulatory scheme that incorporates the majority of a subject area can suggest a federal intent to occupy the eld. Courts are more wary of nding federal occupation of the eld where there is a less comprehensive scheme, since nding federal occupation in such a case may leave parts of the subject area unregulated by any governmental authority.9 In some cases, however, deregulation may be the federal purpose, and courts will nd a \"negative occupation\" of the eld if there is a clear indication that Congress' intent in deregulating was to leave a regulatory \"vacuum\" in the entire area.10 Courts are less likely to nd federal occupation of the eld where the subject matter is a local concern that has traditionally fallen under state authority. For example, the Supreme Court stated, \"regulation of health and safety matters is primarily, and historically, a matter of local concern.\"11 While health and safety regulations have traditionally been considered local matters, regulation of foods, drugs and dietary supplements has been largely a federal issue. Preliminary questions for a state considering dietary supplement regulation are whether federal law preempts that action, if the action conflicts with the objectives of federal law, or if there is federal occupation of the regulatory eld. Several states have passed legislation to regulate various aspects of the dietary supplement industry. This legisla - tion includes labeling and marketing requirements and restrictions on sale and distribution.12 The legality of state-specic labeling requirements may be questioned because the NLEA specied a \"national uniform nutrition labeling\" provision. The provision explicitly preempted states from enacting food nutrition and content labeling requirements (including labeling claims for health benets) which vary from the federal requirements already in place in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).13 The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) subsequently amended the FDCA to dene dietary supplements as \"food[s]\" for most federal regulatory purposes.14 Thus, the NLEA's uniformity requirement applies to dietary supplements and states may not vary from federal nutrition/content labeling requirements. However, NLEA and DSHEA leave states with signicant retained authority to regulate supplement labeling and marketing.15 The NLEA provides an exemption for labeling statements providing warnings concerning the safety of the food (or supplement) or one of its components.16 Additionally, states retain the ability to challenge false or misleading labeling and advertising (except where the labeling, though deemed deceptive by the state, conforms to federal requirements with preemptive eect).17 DSHEA indicates that states may not enact their own standards for nutrition or health-related claims in supplement labeling but it does not broaden NLEA's prior preemption of state action.18 Some states have also taken action beyond labeling and marketing, including retail restrictions on certain dietary supplement products19 and, in one case, imposing batch-testing requirements on ephedra-based dietary supplements.20 In New York, with few exceptions, consumers can purchase dietary supplements over the Internet, through mail-order catalogs, and in retail establishments including gyms and pharmacies.21 New York imposes no labeling 71requirements beyond those found in DSHEA and NLEA. The state does not monitor the manufacture of dietary supplements, nor is there a centralized registry of dietary supplement manufacturers located in the State.22 Distribution of New York State Regulatory Authority The New York State Department of Health (DOH) is empowered to protect citizens' health and safety by controlling and supervising the abatement of nuisances aecting or likely to aect public health, and by investi - gating the sources of disease and mortality.23 The New York State Department of Agriculture & Markets (DAM) is the chief state authority overseeing food manufacture, production, transportation, storage, marketing, label - ing, and distribution. DAM licenses food manufacturers and promulgates food-related good manufacturing practices and record-keeping requirements.24 DOH and DAM share responsibility for food regulation; DAM generally focuses on manufacture and sale of packaged foods (e.g., canned goods sold in retail stores), while DOH focuses on foods prepared and consumed on-site (e.g., in restaurants). DAM inspects food manufacturing facilities, but not supplement manufacturing facilities. Neither DOH nor DAM conducts regular o-the-shelf testing for adulteration or contamination of dietary supplement prod - ucts.25 However, DOH does have the capability to test products for contamination when necessary. In 1994, investigators from DOH's Bureau of Controlled Substances inspected prepackaged herbal medicine products sold in Chinatown, New York City.26 These products were analyzed for controlled substances and heavy metals at the DOH Wadsworth Center for Laboratories and Research. More than half contained measurable levels of arsenic, chromium, lead, mercury, or selenium.27 The State Attorney General has the power, via the State's Consumer Protection Act, to act against fraudulent or deceptive business practices.28 The Attorney General has pursued enforcement actions against marketers of exorbitantly overpriced dietary supplements and against supplement marketers who do not deliver prepaid or - ders. The Attorney General's oce forwards serious supplement-related complaints to DOH and the FDA.29 The New York State Department of State (DOS) maintains records of most business entities, partnerships, and not-for-prot corporations in the State. While most dietary supplement manufacturers located in New York must register with DOS, they are not required to register specically as dietary supplement manufacturers. Thus the State has no means of identifying all supplement manufacturers located or doing business in New York.30 Additionally, the Oce of Regulatory Reform (ORR) within the New York State Department of Health was originally created to support Governor Pataki's regulatory reform agenda and facilitate a more ecient and user- friendly rule making process. Since 1999, ORR has been a central resource for research, policy development, and identication of legal and regulatory issues relating to the practice and use of complementary and alterna - tive medicine including dietary supplements.31 Retail Restrictions and Product Seizures Largely as a result of specic illness, injury, or death, access to some unsafe dietary supplement products has been restricted. For example, in 1996 the existing DOH enforcement infrastructure, including its Bureau of Controlled Substances, cooperated with DAM in enforcement eorts against dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids.32 Acting by order of Governor George E. Pataki, the Commissioner of Health and the 72Commissioner of Agriculture & Markets removed from the shelves and banned the sale of 26 specic herbal products containing ephedrine alkaloids that were marketed to minors as legal alternatives to illegal drugs. Companies marketed these products to youth via the Internet, magazine ads, and displays in health food stores, convenience stores, and drug paraphernalia shops. DOH acted against pills and powders, and DAM acted against carbonated stimulant beverages containing ma huang/ephedra.33 Prior to the FDA's 2004 ephedra regulation, New York State had enacted a statewide ban on retail sales of ephedra-based products to any consumer in 2003.34 This followed action by a number of New York counties including Westchester,35 Rockland, 36 and Suolk.37 Illinois enacted a ban in May 2003.38 California also banned all sales in October 2003, having previously banned sales to minors and imposed warning labels on ephedra supplements in 2002.39 The New York law does not pertain to herbal ephedra dispensed by physicians or practitioners of traditional Asian medicine, as long as it was not dispensed as a dietary supplement for weight loss, bodybuilding, or as an \"energy food.\" Physicians and traditional practitioners are required to demonstrate qualication to use ephedra and other herbs \"via evidence of an active certication issued to such individual from an entity accredited by the National Commission of Certifying Agencies.\"40 The FDA ephedra regulation\u2014to the extent it survives the April 2005 federal court ruling in Nutraceutical Corp. v. Crawford (see Chapters 1 and 4)\u2014pertains only to products legally dened as dietary supplements and does not require persons selling or dispensing ephedra in a non-supplement form to demonstrate any qualica - tions.41 This application presumably renders the federal regulation inapplicable to persons dispensing ephedra in non-supplement form (such as in traditional Asian medicine).42 The FDA regulation includes no language preempting individual states that wish to provide greater protections for their citizens.43 New York State Adverse Event Reporting As discussed in Chapter 4, adverse events associated with dietary supplements typically are not reported, data collection on supplement-related reports is often insucient, and follow-up or referral to appropriate state or federal agencies rarely occurs. As on the federal level, a lack of consumer awareness, and a lack of education and incentives to report for medical and CAM professionals contribute to under-reporting. However, there is no clearly designated New York State entity or system to which dietary supplement adverse events would be reported. Adverse events can be reported to the federal system by contacting the FDA's Med- Watch service, where the information will be collected and analyzed within the CAERS system. Those who wish to report a dietary supplement-related adverse event occasionally contact the New York State Poison Control Network (NYSPCN). NYSPCN is comprised of six regional centers, and provides poison emer - gency assessment and treatment information. NYSPCN sta members also participate in data collection and sharing, and provide public education, including newsletter articles on the dangers associated with herbal prod - ucts.44 NYSPCN centers refer reports to appropriate federal agencies including the FDA, the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and to local and state health ocials. However, the NYSPCN is not designed for tracking supplement-related adverse events. There are no poison control sta assigned to handle dietary supplement-related adverse event reports. Nor is NYSPCN equipped with any specialized data monitoring system that would allow it to track and analyze dietary-supplement related 73adverse events; such a system would be extremely costly to develop and might duplicate federal eorts via the CAERS system. If New York State chooses to encourage more reporting of dietary supplement-related adverse events, it could focus its eorts either on greater use of the federal MedWatch system, or on the poison control network, or both. The most cost-ecient and eective plan is likely to rely heavily on the newly revamped federal system. Specic Task Force recommendations for adverse event reporting are discussed in Chapter 6.

The USP-DSVP mark on a label indicates that the USP has tested and veried ingredients, product and manufacturing processes.50 As of October 1, 2004, the USP had veried 730 dietary supplements as of October 1, 2004.51 The Good Housekeeping Institute (GH) requires that supplement manufacturers wishing to use the GH seal or to advertise in the Good Housekeeping magazine submit clinical evidence of both safety and ecacy in order to substantiate all explicit or implicit claims. Manufacturers must also submit evidence of batch consistency, and must state in writing that good manufacturing practices are followed in their facilities. GH tests products for consistency between labeling and actual product contents, and veries that the supplement disintegrates accord - ing to USP guidelines. If approved, the manufacturer is usually granted use of the seal for one year.52 * * * Current state and private sector initiatives do not oset inadequate federal level safeguards. Consumers are insuciently protected against the known and potential harms of some dietary supplements. New York has the legal and practical ability to improve this situation. The following chapter outlines the Task Force's recom - mendations for developing a systematic approach to dietary supplement monitoring, public and professional education, and, where necessary, regulation of dietary supplement product.

The Expert Committee will assess available data and make specic recommendations to the Commissioner of Health. The Expert Committee should consider the following policies supported by the Task Force based on current information: i) Institute mandatory reporting by dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors of adverse events associated with dietary supplements, with continued support for voluntary reporting by consumers, health care practitioners, and others; ii) Create a state-level registry of dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors doing business in New York State, or other equivalent mechanism for 1) assuring compliance with mandatory reporting of adverse events, and 2) facilitating communication with dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors; iii) Obtain statutory authorization for the Commissioner of Health to require, by regulation, specic labeling of dietary supplement packaging by manufacturers on such terms as the Commissioner may deem reasonable, and iv) Obtain statutory authorization for the Commissioner of Health to ban the sale to minors or to all persons in New York State of specic dietary supplements found by the Commissioner to be unsafe. II) The Department of Health should undertake a major public health education campaign on dietary supplements, with variations specically directed to different target groups.6. Recommendations for New York State The preceding chapters of this report detail two realities that drive these Task Force recommendations. First, consumers and health care providers have insucient information about dietary supplements to adequately as - sess their safety and eectiveness. Second, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) curtails the authority of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate dietary supplements, and does so to a degree that necessitates state action. The Task Force recommendations are spurred by concerns similar to those expressed by former FDA Chair - man David Kessler in an editorial regarding the agency's inability to respond adequately to dangers posed by supplements containing aristolochic acid: [DSHEA] does not require that dietary supplements . . . be shown to be safe or eective before they are marketed. The FDA does not scrutinize a dietary supplement before it enters the marketplace. The agency is permitted to restrict a substance if it poses a \"signicant and unreasonable\" risk under the conditions of use on the label or as commonly consumed.78The safety standard may sound as if the FDA has all the authority it needs to protect the public. The problem is that the burden of proof lies with the FDA. Even when the agency is able to act, how is it sup - posed to know which products contain aristolochic acid, and who sells them? What is the agency supposed to tell people who may have consumed these herbs? Congress has put the FDA in the position of being able to act only after the fact and after substantial harm has already occurred.1 In the opinion of the Task Force, these concerns apply to the broad range of dietary supplements. Piece - meal federal actions\u2014such as dietary supplement warnings, the pending FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), and the regulation of ephedra-based products\u2014leave consumers unprotected against dietary supplement hazards that may arise in the future. And as demonstrated in the April 2005 federal court ruling in Nutraceutical Corporation v. Crawford , DSHEA restrains the FDA even when the agency acts to restrict dietary supplement sales in the interest of public health and in a manner it considers consistent with DSHEA.2 Ad- ditionally, neither federal labeling requirements nor current public education eorts provide consumers with adequate information regarding the risks posed by certain dietary supplement products. The Task Force is aware that some proponents of federal reform are reluctant to pursue state-by-state regu - lation. Their concern is that individual state eorts will create a patchwork of regulations that impose undue burdens on industry while leaving consumers at risk. However, in the absence of eective federal regulation, the Task Force supports regulatory intervention by New York State government in order to protect the health and safety of its citizens. New York State has been a leader in this area as demonstrated by the statewide ban on ephedra supplements that preceded federal action. Because the State needs to strike a balance between protecting the public's health and ensuring consumer freedom, any action taken against unsafe supplements must be supported by reliable evidence. Currently, sci - entic data to support the safety and ecacy of most dietary supplements is rare and generally of poor quality. Research in the eld is ongoing, however, and the status of the evidence is fluid. Therefore, the state approach to dealing with unsafe supplements must be flexible in order to respond to accumulating evidence. The Task Force acknowledges that not all supplements are unsafe, and many are benecial. Therefore, strict state restriction should apply only to those supplements that are reasonably demonstrated to pose unwarranted health risks to consumers. A signicant degree of consumer freedom is appropriate unless and until reliable evidence suggests otherwise. The Task Force considers an Expert Committee as the best vehicle for balancing scientic evidence with con - sumer freedom. The following recommendations oer a vision of this Committee, including policy priorities for consideration. These recommendations will foster systematic evaluation of all available data, therefore allowing New York State to spot trends before they become immediate dangers. I) The New York State Commissioner of Health should create an Expert Committee within the Department of Health to evaluate the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements on an ongoing basis. The Expert Committee will assess available data and make specic recommendations to the Commissioner of Health. Data on the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements emerge continually from scientic research, adverse event reports, and other sources. However, information from such varied sources may not come to the attention of regulatory bodies. Therefore, the Task Force recommends that the New York State Commissioner of Health create an Expert Committee to collect and evaluate data on the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements, and to make recommendations to the New York State Department of Health (DOH).79The Expert Committee will serve as an information repository and center of analysis. As data become avail - able, the Committee will evaluate dietary supplements to determine what (if any) danger they present to the public. To review information on the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements appropriately, the Expert Com - mittee will need to utilize a framework for evaluation. The Task Force urges consideration of the \"Framework for Evaluating Safety\" recently released by the IOM.3 The Expert Committee could also create its own framework for evaluating dietary supplements. The Expert Committee's work will result in specic policy or regulatory recommendations to the Commis - sioner of Health. These recommendations might range from issuing a public advisory, to requiring additional safety warnings on dietary supplement labels, to banning the sale of a particular supplement or supplement ingredient. The recommendations might apply to specic products or to dietary supplements generally; specic options are reviewed in the following sections. The Expert Committee should consider the following policy supported by the T ask Force: i) Institute mandatory reporting by dietary supplement manufacturers, and distributors of adverse events associated with dietary supplements, with continued support for voluntary reporting by consumers, health care practitioners, and others. Mandatory reporting of serious adverse events by manufacturers and distributors doing business in New York State will assist the State in promptly identifying and addressing unsafe dietary supplements. Mandatory reporting will enhance the ability of DOH to detect patterns of illness or injury resulting from dietary supple - ment products. Both the Institute of Medicine and the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy recommended mandatory adverse event reporting at the federal level.4 As discussed in Chapter 4, these recommendations, now several years old, have yet to be enacted. New York State should require manu - facturers and distributors to maintain organized and accessible records of all adverse event reports they receive, with signicant sanctions for failure to comply. To verify compliance with mandatory reporting, it is critical to enforcement eorts to be able to access records of reports when investigating a specic supplement-related problem.5 An adequate federal apparatus for adverse event reporting would likely eliminate the need for a New York requirement; should such federal requirements later emerge, New York manufacturers, and distributors of dietary supplements will already be prepared to comply. Ecient implementation of mandatory reporting will require the State to clearly articulate its denition of a serious adverse event. The FDA has dened \"serious\" adverse events associated with medical products as those where use of the product is suspected to have resulted in: death; substantial risk of death, either at the time of the event or as a suspected result from continued use; hospitalization (initial or prolonged); disability (signicant, persistent, or permanent); congenital anomaly following use during pregnancy; requiring medical/surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.6 To dene less serious adverse events, the regulations for over-the-counter and prescription drug reporting may oer guidance.780DOH should designate specic sta who will be charged with receiving serious adverse event reports, analyz - ing data, and forwarding reports to the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) adverse event reporting system (CAERS) and/or to MedWatch. In addition to mandatory reporting by manufacturers and distributors doing business in New York, the Commissioner of Health should encourage consumers, health care practitioners, and retailers to report volun - tarily all dietary supplement-related adverse events to the FDA MedWatch or CAERS system.8 Such voluntary reports should include both serious adverse events and less serious events as well. Data on less serious events can be critical in identifying long-term health eects or toxicity from repeated use of supplements that may not cause immediate serious eects. In order to utilize this valuable information, the Expert Committee and designated DOH sta should establish a mechanism for two-way information sharing with FDA MedWatch and/or CAERS sta. Research suggests that consumers do not report adverse events associated with supplements as frequently as with drugs. A 1998 study found that 26 percent of respondents would consult their doctor for a serious ad - verse reaction to an over-the-counter medicine, but not to an herbal remedy.9 To encourage eective voluntary adverse event reporting, DOH must provide education to consumers and health care providers in identifying and addressing supplement-related events, including direct eects of supplements as well as supplement-drug interactions. Both professional and consumer education about adverse event reporting were recommended at the federal level by the Institute of Medicine in its 2005 report. The Expert Committee should consider the following policy supported by the T ask Force: ii) Create a state-level registry of dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors doing business in New York State, or other equivalent mechanism for 1) assuring compliance with mandatory reporting of adverse events, and 2) facilitating communication with dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors. One of the largest regulatory gaps left by DSHEA is the FDA's lack of authority to gather adverse event reports from supplement manufacturers and distributors. However, mandatory reporting cannot eectively be accomplished unless the State can identify those entities from which reporting is required.10 The same informa - tion will also be needed to monitor current GMPs when these come into eect. In conducting its own study on GMPs in the supplement industry in 1999, the FDA was not able to conrm that it had identied all supple - ment manufacturers in New York State, and in fact believed that it had missed a number of smaller manufactur - ers.11 Given that a subsequent survey found that small manufacturers were least likely to follow a GMP model,12 this basic lack of information highlights an additional regulatory gap that New York State must close. The Expert Committee should consider the potential role of the New York State Department of State (DOS) in assisting with the reporting requirement. DOS maintains records of most business entities, partnerships, and not-for-prot corporations in the State.13 It also registers, licenses, and regulates various businesses and practices to protect the health, safety, and welfare of consumers.14 However, the les do not identify which businesses manufacture and/or distribute dietary supplements.15 Mandating registration with DOS will allow New York State to identify and communicate with all dietary supplement manufacturers doing business in the State. It will enable the State to alert manufacturers to policy changes related to manufacturing and marketing practices and will facilitate enforcement of mandatory adverse event reporting. Dietary supplement manufacturers doing business in New York could be required to pay a fee in addition to general business registration fees. The DOS could collect this extra fee during the registration process and forward it to DOH to fund dietary supplement related activities (e.g. public education). The fees will help cover 81administrative and enforcement costs. The Task Force recognizes the regulatory burdens already imposed on businesses in New York State. However, the state requires a means to monitor compliance with adverse event reporting, as well as with proposed federal manufacturing standards. The Expert Committee should consider the following policy supported by the T ask Force: iii) Obtain statutory authorization for the Commissioner of Health to require, by regulation, specic labeling of dietary supplement packaging by manufacturers on such terms as the Commissioner may deem reasonable. Current federal dietary supplement labeling regulations fail to ensure that sucient information is provided to facilitate consumer understanding.16 Mandatory state-level labeling can address this problem by (1) alert - ing consumers that particular products have not been determined to be safe and/or eective, or (2) informing consumers of risks that are reasonably suspected, either because of clinical data or because of associated adverse events. The power to require dietary supplement labeling should be explicitly assigned by the Legislature to the Commissioner of Health. Vesting supplement labeling authority with the Commissioner of Health will likely require liaison with the State Department of Agriculture & Markets (DAM). Currently, warning labels can be mandated by regulation from the Commissioner of Agriculture & Markets. DAM is empowered to promul - gate food labeling regulations (which must comply with federal regulations), and DAM has already adopted federal food labeling regulations that include dietary supplement labeling requirements.17 Labeling requirements can be mandated for specic products. For example, the State could require products containing St. John's wort to bear information regarding the serious risks of concomitant use. Other labeling requirements could apply to any dietary supplement sold in the State of New York. For example, the Task Force rejects the blanket assumption of dietary supplement safety during pregnancy and lactation, although the dem - onstrated safety of some, such as folic acid, is recognized. Therefore, the Expert Committee should recommend that the Commissioner of Health mandate that products that have not been proven safe during pregnancy and lactation carry an appropriate warning label. Also, the Expert Committee should recommend that the Com - missioner mandate that the labels of all dietary supplement products sold in New York State bear the FDA MedWatch (adverse event reporting) toll free telephone number.18 The Expert Committee should assess how New York can access information sent directly to federal authorities, and analyze this data in conjunction with data collected within New York. The Expert Committee should consider the following policy supported by the T ask Force: iv) Obtain statutory authorization for the Commissioner of Health to ban the sale to minors or to all persons in New York State of specic dietary supplements found by the Commissioner to be unsafe. The Commissioner of Health has broad power to protect the citizens of New York against public health hazards and some of the proposed actions require no new grant of authority.19 Within current authority the Commissioner can undertake other regulatory actions at least on a temporary basis in urgent situations.20 For instance, the Commissioner may currently order people or entities to cease dangerous activities, such as the sale of a hazardous product. However, this authority requires written notice to each entity that is engaging in the dangerous activity; these entities are then permitted a hearing in not more than 15 days.21 This authority is unwieldy as a means of banning sales of an entire class of products, as opposed to a single brand manufac - tured by one company. 82New York State should authorize the Commissioner of Health to ban sales by means of a general order or emergency declaration, without the requirement to identify and serve each entity with an order. This order could be followed by a period of public comment, during which business entities will have the opportunity to be heard. At the close of the comment period, the Commissioner may choose to maintain, revise, or rescind the emergency order. Such a ban might apply to minors only, or to all consumers in New York State. The Com - missioner might exercise this new authority upon evaluation of valid evidence indicating unwarranted health risks posed by particular dietary supplements or supplement ingredients. Banning the sale of specic unsafe dietary supplements to minors. The ability of adults to make informed choices is generally presumed. Where minors are concerned, however, the assumption is dierent. Under the doctrine of parens patriae , the state accepts an obligation to protect chil- dren, in part by restricting minors' access to various products and services. The state might premise a restriction on the greater danger of physical harm to children's developing bodies, or on the presumption that minors may lack the experience and judgment to use a product responsibly. Prior to the federal ephedra ban, a few states prohibited the sale or furnishing of foods or supplements con - taining ephedrine alkaloids to minors.22 At least one state prohibits public school employees from selling or distributing to students any dietary supplement containing a \"performance-enhancing compound,\" or from endorsing or suggesting the ingestion thereof.23 New York's 1996 action against certain ephedra products, dis - cussed in Chapter 5, was the result of the products being marketed to youth as alternatives to illegal drugs.24 The Legislature should empower the Commissioner of Health to impose retail restrictions on minors' abil - ity to purchase dietary supplement products reasonably believed to present signicant dangers to their health. The Expert Committee should review promptly the evidence for banning the sale to minors of dietary supple - ments that are marketed as legal alternatives to illegal drugs. Such products can contain combinations of a wide variety of ingredients whose safety in combination is unveried; one FDA safety warning concerned a product marketed as a dietary supplement producing a \"legal high,\" but containing the controlled substances GBL and GHB, as well as sedatives and ephedrine.25 Eective regulation of dietary supplements marketed to, or particularly attractive to, minors will require liaison between DOH and other relevant state agencies, particularly the New York State Education Depart - ment (NYSED). Prohibition of the sale of certain dietary supplements to minors, would, for instance, ideally be accompanied by equivalent regulation by the NYSED prohibiting school employees from distributing such supplements to elementary or secondary students. Banning the sale of unsafe dietary supplements to all consumers in New York State. There is no general guideline for determining when a dietary supplement warrants a retail ban.26 Some factors to be considered are patterns of use or misuse among both minor and adult consumers, overall sales (taken as evidence of the number of aected consumers), and the quality of clinical and/or adverse event report evidence suggesting danger. If a supplement were found to present such a risk of harm that removal from shelves were warranted, the State could act to protect the public from imminent health hazards. Few dietary supplements are expected to present a degree of danger warranting a retail ban. However, the Expert Committee should urgently review available data and consider actions regarding the sale and/or labeling of kava, aristolochic acid, and comfrey in New York State.83II. The Department of Health should undertake a major public health education campaign on dietary supplements, with variations specically directed to dierent target groups. The Commissioner of Health should publicly disseminate information regarding the safety and ecacy of dietary supplements. DOH currently devotes considerable eort to communicating benecial health-related information to the public, but it has very rarely communicated dietary supplement-related information.27 Public advisories may be most appropriate concerning individual products or classes of products, or to create a rapid public alert to an emerging problem. DOH should undertake a broad public education campaign. The public education campaign should focus on pro - viding general information about supplement risks and benets, as well as guidance for consumers in deciding whether to purchase supplements and how to respond to adverse health eects arising from supplement use. DOH could collaborate with appropriate professional bodies and educational institutions to undertake a dietary supplement education program. Such a campaign might include advisories about specic supplement products, or general information aimed at helping consumers make informed choices about using supplements for themselves or their children. Variations in the curriculum should be specically directed to dierent target groups, including physicians and other healthcare professionals, traditional and complementary and alternative medicine practitioners; coaches and educators; parents; and adolescents. The educational campaign will include information on: the benets and risks of dietary supplements; the contraindications for dietary supplement use; the dangers of concomitant use ; the side eects of dietary supplements; how to identify and report supplement-related adverse events, including immediate and long-term health eects. The limits DSHEA places on the federal government's ability to adequately regulate dietary supplements make consumer and professional education critical. Both professionals and consumers lack reliable information about the benets and risks of dietary supplements. New York State can protect the public health by educating citizens to make safe and informed choices about the health products they purchase. * * * These recommendations strike an appropriate balance between two legitimate state purposes: respecting consumer freedom to purchase potentially benecial products, and protecting the health and safety of those consumers. The proposed Expert Committee on dietary supplements would develop state-level measures for tracking serious adverse events associated with dietary supplements, increasing supplement-related information available to consumers, and reacting to developing scientic literature on dietary supplements. An accompany - ing DOH education campaign would give consumers and health care providers a broader understanding of the potential risks and benets associated with dietary supplements, thus allowing New Yorkers to make well-in - formed choices about dietary supplements.84Notes 1.
