Melissa Liddle, PD A: The only real way to lose weight is to burn more calories than are consumed. Calories are burned at rest performing basic bodily functions. It is possible to increase metabolism which will increase the calories the body burns on its own. Some possible ways to increase metabolism include not skipping meals, eating many small meals rather than going for long period without eating and by increasing muscle mass through exercise. Cardiovascular exercise such as walking or swimming will help burn calories above and beyond what your body burns to function. Even starting with small amounts of exercise and slowly working up can be beneficial. It is important to consult with your doctor before starting an exercise program. Cutting down on calories is another way to lose weight. The combination of decreased calories with increased activities will be the most effective. Cutting calories too much is not the answer either. This puts your body into starvation mode and slows your metabolism which causes you to hold onto weight. A well-balanced diet which includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein is important. Speak with a dietician about what your dietary goals should be and a dietary plan that would be ideal for you.

Burton Dunaway, PharmD A: Deltasone prednisone is a corticosteroid, not to be confused with anabolic steroids that body builders may use, used to reduce pain caused from inflammation and swelling. For quick, acute cases, it is often given in a large dose, and then reduced in dose each day for approximately a week, until it is gone. For chronic conditions, it may be used at a constant, lower daily dose than the large burst. Short-term side effects include stomach upset, increased blood sugar levels, and insomnia. Therefore, it is recommended to be taken first thing in the morning after breakfast. However, when taking the large burst, it can be hard on the stomach, even after a full meal. For this reason, the large burst dosing may be broken into half the daily dose after breakfast and half the daily dose after lunch. The earlier in the day it is finished, the better, as it will not interfere with sleep if taken early. The dosepaks recommend it to be taken in spread out time periods throughout the day, including bedtime, to decrease the stomach upset.

Other medications you could try are Prilosec OTC, Prevacid OTC, Zegerid OTC - but I would talk to your health care provider first. I am not sure if the predinsone is interacting with any other medications you may be taking but once again talk to your provider. Before taking any OTC medications, check with your pharmacist to be sure they do not interact with any medications you may be taking. Levy, RPh A: Prednisone is an oral corticosteroid that mimics cortisol, which is secreted by the adrenal gland. The clinical use of prednisone started around 1955, and it has literally saved thousands of lives since that time. While oral prednisone therapy does have its drawbacks, some weight gain, salt and water retention, increased chance of infection. The anti-inflammitory properties and its ease of use have not been paralleled in the field of pharmacology since. When given for a specific purpose, prednisone is one of the safest, most tolerated medications in the compendium. You can also find helpful information on prednisone at. Matt Curley, PharmD A: Prednisone belongs to a class of medications called corticosteroids, and it prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. Prednisone is used to treat a variety of conditions, including skin conditions, allergy conditions, asthma, and inflammation. Its side effects include sleep problems, dry skin, dizziness, nausea, and changes in the shape of body fat. Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, are also listed as possible side effects of prednisone, but pancreatic cancer is not. For more information on prednisone, go to. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Kimberly Hotz, PharmD A: Prednisone is in a class of drugs called corticosteroids. Prednisone prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. It's used to treat many different conditions, including allergic disorders, arthritis, skin conditions, ulcerative colitis, lupus, psoriasis, and breathing disorders. Prednisone is not generally prescribed for the treatment or prevention of stroke. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, depriving the brain of oxygen. When a stroke occurs, brain cells begin to die within minutes. The use of drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines, birth control pills, estrogen replacement therapy, and binge drinking can increase the risk of having a stroke. The most common type of stroke is an ischemic stroke, which is caused by the blockage of an artery. People who have high blood pressure and high cholesterol are at an increased risk for having a stroke. Obesity and smoking are also risk factors. Lifestyle modifications may help prevent stroke. Studies suggest that a healthy diet of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, plus moderate exercise, can lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Medications that lower blood pressure are often used to treat and prevent strokes. If the stroke is caused by a blot clot, blood-thinning medications are often used. Consult with your physician for more information about treating stroke. Burton Dunaway, PharmD A: Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication that is used to treat a variety of pain and inflammatory conditions. You should take the prednisone pack exactly as it was prescribed by your physician. If the pain returns when you have completed the course of prednisone, call your physician. There are many possible risks to long-term corticosteroid therapy. Long-term use of corticosteroids can cause high blood pressure, osteoporosis, diabetes, and depression. Discuss the risks and benefits of prednisone therapy with your physician. Mobic meloxicam and Celebrex celecoxib are prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs that are effective in relieving pain and inflammation. They can increase your risk of serious gastrointestinal problems including bleeding and ulcers, but this side effect can be minimized by taking them with proton pump inhibitors PPIs such as Prilosec omeprazole or Prevacid Mobic and Celebrex are less to Yes, there is a possibility that even small doses of prednisone may cause dizziness. Dizziness is listed as one of the more common side effects of prednisone. Usually, this side effect will go away with time as your body gets adjusted to the medication. If this is not the case for you, try speaking with your doctor to see if there is another drug that you may be able to try. Megan Uehara, PharmD A: There is actually no absolute maximum dosage for prednisone. However, it is not unsafe to take higher doses. It just depends on how your body reacts to the medication and how the side effects impact you. Megan Uehara, PharmD A: I have reviewed your question regarding prednisone and your blood glucose level. Prednisone is a synthetic corticosteroid drug that is particularly effective as an immunosuppressant, and affects virtually all of the immune system. It is used to treat certain inflammatory diseases. Short-term side-effects include high blood glucose levels, especially in patients who already have diabetes mellitus. Continue to monitor your blood glucose levels and if you notice an increase, contact your physician. Joseph Hall, RPh A: Prednisone packaging does list dry skin and easy bruising as side effects. Is prednisone working at the dose you're on? Maybe you can reduce how much you take, but consult your doctor first to find out. Are you using moisturizers to help with the dry skin? If not, you could start using one multiple times of day, as needed. Patti Brown, PharmD A: Prednisone is a corticosteroid not an anabolic, which is what bodybuilders use that reduces inflammation. That having been said, NSAIDs nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can also be used for inflammation, but they're usually not as strong. If you aren't tolerating your prednisone, you can try dividing the dose between morning and afternoon, and take it after a meal. It can interfere with sleep, so the earlier in the day you take it, the better. Patti Brown, PharmD Q: About 3 weeks ago, I got poison ivy. I went to a clinic so it could be controlled. The prescription that was given was prednisone. After taking it, my rash was slowly clearing, but I started itching on my back and around the creases of my body. It then started to itch like crazy. My job is very physical, so I sweat all day. I really started to break out. I finally finished the medication 2 days ago but still have the rash and still itch but not as bad. What do you recommend? A: Your question regards developing a rash and itching after taking prednisone for treatment of poison ivy. There are different things that could cause the rash and itching. You could be allergic to the prednisone. Your poison ivy could have spread. You could have a reaction to all the sweating you have done recently. Or it could be something completely different. The recommendation is for you to talk to your health care provider regarding the rash. Your health care provider can properly diagnose what it is causing it and recommend specific treatment. If you start noticing any difficulty breathing or swelling of the throat or tongue, seek immediate emergency medical help as this would be signs of an anaphylactic reaction. Attached is a link to additional information provided by Everyday Health regarding rash. Jen Marsico, RPh A: According to Lexi-Comp, prednisone Deltasone has the associated adverse effects including fluid retention and abdominal distention. These side effects could be the cause of your swelling and discomfort. If you are experiencing pain, then it is important for you to talk to your physician regarding your symptoms. If you are eating unhealthy or in excess, then changing your diet could help you shed some pounds. Exercises can also help with weight control. Make sure that you talk with your physician before beginning an exercise program, especially since you have COPD. Please talk with your health care provider regarding your medical conditions and possible medication side effects. Jen Marsico, RPh Q: I am 63 years old. For the past year I have had constant discomfort in my neck, shoulders, hips and all up and down my back. The left side of my back was recently swollen so I went to a doctor who prescribed a 5 day series of prednisone. For a couple of weeks I felt great! No muscle-joint discomfort and my psoraisis almost cleared up. What is wrong with me that prednisone fixed? Can you take prednisone long term? A: Prednisone, in a class of drugs called steroids, prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation, and is used to treat many different conditions such as allergic disorders, skin conditions, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, or breathing disorders. Prednisone may also be used for other purposes not mentioned here. Less frequent, but more serious, side effects from prednisone include diabetes, hypertension high blood pressure , osteoporosis, suppressed immunity, impaired wound healing, peptic ulcer disease, suppression of the adrenal glands, cataracts, depression, and psychosis. Prednisone is almost never intended for long-term use. This is not a complete list of the side effects associated with prednisone. Gregory Latham, RPh A: Prednisone is a commonly used oral corticosteroid to suppress inflammation and the immune response. It is approved to treat a number of different conditions. According to the prescribing information, the most common side effects of prednisone include sleep problems, mood changes, acne, dry skin, increased sweating, nausea, stomach pain and bloating, headache, dizziness, and changes in body shape or location of body fat especially in face and neck. Corticosteroids can cause some serious side effects, especially with longer-term use. Patients taking prednisone may not be able to respond to a stressful situation, such as surgery, and they may be more likely to get an infection. Prednisone can cause high blood pressure and fluid retention, which can lead to swelling and weight gain. This effect can also lead to low levels of potassium and calcium in the blood. Patients should be aware of the signs of low potassium, such as confusion, thirst, muscle weakness or irregular heartbeat, and if they occur, contact their healthcare provider. Patients taking long-term corticosteroids are at an increased risk for osteoporosis, high blood sugar levels, high cholesterol levels, and development of cataracts. Michelle McDermott, PharmD A: Some of the side effects of prednisone may include: headache, mood changes, thin skin, acne, diabetes, loss of bone mass, glaucoma, and fluid retention. Prednisone may alter glucose regulation which can lead to high blood sugar. The risk for developing high enough blood sugar levels to warrant treatment is dependent on the dose of the corticosteroid. The higher the dose, the more likely a person is to develop high blood sugars that need to be treated. Treatment of high blood sugar or diabetes brought on by prednisone is the same as treatment for an individual with non-corticosteroid induced diabetes. Corticosteroid induced diabetes improves when the dose of the steroid is decreased. The diabetes may also go away after several months once the steroid is stopped. Prednisone is in a drug class called corticosteroids. Prednisone is used alone or combined with other medicines to treat symptoms from having low corticosteroid levels in the body. Corticosteroids are natural hormones produced by the body that are necessary for the body to function normally. Prednisone is also used in people who have normal corticosteroid levels, but who have certain medical conditions, such as arthritis, severe allergic reactions, multiple sclerosis, lupus, asthma, and other medical conditions involving the lungs, skin, eyes, kidneys, blood, thyroid, stomach, and intestines. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Kristen Dore, PharmD A: Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication which is used to treat various inflammatory conditions including temporary use for relief of allergic reactions. Side effects associated with short term use of prednisone include insomnia, stomach upset, mood changes, increased appetite, and weight gain. Prednisone can increase appetite which may lead to higher calorie intake and it may lead to fluid retention both of which can lead to weight gain. Increasing physical activity exercise can help compensate for increased caloric intake which may be associated with prednisone use. It is recommended for most individuals to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity walking, swimming, gardening, etc. Decreasing caloric intake can also help to prevent weight gain. Any water weight gained while on prednisone will likely go away once the medication is stopped. You may wish to talk with your doctor about options for weight loss. A registered dietician can provide specific dietary advice. If prednisone is taken once daily, it should be taken in the morning. Take prednisone with food to prevent stomach upset. Take prednisone as directed by your doctor. Do not suddenly stop prednisone unless directed by your doctor to do so. Be sure to inform your doctor and pharmacist of all the medications you take, including over the counter medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements so they can monitor for drug interactions. It is also important to discuss any adverse effects from medications with your doctor. Laura Cable, PharmD Q: When my eczema and dermatitis worsen, prednisone gets it under control. I was told by a doctor that if I did not take it long term and had 30 days or more in between the times I needed to take it, it would not cause any major side effects. Am I better off with a steriod shot or the pills for 10 days? A: Studies have shown that patients taking prednisone may experience possible side effects such as weight gain, risk of infections, headache, high blood pressure, fluid retention, bruising of the skin and possible insomnia. Prednisone belongs to a class of medications called corticosteroids. Corticosteriods are usually used for the anti-inflammatory effects. Whether the formulation is by oral administration or by injection, possible side effects will primarily be the same as mentioned above. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about any side effects you may be experiencing or your concerns regarding repeated use of prednisone. Consult with them regarding all other prescription or over-the-counter medications you may be taking in combination which can cause other potential side effects or drug interactions. Your healthcare provider should be able to discuss the best treatment options with you. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Anissa Lee, RPh A: Prednisone is classified in a class of drugs called steroids. The medication prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. Prednisone is used to treat many different conditions such as allergic disorders, skin conditions, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, or breathing disorders. Steroids can interact with other medications. Some drugs include aspirin taken on a daily basis or at high doses , diuretics water pills , a blood , cyclosporine Gengraf, Neoral, Sandimmune , take by mouth, ketoconazole Nizoral , rifampin, or certain seizure medications, such as phenytoin Dilantin or phenobarbital. There may be other drugs that can interact with prednisone. Tell your doctor about all the prescription and over-the-counter medications you take.

A: A drug allergy occurs when the body's immune system reacts to the medication as if it were a foreign invader. These reactions can range from a mild skin rash to a severe life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. For severe reactions, emergency medical treatment is needed. However, other reactions, such as hives, can usually be managed at home. The first step in treating a drug reaction is to stop the medication that has caused the reaction. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. The length of treatment can depend on a few factors, for example, how long it takes the body to clear out the offending drug. Corticosteroids may be needed for an extended period up to a week to 10 days in order to clear a drug reaction. Sometimes, your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid taper that starts with a high dose and slowly decreases the dose over a few days. Follow your doctor's instructions and the directions on your prescription label. If your hives continue, consult your doctor for specific treatment recommendations. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or local pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Sarah Lewis, PharmD A: According to the prescribing information, prednisone is used for multiple sclerosis during acute exacerbations relapses of the disease. Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Prednisone works for MS by helping to decrease the inflammation in the central nervous system. Prednisone is not the only steroid that may be used to treat the exacerbations of MS. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, dexamethasone, betamethasone, and prednisolone are also used. Methylprednisolone, another corticosteroid, has also been used to treat MS exacerbations. There is no set course of therapy determined for corticosteroid use in MS. Some people are given intravenous corticosteroids over a period of a few days, while other people take oral by mouth corticosteroids. Prednisone works by changing the way the immune system works to decrease inflammation, redness, and pain. Some of the other conditions prednisone can be used for include: arthritis, severe allergic reactions, and lupus. Some of the common side effects of corticosteroids include trouble sleeping, mood changes, nausea, nervousness, sweating, and increased appetite. Taking prednisone with food may help with the nausea. Taking prednisone in the morning may help to alleviate the insomnia. However it is important to take prednisone exactly how the doctor or health care provider prescribes it to you. Prednisone does affect how the immune system works. Prednisone may make a person more susceptible to getting an infection. Contact your health care provider if you experience any sign of infection, including fever, cough, sneezing, or sore throat. Kristen Dore, PharmD A: Prednisone is a corticosteroid which is used to treat various inflammatory conditions. According to the prescribing information for prednisone, long term use of prednisone may require increased dietary intake of vitamin B6, vitamin C, vitamin D, folate, calcium, and phosphorus. Decreased sodium intake may also be necessary. Because herbs and supplements are not strictly regulated by the U. Food and Drug Administration, these products are not required to be tested for effectiveness, purity, or safety. In general, dietary supplements should only be taken under the supervision of your health care provider. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Laura Cable, PharmD A: Prednisone is a medication that is in the class of medications called steroids that are used to treat inflammation and to suppress immune system responses. The prescribing information does not list muscle cramps as a common side effect of prednisone. The most common short-term side effects are stomach upset, headaches, insomnia, and irritability. The long-term side effects include: weight gain, fluid retention, acne, loss of muscle tone, and fat deposits in the neck, back and belly. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Lori Poulin, PharmD A: Prednisone belongs to a class of drugs called corticosteroids. It works to decrease inflammation and change how the body's immune system responds to stimulation. Prednisone is used to treat a variety of conditions, including severe allergic reactions, asthma, respiratory disorders, arthritis, skin disorders, colitis, lupus, and various cancers. The dosing of prednisone varies depending on the reason it is being used and the severity of the condition. Typically, prednisone is started at a high dose and then it is tapered down over time, usually a couple of weeks. Common side effects of prednisone include insomnia, dizziness, vertigo spinning sensation , mood changes, nervousness, increased appetite, nausea, stomach pain, indigestion, acne, and increased sweating. Long-term use of prednisone can result in cataracts, glaucoma, increased blood pressure, increased cholesterol, increased risk of getting infections, thinning skin, osteoporosis, and changes in the distribution of body fat. Not all of these effects will happen in every person and there is no particular dose at which they start. Doctors generally become concerned when a patient has needed at least 10 mg of prednisone for a year or more. This is not a complete list of the side effects and risks associated with prednisone. Your doctor is best able to properly evaluate your overall medical condition and make recommendations based on your specific circumstances. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Sarah Lewis, PharmD A: Prednisone is one of a group of corticosteroids cortisone-like medicines that are used to relieve inflammation in different parts of the body. Corticosteroids are used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis MS for the management of acute exacerbations because they have the capacity to close the damaged blood-brain barrier and reduce inflammation in the central nervous system. Although prednisone is among the most commonly used corticosteroids in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, it is only one of several different possibilities. Other commonly used corticosteroids include dexamethasone, betamethasone and prednisolone. The initial dose of prednisone varies depending on the condition being treated and the age of the patient, so it is a very individualized treatment option. However, some studies have showed efficacy in treating acute multiple sclerosis relapses with up to 1500 mg of prednisone per day for very short intervals, such as two to three days. Most neurologists, treating multiple sclerosis, believe that high-dose corticosteroids given intravenously are the most effective treatment for a multiple sclerosis exacerbation, although the exact protocol for the drug's use may differ somewhat from one treating physician to another. For more specific information, consult with your doctor or pharmacist for guidance based on your health status and current medications, particularly before taking any action. Crystal Riley, PharmD A: Prednisone is a synthetic corticosteroid, a glucocorticoid, used to treat many different conditions such as allergic disorders, skin conditions, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, or breathing disorders. Complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment. In general, taking prednisone for long periods of time may cause increased facial hair, fracture of weight bearing bones legs and hips , glaucoma, higher risk of getting blood clots and swelling of your face. These are not all the possible side effects that can occur with prednisone.
