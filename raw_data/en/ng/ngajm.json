We share our site with a major London teaching hospital which is both on the clinical frontline for a diverse local community and a centre of excellence for specialist research. You'll study in a clinical and academic research setting with like-minded individuals, mixing with the many different healthcare professionals you will go on to work alongside throughout your career. We also have the latest research equipment and resources including state-of-the-art advanced bio-imaging technology and cutting-edge laboratory facilities. We have a range of specialist health and academic facilities to support your learning, listed below. Laboratories Our teaching laboratories are fully fitted with equipment for biological, chemistry, biomedical, molecular biology and pharmacy practicals. This includes microscopes, spectrophotometers, DMA amplifiers, organ baths and specialist glassware. We also have audio visual equipment installed, so that microscope images can be projected on to large screens. Furthermore, the students will have on their disposal tissue culture facilities, flow cytometry, use of pathogen containment facilities and well animal research facilities. Image Resource Facility (IRF) First established in 1979, the IRF has developed to encompass Light Microscopy, Electron Microscopy, and sample preparation for both, all housed in a single department providing a range of imaging analysis options and the expertise to compliment them. Users of the IRF have the ability to image histology samples, cells and molecules of all varieties, and model organisms such as zebrafish using any of the light microscope, slide scanning, or electron microscope systems we maintain, supported by experienced staff at all stages of analysis. Dissecting room The dissecting room is where present and future healthcare professionals and scientists in the hospital and University learn or refresh their anatomy knowledge directly from the human body, through access to cadaveric material and models, and plastinated (preserved) specimens. Please note: [The Dissecting Room](/study/life-at-st-georges/campus-life/educational-facilities/the-dissecting-room) is currently closed while we complete extensive improvement works. We hope we will be able to resume practical teaching in our facility in early 2023. Pathology museum Our on-site museum houses a collection of over 2,000 pathological specimens, including a number of original specimens donated by Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie in 1843. This space is used for small group tutorials by students across all of our courses as an educational tool to help you understand the mechanisms of disease. Library and learning technology Our modern health sciences library offers a wide range of books, e-books, academic journals and other resources to support you. You will also have access to online resources, such as the Canvas virtual learning environment and our Hunter discovery service to help you find the information you need. The library is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and comprises silent, quiet and group learning areas, as well as four group discussion rooms. IT facilities We have five computer suites housing 260 workstations. Three of these suites are accessible 24 hours a day. It's easy to find a free space with our handy real-time computer locator. We also have 75 self-service laptops available. Free Wi-Fi covers the whole campus, including all accommodation. You can use these resources to access your course materials, discussion boards and feedback through Canvas. "}
