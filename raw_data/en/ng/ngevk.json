It is made seasonally to honor the Goddesses of the various seasons. The elixir is made with select crystal, herbs, and floral essences to match the current season. The current Sacred Temple Water is made with the essence of Larimar, Silver Topaz, Turquoise crystals, Sage and Jasmine herbs, and Hibiscus flowers. These essences are made using a special process by our Certified Crystal Alchemists. You can read more about the process below. The result is a powerful elixir with all of the essences of summer Goddesses and healing. EarthSong Premium Crystal Elixirs are made by our Certified Crystal Alchemists using the guidance of the Crystal Alchemist Handbook. Each crystal essence is made from special Reiki \"Water Dia Ko Mio\" attuned crystals. The attunement by our Reiki Masters draws on the Reiki energy of the Universe and the power of the Moon to attune the crystalline core matrix of the crystals to the energy of flowing love. This attunement aligns and focuses the crystal's energy to potentialize loving reiki energy into water helping to shape and enhance the transfer of crystal energy into the water forming a powerful crystal essence. Healing Essences: Here is a list of the essences you'll find included in this elixir and the healing power that they offer. TRANQUILITY from Larimar. Larimar cools tempers, calms fears, relieves stress, and nurtures the physical and emotional bodies. It is a crystal of serenity, promoting relaxation in every aspect. It is also a powerful emotional cleanser and healer, especially for phobias, panic attacks, stress-related imbalances, and excessive anger or fear. UNDERSTANDING from Silver Topaz. Silver Topaz embodies the energy of the spirit and opens one's senses to the essence of the Self. It brings an awareness of one's thoughts and deeds and the karmic effect these have, as well as a cosmic awareness and understanding of the \"big \"picture\" and how one fits into it all. Stimulating the Crown and etheric chakras, this high-vibrational crystal dissolves mental attachments and purifies emotions, helping to heal the soul. PROTECTION from Turquoise. Turquoise is the most efficient healer, providing solace for the spirit and well-being of the body. It is perhaps the oldest stone in man's history, the talisman of kings, shamans, and warriors. It is a stone of protection, strong and opaque, yet soothing to the touch. It is a strengthening stone, good for exhaustion, depression, or panic attacks. It enhances physical and psychic immune systems. RELIEF from Jasmine. Jasmine has been used for centuries as everything from an antidepressant to an aphrodisiac. Its most well-known use now is for the relief of stress, anxiety, and depression. Its essence brings us the relief we seek and need. REMOVE NEGATIVITY from Sage. Sage is an ancient spiritual tool that is most often used to clear negative energy and entities from an area. Sage has also been used for hundreds of years to connect to the spiritual realm or enhance intuition. BALANCE from Hibiscus. Hibiscus is known to help restore balance within the emotional and spiritual system. It awakens us to aspects of knowledge and wisdom of our core essence. It is also said to enhance our creativity and imagination while attracting positive energy. Source: Crystal Alchemists of EarthSong Studios Size: 30ml bottle containing approximately 600 drops About this Elixir: In the many belief systems of the Divine Feminine the followers of the Goddesses honored them with rituals and gifts. The intent was to gain her favor and blessings for the needs and desires of her followers. Many temples had pools and waterfalls where sacred waters flowed to bring the life-giving power of water to both the goddess and her devoted. Such waters were created and maintained by the priestesses. Rituals were created to consecrate and bless the waters. We are confident special crystals and ceremonial chants were often used. The Sacred Temple waters here at the Crystal Vaults are made in our Sacred Space using the finest crystals and ceremonies honoring the goddesses of the temple for the season. Our sacred space is very carefully set up as a Temple to the Goddesses following our guide to creating a Sacred Space. We then add the crystals, flowers, and herbs we find to work the best together while honoring the specific goddesses of the season. Our rites of Temple Waters are carefully aligned with the movement and energy of the Moon assuring her energy and influences are aligned. We use and study the Mansions of the Moon religiously knowing their profound influence on the potency and efficacy of sacred waters. The results are a very select and limited series of Sacred Temple Waters of the Goddesses. The current seasonal Sacred Temple Waters honor the Goddesses of summer including Auxo, the Greek Goddess of Growth, Hegemone, the Greek Goddess of Plants, and S\u00f3l, the Norse Goddess of the Sun. Primary Uses: These waters have many uses in your life. They bring the blessing of several Goddesses to your life and spirit. They are easy to use and contain nothing but pure natural water and the energy and blessings of the Goddesses. They can be used as daily tonics, in a relaxing bath, or in crystal healing regimes. They can be very effective in Crystal Magic rituals - where our Crystal Masters have been using them extensively. If you are seeking the intercession of benign spirits that personify the glory of the creation in its many aspects and you want to bring their blessings and help into your life you will find these Sacred Temple Waters to be effective, easy to use, and powerful.
