The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked, by the European Commission, to prepare an Opinion on the risks to human health related to the presence of perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) in food, and to consider existing hazard assessments and available occurrence data. The COT is reviewing this Opinion and will publish the statement once it is finalised. 2. The Opinion w as out for public consultation in March 2020 and was discussed by the COT at their meeting in March and at a subsequent additional meeting in April. The additional meeting took place as the Abraham et al. (2020) study on which the health- based guidance value was based had been published subsequent to the March COT meeting. The Committee were able to access the full manuscript and undertake a more thorough review of the work carried out by EFSA in the draft Opinion. A first draft statement was presented to the COT in December 2020. The minutes from the additional COT meeting on the draft EFSA PFAS Opinion and the December COT meeting are available on the COT website. 3. At the December meeting the COT had requested some additional information to be added to, or changes to be made to, the draft statement. A second draft of the statement is presented to Members (Annex A). 4. Members had requested that some context be added to the introduction section, by explaining where the chemicals originated from and some context on exposure, particularly during pregnancy. 5. The Committee had requested that the statement made it clear that the exposures to PFA Ss were all estimates, and that the breast milk exposures were very conservative and were skewed by a data set from Spain. 6. Members asked to see exposures calculated for air, dust, soil and water, where the necessary data to conduct these calculations were available. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 2 7. The Committee generally agreed with the draft conclusions but wanted more detailed descriptions of the uncertainties regarding hazards, exposure estimates, and the possible impacts. 8. This second draft statement includes exposures calculated by the secretariat for drinking w ater, household dust and indoor air. Additional background information has been included and further consideration of the uncertainties. Questions for the Committee Members are invited to read the Opinion and Annex attached as Annexes on this paper and comment on the approach used by EFSA. i. Do Members require any further information to be provided in this statement? ii. Do Members have any comments on the exposure calculations and/or the associated uncertainties. iii. Do Members agree with the conclusions and uncertainties of this draft statement? iv. Do the Members have any further comments? Secretariat June 2021 This is a draft statement for discussion.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked by the European Commission to prepare an O pinion on the risks to human health related to the presence of perfluoroalkylated substances (PFASs) in food, and to consider existing hazard assessments and available occurrence data. 2. The COT are reviewing the EFSA Opinion and considering the outputs alongside UK exposure data to assess the potential risks to the UK population from PFASs (predominantly through exposure via the diet ). Background 3. There are differing definitions for PFAS s but in the 2020 EFSA opinion they are (R-X) substances where R is a hydrophobic alkyl chain of varying length (typically C4- C16) and X is a hydrophilic end group. The hydrophobic part (R) may be fully or partially fluorinated. T he PFASs are highly persistent due to the strong covalent C -F bond. Many PFASs are potential precursors of other PFASs (EFSA, 2018). These precursor s are not usually environmentally persistent but may be transformed to more persistent PFASs , in the environment through biodegradation. (EFSA, 2020). Figure 1. General structure of PFASs 3. In their current Opinion EFSA consider 27 PFASs covering 9 groups. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 4 Perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids PFASs are reported to be, or have been, used in a wide range of products including: \"oil -, water - and stain resistant coatings for clothing, personal protective equipment, workwear, leather and carpets; oil -resistant coatings for food contact materials; aviation hydraulic fluids; fire- fighting foams; paints, adhesives, waxes and polishes; in industrial applications as surfactants, emulsifiers and coatings and personal care products including cosmetics\". The production volume for each of these uses is not publicly available. Their use in a wide range and numerous applications and products is predominantly due to their unique propert ies including: the ability to create stable foams, chemical resistance and surface tension lowering properties. (EFSA, 2020) . 5. The 27 PFASs considered by EFSA in their 2020 Opinion are surfactants, intermediate environmental transformation products, surface protection products or major raw materials for surfactant and surface protection products. There are at least 3,000 PFASs on the global market , however , there is very little information on the production and use for most . Therefore, it is generally not known how much has been, or will be, released, transformed and accumulated in the environment . PFASs may be released into the environment during production, use and disposal . Due to their persistence and relatively water -soluble nature, many of these compounds may be transported long distances in water and also as aerosols . (EFSA, 2020). 6. PFASs are present in food, mainly through two processes : accumulation in aquatic and terrestrial food chains and transfer from contact materials used in food packaging and processing. PFASs have been measured in 'fish', 'eggs and egg products', ' livestock meat', 'fruit and fruit This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 5 products', drinking water', 'vegetable and vegetable products' , 'alcoholic beverages', ' food for infants and small children'1, Legislation 7. The legal status of PFOS and PFOA has been summarised in the 2018 EFSA Scientific Opinion (EFSA, 2018). In and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (PFOSF) , is now listed in Annex I of the POP regulation2 and added to Annex B (Restriction) of the Stockholm Convention. PFOS is not allowed for use in the production of plastics food contact materials (FCM)3. Under Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 the use of PFOS and PFOS related substances are prohibited. There is only one time-limited exemption remaining: the use of PFOS as a mist s uppressant for non-decorative hard chromium (VI) plating in closed loop systems (EA) 8. PFOA also has a number of restrictions placed on it within the European Union2,4. 9. Currently, no other PFASs addressed in the EFSA 2020 Opinion have been legally restricted in Europe with respect to production, marketing or use. There are a number of initiated or ongoing activities which aim to reduce human and environmental risk connected to a number of the PFASs discu ssed in the 2020 EFSA Opinion. (EFSA, 2020). Previous evaluations 10. EFSA considered evaluations on PFOS and PFOA that had been carried out since their O pinion from 2018 and previous risk assessments for PFASs other than PFOS and PFOA. 11. The 2018 EFSA O pinion (EFSA, 2018) included tolerable weekly intakes (TWIs) of 13 and 6 ng/kg bw per week for PFOS and PFOA, respectively. These were based on human epidemiological studies. For PFOS, the increase in serum total cholesterol in adults, and the decrease in antibody response at vaccination in children were identified as the critical effects. Increase in serum total cholesterol was the critical effect identified for 1 These food groups have the highest mean lower bound levels for one or more of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and/or PFHxS. 2 Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on persistent organic pollutants.

Reduced birth weight was also considered for both compounds and increased prevalence of high serum levels of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for PFOA. 12. Risk assessments have also been carried out by : i. the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (2012) which assessed (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, 2012) ii. the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (2015) which reviewed FOSA (Danish EPA, 2015) iii. the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES) published an opinion on PFBA, PFHxA, PFBS and 2015). iv. the German H uman Biomonitoring (HBM) Commission established drinking and FOSA.

Summary of 2020 EFSA evaluation Toxicokinetics 13. This new Opinion reviews data on the toxicokinetics of PFASs in animals and humans. PFOS and PFOA toxicokinetics studies published prior to 2017 are included in previous EFSA O pinions. Additional studies published since 2017 are analysed and reported in th e 2020 Opinion. Experimental animals 14. Most of the information on the fate of PFASs and PFCAs is based on PFOS and PFOA, respectively. These compounds are readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in mammals and distribute predominantly to the plasma and liver. PFOS and PFAO are not metabolised and are excreted in both urine and faeces. They may be subject to extensive enterohepatic recirculation. Serum elimination half -lives for PFOS in rats and mice were slightly longer than one month and in rabbits and monkeys were 3- 4 months. Significant sex differences are observed in the elimination of PFOA in some species such as rats , for which half -lives may vary from a few hours in females , to several days in males. These differences in biological half -lives are mainly due to differences in renal clearance. For both PFOS and PFOA, maternal transfer occurs prenatally to the fetus through placental transfer and postnatally through the consumption of maternal milk. Humans 15. Based on the high concentrations of PFAS s observed in the blood of individuals exposed to contaminated water and by what is known for PFOS and PFOA, it may be assumed that the GI absorption of most of the PFASs occurs to a significant extent in humans. PFASs are widely distributed with the highest concentrations found in blood, liver and kidney. PFASs in blood bind to albumin. PFSA and PFCA metabolism has never been observed, however, precursor compounds such as FTOHs and PAPs can be biotransformed in humans to PFCAs and other metabolites. 16. PFASs are eliminated in urine and faeces , breast milk is also a substantial route of excretion. Shorter chain PFCAs are preferentially excreted in urine, whereas longer chain PFASs are preferentially eliminated through the bile and subsequently, the faeces. Ex tensive uptake from enterohepatic circulation and reabsorption by organic anion transporters ( OATs ) in the kidneys are believed to be more active processes in humans compared to rodents, slowing down the excretion of these substances. 17. Short chain PFASs were found to have half -lives ranging from a few days to approximately one month, whereas estimated half -lives for PFHxS, This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 8 PFOS, PFOA and PFNA can exceed 3 years and be up to approximately 8.5 years . 18. PFOS and PFOA have been detected in umbilical cord blood which indicates that transfer of PFAS to the fetus occurs during pregnancy. The transfer rates of these chemicals vary with structure with longer chain lengths and a terminal sulfonate group associated with lower fetal/maternal ratios. Toxicity Observations in animals 19. Studies on effects following repeated exposures to PFOS and PFOA published prior to 2017 have been reviewed in previous EFSA O pinions. This cover paper summarises the toxicity of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and PFHxS where the information is available or more general ly for PFCAs and PFSAs. Some toxicity data are available for other PFASs. More detail on all of these studies is covered in the EFSA O pinion and in more detail in Appendi ces D to I of the opinion. Effects following repeated exposure 20. The most consistent and sensitive endpoint for PFCAs following repeated exposures was increased relative liver weight, especially in male rodents. Disturbances in lipid metabolism, hepatotoxic effects and signs of cholestasis were mostly evident at higher doses concentrations. For some PFCAs increased relative kidney weight, alterations of the nasal cavity and olfactory epithelium and disturbed thyroid hormone levels were among the most sensitive endpoints. 21. The most sensitive endpoint for perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), PFHxS and PFOS was an elevated absolute and relative liver weight. At higher dose levels, disturbed lipid metabolism, necrosis and inflammation in the liver were observed. Alterations in the kidney and disturbed thyroid hormones were repeatedly documented. Developmental and reproductive toxicity 22. The 2018 EFSA O pinion documented reproductive and developmental toxicity studies for PFOS and PFOA published between 2008 and 2016. These studies are included in Appendix F of the current (2020) Opinion (Tables F.6 - F.8). Also included in these tables are some key studies evaluated by EFSA in their 2008 O pinion on PFOS and PFOA (EFSA, 2008) . 23. Developmental studies on PFOS show effects in offspring at doses similar to, or below , those showing maternal toxicity. Among effects observed in rats and/or mice are high mortality early after birth, reduced fetal weight, reduced postnatal growth, increased liver weight, anasarca, impaired immune This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 9 effects, cardiac abnormalities, cleft palate, delayed oss ification of bones and a decrease in placental weight and capacity. The most sensitive endpoints were increase in liver weight, effects on placental physiology and aspects of glucose homeostasis. 24. The most sensitive developmental outcome for PFOA exposure was impaired development of mammary glands. 25. The most sensitive endpoint after gestational exposure to PFNA was increased liver weight in both maternal and offspring CD -1 mice, and a reduction in postnatal weight gain in F1. Other observed effects included delay in development, increase in neonatal mortality, decreased sperm production, decrease in cholesterol, steroidogenic enzymes and testosterone, as well as decreased number of pups in the next generation. 26. The most sensitive reproductive endpoint for PFHxS exposure was reduced litter size. Increased liver weight of dams was also observed. In general, gestational exposure to PFHxS produces effects in offspring animals at doses which are equal to or higher than those inducing responses in parental animals. Neurotoxicity 27. In 2018, EFSA concluded that both PFOS and PFOA exert developmental neurotoxic effects in rodents. The behavioural analysis showed that the most frequent alterations observed are related to locomotor activity. PFOS exposure mostly decreased spontaneous activity, while PFOA increased it. In several neurodevelopmental exposure studies, a sex -related difference has been observed with males being more sensitive than females. No new relevant neurotoxicity studies in experimental animals were identified. 28. One study evaluated by EFSA shows that PFHxS can also decrease locomotor activity in rodents. Immunotoxicity 29. The majority of studies on the immunotoxicity of PFOS had already been ass essed in the 2018 O pinion and are reviewed again in the current Opinion. The studies have different study designs, durations, use different strains of mice or rats, applied different doses of PFOS and investigated different parameters that may highlight effects on the immune system. Two immunotoxicity studies had been published since the 2018 O pinion and are reviewed in this O pinion. 30. This literature support s the view that PFOS exposure, possibly more than PFOA, causes immunosuppression, as evidenced by decreased antibody responses to sensitisation to an antigen, and that suppressed immune functionality may lead to reduced resistance to infection. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 10 31. Immunotoxicity studies for PFOA were reviewed in the previous Opinion and nothing additional has been published since then. The effects of PFOA in mice are similar to those of PFOS, with both structural and functional parameters influenced. However, the effects were observed at higher doses than with PFOS. 32. Data on PFAS other than PFOS and PFOA are rather limited with studies only available for PFNA and PFDA. Genotoxicity 33. The CONTAM Panel reviewed the studies for genotoxicity for PFOS and PFOA in the 2018 O pinion and concluded that the available data were inconclusive. There was no evidence for a direct genotoxic mode of action for PFOS or PFOA. There has been some evidence for oxidative stress induction by both compounds. Three new studies and two NTP reports have been published since the 2018 O pinion but these do not change the conclusion reached in that Opinion. 34. For PFASs other than PFOS and P FOA the CONTAM Panel concluded that the study and data availability are limited. Due to structural similarity between PFOA and PFNA and between PFOS and PFHxS and some for oxidative stress induc tion by PFNA and PFHxS it is unlikely that there is a direct genotoxic mode of action for PFNA and PFHxS. Long- term toxicity and carcinogenicity 35. Long- term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of PFOS PFOA reviewed by EFSA previously (EFSA, 2008; EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2018) showed that both compounds are tumour promoters in rodent liver and PFOA may also induce Leydig cell tumours in rats. No new carcinogenicity studies were identified. 36. A few studies were available for long- term and carcinogenic assessment of other PFASs. A long- term study for PFHxA only , provided no evidence for any carcinogenicity. PFNA and PFDA showed a tumour promoting capacity in a trout two- stage model of hepatoc arcinogenesis, while 8:2FTOH failed to do so. For the remaining PFASs considered in this O pinion there is no information on their carcinogenic potential. Observations in humans Fertility and pregnancy outcomes Birth weight 37. In the 2018 O pinion on PFOS and PFOA, the CONTAM Panel reviewed 13 prospective studies and four cross -sectional studies that had This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 11 examined associations between PFOS and/or PFOA and birth weight. Relatively modest but consistent inverse associations with birth weight wer e observed for both compounds. This association may be partly confounded by physiological changes in pregnancy. The CONTAM Panel concluded that there may still be an association between PFOS and PFOA exposure and birth weight. 38. Since the 2018 EFSA Opinion, eight new studies have been published on PFOS and PFOA. N one of these studies contradicted the conclusion from the 2018 Opinion that \"there may well be a causal association between PFOS and PFOA and birth weight\". 39. For PFASs other than PFOS and PFOA, concentrations in studies were generally much lower compared to PFOS and PFOA and inconsistent associations with birth weight were observed. Preterm delivery, time to pregnancy, miscarriage and hypertension in pregnancy - preeclampsia 40. Studies for the above four endpoints were reviewed by the CONTAM Panel in 2018 and for each there was insufficient evidence to suggest that PFOS and/or PFOA exposures were associated with the effect. There was one study which had been published which looked at preterm del ivery , but the data w ere in line with the conclusions of the 2018 Opinion. Developmental effects 41. The CONTAM Panel reviewed studies on developmental effects and PFOS and PFOA in the 2018 Opinion. Studies for PFASs other than PFOS and PFOA were reviewed for the current Opinion. For all PFASs the CONTAM Panel concluded that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that PFASs may affect neurobehavioural development or overweight . Neurotoxic outcomes 42. Studies for PFOS and PFOA were reviewed for the 2018 Opinion and other PFASs were reviewed for the current Opinion. The CONTAM Panel concluded that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that exposures to PFASs may adversely affect neurobehavioural, neuropsychiatric and cognitive outcomes. Immune outcomes Asthma and allergies in children in adults 43. In the 2018 Opinion, the available studies were reviewed for PFOS and PFOA and the Panel concluded \"that there is not much evidence to suggest that PFOS or PFOA are associated with asthma and allergies in This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 12 children and adults\". Since then, five new prospective studies have been published and reviewed by the CONTAM Panel for PFOS, PFOA and all other PFASs. These new studies did not change the conclusion from the previous 2018 Opinion. 44. The CONTAM Panel also reviewed any studies for PFASs other than PFOS and PFOA. The CONTAM Panel concluded that the available evidence was insufficient to suggest that exposures with PFASs are associated with allergy and asthma in children and adults. Vaccination response 45. In the previous Opinion on PFOS and PFOA six studies were reviewed. Since then, three more studies have been published. A summary of all of the studies is provided in paragraph 44. The 2 studies (Grandjean et al. , 2012; Abraham et al. , 2020) used in the pr ocess of the derivation of the HBGV are described in more detail in this draft statement (paragraphs 37 - 40 and 41 - 42, respectively) and appendices L and K of EFSA (2020) for the Grandjean et al. and Abraham et al. studies , respectively . 46. Grandjean et al. (2012) examined associations between both pre- (gestation week 32) and postnatal (5 years) serum concentrations of PFASs and offspring antibody concentrations against tetanus and diphtheria following booster vaccination at age 5 years (cohort 3, n=456- 587, 1997- 2000). Post- natally, serum PFASs and pre- booster antibody concentrations were measured at a mean age (SD) of 5.0 (0.1) years. Serum antibody response was then measured about 4 weeks after booster vaccination and at offspring age 7.5 (0.1) years. The median concentrations for antibody titres to tetanus were 0.22 IU/mL at 5 years pre- booster, 35 IU/mL at 5 years post booster and 1.6 IU/mL at 7.5 years. For diphtheria the corresponding numbers were 0.12, 13.0 and 0.68 IU/m, respectively. Associations between offspring PFAS concentrations at age 5 pre- booster with antibody titres at age 5 years post- booster and 7.5 years post -booster can be interpreted as a short - and long- term influence on the efficacy of the booster vaccination, respectively. T his study is interventional as well as observational. The large increase in antibody concentration is initiated through vaccination and this increase is examined in relation to baseline PFASs concentrations. The interpretation of associations reported between maternal PFAS concentrations and offspring antibody concentrations during childhood are, however, more challenging, as several vaccinations are administered from birth at various timepoints. Furthermore, among breastfed infants, maternal PFAS concentrations are, due to exposure through breastfeeding, strong determinants of offspring concentrations duri ng the first few years of life. Several associations were explored in this study and the results are summarised below: 47. Association between maternal PFAS concentrations and antibody concentrations at ages 5 (pre- and post -booster) and 7.5: This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 13 PFOS: Mean concentration in maternal serum was 27.3 ng/mL. Each 2-fold increase in maternal PFOS concentrations was associated with - 39 % (95 % CI: -55, -17) and - 21 % (95 % CI: -38, 1) decrease in diphtheria antibody concentrations at 5 years pre- and post -booster, respec tively. Non -significant but inverse direction associations were observed for tetanus antibody concentrations. PFHxS: Maternal concentrations of PFHxS (mean: 4.4 ng/mL) were not associated with antibody concentrations to tetanus or diphtheria at age 5 years pre- and post -booster. PFOA: Maternal concentrations of PFOA (mean: 3.2 ng/mL) showed a non-significant inverse association with antibody concentrations to diphtheria at age 5 years pre- and post -booster while the associations for tetanus were in opposite directions at pre - and post -booster, neither of them being significant. PFNA: Similar to PFOA, maternal concentrations of PFNA (mean: 0.6 ng/mL) showed a non- significant inverse association with antibody concentrations to diphtheria at age 5 years pre- and post -booster , while the associations for tetanus were centred around the NULL. PFDA: Maternal concentrations of PFDA (mean: 0.3 ng/mL) were significantly and inversely associated with antibody concentrations to diphtheria (around 20 % decrease per 2- fold increase) at age 5 years pre- and post -booster. No association was observed for tetanus. Combined exposures: Structural equations were used to evaluate the associations for combined exposure to PFOS, PFHxS and PFOA during pregnancy and in relation to offspring antibody response to diphtheria and tetanus at age 5.0 years pre -booster and at age 7.5 years pre- booster. A 2 -fold increase in maternal concentrations during pregnancy was significantly associated wi th -48 % (95 % CI: -68, -16) and -42 % (95 % CI: - 66, -1) decrease in serum antibody response to diphtheria at age 5 pre- booster and age 7.5 post -booster, respectively. No associations were observed for tetanus. 48. Offspring PFAS concentrations at age 5 and offspring antibody concentrations at ages 5 and 7.5 years: PFOS: Each 2- fold increase in offspring PFOS concentrations at 5 years pre- booster (mean 16.7 ng/mL) was associated with - 29 % (95 % CI: -46, -6) and -24 % (95 % CI: - 44, 4) change in post -booster antibody response to tetanus at ages 5- year and 7.5 years, respectively. The corresponding estimates for diphtheria were -16 % (95 % CI: - 32, 4) and - 28 % ( -46, -3), respectively. PFHxS: At age 5 years pre- booster, 2- fold offspring concentrations of PFHxS (0.6 ng/mL) were significantly associated with - 19 % (95 % CI: - 30, -7) lower tetanus antibody concentration at 5 years post -booster This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 14 and -20 % (95 % CI: - 32, -6) lower concentration was observed for diphtheria for these two timepoints. PFOA: At 5 yea rs of age, pre- booster offspring concentrations of PFOA (4.1 ng/mL) showed a weak but inverse association with antibody response to tetanus and diphtheria post-booster at age 5 years (6- 13 % decrease). At age 7.5 years the association for both antibody tit res to diphtheria and tetanus was, however, strongly significant, corresponding to around ~25 % decrease per 2- fold increase in PFOA. PFNA: At 5 years pre- booster, each 2- fold increase in offspring PFNA concentrations (mean: 1.0 ng/mL) was associated with around 15- 20 % decrease in antibody response to diphtheria and tetanus at age 5- and 7.5-years, although formal significance was not always reached. PFDA: At 5-years pre- booster, each 2- fold increase in PFDA (mean: 1.0 ng/mL) concentrations was associated with around 10- 20 % decrease in antibody response to diphtheria and tetanus at 5- and 7.5- years post -booster, although formal significance was reached only for tetanus. Combined exposures: Structural equations were used to evaluate the associations for co mbined exposures to PFOS, PFHxS and PFOA at offspring age 5 years (pre- booster) in relation to offspring antibody response to diphtheria and tetanus at age 5 years pre- booster and at age 7.5 years post -booster. A 2- fold increase in offspring serum levels at age 5 years pre- booster showed a non- significant inverse association with antibody concentrations age 5 years pre- booster. A 2- fold increase in combined exposures at age 5 .0 years pre- booster was, however, significantly associated with a - 44 % (95 % CI: - 66, -11) and -55 % (95 % CI: - 73, -25) decrease in serum antibody response to diphtheria and tetanus at age 7.5, respectively. Low antibody levels : At age 5 years pre- booster, a 2- fold increase in PFOS concentrations was associated with 1.6 (95 % CI: 1.1, 2.3) higher odds of being below a protective level (0.1 IU/mL) against diphtheria. The corresponding estimates for PFOA was OR 1.2, 95 % CI: 0.8 -1.7. Slightly elevated but non- significant OR were observed for tetanus. At age 7.5 years concentrat ions of PFOS and PFOA at age 5 years were associated with 2.4 (95 % CI: 0.9, 6.4) and 3.3 (95 % CI: 1.4, 7.5) higher odds of being below protective levels against diphtheria. Similar elevated odds were reported for tetanus at age 7.5. 49. Co-exposures: Concer ning possible confounding by other co- exposures, PCBs in maternal samples and offspring samples at age 5 years showed a weak correlation with individual PFASs. Adjustment for these co-exposures had no impact on the effect estimates. With respect to individ ual PFASs, the correlation between the five substances at offspring age 5 years ranged between 0.2 and 0.8. The strongest correlation was observed between PFNA and PFDA, while for PFOS and PFOA the correlation was ~0.5. Other This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 15 pair-wise correlations were weaker. The authors performed benchmark dose (BMD) analyses for each of the five PFASs in serum of the 5 -year-old children in relation to antibody response at 5 and 7.5 years. The results were reported with and without mutual adjustment for PFOS and PFOA (Budtz -Jorgensen and Grandjean, 2018). In short, the modelling showed that both PFOS and PFOA, in statistical terms, were associated with antibody concentrations independent of each other (not confounded). 50. In a cohort of 101 infants from Germany, Abraham et al. (2020) examined the association between plasma concentrations of PFHxS, PFOS, PFOA and PFNA and antibodies to diphtheria, tetanus and haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Mothers and their children were recruited in 1997- 1999 when the infants were between 341 and 369 days old. Of these 21 were formula fed (2 weeks of breastfeeding) and 80 were breast fed for >4 months. When combining exclusive and partial breastfeeding into \"equivalent to exclusive br eastfeeding\" the median duration was 7.4 months. Mean levels of PFASs in plasma from, respectively, non- breastfed and breastfed infants were for PFOA 3.8 and 16. 8 ng/mL, for PFOS 6.8 and 15.2 ng/mL, for PFHxS 1.7 and 2.1 ng/mL and for PFNA 0.2 and 0.6 ng/m L. For the mothers, the mean concentrations in plasma among those who did not breastfeed (n=21) and those who breastfed (n=80) were for PFOA 4.9 and 3.2 ng/mL, for PFOS 17.2 and 14.1 ng/mL, for PFHxS 1.8 and 1.0 ng/mL and for PFNA 0.4 and 0.3 ng/mL. Higher concentrations in plasma among breastfed infants and lower concentrations among mothers who breastfed is explained by lactational transfer of PFASs from the mother to the baby. This transfer into breast milk is more effective for PFOA compared to PFOS, which also explains the differences in PFOS/PFOA ratio between mothers and infants. 51. Concentrations of PFOA in infant plasma were significantly and inversely correlated with antibody concentrations to diphtheria (r=-0.23, p=0.01) and Hib (r= -0.32, p=0.001). Analyses were adjusted for time since last vaccination and for tetanus also the number of vaccinations . Adjustment for other co -contaminants quantified in infant blood, including PCBs, dioxins (I -TEQ), organochlorine pesticides, mercury, cadmium and lead did not influence these associations . Adjustment for duration of exclusive breastfeeding had no relevant influence. The NOAECs for PFOA, estimated by dividing exposure into quintiles, ranged between 18.9 and 19.4 ng/mL, depending on the type of antibody titres . In terms of effect size the mean reduction in antibody response when comparing the highest to lowest quintile of PFOA exposure was - 57 %, - 53 % and - 78 % for diph theria, tetanus and Hib, respectively. Associations for PFOS, PFHxS and PFNA were not significant. Upon request from EFSA, th e authors provided analys es of the associations with the sum of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS (EFSA Opinion, Appendix K). Similar to PFOA, the sum of the four PFASs was significantly and inversely correlated with tetanus and Hib, while the correlation for diphtheria was borderline significant. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 16 52. The different PFASs show significant findings across different studies . This is not unexpected as there are differences in the concentrations and mixture compositions. It is therefore difficult to know whether one of the PFASs is more potent. A more detailed analyses of the Grandjean et al. (2012) study carried out by Budtz -Jorgensen and Grandjean (2018) suggests that both PFOS and PFOA may affect antibody response independently. 53. The studies published since the 2018 Opinion strengthen the conclusion that both PFOS and PFOA are associated wit h reduced antibody response to vaccination. The evidence for other PFASs is weaker as concentrations are lower. Clinical Infections 54. There is some evidence to suggest that exposures to PFASs are associated with increased propensity of infections , but more studies with objective measures of infections (not self -reporting) are needed. Endocrine effects 55. The CONTAM Panel reviewed studies which looked at PFOS, PFOA and other PFASs in thyroid function and disease, male fertility and puberty and female fertility, menstrual cycle and puberty and concluded that there was insufficient evidence available to suggest that the PFAS exposures are associated with these effects. Metabolic outcomes Blood lipids 56. In the 2018 Opinion the CONTAM Panel concluded that \"it is likely that associations between serum PFOS and PFOA levels and serum cholesterol are causal and that an increase in cholesterol was considered adverse\" . 57. Associa tions between PFOS/PFOA and cholesterol have been reviewed by the CONTAM Panel again after external comments to the previous Opinion. This review included some studies published since the 2018 Opinion. The current consideration is that the uncertainty regarding causality is larger than that stated in the previous Opinion. 58. The CONTAM Panel reviewed 12 studies on associations between cholesterol and PFASs other than PFOS and PFOA . The results were mostly inconsistent. However, in almost all studies significant associations were This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 17 found with PFNA and total cholesterol. The data suggest that PFNA has an association with serum cholesterol which is independent from PFOS/PFOA. Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome 59. In the 2018 Opinion the studies reviewed led the CONTAM Panel to conclude that there was no evidence that PFOS or PFOA increases the risk of metabolic disease. Studies reviewed for the current Opinion for PFASs other than PFOS and PFOA are inconsistent. Liver 60. In the previous Opinion the CONTAM Panel considered that the association between PFOA and elevated ALT was causal, but the adversity of the increase in the normal range was considered uncertain since the increase in ALT per unit PFOS/PFOA was small and no association with liver disease was shown. The data for PFOS was inconsistent. Studies published since the previous Opinion have been reviewed by the CONTAM Panel and are in agreement with the conclusion in the 2018 Opinion. 61. The CONTAM Panel reviewed studies on PFASs other than PFOS and PFOA and t he results indicate positive associations between PFHxS/PFNA and serum ALT. However , the association was modest in most of the studies. 62. The available evidence on associations between ALT and PFASs is insufficient for use as the basis for an HBGV . Kidney function and uric acid 63. When reviewed in the 2018 Opinion, studies showed that there were relatively strong associations between serum PFOS/PFOA and estimated GFR as well as serum uric acid. However, taking into account that some reverse causality i s plausible, that there may be confounding, and no significant associations were shown between PFOS/PFOA and chronic kidney disease, the CONTAM Panel considered the evidence that PFOS/PFOA exposures causes reduced GFR insufficient. For studies with other P FAS there was insufficient evidence to conclude that exposures to PFASs decrease GFR or increase uric acid in serum . Carcinogenicity outcomes 64. When the CONTAM Panel (2018) reviewed studies on cancer incidence and cancer mortality, they provided limited evidence that exposure to PFOS or PFOA are related to cancer risk . Studies with PFOS, PFOA and This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 18 other PFASs published since the 2018 Opinion have been reviewed and provide no evidence for a link between exposure to P FASs and cancer risk . Cardiovascular disease and mortality 65. In the previous Opinion (2018) studies examining associations of PFOS/PFOA exposure and cardiovascular outcomes were reviewed. The studies did not show any clear association between PFOS/PFOA exposure and cardiovascular disease. 66. When studies which looked at other PFASs exposure and cardiovascular disease were reviewed by the CONTAM Panel it was noted that some recent studies suggest an association between exposure to PFAS and cardiovascular disease, but insufficient for use as an HBGV . Bone mineral density 67. Two studies that examined associations between PFOS/PFOA and bone mineral density were reviewed (2018) and some inverse associations were noted (with caveats). The magnitude of the associations was small and may be due to reverse causation or residual confounding. Only one study was available to review for other PFASs. The findings from this single study are insufficient as evidence that PFNA or PFHxS has an impact on bone mineral density. Exposure s 68. For most of the exposures calculated in the sections below they are for individual PFASs . Exposures for the rest of the diet were calculated by EFSA (2020) and are for a sum of the four PFAS s (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA). Dietary Breast milk Exposure calculation by EFSA (EFSA, 2020) 69. EFSA calculated exposures from breast milk. Infants with the greatest exposures via breast milk are those less than 6 months of age. EFSA used a median age of 3 months with an equivalent body weight of about 6.1 kg. Estimated average and high daily milk consumption of about 800 mL and 1,200 mL, respect ively were used. Levels in milk have been investigated but were often below the LOQs of the method. However, some studies determined the ratio between milk levels and maternal serum levels . These were approximately 0.015 for PFOS and 0.03 for PFOA. Based on the mean This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 19 serum levels in adults of 7.5 ng/mL for PFOS and 2.1 ng/mL for PFOA, this would result in milk levels of 0.113 and 0.063 ng/mL, respectively. 70. For PFOS, a daily average and high consumption of 800- or 1,200 -mL milk (EFSA NDA Panel, 2013) would result in an intake of 90 and 135 ng PFOS per day or, respectively, 15 and 22 ng/kg bw per day (103 and 155 ng/kg bw per week). For PFOA, the daily intake for average and high consumers would be 50 and 76 ng, or, respectively, 8 and 12 ng/kg bw per day (58 and 87 ng/kg bw per week). Exposure calculation by the COT 72. A literature search was carried out for concentrations of PFASs in human breast milk. There were no UK data. Only data from countries in the EU with breast milk samples taken after 2008 were considered. Only those that had median and/or maximum values were included in the exposure calculations. Tables 1 to 4 in Annex B show PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA breast milk concentration data and study information. Averages of the median and maximum values were calculated for each of the 4 PFASs (Tables 5 and 6, Annex B) which were used to calculate exposures for infants aged 0 - <4 months and 4 - <6 months (Table 1). 71. For the average median PFASs concentrations in breast milk the following ranges of exposures were calculated which inc luded average and high consumers : PFOS: 38 - 75 ng/kg bw per week PFOA: 40 - 80 ng/kg bw per week PFHxS: 12 - 24 ng/kg bw per week PFNA: 14 - 27 ng/kg bw per week 72. For the average maximum PFASs concentrations in breast milk the following ranges of exposures were calculated which included average and high consumers : PFOS: 120 - 240 ng/kg bw per week PFOA: 130 - 260 ng/kg bw per week PFHxS: 22 - 43 ng/kg bw per week PFNA: 37 - 73 ng/kg bw per week 73. The average exposures were similar to those calculated by EFSA from serum levels. Exposures for high concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in breast milk were not calculated by EFSA because the available data were deemed insufficient to estimate exposures (EFSA, 2020) . This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 20 Table 1. Estimated PFOS , PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA exposure (ng/kg bw per week) in 0 to 6 -month- old infants from breast milk Exposure (ng/kg bw/week) 0 to <4 months (800 mL) 0 to <4 months (1,200 mL) 4 to <6 months (800 mL) 4 to <6 months (1,200 mL) PFOS concentration 53 ng/L 50 75 38 57 PFOS concentration 170 ng/L 160 240 120 180 PFOA concentration 56 ng/L 53 80 40 60 PFOA concentration 180 ng/L 170 260 130 190 PFHxS concentration 17 ng/L 16 24 12 18 PFHxS concentration 30 ng/L 28 43 22 32 PFNA concentration 19 ng/L 18 27 14 20 PFNA concentration 51 ng/L 48 73 37 55 Exposure values were calculated based on default consumption values of 800 and 1200 mL for average and high -level exclusive consumption of breast milk and expressed on a bodyweight (5.9 kg for infants aged 0- 4 months and 7.8 kg for infants aged 4 to < 6 mo nths) basis . Rest of the diet 74. The EFSA Opinion included UK data both on occurrence and consumption. The UK specific data and exposures for the sum of the four PFASs (Table 1 and Annex C) are within, and towards the lower end of the range of data from the EU. The data for the UK use the National Diet and Nutrition Survey ( NDNS) data (years 1- 3) for consumption data for toddlers, other children, adolescents, adults, elderly and the very elderly . Consumption data from the Diet and nutrition survey in infants and young children (DNSIYC) was used to calculate exposures for infants and toddlers. The calculated exposures are shown in Table 2. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 21 75. Exposures for infants were calculated to be 61 and 590 ng/kg bw per week for LB and UB mean consumers and 110 and 870 for LB and UB 95th percentile consumers . 76. There are 2 sets of data for toddlers, one set using NDNS data and the other data from DNSIYC. Using the DNSIYC data toddler exposures were calculated as 29 and 460 ng/kg bw per week for LB and UB mean consumers and 74 and 770 ng/kg bw per week for LB respectively . Generally , exposures calculated from the NDNS data are lower than those calculated f rom the DNSIYC data. Exposure estimates are 1 7 and 450 ng/kg bw per week for LB and UB mean consumers and 45 and 850 ng/kg bw per week for LB and UB 95th percentile consumers. 77. Exposures for other children were calculated to be 9.7 and 330 ng/kg bw per week for LB and UB mean consumers and 27 and 640 ng/kg bw per week for LB and UB 95th percentile consumers . 78. Adolescent exposures had been calculated and were 3.2 and 150 ng/kg bw per week for LB and UB mean consumers and 10 and 350 ng/kg bw per week for LB and UB 95th percentile consumer s. 79. Exposures had also been calculated for adults, the elderly and the very elderly. Ranges for LB and UB mean consumers were 4.3 - 5.6 and 97 and 110 ng/kg bw per week , respectively . For LB and UB 95th percentile consumers, exposures were calculated as 13 - 15 and 200 - 220 ng/kg bw per week, respectively. This is a draft statement for discussion.

Drinking water is not routinely monitored for PFASs, but the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) specifies that water companies should ensure that PFOS and PFOA are adequately addressed in their risk assessments, and that if appropriate, they should consider initiating monitoring for PFASs at their works. The DWI has established a tiered approach for monitoring levels of PFOS and PFOA in drinking water. The DWI have considered other PFAS, however based on occurrence data and modelling, the main conclusion was that it was unlikely that individual PFAS would be detected at concentrations greater than 0.1 \u00b5 g/L. If a water company detects PFAS other than PFOS or PFOA it is expected that a precautionary approach be adopted and the DWI informed. (DWI, 2021). 81. The recently revised guidance on the Water Supply Regulations, 2016 established updated guidance levels which have been set for water companies to take increasing action for both PFOS and of 0.1 \u00b5g/L has been established as a trigger level for further action to reduce concentrations. It is a pragmatic value that is broadly in line with assessments made by other developed countries based on animal data. The corresponding previous values from 2009 were PFOS 1.0 \u00b5 g/L and PFOA 5.0 \u00b5 g/L and were based on the 2009 COT TDIs. The value of 0.01 \u00b5 g/L is a concentration that can be reliably and accurately measured using modern analytical techniques and is a trigger for further monitoring (DWI, 2021). 82. In discussions with the DWI, it was suggested that the concentrations that should be used for PFOS and PFOA for drinking water derived from surface and ground water 5 are: 5 ng/L for drinking water derived from surface water. This is about typical level found in river water which will of course be subject to treatment. Most surface water will receive granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment which is likely to reduce the concentration. 5 ng/L is therefore reasonably conservative. 10 ng/L PFOS and PFOA in ground water derived drinking wate r. There are fewer data, and some will receive GAC 5 A surface water is one abstracted form a river or reservoir and groundwater is abstracted from a well or borehole. Springs are a bit of a grey area and some groundwaters can be influenced by surface water. Generally , groundwaters are of better and more stable quality but can be affected by persistent pollutants. About 2/3 of the drinking water supply in England and Wales is derived from surface water and 1/3 from groundwater. The south and the east is more dependent on groundwater supplies than the north and the west (DWI, personal communication, 2021). This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 24 treatment. Companies have reported that currently all supplies are below 100 ng/L which would be very conservative. Therefore, 10ng/L is reasonably conservative. 83. For other PFAS at present the data are r elatively limited. 84. Chronic exposures were calculated with drinking water (including all tap and bottled water) using the values of 5 and 10 ng/L. Consumption data from NDNS years 1 -8 (Bates et al. , 2014; Bates et al. , 2016; and Roberts et al., 2018) and D NSIYC (DH, 2013) were also used in the exposure calculations. All age groups were considered and include infants (4 - 18 months), toddlers (18 months - 3 years), children (4 - 10 years), adolescents (11 - 18 years), adults (19 - 64 years) and the elderly ( 65+ years). 85. Chronic mean exposures calculated for a PFAS concentration of 5 ng/l, as derived from surface water, across both NDNS and DNSIYC, ranged from 0.29 ng/kg bw per ng/kg bw per week (0.12 ng/kg bw per day) for toddlers (Table 1). Exposures calculated for 97.5th percentile consumers ranged from 0.85 ng/kg bw per week (0.12 ng/kg bw per day) for consumers aged 65+ to 2.5 ng/kg bw per week (0.35 ng/kg bw per day) for toddlers (Table 3 ). 86. Chronic mean exposures calculated with a PFAS concentration of 10 ng/L, as derived from ground water, across both NDNS and DNSIYC, ranged from 0.57 ng/kg bw per ng/kg consumers aged 65+ to 1.7 ng/kg bw per week (0.25 ng/kg bw per day) for toddlers (Table 2). Exposures calculated for 97.5 th percentile consumers ranged from 1.7 ng/kg bw per week (0.24 ng/kg bw per day) for consumers aged 65+ to 4.9 ng/kg bw per week (0.71 ng/kg bw per day) for toddlers (Table 4 ).

No data were available on measured levels of PFOS in soil in the UK. 88. Occurrence data for PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA have been measured in indoor dust in UK (Birm ingham) and European homes and was used to calculate exposures (Annex D) 89. Exposures from dust ingestion were calculated for median and high concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA and mean ingestion rates, for each UK population group (infants, toddlers, children, adolescents, adults and seniors). 90. For the average median PFASs concentrations in dust, the following ranges of exposures were calculated for all UK population groups for each of the compounds (Table 5 ): PFOS (59 ng/g): 0.014 - 1.9 ng/kg bw per (55 0. 013 ng/g): 0.000051 - 0.0071 bw per week 91. For the average maximum PFASs concentrations in dust, the following ranges of exposures were calculated for all UK population groups for each of the compounds (Table 5 ): PFOS (1300 ng/g): 0.30 - 42 ng/kg 0.0032 - 0.45 ng/kg bw per week 92. For all PFASs considered, infants had the highest exposures and teenagers, adults and seniors had the lowest exposures. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 26 Table 5. Estimated exposures for PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA (ng/kg bw per week) for UK population groups . Infants Toddlers Children Teenagers Adults Seniors PFOS (59 dust ingestion rates: infants 36 mg/day; toddlers 41 mg/day; children 32 mg/day; teenagers 2.2 mg/day; adults and seniors 2.6 mg/day. Values are to 2 significant figures. Food contact materials 93. EFSA concluded that \" PTFE cookware may contain residual PFOA in the low \u00b5 g/kg range, and food packaging may contain PFASs where they are used because of their grease- resistant properties. Studies conducted to date continue to support the conclusions report ed in the previous Opinion (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2018) that the use of this type of material is likely to contribute to human exposure to PFASs, but that the contribution is small compared with other sources of exposure. \" (EFSA, 2020). 94. Some testing was carr ied out on total fluorinated content of sel ected UK supermarket and takeaway food packaging, by the environmental charity Fidra (Dinsmore, 2020). The specific test method used to determine the total fluorinated content of the selected packaging samples does not reflect the potential migration of the substance into the food it is in contact with. \"To fully understand the direct health implications of PFAS in food packaging, more information is needed on the chemical migration levels, i.e., how muc h of the PFAS from food packaging is transferred to the food itself. This has not been addressed in this study and requires further resource to quantify.\" (Dinsmore, 2020). 95. The FSA has recently been made aware that the vast majority of paper packaging manufactured in the UK by Confederation of Paper Industry member companies do not use PFAS s. They are now predominantly used This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 27 only in specialist packaging which has particular technical requirements such as moisture or grease resistance, like microwavable popcorn bags. Air (indoor) 96. Concentrations of PFASs in indoor air generally exceed those of outdoor air and therefore exposure via inhalation is mainly due to indoor air (Harrad et al. , 2010) . Concentrations of PFASs in indoor air have been found to vary greatly between homes. (EFSA, 2020; Ericson Jogsten et al. , , 2015, Haug et al. , 2011). There are only 2 studies which have measured samples of PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and/or PFNA in homes in the UK or Europe since 2008 (Winkens et al. , 2017; Goosey and Harrad, 2012) . Measurements of PFNA were only available from W inkens et al. , 2017. Exposures were calculated even though the data from the two studies were dissimilar. 97. A number of studies published since 2008 have measured the PFAS precursors and some of these have then calculated predicted exposures to PFOS and PFOA using factors to take into account the biotransformation . However , there is a lack of biotransformation data for PFAS precursors to PFOS, PFOA and PFNA in humans , although certain biotransformation factors have been assumed previously (Poothong et al. , 2020; Padilla - al., 2015; Schlummer et al. , 2013). 98. For the average median PFASs concentrations in indoor air in homes, the following ranges of exposures were calculated for all UK population groups for each of the compounds (Table 6 ): PFOS (6.4 pg/m 3): bw per week 99. For the average maximum PFASs concentrations in indoor air in homes, the following ranges of exposures were calculated for all UK population groups for each of the compounds (Table 6 ): PFOS (200 pg/m 3): bw per week 100. For all PFASs considered, toddlers had the highest exposures via inhalation and seniors had the lowest exposures. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 28 Table 6. Estimated exposures for PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA (ng/kg bw per week) from air for UK population groups . Exposure (ng/kg bw/week) Infants Toddlers Children 9.3 m3/day; children 12 m3/day; teenagers 17 m3/day; adults 16 m3/day and seniors 15 m3/day. Critical effects, dose -response assessment and derivation of an health- based guidance value Critical effects 101. The CONTAM Panel decided to base its assessment on epidemiological studies. The EFSA assessment is summarised in the following paragraphs. 102. Various associations between serum levels and a number of outcomes have been reported in human studies. In 2018 the CONTAM Panel considered four effects as potentially critical for PFOS and/or PFOA. These were: i. Increased serum total and LDL cholesterol (risk factor for cardiov ascular disease, ii. Increased ALT levels (indicating effects on liver cells), iii. Reduced birth weight and iv. Effects on the immune system as shown by decreased antibody response to vaccines. 103. In their 2018 O pinion, the CONTAM Panel used the effects on serum cholesterol levels to derive TWIs for PFOS and PFOA. These were also protective for the other potential critical endpoints. Although the association with increased cholesterol was observed in a large number of studies, the CONTAM Panel now considers the uncertaint y regarding causality larger. This This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 29 is primarily due to a postulated process around the enterohepatic cycling of both PFASs and bile acids, the latter affecting serum cholesterol levels. 104. The association with reduced birth weight could in part be explained by physiological changes during pregnancy. There is currently little evidence for an increase in the proportion of children with low birth weight. 105. There is a consistent increase in ALT levels in general population studies, which appear to be supported by observations in animal studies but were not observed in occupational studies. In the critical study (Gallo et al. , 2012) the increase in subjects with high ALT levelled off at relatively low serum concentrations (about 30 ng/mL of PFOS and PFOA) and above that it did not increase further. In contrast, rodent studies only show an increase in ALT at the high- end of the dose- response curve. This inconsistency creates some uncertainty and for these reasons, this endpoint was not considered as the critical effec t (EFSA, 2020) . 106. Reduction in thyroid hormone levels is often observed in animal studies. Epidemiological studies provide insufficient support of the associations between exposure to PFASs and changes in thyroid hormone levels or thyroid functions. 107. The effects on the immune system were observed at the lowest serum levels in both humans and animals. The CONTAM Panel considered these findings robust since they were consistently observed for several PFASs and for several species. In the present O pinion, the CONTAM Panel decided to base their PFASs assessment on effects on the immune system. 108. A decrease in vaccination response is considered adverse as summarised by WHO/IPCS (2012) in the Guidance for immunotoxicity risk assessment for chemicals. This may apply to vulnerable population groups such as infants and the elderly, considering their higher infection risk. 109. For compounds that accumulate in the body the CONTAM Panel prefer to identify serum or tissue levels associated with adverse effects. The Pane l decided to combine its assessment on the serum levels for the sum of four PFASs (PFOS, PFOA, PFNA and PFHxS). These are currently the PFASs which contribute most to the levels observed in human serum. Although some other PFASs like PFBA and PFHxA also contribute significantly to the exposure, these compounds have much shorter half -lives in humans. The available data are insufficient to derive potency factors for the PFASs. 110. A study on children in the Faroe Islands (Grandjean et al. , 2012) showed several inverse associations between serum levels of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS, as well as the sum of PFOA, PFHxS and PFOS at five This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 30 years of age, before booster vaccination, and antibody titres against diphtheria and tetanus, at both the age of 5, shortly after booster vaccination and at 7.5 years. Additional data on the sum of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS were obtained O pinion, appendix L). BMDL modelling was carried out for this study but did not provide a BMDL considered suitable for risk assessment. The CONTAM Panel identified a no observed adverse effe ct concentration ( NOAEC) serum levels at the age of 5 years for the sum of PFOA, PFNA, P FHxS and PFOS of 27.0 ng/mL, based on decreased antibody titres for diphtheria at the age of 7 years. 111. A more recent study from Germany supported this (Abraham et al. , 2020). An inverse association was observed between serum levels of PFOA, but also the s um PFNA, PFHxS PFOS titres against haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), diphtheria and tetanus in serum sampled from 1 -year-old children predominantly breastfed for a median duration of 7.4 months. 112. A NOAEC of 31.9 ng/mL at the age of 1 year was derived for the sum of PFOA, PFNA, PFOS and PFHxS based on association with reduction in antibody titres against Hib. For PFOS, PFHxS and PFNA alone, no significant associations were observed in this study. The association with reduced tetanus antibody titres was also significant, whereas the association between the sum of the 4 PFASs and diphtheria was only borderline significant. 113. A lowest BMDL 10 of 17.5 ng/mL at the age of 1 year was derived for the sum of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS, based on the inverse association between serum levels of the sum of these four PFASs and antibody titres against diphtheria. Mixture Approach 114. In 2018, the CONTAM P anel derived separate TWIs for PFOS and PFOA. Since that Opinion, EFSA published a guidance document on how to evaluate the effects of mixtures (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2019) and it was considered that similarities in chemical properties and effects war ranted a mixture approach for PFASs. Therefore, in this O pinion the CONTAM Panel decided to focus on the four PFASs (PFOA, PFNA, PFOS and PFHxS). In humans these four chemicals show the highest concentrations in blood plasma and serum. In general, they also show the same effects when studied in animals. 115. The studies by Abraham et al. , (2020) and Grandjean et al. , (2012) showed significant associations for the sum of the four PFA Ss and antibody titres. A later study by Grandjean et al. (2017) showed PFOA had stronger associations than PFOS. Since PFOA and PFOS concentrations are higher compared to serum concentrations of PFNA and PFHxS, and PFOA highly This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 31 correlates with the serum levels of the other PFASs, it is uncertain whether PFOA has a higher potency for this critical endpoint than the other PFASs and therefore drives the association. The CONTAM Panel assumed equal potency by default for these four PFASs on immune outcomes. This was done on a weight base rather than a molar base, to allow easier comparison with the exposure assessment. Dose -response assessment 116. The modelling approach used in the 2018 EFSA O pinion was criticised during the expert meeting (EFSA/CONTAM/3503). The lowest decile of antibody titre was used as the reference value rather than extrapolate and evaluate the BMR for a serum PFOS concentration of zero. In the present Opinion the data fro m both the Faroe Islands and Germany were modelled with PROAST and BMDS. 117. For the Faroe Island study , BMD modelling was undertaken by EFSA but resulted in wide BMDL - BMDU intervals . This was as a consequence of extrapolating to zero exposures and well below the lowest observed serum levels. Therefore, a NOAEC of 27.0 ng/mL was derived for the sum of the four PFASs in serum of 5 -year-old children (serum level in quintile, Appendix L of the EFSA O pinion) , based on the decreased antibody titres for diphtheria at the age of 7 years. 118. For the Abraham study , BMD modelling was undertaken, and an association shown for serum levels of the sum of the four PFASs and titres of diphtheria and tetanus antibodies was shown. From 4 individual models (Appendix K. EFSA 2020) BMDL - BMDU intervals of 17.5 - 46.6 and 18.8 - 56.3 ng/mL were calculated for antibodies against diph theria and tetanus, respectively. The models provided similar results. A critical effect size of 10 % was used due to the large variation in the response. The lowest BMDL of 17.5, from the individual models was used as the reference point 6. EFSA Opinion Appendix K). 119. This BMDL 10 of 17.5 ng/mL corre sponds to a lower intake by the child and thus the mother in her life up to pregnancy, than the NOAEC of 27.0 ng/mL from the Faroe Islands study. The CONTAM Panel also considered that PFAS serum levels in breastfed children are in general higher at 1 year of age than at 5 years. Therefore, this BMDL 10 was used to estimate the daily intake by mothers that would result in this critical serum concentration at 1 6 Model averaging had also been used, however the BMDL values obtained were significantly lower than from the individual models. They were also lower than the observed range of the serum levels of the four PFASs in the study. It was therefore decided that the BMDL values from the individual models should be used. (EFSA, 2020) This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 32 year of age in breastfed children. This daily intake was subsequently used to derive an HBGV for the sum of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS. 120. A physiologically -based pharmacokinetic model was used in the previous O pinion (EFSA, 2018) to translate the critical serum levels into a daily intake and was carried out for PFOS only. In the current O pinion PFO A is also modelled (EFSA O pinion Appendix M provides details of the PBPK modelling). The model was originally developed for adults but had been adapted to estimate the serum levels in growing children and to include exposure via breastfeeding. Data from human biomonitoring studies had been used to estimate the levels in human milk corresponding to a certain serum level in the mother . The prenatal exposure and body burden of the new -born were also estimated. It has been shown that during breastfeeding, a substantial part of the PFASs in the mother is transferred to the infant, and as a result, serum levels in the mother but also milk levels decrease over the lactation period. This decline was also included in the model. The data for PFNA and PFHxS were insufficient, but due to structural and toxicokinetic similarities, it was assumed that these compounds behave like PFOA and PFOS, respectively. 121. The serum level of 17.5 ng/mL was the sum of the levels of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS with relative contributions ( based on the mean levels of these PFASs in 1- year old breastfed infants ) of 48.4, 1.7, 6.1 and 43.8 % , respectively. This equates to contributions of 8.47, 0.30, 1.06 and 7.67 ng/mL respectively . The PBPK model was used to calculate the critical milk and corresponding serum levels in the mother at 35 years that would result in these levels of PFAS in the one- year old infant. Subsequently an estimate was made of the daily intakes by the mothers that lead to this critical serum level at 35 years. Assuming 12 months of breastfeeding7, it was estimated that the BMDL 10 in infants corresponds to an intake by the mother of 0.63 ng/kg bw per day for the sum of the four PFASs. 122. The CONTAM Panel decided to use the daily intake of 0.63 ng/kg bw per day as the starting point for the derivation of an HBGV for the sum of the four PFASs. 123. The CONTAM Panel considered animal studies, but when compared to the results of human studies, suggested that the application of the various uncertainty factors is too conservative and supports the use of the human data to derive an HBGV. 7 12 months was used as the duration of breastfeeding in the model because of current breastfeeding practices in Europe and based on the WHO recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond. (EFSA, 2020) This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 33 124. The CONTAM Panel also considered the mammary gland effects, observed in animal studies, to be potentially adverse for humans. However, basing the assessment on the effects on mamm ary glands using animal data and uncertainty factors, would result in a much lower HBGV. Based on the uncertainties on whether these effects on mammary gland development occur in humans and extrapolation between species , the CONTAM Panel decided to use the vaccination response in humans as the critical endpoint. Nevertheless , this potential developmental effe ct is of potential concern. Derivation of a Health Based Guidance Value 125. The CONTAM Panel decided to derive an HBGV based on immune effects in humans . Two studies showed a dose- response and after BMD modelling, the lowest BMDL 10 of 17.5 ng/mL was selected as the reference point. PBPK modelling was then used to calculate the daily intake of the mother . 126. The daily intake of 0.63 ng/kg bw per day was decided upon as the starting point . 127. The CONTAM Panel established a group tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 7 x 0.63 = 4.4 ng/kg bw per week for the sum of PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS, to take into account the long half -lives of these PFASs. 128. It was decided that no additional uncertainty factors need to be applied, because the BMDL 10 is based on infants which are expected to be a sensitive population group, as is true for many immunotoxic chemicals. In addition, a decreased vaccination response is considered a risk factor for disease rather than a disease. 129. This TWI is protective for the other potential critical endpoints (increase in serum cholesterol, reduced birth weight and high serum levels of ALT). Risk Characterisation 130. The EFSA Opinion (EFSA, 2020) states that \" This TWI should prevent that mothers reach a body burden that results in levels in milk that would lead to serum levels in the infant associated with a decrease in vaccination response. As a result, the higher exposure of breastfed infants is taken into account in the derivation of the TWI and the intake by infants should therefore not be compared with this TWI. 131. For the rest of the diet, UK Lower bound mean exposures for adolescents, adults, the elderly and the very elderly (3.2 - 5.6 ng/kg bw per This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 34 week) are approximate to the TWI of 4.4 ng/kg bw per week. These exposures for other children just are double the value of the TWI, with a value of 9.7 ng/kg bw per week. Toddler exposures calculated using the NDNS survey data are approxi mately 4- fold the TWI. I nfant and toddler expos ures estimated using the DNSIYC survey data are approximately 14- and 7-fold the TWI. 132. The UK lower bound 95th percentile exposures for adolescents, adults, the elderly and the very elderly do exceed the TWI up to about 3-fold. For other children the exceedance is approximately 6-fold. Toddler exposures calculated using the NDNS survey data are about 10-fold. Infant and toddler exposures calculated using DNSIYC survey data are approximately 25- and 17-fold the TWI. 133. UK upper bound mean exposures range from 97 to 590 ng/kg bw per week across the population groups, with infants having the highest exposures. These are 2 2- to 130-fold the TWI . 134. UK upper bound 95th percentile exposures range from 200 to 870 ng/kg bw per week across the population groups, with infants having the highest exposures. These are 4 5- to 200-fold the TWI. 135. Serum level modelling of the four PFASs indicates that the lower bound exposure is a more accurate prediction of the exposure than the upper bound estimates which would lead to a much higher exceedance of the critical serum levels. 136. With a PFAS concentration of 5 ng/L in drinking water derived from surface waters all calculated mean and 97.5th percentile exposures for all age groups were below the TWI of 4.4 ng/kg bw per week. 137. For drinking water derived from ground water with a conservative concentration of 10 ng/L, mean exposures for all age groups were below the TWI. Exposures for 97.5th percentile consumers were below the TWI for all age groups except toddlers with a marginal exceedance of the TWI, with an exposure of 4.9 ng/kg bw per week. 138. Exposures from household dust at average median PFASs concentrations for all UK populations range from 0.000051 to 2.1 ng/k bw per week across the four individual PFAS. For each of PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA exposures from house dust are below the TWI. 139. For conservative exposures calculated from average maximum PFASs concentrations in household dust , the values across all UK population groups across the four individual PFAS range from 0.0032 to 42 ng/kg bw per week. However, there is more uncertainty around the calculation of these values as discussed in Annex D and the uncertainties section. The TWI is exceeded for PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS by infants, toddlers and children. For all PFASs This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 35 considered, infants had the highest exposures and teenagers, adults and seniors had the lowest exposures. 140. For the individual PFASs, all exposures from indoor air calculated across all population groups for both average median and maximum concentrations, are below the TWI . For all PFASs considered, toddlers had the highest ex posures via inhalation and seniors had the lowest exposures. Uncertainty Uncertainties in the exposure assessment s 141. Exposures for breast milk, dust, drinking water and indoor air were calculated for individual PFA Ss. Exposures for the rest of the diet were taken from the EFSA Opinion (2020) and were for a sum of the four PFAS. The majority of the studies used to calculate the exposures for breast milk, dust and indoor air did not provide indi vidual sample data which could therefore not be assessed prior to the data analysis. 142. UK bodyweights, inhalation rates and dust ingestion rates were selected to represent the greatest number of individuals (greatest age range) within that population group. 143. The exposure calculations are likely to be conservative because generally all values reported were included in the analysis , including some reasonably high concentrations which were included in the average maximum calculations. 144. All of the studies used t o calculate exposures had sample numbers lower than 65. Most had 20 or fewer samples. 145. Studies were carried out in different years and in different countries which increased the likely variability within the samples between studies. Studies had different LODs /LOQs for the same PFASs for the same material of interest (breast milk, dust or indoor air). For some studies the data were available for the individual samples but in others only the outputs of the data analysis were available. 146. Where branched and linear isomers of a specific PFASs were measured, where possible, the data were summed as suggested by Nyburg et al. (2018) . 147. In studies that included samples which were pooled prior to analysis, or only provided a summary of the information it is not known how the data from the individual samples compared and whether data are skewed by individual results. 148. Uncertainties relating to specific exposure assessments are discussed in the following paragraphs . This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 36 Breast milk 149. Data from the Nyberg (2018) study was available for individual samples. From these it was possible to calculate the average and m edian for individual PFASs and identify the minimum and maximum values. The data for PFOS and PFHxS were for both linear and branched isomers and these were summed for each PFAS to provide one value for each sample. For PFOS (for branched and linear) , data were also reported for m/z 499/80 and 499/99 i ons. These were averaged as suggested by Nyberg prior to use of the data for summing branched and linear values. Rest of the diet 150. The exposure calculations for the rest of the diet were from EFSA (2020) and as such, the uncertainties are discussed in the EFSA Opinion. Drinking water 151. The uncertainties in the exposure assessment for drinking water include: The exposures calculated assumed that concentrations of 5 ng/L and 10 ng/L would be reasonably conservative scenarios for surface and ground water, respectively. Chemical concentrations were given in the units ng/L. Data in the NDNS is expressed in weight i.e., g or kg. Therefore, in the assessments these concentrations were assumed to be ng/kg. i.e., 1 L of water was assumed to equal to 1 kg of water. There were limited number s of infant/toddler consumers of water used as a diluent for infant foods. Air (indoor) 152. Only two studies were available for inclusion in the exposure calculations . The sample numbers for the studies are relatively small: 20 for the PFAS s concentrations measured from Birmingham ; and 57 from Kuopio, Finland. The detection fr equencies are also low for PFHxS for samples from Kuopio. Therefore, there are a limited number of measured data from which to calculate exposures. Uncertainties in the critical effects, dose -response assessment and derivation of an HBGV 153. The EFSA CONTAM Panel have considered uncertainties in their Opinions (EFSA 2018; EFSA, 2020). \" Overall , the CONTAM Panel considered the impact of the uncertainties on the risk assessment for the sum of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS and PFNA is high\" (EFSA, 2020). This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 37 154. The COT had reviewed the t wo studies (Abraham et al ., 2020 and Grandjean et al., 2012) used by EFSA for the derivation of a TWI for PFAS s. The endpoints used were the indications of a decrease in vaccine response in children. The results from the studies were not entirely consistent for the PFASs compounds studied. It was also noted that the cohort in the Abraham et al. study was relatively small. 155. The i mmune effects of PFASs have been seen in both experimental animal and human studies. The Grandjean and Abraham studies are the only studies suitable for undertaking BMD modelling. However, they are still less than ideal, and it would be helpful to have a more robust point of departure (POD) . The modelling used seems to take account of the critical toxicokinetic effects. The pathological consequences of the reduction in vaccine response in these children are unknown. It is unknown how this effect relates to the TWI. 156. The EFSA opinion indicated that when antibody titres are diminished, the level of protection from vaccines might be compromised. However, it was not clear what decrease in antibody levels could cause such an effect. It was noted that there were also natural fluctuations in vaccine titres over time. 157. It was thought that information on the impact of vaccinating against diphtheria in the UK was available. As most children in the UK are vaccinated, the fact that there were almost no cases of diphtheria (10 cases in England in 20198) would suggest that any effect of PFASs on vaccine response was non -linear. However, as there is no cohort of infected subjects (due in part to the effectiveness of vaccination) any effect on impairment of the vaccine response would not necessarily be seen, as only a small percentage of the population would be at risk. Currently there does not appear to be any discernible impact. 158. The COT agreed that qualitatively the correct health endpoint had been used but quantitatively, questioned the calculations. Overall, there were some reservations about t he choice of the critical study and the specific effect selected. However, the COT agreed that the critical study was the best available. It was not unreasonable that this study was selected, and, in the absence of more appropriate studies, its use was acc eptable. 159. The C OT considered whether there was a real effect or not. The Grandjean et al cohort had initially been studied to assess the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the results had been compared after correct ing for confounding by PCBs. However, the Committee questioned how effective this correction would be when the major source of exposure for both 8https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/diphtheria#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20diphtheria%20cases,occur% 20if%20vaccination%2 0levels%20fall . This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 38 groups of chemicals was the same, i.e., seafood. It was noted that the assessment was multi -faceted and that the two groups of chemicals were not necessarily confounders because they were on the same causal pathway. However, it would not be possible to put both PCBs and PFA Ss in the model at the same time and it would also not be possible to fully adjust one model for the other. 160. The C OT discussed the benchmark dose (BMD) modelling that had been carried out by EFSA. This had originally been carried out by Abraham et al. and then replicated by EFSA. A relatively small set of data was used in the modelling. A number of the fitted models showed no threshold, indicating that there was no 'no effect level'. However, there did not appear to be anything in the EFSA Opinion to explain this. There had also been difficulties with the BMD modelling, for example, model averaging did not provide plausible results and was not further discussed by the EFSA panel although model averaging is their preferred approach in BMD modelling. Instead, the lowest value from an individual model was used. It was presumed that this was for a non-threshold dose response. It was noted that the data set could be very difficult to model. COT Conclusions 161. Breast milk exposures for UK infants all exceed the TWI of 4.4 ng/kg bw per week. However, EFSA (2020) stated that \"the higher exposure of breastfed infants is taken into account in the derivation of the TWI and the intake by infants should therefore not be compared with this TWI \". 162. For the rest of the diet, EFSA had calculate UK exposures. UK Lower bound mean exposures for adolescents, adults, the elderly and the very elderly are approximate to the TWI of 4.4 ng/kg bw per week. The exposures for other children are approximately 2- fold the TWI. Toddler exposures calculated using the NDNS survey data are approximately 4- fold the TWI. Infant and toddler exposures estimated using the DNSIYC survey data are approximately 14- and 7- fold the TWI. 163. The UK lower bound 95th percentile exposures for adolescents, adults, the elderly and the very elderly do exceed the TWI , up to about 3- fold. For other children the exceedance is approximately 6- fold. Toddler exposures calculated using the NDNS survey data are about 10- fold. Infant and toddler exposures calculated using DNSIYC survey data are approximately 25- and 17-fold the TWI , respectively . 164. UK upper bound mean exposures across the population groups, with infants having the highest exposures are approximately 22- to 130- fold the TWI. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 39 165. UK upper bound 95th percentile exposures across the population groups, with infants havi ng the highest exposures are approximately 45- to 200-fold the TWI. 166. Serum level modelling of the four PFASs indicates that the lower bound exposure is a more accurate prediction of the exposure than the upper bound estima tes which would lead to a much higher exceedance of the critical serum levels. 167. Exposures from household dust at average median PFASs concentrations for all UK populations for individual PFASs are below the TWI. 168. For exposures calculated from average maximum PFASs concentrations in household dust the TWI is exceeded for PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS by infants, toddlers and children. 169. With a PFAS concentration of 5 ng/L in drinking water derived from surface waters all calculated mean and 97.5th percentile exposures for all age groups were below the TWI of 4.4 ng/kg bw per week. 170. For drinking water derived from ground water with a conservative concentration of 10 ng/L, mean exposures for all age groups were below the TWI. Exposures for 97.5th percentile consumers were below the TWI for all age groups except toddlers with a marginal exceedance of the TWI, with an exposure of 4.9 ng/kg bw per week. 171. For the individual PFASs, all estimated exposures from indoor air calculated across all population groups for both average median and maximum concentrations, are below the TWI. 172. Due to high numbers of results below the LOD/LOQ for food samples , these estimated chronic exposures should be viewed as indicative of the range of exposures and therefore, interpreted with caution. The sam e cautionary approach should be used when considering the household dust and indoor air exposures and also taking into account the additional uncertainties around these, discussed previously. 173. The diet is the predominant route of exposure to PFASs, however, other routes of exposure may include dust ingestion and indoor air , for which exposures have been considered. There may also be some exposure from the dermal route, however these have not been calculated in this statement . 174. The EFSA CONTAM Panel , in their evaluation of PFASs have used a mixtures approach and established a TWI of 4.4 ng/kg bw per week, based on the sum of four PFASs: PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA. 175. The TWI was calculated based on studies of epidemiological immune effects as this was considered, by the CONTAM Panel to be the critical effect. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 40 The predominant study used was the study by Abraham et al. (2020). From this study a BMDL 10 of 17.5 ng/mL was calculated, for the sum of the four PFASs i n serum. This value was then used as the reference point for PBPK modelling. From the PBPK model the daily intake calculated for a mother was 0.63 ng/kg bw per day. This was then converted to a weekly value of 4.4 ng/kg bw per week , for use as the health- based guidance value. 176. The COT agreed that the use of the sum of the four PFA Ss was acceptable as a first approximation for exposures of PFAS. 177. Two studies (Abraham et al ., 2020 and Grandjean et al ., 2012) were used by EFSA for the derivation of a TWI for PFAS. The endpoints used were the indications of a decrease in vaccine response in children. 178. The COT agreed that qualitatively the correct health endpoint had been used but quantitatively, questioned the calculations. Overall, there were some reservations about the choice of the critical study (Abraham et al. , 2020) and the specific effect selected. However, the COT agreed that the critical study was the best available. It was not unreasonable that this study was selected, and, in the absence of more appropriate studies, its use was acceptable. 179. The COT had significant reservations about the model used, including the BMD approach, and the TWI which had been established, due to the uncertainties and the caveats involved. The concerns related to both the study and thus the data used in the modelling, and the modelling itself. 180. The values for the BMDL and TWI were low and there was a lot of uncertainty surrounding the data used by EFSA. 181. Whilst the COT is unable to suggest an alternative TWI at this time, there will need to be strong caveats explaining the exposure estimates versus TWI relative to exposures and these would need to be considered carefully to avoid miscommunication of the data. 182. The exceedances of the TWI at lower bound exposure estimates indicate a health concern. Secretariat June 2021 This is a draft statement for discussion.

In the absence of a suitable UK study of PFAS in breast milk, data from EU studies for which all samples were taken after 2008 have been used to calculate exposures to PFAS from breast milk in this paper. The exposure estimates are based on concentrations derived as an average of the median (Table 5) or maximum (Table 6) values reported in the literature. Table 5. Concentrations (ng/L) derived as an average of the median values reported in the literature Table 6. Concentrations (ng/L) derived as an average of the maximum values reported in the literature *The maximum PFOS value in the Llorca et al. , (2010 ) study was from an i ndividual and was approximately 5 - 30-fold higher than all other measure values. Therefore, the second highest value from this study was used.

Therefore, the default consumption values used by the COT in other evaluations of the infant diet of average (800 mL) and high- level (1200 mL) consumption have been used to estimate exposures to PFOS and PFOA from breast milk. Bodyweights of 5.9 and 7.8 kg were used for infants aged 0 - <4 and 4 - <6 months, respectively. 4. For the average median PFASs concentrations in breast milk the following ranges of exposures were calculated which included average and high consumers: PFOS: 38 - 75 ng/kg bw per week PFOA: 40 - 80 ng/kg bw per week PFHxS: 12 - 24 ng/kg bw per week PFNA: 14 - 27 ng/kg bw per week 5. For the average maximum PFASs concentrations in breast milk the following ranges of exposures were calculated which included average and high consumers: PFOS: 120 - 240 ng/kg bw per week - 260 ng/kg week PFHx S: 22 - 43 per week PFNA: 37 - 73 ng/kg Table and PFNA exposure (ng/kg bw per week) in 0 to 6 -month- old infants and from breast milk 0 to <4 months (800 mL) 0 to <4 months (1,200 mL) 4 to <6 months (800 mL) 4 to <6 months (1,200 mL) PFOS concentration 53 ng/L 50 75 38 57 PFOS concentration 170 ng/L 160 240 120 180 PFOA concentration 56 ng/L 53 80 40 60 PFOA concentration 180 ng/L 170 260 130 190 This is a draft statement for discussion.

Dust ingestion rates were taken from the EPA Exposure Factors Handbook (2011)9 which had been updated in 2017. Average bodyweights for the UK populations were calculated from NDNS (18 months - 95 years) and DNSIYC (4 - 18 months) data for different age groups. These are all shown in Table 7. Two bodyweights were provided for the toddler age group: 10 Kg for the 7 - 18 months age group and 16 Kg for those aged 18 months to 4 years. As the 16 Kg represented a wider age range, that was used in the exposure calculations . 4. Exposures from dust ingestion were calculated for median and high concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA and mean median ingestion rates, for each UK population group (Table 8). Table 7.

The maximum values from the datasets for PFOS (400 pg/m3) and PFOA (440 pg/m3) are both from the study by Goosey and Harrad (2012) and are approximately 3 - 4-fold the next highest values for each of the chemicals. Using these values in the exposure calcul ation is a conservative approach. This is a draft statement for discussion. It does not reflect the views of the Committee and should not be cited. 73 3. The exposure estimates are based on concentrations derived as an average of the median (Table 5) or maximum (Table 6) values reported in the literature. Table 5.

Inhalation rates were taken from the EPA Exposure Factors Handbook (2011) 10. The number of age groups for which inhalation rates were provided was greater than the 6 population groups. The inhalation rates selected were those that covered much of the UK population group. Average bodyweights for the UK populations were calculated from NDNS (18 months - 95 years) and DNSIYC (4 - 18 months) data for different age groups. These are all shown in Table 7. 10 Exposure Factors Handbook 2011 Edition (Final Report) | Science Inventory | US EPA Chemical Average of reported median values (pg/m3) References PFOS 6.4 Goosey and Harrad, 2012 ; and Winkens et al. , 2017 PFOA et al. , 2017 Chemical Average of reported maximum values (ng/g) References PFOS 200 Goosey and Harrad, 2012; and et al. , 2017 This is a draft statement for discussion.
