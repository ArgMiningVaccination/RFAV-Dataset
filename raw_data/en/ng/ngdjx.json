[What is cisplatin?] Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug [head and neck](/cancer-information-and-support/head-and-neck-cancer), [lung](/cancer-information-and-support/lung-cancer) and [cervical cancer](/cancer-information-and-support/cervical-cancer). It may also be used to treat other cancers. It is best to read this information with our general information about [chemotherapy](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy) and the [type of cancer ](/cancer-information-and-support/cancer-types)you have. Your doctor will talk to you about this treatment and its possible side effects before you agree ( [consent](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/your-treatment-options/giving-your-consent)) to have treatment. [How cisplatin is given] You will be given cisplatin in a [chemotherapy day unit](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy/how-chemotherapy-is-given) or during a stay in hospital. A chemotherapy nurse will give it to you. Cisplatin can be given in combination with other cancer drugs or with [radiotherapy](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/radiotherapy). During treatment you usually see a cancer doctor, a chemotherapy nurse or a specialist nurse, and a specialist pharmacist. This is who we mean when we mention doctor, nurse or pharmacist in this information. Before or on the day of treatment, a nurse or person trained to take blood (phlebotomist) will take a blood sample from you. This is to check that your blood cells are at a safe level to have chemotherapy. You will see a doctor or nurse before you have chemotherapy. They will talk to you about your blood results and ask you how you have been feeling. If your blood results are okay, the pharmacist will prepare your chemotherapy. Your nurse will tell you when your treatment is likely to be ready. Your nurse usually gives you [anti-sickness](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/nausea-and-vomiting) (anti-emetic) drugs before the chemotherapy. Cisplatin is given into a vein (intravenously). You may have the chemotherapy drugs through: - a [cannula](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy/cannulas)- a short, thin tube the nurse puts into a vein in your arm or hand - a [central line](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy/central-lines)- a fine tube that goes under the skin of your chest and into a vein close by - a [PICC line](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/types-of-treatment/chemotherapy/picc-lines)- a fine tube that is put into a vein in your arm and goes up into a vein in your chest. Your nurse will give the cisplatin as a drip (infusion) that is attached to your cannula, PICC line or central line. They will usually put the drip through a pump. This will give you the treatment over a set time. Extra fluids Your course of chemotherapy You have chemotherapy as a course of several sessions (or cycles) of treatment over a few months. Each cycle of cisplatin usually takes 21 days (3 weeks). You usually have the cisplatin on the first day of each cycle. But this will depend on the type of cancer you have. Your doctor or nurse will discuss your treatment plan with you. [About side effects] We explain the most common side effects of this treatment here. We also include some less common side effects. You may get some of the side effects we mention, but you are unlikely to get all of them. If you are also having treatment with other cancer drugs, you may have some side effects that we have not listed here. Always tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about any side effects you have. Your doctor can give you drugs to help control some side effects. It is important to take them exactly as your nurse or pharmacist explains. This means they will be more likely to work for you. Your nurse will give you advice about managing your side effects. After your treatment is over, most side effects start to improve. Serious and life-threatening side effects Some cancer treatments can cause severe side effects. Rarely, these may be life-threatening. Your cancer doctor or nurse can explain the risk of these side effects to you. Contact the hospital Your nurse will give you telephone numbers for the hospital. If you feel unwell or need advice, you can call them at any time of the day or night. Save these numbers in your phone or keep them somewhere safe. More information We cannot list every side effect for this treatment. There are some rare side effects that are not listed. You can visit the [electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC)](http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/) for more detailed information. [Side effects while treatment is being given] Allergic reaction Some people have an allergic reaction while having this treatment. Signs of a reaction can include: - feeling hot or flushed - shivering - itching - a skin rash - feeling dizzy - a headache - feeling breathless or wheezy - swelling of your face or mouth - pain in your back, tummy or chest. Your nurse will check you for signs of a reaction during your treatment. If you feel unwell or have any of these signs, tell them straight away. If you do have a reaction, it can be treated quickly. Sometimes a reaction happens a few hours after treatment. If you develop any signs or feel unwell after you get home, contact the hospital straight away. The drug leaks outside the vein If the drug leaks outside the vein, it can damage the surrounding tissue. This is called extravasation. Extravasation is not common but if it happens it is important to treat it quickly. Tell your nurse straight away if you have any stinging, pain, redness or swelling around the vein. If you get any of these symptoms after you get home, contact the doctor or nurse straight away on the contact telephone number they gave you. [Common side effects of cisplatin] Risk of infection This treatment can reduce the number of white blood cells in your blood. These cells fight infection. If the number of white blood cells is low, you are more likely to get an [infection](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/infection). A low white blood cell count is sometimes called neutropenia. An infection can be very serious when the number of white blood cells is low. It is important to get any infection treated as soon as possible. Contact the hospital straight away on the 24-hour contact number you have been given if: - your temperature goes over 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) - you suddenly feel unwell, even with a normal temperature - you have symptoms of an infection - your temperature goes below 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F). Symptoms of an infection include: - feeling shivery and shaking - a sore throat - a cough - breathlessness - diarrhoea - needing to pass urine (pee) a lot, or discomfort when you pass urine. It is important to follow any specific advice your cancer treatment team gives you. The number of white blood cells will usually return to normal before your next treatment. You will have a blood test before having more treatment. If your white blood cell count is low, your doctor may delay your treatment for a short time, until your cell count increases. Bruising and bleeding This treatment can reduce the number of platelets in your blood. Platelets are cells that help the blood to clot. If the number of platelets is low, you may bruise or bleed easily. You may have: - nosebleeds - bleeding gums - heavy periods - blood in your urine (pee) or stools (poo) - tiny red or purple spots on the skin that may look like a rash. Tell your doctor if you have any unexplained bruising or bleeding. You may need a drip to give you extra platelets. This is called a platelet transfusion. Anaemia (low number of red blood cells) Chemotherapy can reduce the number of red blood cells in your blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the body. If the number of red cells is low, this is called anaemia. You may have symptoms such as: - pale skin - lack of energy - feeling breathless - feeling dizzy and light-headed. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have these symptoms. If you are very anaemic, you may need a drip to give you extra red blood cells. This is called a blood transfusion. Sometimes doctors prescribe a drug called [erythropoietin](/cancer-information-and-support/treatments-and-drugs/erythropoietin-epo). This helps the body to make more red blood cells. It is given as an injection under the skin. But it is more common to have a blood transfusion for anaemia. Feeling sick Your doctor will give you anti-sickness drugs to help prevent or control sickness during your treatment. Take the drugs exactly as your nurse or pharmacist tells you. It is easier to prevent sickness than to treat it after it has started.If you [feel sick](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/nausea-and-vomiting), take small sips of fluids often and eat small amounts regularly. It is important to drink enough fluids. If you continue to feel sick, or are sick (vomit) more than once in 24 hours, contact the hospital as soon as possible. They will give you advice. Your doctor or nurse may change the anti-sickness drug to one that works better for you. Loss of appetite This treatment can [affect your appetite](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/eating-problems). Don't worry if you do not eat much for a day or 2. But if your appetite does not come back after a few days, or if you are losing weight, tell your nurse or dietitian. They can give you advice. They may give you food or drink supplements. Or they may suggest changes to your diet or eating habits to help. Changes to your taste You may get a bitter or metal taste in your mouth. Sucking sugar-free sweets may help with this. Some foods may taste different or have no taste. Try different foods to find out what tastes best to you. [Taste changes](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/eating-problems) usually get better after treatment finishes. Your nurse can give you more advice. Effects on the kidneys Cisplatin can affect how your kidneys work. You will have blood tests before and during treatment to check how well your kidneys are working. Before and after each treatment, your nurses will give you extra fluids through a drip. This is to protect your kidneys. They will also give you advice about how much fluid to drink for the next 24 hours. Throughout the rest of your chemotherapy cycle, it is important to drink at least 2 litres (3\u00bd pints) of fluids each day. Tell your nurse or doctor if: - you are not able to drink as much as you have been asked to - for example, if you feel sick - you are being sick or have diarrhoea - you are passing urine (peeing) less than usual. Hearing changes This treatment may cause hearing changes, including hearing loss. You may have ringing in the ears. This is called tinnitus. You may also become unable to hear some high-pitched sounds. Hearing changes usually get better after this treatment ends. But some can be permanent. Tell your doctor if you notice any changes in your hearing. Feeling tired [Feeling tired](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/tiredness) is a common side effect of this treatment. It is often worse towards the end of treatment and for some weeks after it has finished. Try to pace yourself and plan your day so you have time to rest. Gentle exercise, like short walks, can give you more energy. If you feel sleepy, do not drive or use machinery. Diarrhoea This treatment may cause [diarrhoea](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/bladder-and-bowel-problems). Diarrhoea means passing more stools (poo) than is usual for you, or having watery or loose stools. If you have a stoma, it will be more active than usual. If you have diarrhoea: - try to drink at least 2 litres (3\u00bd pints) of fluids each day - avoid alcohol, caffeine, milk products, high-fat foods and high-fibre foods - contact the hospital for advice. Effects on the heartbeat Cisplatin can cause fast, irregular or slow heartbeats. Tell your doctor if you notice any changes to your heartbeat. Rarely, cisplatin can cause more serious heart problems. Contact a doctor straight away if you: - have pain or tightness in your chest - feel breathless or dizzy - feel your heart is beating too fast or too slowly. Other conditions can cause these symptoms, but it is important to get them checked by a doctor. [Less common side effects] Numb or tingling hands or feet (peripheral neuropathy) This treatment may affect the nerves, which can cause numb, tingling or painful hands or feet. You may find it hard to fasten buttons or do other fiddly tasks. Tell your doctor if you have these symptoms. They sometimes need to lower the dose of the drug. The symptoms usually improve slowly after treatment finishes. But for some people they may never go away. Talk to your doctor if you are worried about this. [Other information about cisplatin] Blood clot risk Cancer and some cancer treatments can increase the risk of a [blood clot](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/blood-clots-and-cancer). Symptoms of a blood clot include: - throbbing pain, redness or swelling in a leg or arm - suddenly feeling breathless or coughing - sharp chest pain, which may be worse when you cough or take a deep breath. If you have any of these symptoms, contact the hospital straight away on the 24-hour contact number you have been given. If you cannot get through to your doctor, call the NHS urgent advice number on 111. A blood clot is serious, but it can be treated with drugs that thin the blood (anticoagulants). Your doctor or nurse can give you more information. You can help reduce the risk of developing a blood clot by: [staying active](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/preparing-for-treatment/eating-well-and-keeping-active)during treatment - drinking plenty of fluids, especially water. You may be given anticoagulants to help prevent a clot. Other medicines Some medicines can affect how this treatment works or be harmful when you are having it. Always tell your cancer doctor about any drugs you are taking or planning to take, such as: - medicines you have been prescribed - medicines you buy in a shop or chemist - vitamins, herbal drugs and complementary therapies. Tell other doctors, pharmacists or dentists who prescribe or give you medicines that you are having this cancer treatment. You can visit the [electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC)](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc) for more detailed information about your treatment. Vaccinations Vaccinations can reduce your risk of getting certain infections. Your doctor or nurse may talk to you about having vaccinations. Doctors usually recommend that people with cancer have a flu vaccination and a [coronavirus (covid) vaccination](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/coronavirus/vaccine). These are both inactivated vaccinations that can help reduce the risk of infection. People with weak immune systems can have these, as they are not live vaccinations. If your immune system is weak, you need to avoid live vaccinations. This is because they can make you unwell. Live vaccines contain a very weak version of the illness they are vaccinating you against. Your cancer doctor or GP can tell you more about live and inactivated vaccinations. Sex If you have sex in the first few days after this treatment, you should use barrier protection such as a condom or dental dam. This will protect your partner if any of the drug is in your semen or vaginal fluids. Fertility Some cancer drugs can affect whether you can [get pregnant](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/fertility) or [make someone pregnant](/cancer-information-and-support/impacts-of-cancer/fertility). If you are worried about this, it is important to talk with your doctor before you start treatment. Contraception Your doctor will advise you not to get pregnant or make someone pregnant while having this treatment. The drugs may harm a developing baby. It is important to use contraception during your treatment and for a while after treatment finishes. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can tell you more about this. Breastfeeding You are advised not to [breastfeed](/cancer-information-and-support/treatment/your-treatment-options/pregnancy/breastfeeding) while having this treatment, or for some time after treatment finishes. This is because the drugs could be passed to the baby through breast milk. Your doctor or nurse can give you more information. Medical and dental treatment If you need medical treatment for any reason other than cancer, always tell the doctors and nurses you are having cancer treatment. Give them the contact details for your cancer doctor so they can ask for advice. If you think you need dental treatment, talk to your cancer doctor or nurse. Always tell your dentist you are having cancer treatment.
