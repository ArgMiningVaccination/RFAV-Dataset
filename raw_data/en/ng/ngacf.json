The program educates its students to be productive, caring and responsible citizens and skilled healthcare professionals. Programs Integrative Health Care Preparation Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which encompasses acupuncture, herbal therapy, manual therapy, diet counseling, exercise and breathing techniques has been in use for thousands of years. Over the millennia, the Asian community has continuously refined this ancient healing art. During the last century, this refinement has included integration of Western medical sciences within the paradigm of TCM. Having an opportunity to work alone and in conjunction with other health care practitioners in the Health Sciences Center, the students will be able to integrate the care of patients with other health care providers.
