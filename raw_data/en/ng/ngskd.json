The primary accreditation organization for undergraduate medical education is the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The LCME ( www.lcme.org ) is the nationally recognized accrediting authority for medical education programs leading to the M.D. degree in U.S. and Canadian medical schools . The LCME is jointly sponsored by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the American Medical Association (AMA) . All state licensing boards in the United States require graduation from an LCMEaccredited school to be eligible for licensure a s an allopathic physician. The LCME has a threestep process for granting accreditation to new medical schools: preliminary accreditation granted prior to recruiting the charter class of students (granted to the UCF College of Medicine on February 5, 2008); provisional accreditation, granted during the second year of operation of the first class (granted to the UCF College of Medicine on June 20, 2011); and full accreditation, granted during the fourth year of the Charter class. The college is developing a curriculum and appropriate standards to achieve full accreditation of the program prior to the graduation of its Charter class. 14 Medical Education that Creates Opportunity The M.D. Program learning experience at UCF is a unique and exciting blend of state- of-the art technology, virtual patients, clinical and laboratory experiences, research, facilitator-directed small group sessions, and interactive didactic lectures . Classes include live patient interaction . Innovative simulation and animation experiences have been developed explicitly for the study of medicine that integrate and reinforce the curriculum . From basic science concepts to clinical diagnoses and treatments, the Clinical Skills and Simulation Center enhances and complements learning. The M.D. Program curriculum at UCF fully integrates basic and clinical sciences across all four years . The first two years of the curriculum are structured into modules with the first year focusing on a fundamental understanding of how the various basic science disciplines relate to the normal human body . The second year takes an organ system-based approach and applies the basic knowledge of the first year to the study of clinical disease, pathological processes and treatment . In concert with these aspects of medicine the curriculum presents psychosocial issues, cultural differences, communication skills, and physical diagnosis skills as they relate to the different topics in medicine. Educational experiences throughout the curriculum are designed to enhance the learning environment, emphasize student-centered learning, application and synthesis of information, and foster an appreciation of life-long learning . All modalities of learning are incorporated into the curriculum including interactive lectures using audience response systems, simulation, Web-based activities and clinical cases, team-based learning, and standardized patient encounters . Clinical experiences occur throughout the first two years in the Practice of Medicine . Students work with community preceptors in a variety of settings, including primary care, specialty practices and hospital- based practices . These clinical experiences provide students the opportunity to observe the application of their studies to real patients, as they gain experience in communication, history taking, physical exam skills, and cultural competency. An exciting component of the curriculum at UCF is best described by the Dean as the \"Keep the Dream Alive\" module. This Focused Individual Research Experience (FIRE) module continues throughout the first two years . The scope of these projects is limited only by the student's imagination, and may include every aspect from bench to clinical research, quality of care, hospitality in medicine, quality of life, disease prevention, legal aspects of medicine, and more . Each student works with a mentor to develop an indi vidualized project or area of study that focuses on the student's unique interest in medicine. The third and fourth years of the curriculum are devoted to clinical experience through clerkships, selectives, and electives . Fundamental knowledge from the first two years is reinforced through lectures, simulations, journal clubs, and conferences during the six core clerkships . 15 Overall, the four-year medical curriculum at UCF is designed to fully integrate basic sciences and clinical medicine, giving students an appreciation of cultural diversity and the need for sensitivity in treating patients, foster professionalism in all interactions, and ignite a passion for lifelong learning. 16 College of Medicine's Mission, Values, Vision, Goals, Strategic Initiatives Mission The University of Central Florida College of Medicine educates and inspires individuals to be exemplary physicians and scientists, leaders in medicine, scholars in discovery and adopters of innovative technology to improve the health and well being of all .

In addition, UCF College of Medicine encourages applications from a diverse population and values diversity in the medical program . Admissions decisions are made on the basis of a wide variety of information provided in the admissions package of each applicant . The Medical Student Admissions Committee (MSAC) considers factors such as academic qualifications, demonstrated humanism and empathy, research and work experience, teamwork and leadership skills, as well as motivation for medicine . An applicant's character, integrity and general fitness to practice a particular profession may also be considered in the admission process . Admission to the M.D. Program is competitive and although qualified, many applicants will not be invited for an interview. Role of the Admissions Office The College of Medicine M.D. Admissions Office guides students through the medical application and admissions processes . The office develops and implements a College of Medicine recruiting plan that serves to fulfill the mission of the college . The College of Medicine Admissions Office manages the M.D. admissions process for the college . As such, the office is primarily responsible for overseeing the recruitment, application, interview and admissions processes ensuring that they are in compliance with all College of Medicine, UCF, state and American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) governing directives . The Admissions Office works in tandem with the MSAC and other College of Medicine offices to ensure that each matriculated class embodies strength in academics, research, work experiences, professional goals and skills, professionalism and medical motivation that contributes to a diverse, team-oriented, culturally competent classroom . The Admissions Office provides administrative support to the MSAC chair and committee. The Admissions Office uses the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) as the primary application processing system and works with College of Medicine and UCF offices to ensure that supporting data is made available on a timely basis. The College of Medicine Admissions Office both receives and maintains applicant file components in electronic format whenever possible. 19 Applicant Recruiting As the primary recruiting office for applicants to the M.D. Program, the Admissions Office represents the program and uses all means necessary to ensure that viable applicants understand the mission, culture and objectives of the College of Medicine . The Admissions Office participates in as many medical student forums and meetings as deemed appropriate to achieve a diverse, motivated and academically solid student body . The Admissions Office works closely with undergraduate program advisors and special high school advisors to ensure that their students have been prepared properly to begin the medical school application process . This office is also the primary office to provide program advising to applicants to ensure that they understand the application and admissions process . They work with applicants who were not accepted to help them to understand the areas where their application may be strengthened for possible success in a future application year . Finally, the Admissions Office attends AAMC and other meetings deemed necessary to ensure that the office is cognizant of all admissions rules and requirements. International Applicants As a state-supported M.D. Program in Florida with a mission to produce more physicians for the population of the state, only applicants who are U.S . Citizens or who are Permanent Resident Aliens or Asylees with permanent INS documentation in their possession will be allowed to matriculate . Applicant files that are not one of these three groups will not be considered for an interview. Admissions with Advanced Standing (Transfer) The M.D. Program does not plan to accept Advanced Standing (Transfer) applicants for the first several years of the admissions cycle . Application Process The only method by which applicants (excluding transfer applicants) may apply to the UCF M.D. Program is through the on-line American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) . AMCAS is the national application service that processes applications for M.D. Programs throughout the nation . Through AMCAS, an applicant may apply to most M.D. Programs by completing one application document and paying the appropriate fees. AMCAS is considered a service organization to both the student and the school . Although there is an application fee to the student, the institution is not charged for any of the services that AMCAS provides . In addition to processing the application (which includes the verification of all college grades), AMCAS provides the school with current, categorically summarized information regarding all applicants immediately upon completion of AMCAS transcript verification . The AMCAS application period begins in late May and, for most M.D. Programs, terminates on or before December 1st of the year prior to that year in which the applicant anticipates matriculation . The AMCAS application deadline is the date by which the applicant must have their application, all fees and associated data verified by AMCAS . Schools are allowed to make exceptions to the established deadline date for individual applicants when deemed appropriate by the Admissions Office . This institution honors the AMCAS Fee Assistance Program waiver as a basis for waiving the Supplemental Application Fee. 20 The M.D. Program will evaluate completed applications from both residents and nonresidents of the state of Florida . Qualified non-Florida residents may be invited for an interview . As a state-supported institution, a large majority of each matriculating class will be composed of Florida residents. Required Academic Coursework The College of Medicine has established certain required academic prerequisite coursework for admissions . These requirements must be taken in residence (not online) from a properly accredited college or university in the United States . Applicants must also have completed at least a bachelor's - level degree prior to matriculation into the M.D. Program. General Biology 2 Semesters (with labs) General Chemistry 2 Semesters (with labs) Organic Chemistry 2 Semesters (with labs) General Physics 2 Semesters (with labs) College English 2 Semesters College Math 2 Semesters Please note that the College of Medicine does not recommend or encourage an undergraduate college major in any discipline as the \"best\" major for entry to the M.D. Program . Undergraduate majors in either the humanities or sciences are equally acceptable as students are encouraged to follow their own desires when pursuing majors . The College of Medicine recognizes that both the sciences and the humanities are essential to the practice of medicine and encourages studies in that applicant's area of interest . Non-science majors are encouraged to take as many science courses as possible to assist the MSAC in understanding t he applicant's science aptitude . Additional coursework that is recommended, but not required, includes biochemistry (with lab), embryology, cell biology, comparative anatomy and genetics . Coursework in humanities, natural sciences or communication arts is also encouraged . While no specific college math courses are required, some college work in calculus is strongly recommended; familiarity with the principles of statistics for analysis of data is also important. For those applicants who have completed upper-level degrees, all academics are considered and some of the undergraduate prerequisites may be substituted with upper-level coursework in the same discipline . Requirements for Interview Consideration In addition to the coursework noted in the preceding section, the College of Medicine expects that each applicant selected for admissions will have demonstrated strong academic skills as well as a motivation for medicine and compassion for others. As such, all applicants invited for an interview should have achieved a minimum of a 3.00 overall and science GPA and have scored a minimum of a 24 on a single MCAT exam which is not older than the last 3 application cycles (i.e. an applicant for the class entering in 21 August 2011 must have taken the MCAT in 2008- 2010 ). Applicants competitive for an interview should have demonstrated a strong motivation for medicine by having consistently participated in meaningful volunteerism, both in the medical and community service areas . Furthermore, motivated applicants are expected to have participated in some physician shadowing and also have demonstrated teamwork, leadership and preferably basic science laboratory research skills. State Residency Classification The College of Medicine Office of Admissions for the M.D. Program determines residency for all first- time- on-campus medical students; the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office reviews student requests for changes in residency once the student is enrolled . A first-time- on-campus student will be classified according to the information he or she includes on the application for admission and state residency affidavit, providing that no other information is available that calls into question the information contained on these documents . The M.D. Admissions Office strictly observes the Florida Residency Guidelines, and no exceptions will be made regarding a student's legal state of residence unless it is in accordance with the office of general counsel. The Application File The major portion of the applicant file is maintained electronically in the AMCAS system. AMCAS updates schools with information initiated by the applicant and, using official school transcripts, verifies the academic work of the stude nt. The M.D. Admissions Office collects additional documents submitted on behalf of an applicant and monitors all files until they are complete or until the application deadline has passed . A completed application consists of the following items at a minimum: - Verified AMCAS Application - Completed Supplemental Application - Letters of Recommendation (via AMCAS only) o three Faculty Recommendation Letters OR Pre-professional Committee Letter o two Character Recommendation Letters - Application Fee or AMCAS Fee Waiver Designator - Passport Type Photo (Requested but not required for completion of file) - Official Transcripts (after Acceptance) - State Residency Affidavit (after Acceptance) - Additional Information Provided by the Applicant (Optional) o Letters providing updated or amplifying information o Recent Grade Sheets/Transcript o U.S. Citizenship Forms o Change of Name Information The M.D. Admissions Office will send an e-mail to each applicant immediately upon file completion and will continue to provide status updates via the Supplemental Applicant dashboard as warranted . It is the responsibility of each applicant to meet established deadlines and to monitor completion of their application . 22 The M.D. Admissions Office maintains the electronic/paper files for all applicants that contain all of the above as well as any other documentation which is pertinent to the applicant for each application year . While in the M.D. Admissions Office, all applicant files are treated as privileged and confidential information. None of the data will be shown to the applicant or any other individual that does not have the need to view the information in the course of their own university business responsibility . Upon the date of matriculation, the M.D. Admissions Office will provide all appropriate documentation to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar Office which will begin the student educational record that is subject to FERPA Guidelines . Initial Screening of Applicants The initial indication that an applicant has begun the application process is provided by AMCAS . The M.D. Admissions Office communicates with applicants upon receipt of a verified AMCAS application and ensures that qualified applicants receive Supplementary Applications . Once all components of the applicant file have been received, the Director of Admissions for the M.D. Program reviews the file to ensure that the applicant meets, or will meet, all requirements for admission prior to matriculation . Files that meet all requirements are evaluated by being placed in a pool of applicants which may be selected for an interview . Files that do not appear to meet all requirements are reviewed by the Director of Admissions and the MSAC chair to determine whether to reject the application or allow it to remain in the pool for possible interview selection . The M.D. Admissions Office will release Letters of Rejection to all applicants as sanctioned by the MSAC chair. Interview Selection Guidelines The MSAC chair works in tandem with the Director of Admissions for the M.D. Program to ensure that all applicants chosen for an interview are those who are not only academically talented, but also have demonstrated the desire to pursue medicine . As such, during the rolling admissions process, the Director of Admissions for the M.D. Program constantly reviews the pool of interview-ready applications to select the best students available for interview . Those students should have averages which meet or exceed the committee's minimum GPA and MCAT scores . Ideally, those selected for an interview should have: - experienced meaningful and consistent medical clinical activities - demonstrated consistent service to the community - shadowed a physician - displayed teamwork and leadership skills - participated in basic science research - showed perseverance or excelled in an activity (sports, research, etc.) at a very high level Not all applicants selected for an interview will have all of the qualities listed above; however, the Admissions Office seeks to interview applicants who are academically solid, motivated for medicine and bring diversity to the classroom. 23 Interview Day Once an interview group has been created and the applicants have selected an interview date, the Admissions Office provides the applicant with an e-mail confirming the date of interview . This confirmation e-mail provides additional information to include an agenda and information regarding overnight stay, local travel, parking and other details to enhance the applicant's visit . The interview day structure include s a visit of approximately seven hours which includes interviews, program overview, student financial information, a visit to a clinical training site, tour of the medical education building, interaction with current students and administrators, and a discussion regarding the admission and acceptance process. Notification of Acceptance, Rejection or Wait Listing When the MSAC has made a final decision regarding each interviewed applicant, the Director of Admissions for the M.D. program makes immediate contact with each applicant via telephone to inform them of the committee decision . MSAC meetings normally occur within two weeks of the applicant's interview visit . Acceptance Packages Acceptance packages include an Acceptance Letter signed by the MSAC chair . Other items in the package include a copy of the College of Medicine Technical Standards and a Technical Standards Response Form . A written response is desired from the applicant within two weeks of the date of the acceptance letter . The response letter from the applicant should also include the Technical Standards Response Form . If a response letter is not received from the applicant, the Admissions Office will make every effort to contact the applicant to determine their intent . Technical Standards Response Forms are filed with the applicant's response to the acceptance offer in the Admissions File . Those Technical Standards Response Forms which indicate that an accommodation may be necessary are forwarded immediately to the Office of Student Affairs for further action. Official Transcripts All applicants that have been selected for admission to the M.D. Program must provide an official transcript showing a bachelor's degree earned at a regionally accredited U.S. institution to the College of Medicine M.D. Admissions Office prior to matriculation . To be official, transcripts and diploma/degree certificate must bear the original seal or signature of the school's registrar or of the appropriate school official or office . An official transcript bearing the applicant's bachelor's degree must be provided prior to matriculation. Criminal Background Checks Accepted applicants ' Criminal Background Checks (CBC) are currently funded by AMCAS . AMCAS initiates the CBC process after January 1st, for all applicants that have been accepted by any AMCAS member institution . As additional institutions offer acceptance to that applicant, they too will be provided access to the result of the original CBC . 24 Technical Standards for Medical School Admission, Academic Progression and Graduation The M.D. Program educates physicians who are capable of entering residency training (graduate medical education) and meet all requirements for medical licensure. All candidates are evaluated according to the same standards and criteria. Delineation of technical standards is required for the accreditation of U.S. medical schools by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The technical standards describe the essential abilities required of all candidates. Reasonable accommodation in achievement of the standards is defined under federal statutes applied to individuals with disabilities. Such accommodations are intended to support the successful completion of all components of the M.D. degree. The technical standards for the M.D. degree are applied in concert with other policies of the university, including academic policies, academic standards established by the faculty, and student conduct policies. Standards in five areas must be met by all candidates: Observation, Communication, Motor Function, Cognitive Standards, and Professionalism. 1. Observation Candidates are reasonably expected to observe demonstrations and participate in experiments in the basic sciences; observe patients at a distance and close at hand; demonstrate sufficient use of the senses of vision and hearing and the somatic sensation necessary to perform a physical examination; and integrate findings based on these observations and to develop an appropriate diagnostic and treatment plan. 2. Communication Candidates are reasonably expected to communicate in verbal and written form with health care professionals and patients, including eliciting a complete medical history and recording information regarding patients' conditions; perceive relevant non verbal communications such as changes in mood, activity, and posture as part of a physical examination of a patient; establish therapeutic relationships with patients; and demonstrate reading skills at a level sufficient to individually accomplish curricular requirements and provide clinical care for patients using written information. Accommodation through use of a trained intermediary or other communications aide may be appropriate when this intermediary functions as an information conduit. 25 3. Motor Function Candidates' motor and sensory functions must be sufficient to diagnose and deliver effective patient care by consistently, quickly, and accurately integrating all data gathered through whatever sense(s) employed. Candidates are reasonably expected to perform physical examinations and diagnostic procedures, using such techniques as palpation, auscultation, and percussion; complete routine invasive procedures as part of training, using universal precautions without substantial risk of infection to patients; perform basic laboratory tests and evaluate routine diagnostic tools such as EKGs and Xrays; respond in emergency situations to provide the level of care reasonably required of physicians; and participate effectively in physically taxing duties over long hours and complete timed demonstrations of skills. 4. Cognitive Standards Candidates must have sufficient cognitive abilities and effective learning techniques to assimilate the detailed and complex information presented in the medical curriculum. They are reasonably expected to: measure, calculate, analyze, synthesize, extrapolate, and reach diagnostic and therapeutic judgments; recognize and draw conclusions about threedimensional spatial relationships and logical sequential relationships among events; formulate and test hypotheses that enable effective and timely problemsolving in diagnosis and treatment of patients in a variety of clinical modalities; understand the legal and ethical aspects of the practice of medicine; and remain fully alert and attentive at all times in clinical settings. Problem-solving, the critical skill demanded by physicians, requires all of these intellectual abilities. 5. Professionalism Candidates are expected to demonstrate behavior and social attributes that enable the effective practice of medicine. Candidates are reasonably expected to demonstrate the judgment and emotional stability required for full use of their intellectual abilities; possess the perseverance, diligence, and consistency to complete the medical college curriculum and prepare to enter the independent practice of medicine; exercise good judgment in the diagnosis and treatment of patients; complete all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients within established timelines; function within both the law and ethical standards of the medical profession; work effectively and professionally as part of the health care team; relate to patients, their families, and health care personnel in a sensitive and professional manner; participate effectively in physically taxing duties over long work hours, function effectively under stress, and display flexibility and adaptability to changing and uncertain environments; maintain regular, reliable, and punctual attendance for classes and clinical responsibilities; contribute to 26 collaborative, constructive learning environments, accept constructive feedback from others, and respond with appropriate modification. Compassion, integrity, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admission and educational processes. All candidates are responsible for meeting acceptable standards for behavior and intellectual functioning. Only minimal accommodation is foreseen with regard to the professional section of the technical standards. Office of Registrar/Student Records and Related Policies http://med.ucf.edu/academics/registrar/ Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona, Suite 115 Office Hours: Monday-Friday, 8 am - 5 pm (Hours subject to change during holidays and term breaks) Overview The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar manages and maintains the academic records of all medical students. The primary role of the Registrar is to maintain the permanent records and documents pert inent to each matriculated student's progress through out medical school . The Registrar is also responsible for maintaining the documents that preserve the institutional memory of the college. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office provides services to students, faculty, administrators and alumni first among its priorities, recognizing these individuals as the office's primary constituency .

Third parties including individuals, businesses, loan companies or lenders may request enrollment verification directly from National Student Clearinghouse online http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/ or call the National Student Clearinghouse directly at (703) 742-4200. This is a paid service. Withdrawal Policy Withdrawal for each term begins after the \"tenth day of enrollment. \" Students may withdraw from coursework and receive the notation of \"W\" with the approval of the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine . Withdrawing from coursework may have financial aid consequences . Students should seek appropriate advisement prior to withdrawing. A student is not automatically withdrawn from coursework for not attending, nor can an instructor withdraw a student from coursework . Upon request the instructor will provide the student with an assessment of the student's performance in the coursework prior to the last permitted day of withdrawal. Withdrawal is permitted after the deadline only in extraordinary circumstances such as serious medical problems . Unsatisfactory academic performance is not an acceptable reason for withdrawal after the deadline . Students who are seeking to petition for a late withdrawal should consult with the College of Medicine's Office of Student Affairs . At the time of the request, the Office of Student Affairs will ascertain from the instructor whether the student was passing or failing the coursework . If the student was passing, a \"WP\" will be recorded on the student's permanent record; if failing, a \"WF\" will be entered . Medical and late withdrawals normally are granted for all coursework being taken at the time of withdrawal. Students who seek late withdrawal because they are ill must apply for the withdrawal within six months of the term from which the withdrawal is sought . Students seeking a late withdrawal because of medical conditions must follow the medical withdrawal procedure . The student' s physician provides the 28 university with the appropriate medical information, using the forms available in the College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs . If a medical withdrawal is approved, a \"W\" will be recorded for each coursework that the student was enrolled in . Students who receive a medical withdrawal may be placed on hold until the college can determine that the student is ready to return . If a medical withdrawal is not approved, the request may be approved as a late withdrawal and grad es of \" W\" will be recorded. Following the close of the tenth date of enrollment for each term, students withdrawing from coursework will incur both grade and fee liability . Students with circumstances determined by the university to be exceptional and beyond their control may apply for a cancellation of enrollment and the elimination of fee liability . Exceptional circumstances include, but are not limited to, sickness, death, involuntary call to military service, or administrative errors created by the college or university . Students must submit a petition and all supporting documentation for a late drop of coursework to the College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs within six months of the end of the semester for which the late drop is sought. If a student withdraws from coursework while an alleged academically dishonest act is under consideration and the case is not subsequently resolved in favor of the student, the college reserves the right to assign the appropriate grade for the coursework. Holds A hold (negative service indicator) may be placed on a student's records, transcripts, grades, diplomas or registration due to financial or other obligations to the university . Satisfaction and clearance of the hold is required before a release can be given . Students may check for holds at https://my.ucf.edu . To obtain an immediate release for a financial hold, payment to the UCF Main Campus C ashier's Office must be made either in cash, credit card, cashier's check or money order. Records The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar is responsible for maintaining permanent records and documents that pertain to each matriculated student's progress through medical school . These records include application materials, medical school evaluations, official transcripts of all medical school coursework, documentation of grade changes, USMLE scores and USMLE ID number, official dates of enrollment, Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE), documentation of dismissal or withdrawal, copy of diploma, copy of Federation of State Medical Boards and other state licensing forms . The procedures used in managing these records are consistent with established standards and existing regulations . As a student, the educational records are considered confidential. Under most circumstances an individual student's records will not be released without the student's written and signed consent. 29 Student records are maintained electronically within a secure infrastructure . The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar provides access to student records to faculty and administrative staff with a legitimate educational interest . Students have the right, under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), to inspect and review their educational records . Student records submitted to the university become the property of the university and cannot be returned to or copied for the student or released to a third party . Student records are digitally scanned . Students may request to amend their records under the provisions outlined in the regulation . Challenges to medical student academic records will follow the appeal process included in the university 's Golden Rule to be adapted for the College of Medicine. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) The procedures for protecting the confidentiality of student records are based on state regulations and the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) . FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records . They are: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days (State of Florida law = 30 days) of the day the university receives a written request for access . Students should submit to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they desire to inspect . The university official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected . If the records are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed; 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate . Students may ask the university to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate. They should write the university official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate. If the university decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the university will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing ; 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent . One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests . A school official is a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks . A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility; and 30 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by a state university to comply with the requirements of FERPA . The name and address of the office that administers FERPA are : Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington DC, 20202- 4605 Directory Info Under the provisions of the FERPA, students have the right to withhold the release of the following items designated by UCF as \"Directory Information :\" name current mailing address telephone number date of birth major field of study dates of attendance enrollment status degrees and awards received participation in officially registered activities and sports athletes' height and weight Unless otherwise indicated, these informational items may be released at the discretion of the university. The university will honor a student's request to withhold \"Directory Information\" until such time as that student's request to withhold \"Directory Information\" is rescinded . Until such rescindment is affected, the university will continue to withhold such information, even after enrollment has terminated. For more information, please refer to the Student Rights to Privacy (FERPA) . Higher Education Act Lists, descriptions and sources of information required for disclosure under the Higher Education Act may be obtained from the UCF registrar's office (Millican Hall 161) or from the UCF registrar's website http://registrar.sdes.ucf.edu/hea/ . Name Changes To change the legal name maintained on the student's official UCF record, the student must submit a completed \"Change of Name\" form and supporting documentation to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar . A copy of a legal name change document (e.g., marriage certificate, divorce decree, etc.) must be attached to the form . The \"Change of Name\" form is available online at http://www.med.ucf.edu/academics/registrar/forms.asp . 31 Address and E-mail Changes To communicate in a more expedient manner, UCF uses e-mail as the primary means of notifying students of important university business and information dealing with registration, deadlines, financial assistance, scholarships, tuition and fees, etc . The College of Medicine sends all business-related and academic messages to a student's Knights e-mail address to ensure that there is one repository for that information. It is critical that students maintain and regularly check their Knights e-mail account for official announcements and notifications . Communications sent to the Knights e-mail address on record will be deemed adequate notice for all university communication, including issues related to academics, finances, registration, parking, and all other matters . The university does not accept responsibility if official communication is rejected or fails to reach a student who has not registered for, or maintained and checked on a regular basis, their Knights e-mail account. Students must ensure that permanent and mailing (local) addresses and telephone numbers are current with the university at all times. Students can update their contact information online at https://my.ucf.edu . Transcript Requests Official UCF transcripts are requested using the new online ordering process. All currently enrolled students have access via the Student Portal at: https://my.ucf.edu . Telephone and e-mail requests are not accepted. Transcripts cannot be released if the student has a hold due to a financial obligation to the university . Transcript requests must include the student's signature, full name, identification number and the name and complete address of the person(s) or organizations to which transcripts are to be sent . If final grades or degree statement are needed, a student may indicate that the transcript request is to be held until all requested data are posted. Official transcript costs for the M.D. program have been assessed as part of yearly fees; consequently, transcripts are provided to enrolled students at no charge. However, the transcript cost for other UCF undergraduate and graduate programs is $10 per copy effective January 1, 2008. There is a transcript fee of $10 per transcript for requests made following graduation or withdrawal from the program. Full-time Enrollment Requirements All students enrolled in the M.D. Program must attend full-time and take the educational modules as a cohort group . Exceptions to these enrollment requirements are granted only in cases of documented medical hardship . Requests for an exception should be directed to the College of Medicine Associate Dean for Students in writing . Registration in Term of Graduation A student must be registered in a term in which the College of Medicine faculty or administrative and professional time are required (e.g., for review of thesis or research report by faculty or editorial staff, for completion of internships, or for comprehensive or other examinations). 32 Certification of Degree Completion The College of Medicine certifies that all program and college requirements have been met . Degree certification forms are prepared in the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office and forwarded to the SEPC (M4) for final determination that all requirements for the M.D. degree have been met . Medical students who have completed all the requirements for the degree and have successfully completed the required clerkships may request a letter to that effect prior to the receipt of the degree . Such letters will be issued by the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office. Grade System The college uses a letter system for the M.D. Program where grades are assigned for overall performance in a given module or clerksh ip. Students' performance in academic course work are evaluated by assignment of grades of (A) Excellent Performance, (B) Good Performance, (C) Conditional Performance, in order of excellence . The (F) grade (Unacceptable Performance) is given to students who fail a module/clerkship, who demonstrate inappropriate professional behaviors, or who fail to attend or participate in required course activities . Other grade actions include an (I) showing incomplete work, a (W) indicating that a student withdrew from the course, an (R*) followed by a grade showing that the student repeated the course (Grade Forgiveness), and a (T) used as a \"temporary grade\" for performance pending review by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) . See below for further explanation of the (T) grade. Faculty may specify that some programs (selectives/electives) can be graded using a (P) pass/ (F) fail grade designation . All grade options for the program are subject to approval by the M.D. Program Curriculum Committee. The instructor assigns an I (incomplete grade) when a student is unable to complete a module or clerkship due to extenuating circumstances, and when all requirements can clearly be completed in a short time following the close of regular classes . In all circumstances where a student receives an (I), the student and faculty member must complete an agreement that specifies how and when the incomplete grade will be made up, which will be considered by the appropriate SEPC . All students receiving financial assistance (federal and institutional loans), will be cautioned that the terms of the assistance require that the (I) grade must be made up by the agreement date . Minimal competency in each module/clerkship is a composite score of 70 or above (A, B or C grade). A (T) entry identifies students whose performance, although within the passing range, requires study and reevaluation in one or more areas within the module/clerkship . A (T) is used as a \"temporary grade\" for module/clerkship grades when students have achieved a n overall score that would indicate a passing grade, but they have shown weak or marginal performance in one or more of the traditional subject areas that are included in the overall module/clerkship . The overall performance of students receiving a (T) in lieu of a grade is reviewed by the SEPC with the Module/Clerkship Director to determine how the student may improve their fund of knowledge in the identified subject area(s) . The (T) grade is replaced by the final module/clerkship grade when remediation is successfully accomplished in knowledge, skills, attitudes and/or behavior. Unsuccessful remediation may result in a failing grade. 33 Individual Module or Clerkship Directors specify how performance on assigned work is related to this grading scale in the particular module or clerkship . The final grade assigned for the module is recorded on the official transcript . However, because the pre-clerkship modules are integrated or organ system- based but involve a number of traditional basic science disciplines, Module Directors will also record performance in those areas as well . Where appropriate, the Module Director will assign a (T) grade to indicate that the student's performance in one or more discipline areas falls in the conditional or unacceptable range . Similarly, Clerkship Directors may assign a (T) grade to indicate that a particular student's knowledge, skill or professionalism is conditional or unacceptable in a particular area, even though the student's overall performance is excellent or good . Assigned (T) grades with annotations are used by the SEPC in its review of an individual student. A student may appeal his or her exam or course grade if he or she feels that the grade was assigned in a manner not in accordance with the module or clerkship statement of policy distributed at the beginning of the module or clerkship. This is not a process for appeal of established module or clerkship grading policies. The appeal is directed initially to the Module or Clerkship Director and then to the Assistant Dean of Medical Education for resolution at an informal level. If resolution of the issue is not made to the student's satisfaction, then a formal appeal is made in writing to the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs stating the reasons for the appeal. After an appropriate hearing and review, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs will recommend final disposition of the appeal. A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written request within 10 business days of receipt of written notification of the recommendation from the Office of Faculty and Academic Affairs. Acting as the University President's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 10 business days of receipt of the student's request for review. Medical students are assigned a personal portal on the MyUCF web site where final grades, notices and announcements are posted . In addition, each medical student receives a secured portal into a personal web site using MEDS (Medical Education Delivery System) where instructional module notices and assignments are posted. Classification of Modules/Courses 6000-6999 Advanced graduate level modules . These modules are designed to build upon the beginning graduate level courses/modules and to deliver more advanced content and experiences. 7000-7999 Doctoral level courses . These courses provide material at the most advanced graduate level. 34 Florida's Statewide Module/Course Numbering System Modules/courses in this Bulletin are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS) . This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by thirty-three nonpublic institutions . Students and administrators can use the online Statewide Course Numbering System to obtain course descriptions . The information is at the SCNS website: http://scns.fldoe.org . Validity of Submitted Documents If the college finds that an applicant has made a false or fraudulent statement or a deliberate omission on the application, residency affidavit, health report, or any accompanying document or statement, that applicant will be denied admission . If the student is enrolled when such fraud is discovered, the student is immediately withdrawn (with no refund), denied further enrollment and invalidated on credit and any degree based on such credit . Actions for this type of offense are handled administratively by the Office of Student Affairs after notification to the alleged violator and hearing by that office. Leave of Absence Students who are unable to continue enrollment or complete required instructional modules or clerkships due to illness, maternity leave of absence, hardship or special circumstances must immediately contact the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine. A student requesting a leave of absence must submit a letter outlining the reasons for the request and timetable for return to the Associate Dean for Students and the Chair of the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee. The Associate Dean for Students and/or the SEPC may approve a short-term leave of absence . Any incomplete work must be completed by the time specified in the letter to the student sent by the Associate Dean for Students or the Chair of the SEPC. Leave of absence may be granted for up to one calendar year. Leaves requested for a longer period are approved only in exceptional circumstances . Extension requests must be made to the SEPC before the expiration of the original Leave of Absence . Note: for purposes of deferring repayment of student loans during a school-approved leave of absence, federal regulations limit the leave to six months. Students on approved College of Medicine leave of absence must notify the Office of Student Affairs of the College of Medicine in writing of his or her intent to re-enroll at least one month prior to the date they wish to return to medical studies. The M.D. Program at the College of Medicine does not permit auditing of modules . Modules are only available to students enrolled in the M.D. Program. Residency Reclassification The College of Medicine Office of Admissions for the M.D. Program determines residency for tuition purposes for all newly admitted students at the College of Medicine . Thereafter, the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office reviews requests for changes in residency. 35 To request a residency review, the student must submit a completed \"Residency Reclassification Request Form\" and supporting documents to the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office . This form is available either at the UCF registrar's office or online at http://registrar.ucf.edu/ . The reclassification form must be accompanied by all documents that support the student's Florida residency claim . Residency reclassification requests are subject to Florida Statute 1009.21 (formerly 240.1201), Florida State Board of Education Administrative Code 6A-10.44 and State Board of Education rule 6C-7.005 . In addition, university policy requires students requesting residency reclassification to provide documentation establishing that they have income or personal resources to meet financial obligations of attendance and living expenses . Contact the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office for additional information regarding all residency reclassification requirements. When building a case for Florida residency for tuition purposes, the student may choose to submit documents from a variety of categories . Students may consult the College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office before submitting the reclassification request and supporting documents . The submission of documents in itself does not qualify the student for Florida residency for tuition purposes. The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office will evaluate the submitted documents and available information and will render an eligibility determination . UCF is authorized to make discretionary judgments as to residency within the bounds of the law and in reaching this professional judgment will evaluate all documents submitted and information available . No single document shall be conclusive. Students seeking residency reclassification should understand that living in or attending college in Florida is not tantamount to establishing residency in Florida for tuition purposes . The student who comes to Florida to enroll in a Florida post-secondary educational institution as an out- of-state resident and continuously enrolls in a Florida institution normally will not meet the Florida residency requirement for in-state tuition regardless of the length of time enrolled . Living or attending school in Florida merely evidences physical presence . The student must provide documentation verifying that he or she has formed significant legal ties to the state of Florida . This documentation must establish that the Florida residence constitutes a bona fide domicile rather than serving the purpose of maintaining a mere temporary residence or abode incident to enrollment in an institution of higher education . Evidence establishing legal ties to states other than Florida may disqualify the student from Florida residency for tuition purposes . All determinative documents must be dated at least 12 months before the first day of class for the term in which residency is sought. New and continuing students who believe that they qualify for Florida residency must submit the request and all documents prior to end of \"Late Registration\" for the term in which Florida residency is requested. Documentation received after the last day of \"Late Registration\" will not be used to determine residency for the current term . Approved residency reclassification will not be applied retroactively to previous terms. 36 The College of Medicine M.D. Registrar's office may require additional documentation beyond that initially submitted by the student or the claimant before it can render a reclassification eligibility determination and it will not complete its review of the residency reclassification application until both the student and the claimant have submitted all requested documents. Office of Student Financial Services and Related Policies http://med.ucf.edu/students/financial/ Health Sciences Campus at Lake Nona, Suite 115 Office: Hours: Monday-Friday, 8 am - 5 pm (Hours subject to change during holidays and term breaks) Overview The College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services makes every effort to assist students in securing adequate funding for their educational expenses . A major function of the office is to assist with the financial aid application and disbursement process, as well as provide financial counseling on topics such as debt management and budgeting . The Office of Student Financial Services conducts group presentations and workshops and accepts individual appointments to discuss and counsel students on their individual situation and needs. It is recommended that all students read the Student Financial Services Guidebook which lists steps to take to apply for, as well as policies in place regarding financial aid. Tuition and Fees Information about tuition and fees can be obtained from the College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services, (407-266-1383) or by visiting http://med.ucf.edu/students/financial/tuition.asp ). Fee Invoices and Due Dates Students can view their fee invoices by visiting https://my.ucf.edu . Please note that students will not have an invoice until they are registered for courses. The Student Handbook details expected due dates of fee invoices. Deferrals of Tuition and Fees Financial aid awards will normally result in a deferment of tuition and fee payments. Deferments allow for the time lag that normally occurs between the date that tuition and fees are due and the date on which financial aid disbursements are made and enrollment can be verified (add/drop date), which is normally two to three weeks after the term begins . Students are responsible to pay any amount owed to the university that is not covered by estimated aid and/or other resources by the payment deadline . The deferment process occurs automatically if the student is meeting all general eligibility requirements and has enrolled full time in the M.D. Program . Students should refer to correspondence from the Office of 37 Student Financial Services, contact the Office of Student Financial Services, or utilize https://my.ucf.edu to obtain up- to-date information . Since awards are subject to change, deferments are also subject to change . Deferments based on estimated Stafford loans will be canceled prior to the beginning of the term if the student has not completed the loan application process . Students should communicate with administrators if enrollment plans or financial plans change during the course of their attendance. Student Financial Responsibility Statement/Late Payment Fee Registration at the College of Medicine requires students to acknowledge the following financial responsibility statement: \"I accept responsibility for payment of my term tuition and fees by the published deadline. I understand that if I do not pay my tuition and fees by the due date, I will be charged a $100 Late Payment Fee, my records will be put on hold, my account will be referred to a collection agency and I may incur other financial consequences.\" Past Due Accounts All financial obligations to the university must be met . Failure to meet obligations can result in the withholding and denial of registration, diploma, transcripts and readmission to the university . The services of a professional collection agency and recourse to the courts may also be invoked if deemed necessary . All costs of collection, including attorney's fees, are borne by the debtor . Students should not assume registration will be canceled for failure to pay fees or attend classes . Tuition deferrals, for example, will prevent class cancellation for non-payment. Fee Appeals Students who desire to appeal a late registration fee and/or a late payment fee may make their appeal to the Fee Appeals Committee by initiating a student petition (Form 41-561) . This form can be obtained online at www.fa.ucf.edu (Click Forms, Student Services and Fee Appeals Petition) .

Forms faxed to College of Medicine Office of Student Affairs should be addressed Attn: Fee Appeals (407) 266-1389. Holds Holds due to unpaid tuition and fees that prevent registration and the receipt of transcripts will automatically be removed overnight once fees are paid. Financial Aid Disbursements/Short Term Advances Financial aid disbursements begin the second week of each payment period . Students should be aware of this, so they are prepared to use their personal savings for anticipated expenses such as books and supplies at the beginning of each term . A Short Term Advance may be available for students to help with these expenses, but funds are limited and should not be relied upon . The application is available for download prior to each payment period, so that funds may be available prior to the first day of classes . Students who apply late for financial aid should be prepared to cover their own educational and living 38 expenses well into the enrollment period. When financial aid disburses, the funds first apply towards university debts . The remaining balance is refunded to the student in one of two ways: via direct deposit or paper check . If a student has provided his or her bank information to set up direct deposit, which can be done on https://my.ucf.edu , then the refund is deposited into the student's account . Otherwise, a check is mailed to the student's current mailing address on https://my.ucf.edu . Paper checks take longer to process and there will be at least a three-day delay. Direct Deposit of Refunds Students are strongly encouraged to establish direct deposit with the university . Direct deposit prevents delays due to lost checks or change of address . All refunds from students' accounts can be direct ly deposited into their checking accounts . Funds are usually available within 24-48 hours after disbursement and enrollment only takes a few minutes . To enroll, sign in at https://my.ucf.edu and click on Student Self Service. Click on the Student Accounts icon and then click on Direct Deposit and follow the instructions. Please note that efficient budgeting practices need to be implemented by students receiving refunds that cover their living expenses . Whether the refund is from loan proceeds or scholarship funding, it is important that students practice smart spending techniques . For further information, please contact the Office of Student Financial Services at 407-266-1383 or 407-266-1381 . Payment Procedures If financial assistance will not cover the full balance due on a student's account then proper payment procedures must be followed . Payment must be received or postmarked no later than the fee payment deadlines specified to be considered on time . Non-cash payments (checks and money orders) placed in the 24-Hour Depository (at the main campus) by the official fee payment deadline will be considered on time.

Washington Center \u2014(407) 823-0829 39 Refund of Fees Withdrawal or dismissal from the College of Medicine by the end of the week indicated will result in a full or partial refund as indicated below . Please note that this refers to classes, not orientation. Refunds for withdrawals or dismissals apply only to the portion of the year for which payment has been made . The date of withdrawal is determined by the date that document of withdrawal is received by the Associate Dean for Students . The College of Medicine uses the university schedule for refunds . The schedule is as follows: end of first week - one hundred percent end of second week - seventy-five percent end of third week - fifty percent end of fourth week - twenty-five percent fifth week or later - no refund In the case of a medical withdrawal associated with a medical condition that prevents the completion of studies, a full refund of tuition and fees may be approved by the Associate Dean for Students . Refunds for medical withdrawals apply only to the portion of the year for which payment has been made . Consideration will be given for a medical withdrawal only when an illness or injury makes it impossible to complete a term . A medical withdrawal normally requires withdrawal from all instructional activities . Medical withdrawals will not be approved if the difficulty resulting from an injury or illness was present when the student enrolled for the term. A refund of fees will be processed under the conditions noted . The student must submit a written appeal for a refund or other appeal action to the Associate Dean for Students within six months of the close of the year to which the refund or other appeal action is applicable . Any debts to the university will be deducted from the refund, up to the full amount . The refund amount depends upon eligibility as described below: A refund of fees will be processed automatically based on the date of receipt of the documentation of withdrawal by the Associate Dean for Students . Any outstanding debts owed to the university and the College of Medicine will be deducted from the refund, up to the full amount. Refunds for exceptional circumstances are determined by the college and are available up to 100 percent of tuition and registration fees . Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, sickness, death, involuntary call to military service or administrative error. Refunds for students receiving federal financial aid must adhere to the Return of Title IV Funds Policy noted. Refunds for students receiving university-sponsored aid such as scholarships and grants are subject to the same refund policy. Therefore, if a student is subject to a percent refund of tuition due to early withdrawal, the same percent of gift aid will be refunded to the university. This includes 40 institutional scholarships that cover living expenses. The earlier noted calculation will be performed within 30 days after notification of withdrawal or within 30 days after the university becomes aware of the withdrawal. Return of Title IV Funds Students who withdraw after having received Title IV financial assistance might have to repay a portion of that assistance . If the student's award package includes any federal funds and the withdrawal occurs in the first 60 percent of the payment period , federal regulations require that a portion of the student's federal aid be returned to the aid programs . The portion of the aid to be returned is determined by a refund calculation which is based on the number of days remaining in the period . The return of aid is credited in the following order: Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan Federal GradPLUS Loan Other Aid Students who received Federal Stafford Loans should also know that the College of Medicine Office of Student Financial Services is required to notify the Department of Education of student withdrawals . Approved Leaves of Absence A student who is on an approved leave of absence may retain \"in -institution\" status for Title IV loan repayment purposes . However, if the student does not return from a leave of absence, the student's loan grace period starts at the date the leave began . Moreover, Title IV regulations limit leaves of absence to 180 calendar days for recipients of federal funding . If the student has not completed the course work from the term in which the leave of absence was taken or is not re-enrolled at the end of 180 calendar days, the leave of absence is treated as a withdrawal for federal financial aid purposes. Student Eligibility for Federal Funds To receive aid from most federal financial aid programs, students must meet certain requirements and complete a FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) every year . A student's citizenship status must fall into one of the following categories to receive federal student aid from the U.S. government: U.S. Citizen U.S. Nati onal (includes natives of American Samoa or Swain's Island) U.S. Permanent Resident who has an I-151, I-551, or I-551C (Alien Registration Card) Foreign National holding an Arrival-Departure Record (I-94) from the Department of Homeland Security showing one of the following designations: o \"Refugee\" o \"Asylum -Haitian Entrant\" (valid only if issued before April 1, 1980) Other eligible non-citizens with a Temporary Resident Card (I-688) Foreign national with a suspension of deportation case pending before Congress. If an applicant has only a Notice of Approval to Apply for Permanent Residence (I-171 or I-464A), he or she is n ot eligible for federal student aid. Financial Aid Application Process Please refer to the Student Financial Services Guidebook for specific information regarding the application process and relevant policies. Satisfactory Academic Progress MD Students at UCF College of Medicine who receive Title IV aid must meet the following Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Background All MD students are enrolled full time while in attendance at UCF College of Medicine. Students proceed through the four years of study with class levels delineated at M1, M2, M3 and M4. Medical students' academic, clinical and professional performance is reviewed by the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) on a regular basis. During the Annual Evaluation, each student will be reviewed to determine the student's preparedness for advancement to the next level of medical study. The MD program's academic term is equal to one academic year. MD students do not receive calculated grade point averages. Students receiving all A and B grades for all modules or clerkships in a given year are normally advanced to the next year of study or recommended for graduation. Students with one or more C grades or annotation of T instead of assignment of final grade will be reviewed by the committee to determine appropriate recommendation for followup action which could include no additional requirements; completion of a particular module or examination; requirement to retake a particular module or clerkship; repeating a complete year; or dismissal from the program. The student may also be placed on a probationary status until required actions are completed. Students with one or more F grades will be reviewed separately by the committee to determine their suitability for continuing in the medical education program. The committee may recommend remedial action requiring the student to retake a module/clerkship or repeat a year, or may recommend dismissal from the program. (For more information regarding student advancement, please review the UCF College of Medicine M.D. Student Handbook.) The outcome of each studen t's Annual Evaluation is shared by the Chair of the SEPC with the Office of Student Financial Services (SFS). In turn, at the end of each academic year, SFS determines if the student has met the Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) for eligibility for Title IV aid. 42 Qualitative and Quantitative standards The maximum time frame to complete the four year medical school program is six years from the date that the students start the program . Any exceptions due to extenuating circumstances must be granted by the Associate Dean for Students. Students are expected to successfully complete each year so that they may advance to the next level. If a student does not successfully complete any one academic year, which prevents promotion to the next level, AND that student remains enrolled, then the student will be placed on SAP probationary status, which will be noted in the academic record. The student may receive Title IV aid during the probationary year. At the end of that year, the student's pro gress will again be reviewed, and if the SEPC determines the student successfully completed the year, probationary status ends. The student returns to good standing and may continue to receive Title IV aid. If, however, the student does not successfully complete the probationary year, the status changes from probationary to canceled, and the student cannot receive Title IV aid. Re-establishing eligibility If a student fails to be promoted after a probationary year, then s/he will not receive Title IV aid until such time as the student has successfully been promoted to the next level by the SEPC. If a student takes a leave of absence or withdraws and then returns to UCF College of Medicine, the student's SAP status will remain the same as when s/he le ft UCF. If the status is good or probationary, then the student can receive Title IV aid. Appeals We understand that illness, injury, death of a relative and other unfortunate or unforeseen circumstances that occur in the lives of students adversely affect their academic progress. For this reason, we allow students to submit SAP appeals that explain these mitigating situations. Supporting documentation must be submitted along with the appeal to the Office of Student Financial Services. Appeals are reviewed on a timely basis (within a week if possible) so that students can make financial decisions regarding their continued enrollment. At this time, transfer students are not accepted at UCF College of Medicine, so until such time that this policy ch anges, we are not addressing transferred course work's impact on SAP. Standards of Progress for Veteran Students-M.D. Program 1. Unsatisfactory Performance As defined in the Academic Policies section of the M.D. Program Student Handbook, students with unsatisfactory performance will be subject to dismissal from the College of Medicine. 43 2. Academic Probation As defined in the Academic Policies section of the M.D. Program Student Handbook, students are subject to dismissal from the College of Medicine if they do not achieve academic good standing under established rules . VA benefits will be terminated for VA students for failure to achieve academic good standing and dismissal after probation. 3. Dismissal (Veteran Benefits) As defined in the Academic Policies section of the M.D. Program Student Handbook, benefits may be terminated for VA students who are dismissed from the College of Medicine. For more specific information regarding financial aid and financial services, please refer to the Student Financial Services Guidebook. Academic Policies Honor Council (a.k.a. Student Professional Conduct Council) Students are subject to the rules and regulations of the UCF College of Medicine's Student Handbook . The Honor Council (a.k.a. Student Professional Conduct Council) has as its duties the consideration of students where suitability for the practice of medicine needs to be evaluated. In granting the M.D. degree, the faculty of the college endorses each student as being suitable for the practice of medicine . Students, where their suitability for practice is questioned due to behavioral, ethical, or other reasons, will be reviewed by the council . The council realizes that some behaviors may call for accommodation as a disability . Grading Policy See page 32 of this Bulletin for detailed information on the grade system. Medical Student Advancement More detailed information on medical student advancement can be found under the \"Advancement of Stud ents\" section in the M.D. Program Student Handbook. Advancement Process The Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) regularly reviews the academic and clinical performance of each medical student . Students are reviewed at each meeting of the c omm ittee . Students who are experiencing academic difficulty may be referred to the Director of Student Academic Support Services. The student 's faculty advisor will also be notified. The SEPC uses the following process for evaluation and advancement: I. The SEPC shall review the academic and clinical performance of each medical student and make recommendations regarding advancement, graduation, probation, dismissal, remediation, leaves of absence, and re-admission. 44 II. The committee will review the performance of students in academic difficulty, those students demonstrating a potential for being in academic difficulty, and those students who have exhibited unprofessional behavior or non-compliance with other standards of performance . The committee may recommend an improvement plan, may develop more comprehensive longer- term remedial plans for those students having difficulty, or implement appropriate disciplinary action, possibly including dismissal from the educational program. III. The committee will recognize the achievements of those students displaying exceptional or outstanding performance. IV. The committee chair will notify each student of the committee's recommendation regarding advancement or disciplinary action and provide the student with an opportunity to appeal that recommendation if they desire. V. The Dean makes the final decision regarding an appropriate course of action for each student. Further information on the Student Evaluation and Promotion Committee (SEPC) may be found in the M.D. Program Student Handbook. Annual Evaluation Each student is reviewed annually by the SEPC to determine the student's preparedness for advancement to the next level of medical study . Students receiving all A and B grades for all modules or clerkships in a given year are normally advanced to the next year of study or recommended for graduation . Students with one or more C grades or annotation of T instead of assignment of final grade are reviewed by the committee to determine appropriate follow-up or action which could include no additional requirements, completion of a particular course or examination, repeating a particular module or clerkship, repeating a complete year, dismiss al from the program, or other recommendations . The student may also be placed in a probationary status until required actions are completed . Students with one or more F grades will be reviewed separately by the committee to determine thei r suitability for continuing in the medical education program . The committee may recommend remedial action requiring the student to retake a module/clerkship or repeat a year, or may recommend dismissal from the program. Appeal of Advancement Recommendation A student may appeal the advancement recommendation by the SEPC if the student feels that that the recommendation was not made in accordance with the advancement policy specified for the program or other requirements of continued enrollment or professionalism. The student may be advised by the Associate or Assistant Dean for Students and College of Medicine M.D. Registrar regarding official 45 policies. The written request for an appeal is directed initially to the chair of the SEPC for resolution by the committee. If the issue is not fully resolved, then a formal written appeal stating the specific reasons that support the appeal must be made in writing to the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs within 10 business days after receiving notification of the SEPC recommendation regarding the appeal . After an appropriate review, the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs will recommend final disposition of the appeal . A student wishing to appeal to the Dean concerning the recommendation must make a written request within 15 business days of receipt of written notification of the recommendation from the Associate Dean for Faculty and Academic Affairs . Acting as the university president's representative, the Dean of the College of Medicine shall make a final decision on the matter within 10 business days of receipt of the student's written request for review . In the event student progression is delayed, a student will be assigned to the present or adjusted year SEPC as is deemed appropriate by the present SEPC.

To that end, students accepted into this program spend time in a variety of clinical settings so that they come in regular contact with patients from diverse ethnic and sociologic backgrounds that manifest an equally diverse array of medical problems . Students are also given ample time to conduct individualized study and research. Objectives The \"general objectives of the educational program\" have been defined by the M.D. Program Curriculum Committee as the core competencies expected of all graduates from the College of Medicine . 46 The curriculum not only prepares physicians to practice medicine, but also incorporates several themes that begin in the first year and carry through until graduation . These themes address current problems with medical education that must be improved to produce physicians who can think independently and work as team members of health care groups . Program Objectives The college has defined a mission and a set of student learning outcomes and objectives at the program level. These learning objectives span six dimensions: Medical knowledge (6) Patient care (12) Systems-based practice (7) Practice-based learning and improvement (4) Ethics and professionalism (6) Interpersonal and communication skills (3) These dimensions correspond to competency domains described by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education. The specific program learning objectives incorporate all of the objectives suggested by the Medical School Objectives Project of the AAMC as well as other outcomes and objectives identified by the faculty as particularly relevant for College of Medicine graduates. More information on the program objectives can be found at http://www.med.ucf.edu/academics/md/objectives.asp . Four-Year Curriculum The UCF M.D. program curriculum fully integrates basic and clinical sciences across all four years. The first two years of the curriculum are structured into modules, with the first year focusing on a fundamental understanding of how the various basic science disciplines relate to the normal human body. The second year takes an organ system-based approach and applies the basic knowledge of the first year to the study of clinical disease, pathological processes, and treatment. In concert with these aspects of medicine, the curriculum also covers psychosocial issues, cultural differences, communication skills, and physical diagnosis skills as they relate to the different topics in medicine. The third and fourth years of the curriculum are devoted to clinical experience through clerkships, selectives, and electives. The clinical curriculum provides practical patient experiences complemented by basic science lectures, simulations, journal clubs, and conferences throughout the six core clerkships. Integrated throughout all four years of the M.D. program, Longitudinal Curricular Themes (LCT 's) will emphasize critical aspects of medicine and medical care that are not addressed in the basic core curriculum. The LCT's include Ethics and Humanities, Gender -Based Medicine, Medical Informatics, Medical Spanish, Medical Nutrition, Geriatrics, Palliative Care, Cultural Medicine, and Patient Safety. Each of these themes will be highlighted when appropriate in the core curriculum and reinforced through a variety of interactive experiences. 47 Overall, the four year medical curriculum at UCF is designed to fully integrate basic science and clinical medicine, provide students with appreciation of cultural diversity and the need for sensitivity in treating patients, foster professionalism in all interactions, and ignite a passion for life-long learning.

In the P -2 module, students continue to develop physical examination and communication skills and further prepare for clinical problems in medicine, such as patient interaction, ethical and medico -socioeconomic issues, and skills necessary for effective communication. Problem -focused interviewing techniques and physical examination skills are mastered, with emphasis on compassionate dealing with individuals with certain medical conditions. End -of-life issues and socioeconomic related topics are covered with emphasis on humanities and community medicine. Communication with patients, other healthcare providers and the community at large are emphasized. The Community of Practice component is integrated within P -2 as students continue to work with preceptors throughout Central Florida med ical community, expanding their experiences with clinical patients in a manner fully correlated with the curriculum of the second year. As in P -1, students encounter Standardized Patients, and use simulation and web -based activities in this module for the learning, practice and assessment of physician skills. P-2 culminates in a week -long instructional unit presenting students with a variety of clinical problems without knowing the organ system being presented. These clinical cases incorporate problems fro m the entire spectrum of medical care. Emphasis is placed on how doctors think and act to manage diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, including management of complications. Types of errors are identified along with methods for error recognition and prevent ion. Clinical cases are presented in both live and simulated case format. A major objective of this unit is to increase stude nts' awareness of the need to be systematic and complete in their analysis of information available. This experience is intended t o prepare students for situations they will likely encounter during the clerkship experience. 53 I-2: Focused Individual Research Experience ( 31 weeks; five credit hours) Description During year 2 of the \"Keep the Dream Alive\" module, students complete their projects initiated during year 1 and present them to faculty and peers during a mini -conference highlighting their work. It is expected that projects result in a scholarly presentation or publication. The conference is scheduled so that bot h first -year and second -year students can attend, providing opportunity for second -year students to serve as role models for their classmates. Projects and research may extend into the third and fourth years, and for students continuing their research, add itional opportunities for presentation are available. Third-Year Curriculum (50 weeks; credit hours as noted below) Following a oneweek orientation to the third year, students rotate through a set of required Core Clerkships in Internal and Family Medicine, Surgery and Surgical Selectives, Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Psychiatry and Neurology. Required Third -Year Courses (clerkships) Weeks Credit Hours Core Clerkship in Internal and Family Medicine 12 16 Core Clerkship in Neurology 6 8 Core Clerkship in Obstetrics and Gynecology 6 8 Core Clerkship in Pediatrics 6 8 Core Clerkship in Psychiatry 6 8 Core Clerkship in Surgery and Surgical Selectives 12 16 Third-Year Clerkship Descriptions Core Clerkship Internal and Family Medicine (16 credit hours) Description During this clerkship, students will participate and demonstrate competence in humanistic and evidence -based inpatient and outpatient care of patients with common medical disorders. Students will also learn appropriate health promotion and health screening fo r adult patients. Students will learn to work as part of a medical team in all settings and will understan d the roles of the interdisciplinary patient care team. Learning activities will include preceptor -supervised clinical experience, clerkship -specific didactics, use of standardized patients and medical simulations and self -directed learning utilizing infor mation technology. The clerkship has specified the types of patients and clinical conditions students need to encounter, and the physical examination skills and testing and procedural skills that st udents need to master. 54 Core Clerkship in Surgery and Surgical Selectives (8 credit hours) Description Surgical Clerkship will introduce the student to the workup, diagnosis, treatment and follow -up of a wide variety of surgical diseases. Evidence -based practices will be emphasized. The student will spend 6 weeks on a general surgical service, and then will subsequently spend 3 two -week blocks on surgical and other specialties, examples of which include vascular surgery, ENT, radiology and orthopedics. St udents will be responsible for the evaluat ion and workup of patients in the emergency room and wards as well as in the outpatient setting. Participation in daily inpatient multidisciplinary ward rounds will be emphasized as well as active participation in a wide a rray of bedside surgical procedure s and major operative interventions under general anesthesia. In hospital call will be a requirement. The student will also be responsible for regular attendance at weekly didactic conferences, grand rounds, journal club conferences and morbidity an d morta lity conferences and simulator/animal lab experiences. During the General Surgery Clerkship, students also participate in three two week blocks during which students have an opport unity to choose from a number of surgical (e.g. vascular surgery) and other specialty areas (including, for example, ophthalmology). Core Clerkship in Obstetrics and Gynecology (8 credit hours) Description While on the Obstetrics and Gynecology clerkship, the student will be considered an integral part of the clinical team and have the opportunity for a broad range of clinical experiences in the Labor and Delivery suite, operating room, ambulatory clinics and inpatient hospital services. Didactic sessions including lectures, clinical skills workshops and case study seminars wil l supplement the core clinical experience. Students should come away from the clerkship with an understanding of the role of the obstetrician/gynecologist a s a primary health care provider for women of all ages, the importance of the gynecologic history an d physical examination in the overall assessment of the health of women, and the major significance of competent obstetrical and gynecologic care in public health and preventive medicine. Core Clerkship in Pediatrics (8 credit hours) Description This clerkship will introduce third -year medical students to the basic principles of general pediatrics. Through both inpatient and outpatient encounters with children across the age range of pediatric, from neonates through young adulthood, the student will ge t exposure to the clinical care of children. The learner will participate in the newborn nursery and outpatient health supervision visits where the fundamental concepts of the pediatric interview and physical exam, growth and development, anticipatory guid ance, primary prevention, screening, and vaccination will be presented. Clinical experience with acute/chronic illness visits will afford the learner exposure to comm on pediatric complaints and symptoms as well as common pediatric diagnoses. Participation in the inpatient component of this course will solidify students' pediatric skills of data gathering, data synthesis, the development of problem lists and working diagnoses, and for mulating therapeutic plans while being a member of a health care team provi ding family -centered care to children. Core Clerkship in Neurology (8 credit hours) Description Between 10% and 15% of primary care visits may involve complaints referable to the nervous system. Neurologic problems may ac count for up to 1 in 5 hospital admissions. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., and is the single most common cause of long -term disability, and Alzheimer's disease is a growing public health problem. For these and other reasons, education of non -specialists in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neurologic disease is essential to integrated health care delivery. The goal of the Neurology cl erkship is to formulate a diagnosis, begin an appropriate diagnostic evaluation, and initiate a rational treatment pl an for common neurologic conditions. The clerkship accomplishes these aims by application of clinical neuroscience to the neurologic history and examination. Inpa tient and outpatient experiences expose students to the full spectrum of neurologic disease. 55 Core Clerkship in Psychiatry (8 credit hours) Description During this clerkship, students will participate in evidence -based and patient -centered inpatient and outpatient care of patients with psychiatric disorders. Learning activities will include preceptor -supervised clinical experience, clerkship -specific didactics, use of standardized patients, and self -directed learning utilizing information technology. The clerkship has specified the types of patients and clinical conditions students need to en counter, and the physical/mental examination skills, and testing and procedural skills that students need to master. The third year concludes with a one week capstone experience and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) which must be passed before the student begins the fourth year. Fourth-Year Curriculum ( 33-45 weeks, including elective courses; 6 credit h ours each) The fourth year is divided into twelve, four-week blocks. All students rotate through four weeks each of Emergency Medicine, Critical Care, and two Acting Internships. Of the remaining eight blocks of the year, four are devoted to electives where students can gain additional clinical experiences locally or nationally, and one is reserved for the a capstone experience that provides preparation for internship, leadership training and teaching experience. The remaining three months can be used for another elective, independent study, further research or residency interviews.

Graduation Requirements Minimum Requirements for Advancement I. Year One to Year Two: For promotion, a student must obtain a passing grade in all required modules that comprise the Year One curriculum of the College of Medicine. II. Year Two to Year Three : For promotion, a student must have obtained a passing grade in all required modules that comprise the Year Two curriculum of the medical school, and have taken and passed the USMLE Step 1. 56 III. Year Three to Year Four : For promotion, a student must have obtained a passing grade in all required clerkships that comprise the Year Three curriculum and successfully passed the Comprehensive Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE). The OSCE is a multi station skills exam in which the Standardized Patient (SP) allows the student to perform a five- to-seven minute focused clinical skills exam on them, under the observation of a clinical observer, who assesses and grades their performance. This exam is administered at the end of the year. More detailed information on policies and procedures related to medical student advancement can be found under the \"Medical Student Advancement\" section in the M.D. Program Student Handbook. Requirements for Graduation I. A student must have obtained a passing grade (C or better) in all modules or clerkships and required educational activities of the established curricul um of the College of Medicine leading to the M.D. degree. II. In the future when transfer students are admitted with advanced standing from other LCME approved schools, they must complete, at the minimum, the last two years of the curriculum at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. III. All students must take the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and pass at the national standard in order to graduate. This examination is usually taken by all students in April following the second-year studies. In addition, all students must take and pass the USMLE Step 2 CK and Step 2 CS examinations in order to be certified for graduation. Students should take the Step 2 CK and the Step 2 CS examinations no later than December 31 in the fourth year. IV. Students must have satisfactorily passed and completed the fourth year curriculum. V. The student must not have a financial obligation to the University. VI. The student must have satisfactorily demonstrated the professional attitudes and values expected of physicians. Each student is reviewed during the fourth year by the SEPC to determine the student's suitability for graduation. In conducting that review, the committee examines the student's performance in the pre - clinical areas, clinical performance in the clerkships, and professionalism exhibited throughout the program of study and during the capstone experience. In addition, the committee verifies that any required examinations have been completed. Students are certified for graduation with the M.D. degree upon approval by the SEPC. Assessment of the Curriculum As part of the curriculum development, the M.D. Program Curriculum Committee has identified specific learning outcomes and objectives for each instructional module . These module outcomes and objectives 57 are mapped to the program outcomes and objectives . Formative methods of evaluation are incorporated throughout each module of study using multiple assessment approaches appropriate to the module. In addition, there are one or more summative evaluations during each module. The M.D. Program Curriculum Committee compiles student performance information from examinations, USMLE exam results, NBME subject exam results and faculty and student evaluations and uses this information to assess the curriculum . The assessment reviews learning outcomes and measures student performance on the outcomes on an annual basis and the M.D. Program Curriculum Committee uses this information to improve the program . Another important tool that will be helpful in curricular decision-making is the AAMC Graduation Questionnaire, a questionnaire for all graduating M.D. students in the United States . Results will be used to assess particular courses and the M.D. Program in general. The following indicators will be used to determine educational program effectiveness: Results of USMLE or other national examinations Student scores on internally developed examinations Performance-based assessment of clinical skills (e.g., OSCEs) Student responses on AAMC Medical School Graduation Questionnaire Student evaluation of courses and clerkships Student advancement and graduation rates NRMP results Specialty choice of graduates Assessment of residency performance of graduates Licensure rates of graduates Specialty certification rates Practice location of graduates Practice type of graduates Other (College of Medicine Program Assessment Measures) Abbreviations The following is a list of abbreviations used in the College of Medicine M.D. Program Bulletin: AAMC -Association of American Medical Colleges AMCAS - American Medical College Application Service CDC - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COA - Cost of Attendance COM - College of Medicine ERAS - Electronic Residency Application Service FAFSA - Free Application for Federal Student Aid 58 FERPA - Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act LCME - Liaison Committee on Medical Education MCAT - Medical College Admission Test MEDS - Medical Education Delivery System MSAC - Medical Student Admissions Committee SEPC - Student Evaluations and Promotion Committee SPCC - Student Professional Conduct Council UCF - University of Central Florida USMLE - United States Medical Licensing Examination "}
