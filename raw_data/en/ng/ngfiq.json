Owing to an inadequate understanding of herb/supplement-drug interactions, the simultaneous consumption of these products may result in deleterious effects and, in extreme cases, even fatal outcomes. This systematic review is aimed at understanding the knowledge and beliefs about the consumption of herbs/supplements and herb/drug-supplement interactions (HDIs). The study follows the PRISMA guidelines. Four online databases (Web of Science; PubMed; Cochrane; and EBSCOhost) were searched, and a total of 44 studies were included, encompassing 16,929 participants. Herb and supplement consumption is explained mostly by the reported benefits across multiple conditions and ease of use. Regarding HDIs, most people take both herbs/supplements and prescription drugs simultaneously. Only a small percentage of participants have knowledge about their interaction effects, and many reported adverse interactions or side effects. Nevertheless, the main reason for stopping the prescribed drug intake is the perceived lack of its effect, and not due to interactions. Therefore, it is important to increase the knowledge about supplement use so that further strategies can be elaborated to better detect or be alert for whenever a potentially dangerous reaction and/or interaction may occur. This paper raises awareness regarding the need for developing a decision support system and ends with some considerations about the development of a technological solution capable of detecting HDIs and, thereby, aiding in the improvement of pharmacy services.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-05-13", "cleaned_text": "Knowledge and Beliefs about Herb/Supplement Consumption and Herb/Supplement-Drug Interactions among the General Population, including Healthcare Professionals and Pharmacists: A Systematic Review and Guidelines for a Smart Decision System [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15102298](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15102298) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-nutrients-15-02298)], in the postpartum period [ [2](#B2-nutrients-15-02298)], and among pregnant women [ [3](#B3-nutrients-15-02298), [4](#B4-nutrients-15-02298)], including dietary supplements (DS) [ [5](#B5-nutrients-15-02298), [6](#B6-nutrients-15-02298), [7](#B7-nutrients-15-02298), [8](#B8-nutrients-15-02298), [9](#B9-nutrients-15-02298)]. HMs include herbs, herbal substances, and products of plants or a combination of plants that were used even before the discovery of conventional drugs [ [10](#B10-nutrients-15-02298)]. DSs include ingredients such as vitamins, minerals, dietary herbs, amino acids, and enzymes [ [11](#B11-nutrients-15-02298)]. The same phenomenon of increased consumption has been occurring as regards image- and performance-enhancing supplements or drugs (IPEDs), also known as lifestyle drugs, comprising various products, including anabolic steroids, sexual enhancers, growth hormones, and other drugs that can alter the functions of the body to enhance muscle growth, reduce body fat, and promote weight loss [ [12](#B12-nutrients-15-02298)]. The consumption of this kind of product has increased worldwide, as shown in several papers (e.g., [ [12](#B12-nutrients-15-02298)], namely during the COVID-19 lockdown). In a recent study involving seven countries, the participants reported the use of a wide range of drugs and medicines to boost their image and performance (28%), which was maintained during the lockdown, mostly in Hungary (56.6%), Japan (46.8%), and the UK (33.8%), or started taking new IPEDs (6.4%) [ [13](#B13-nutrients-15-02298)]. [14](#B14-nutrients-15-02298)], have raised serious health concerns due to potentially dangerous interactions that could occur between prescription medications and herbs/supplements [ [15](#B15-nutrients-15-02298), [16](#B16-nutrients-15-02298), [17](#B17-nutrients-15-02298)]. Directly connected with the possible drug interactions are cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP), which are essential for the metabolism of drugs [ [18](#B18-nutrients-15-02298), [19](#B19-nutrients-15-02298)]. The possible interactions arise when the ingested drugs have CYP activity, which can cause a variety of reactions, such as inhibiting or inducing CYP activity [ [18](#B18-nutrients-15-02298)]. These enzymes are mostly found in the liver and, depending on their pathway, can have a different designation (i.e., CYP1, CYP2) [ [18](#B18-nutrients-15-02298)]. Studies show that certain herbal products have an effect on CYP pathways, such as inhibiting their activity [ [20](#B20-nutrients-15-02298)], which can lead to potential Herb/supplement-Drug Interactions (HDIs) when administering drugs that are metabolized by the same enzyme [ [20](#B20-nutrients-15-02298), [21](#B21-nutrients-15-02298), [22](#B22-nutrients-15-02298)]. Studies also show that the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATB-binding cassette transporter responsible for taking toxins and xenobiotics out of cells [ [23](#B23-nutrients-15-02298)], is also affected by various Natural Products (NP) [ [20](#B20-nutrients-15-02298), [24](#B24-nutrients-15-02298)], which can result in its inhibition [ [25](#B25-nutrients-15-02298)]. Herbs that affect P-gp also show effects on CYP, further validating the importance of these two compounds on HDIs [ [25](#B25-nutrients-15-02298)]. [26](#B26-nutrients-15-02298)]. Similar to Licorice, Grapefruit also alters CYPs, namely in the intestinal wall [ [27](#B27-nutrients-15-02298)], due to the high dose of 6,7-dihidroxybergamottin (DHB) that they contain [ [28](#B28-nutrients-15-02298)]. Grapefruit consumption has also been shown to increase the levels of simvastatin and lovastatin, and, to a lesser degree, the levels of atorvastatin [ [28](#B28-nutrients-15-02298)]. St John's wort also potentiates HDIs, by altering the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, through the activation of PXR [ [29](#B29-nutrients-15-02298)]. [14](#B14-nutrients-15-02298)]. Most community pharmacists have a positive attitude regarding the use of herbs/supplements and show good practices toward these products, recognizing the possible adverse effects of HDIs and related contraindications [ [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298)]. Pharmacists are in the unique position of being in contact with the public due to their proximity to the communities, and they have the ability to follow-up with the user for longer periods when compared to many other healthcare professionals [ [31](#B31-nutrients-15-02298)]. They can thus educate patients about the use, efficacy, side effects, and potential interactions of these products with prescription medications [ [32](#B32-nutrients-15-02298), [33](#B33-nutrients-15-02298)]. However, given that the acquisition of herbs/supplements is not restricted to pharmacies, the major concerns about the effects of these products should be directed at the general population, among whom knowledge about the potential risks of herb/supplement consumption is limited [ [34](#B34-nutrients-15-02298)]. This lack of information is not limited to herb/supplement consumption but also includes the HDIs. This interaction is defined as the pharmacological response to the administration of, or co-exposure to, a drug with another substance that modifies the patient's response to that drug [ [35](#B35-nutrients-15-02298)], which can result in serious health problems [ [17](#B17-nutrients-15-02298), [36](#B36-nutrients-15-02298)]. For this reason, the general population's lack of knowledge regarding this interaction effect has been of concern to public health authorities [ [37](#B37-nutrients-15-02298)]. In other words, the lack of knowledge regarding supplements, together with concerns about changes in body image, can lead to harmful behaviors that could promote the intake of supplements that guarantee immediate results in terms of body transformation [ [13](#B13-nutrients-15-02298)]. The possible interactions of these substances with other prescription drugs and the associated health risks raise the need for new types of interventions by healthcare professionals, namely pharmacists [ [38](#B38-nutrients-15-02298), [39](#B39-nutrients-15-02298)]. [34](#B34-nutrients-15-02298)]. Although there is limited evidence about the use of these supplements in the prevention or treatment of diseases [ [40](#B40-nutrients-15-02298)], the marketing of these herbs/supplements has been increasing, as previously mentioned [ [15](#B15-nutrients-15-02298), [41](#B41-nutrients-15-02298), [42](#B42-nutrients-15-02298)]. [43](#B43-nutrients-15-02298)]. [44](#B44-nutrients-15-02298)], a social representation is a system of values, ideas, and practices that are acquired through communication and interactions among group members and between members and institutions, such as the media. This communication is carried out through two processes, namely, anchoring and objectification. Through social representations, individuals can acquire collective cognitions that fit within a certain group. In the case of CAMs, the representations that society has about these types of products, and about health and illness, can be integrated within the person's viewpoint [ [45](#B45-nutrients-15-02298)]. Thus, the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of the individual are influenced by the community, even if the person has a certain degree of autonomy. These representations are conveyed through communication, namely, through the processes of anchoring and objectification [ [45](#B45-nutrients-15-02298)]. Anchoring refers to the process by which beliefs about supplements and herbal medicines are anchored on something that was already known to facilitate the understanding of the new phenomenon. Although anchoring facilitates an increased understanding of the new phenomenon through the already known information, it can also create erroneous beliefs about the new phenomenon. For example, a study showed that about 69% of people think that cancer can be controlled with naturally available herbs [ [10](#B10-nutrients-15-02298)]. Despite the potential importance of these products, their use might be dangerous. Concerning objectification, its aim is also to facilitate communication, but through visual and linguistic tools that serve to describe and make the belief psychologically tangible. For instance, the concepts of herbs and supplements are associated with medicine, and with natural and nutritional terms. Therefore, anchoring and objectification will contribute to the development of social representations about herbs/supplements in the population, thus integrating them in individuals' behaviors, lifestyles, and routines. If the representations are too divergent from the reality of the herb/supplements' effects from the reality of their interactions with prescription medications, then, the interventions for behavioral changes in the population, regarding the intake of these substances, may be inappropriate or ineffective. For example, if herbs/supplements are anchored on natural substances, the prevention of interaction consequences will be ignored. To get to social representations, it is thus important to explore the beliefs and attitudes of the population about supplements and other herbal medicines. [46](#B46-nutrients-15-02298), [47](#B47-nutrients-15-02298), [48](#B48-nutrients-15-02298), [49](#B49-nutrients-15-02298)], this information is not reviewed and organized in a systematic manner that allows the medical community and other governmental entities to access and interpret the evidence clearly, and to objectively formulate recommendations to address this problem. [50](#B50-nutrients-15-02298)]. Therefore, the understanding of the perspectives on HDIs will increase the comprehension of the necessary factors to consider when formulating support strategies in this area, effectively responding to real needs. Additionally, as shown by Wilson et al. [ [51](#B51-nutrients-15-02298)], an effective expansion of the services provided by a pharmacy is correlated with an approach that seeks to know and to supply services that are of value to the patient. Moreover, this type of approach shows a correlation, mediated by the efficiency in service expansion, with pharmacists' performance. Another aspect to take into consideration in the implementation of support strategies is adherence. The implementation should integrate the capacity to respond to the factors that govern adherence to treatment, which include the understanding of beliefs, values, attitudes, and motivation/capability to do so. The consideration of these factors will allow the development of support strategies that promote a higher degree of adherence and that take into consideration the needs of the people who look for them [ [52](#B52-nutrients-15-02298)]. [53](#B53-nutrients-15-02298)]. [54](#B54-nutrients-15-02298)]. [55](#B55-nutrients-15-02298)]. 2. Materials and Methods [56](#B56-nutrients-15-02298)] were followed to guide the general stages and protocols of this review. 2.1. Search Strategy 2.2. Study Selection [57](#B57-nutrients-15-02298)]. The Rayyan Intelligent Systematic Review tool [ [58](#B58-nutrients-15-02298)] was used to ensure the blind application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. An inter-rater agreement value of 0.853 was obtained. The decisions by the two independent reviewers were compared, and disagreements were resolved through discussion. 3. Results [Figure 1](#nutrients-15-02298-f001)), namely, Web of Science (n = 237), PubMed (n = 56), Cochrane (n = 18), and EBSCOhost (n = 96). After the exclusion of duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 293 articles were analyzed. Of these, 240 articles were excluded due to the following reasons: (a) Not mentioning the variables in the research question (e.g., herbs, supplements, or dietary) (n = 97); (b) Outside the determined period (n = 89); (c) Outside the scope of the review (lacking assessment of beliefs, attitudes or knowledge about the herbs/supplements (n = 44); (d) Other than the intended language (n = 4); (e) Non-empirical studies (n = 3); (f) Different population (i.e., animals) (n = 2); and (g) Publication type (i.e., dissertation, thesis, commentary articles) (n = 1). A total of 53 articles were sought for retrieval, with one not being available. A total of 52 full-text articles were read in full and some were excluded for being outside the scope of the review (not mentioning herbs, supplements or dietary) (n = 5). Others were excluded for not being considered as a full article/original study (conference abstract) (n = 3), and another was excluded for consisting of the development and validation of a questionnaire (n = 1). Overall, 44 papers met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. The two independent reviewers obtained a Cohen coefficient of 0.853, indicating almost a perfect agreement in the selection process [ [59](#B59-nutrients-15-02298)]. 3.1. Study Characteristics [60](#B60-nutrients-15-02298)]. Most studies used a correlational/comparative design. Specifically, 37 followed a cross-sectional [94](#B94-nutrients-15-02298)] ( [Table 2](#nutrients-15-02298-t002)). Three studies used [95](#B95-nutrients-15-02298), [96](#B96-nutrients-15-02298), [97](#B97-nutrients-15-02298)] and two used mixed-method (qualitative [ [98](#B98-nutrients-15-02298), [99](#B99-nutrients-15-02298)] ( [Table 1](#nutrients-15-02298-t001)). The studies' results concerning knowledge, beliefs, perceptions or attitudes about supplements, interactions, and risks/adverse effects are shown in [Supplementary Material](#app1-nutrients-15-02298), include complete or any information on the gender of the participants. Some studies [ [10](#B10-nutrients-15-02298), [61](#B61-nutrients-15-02298), [63](#B63-nutrients-15-02298), [74](#B74-nutrients-15-02298)] did not include information on the age of the participants. To the authors' knowledge, the age of the participants ranged from 14 to 88 years. [Figure 2](#nutrients-15-02298-f002)highlights their geographical distribution. The data presented shows that the number of studies per country is the following: USA (n = 8); Saudi Arabia (n = 5); Jordan (n = 4); Nigeria (n = 4); Lebanon (n = 3); Brazil (n = 3); India (n = 2); Serbia (n = 2); Australia (n = 2); Hungary (n = 1); Pakistan (n = 1); South Africa (n = 1); Portugal (n = 1); Malaysia (n = 1); England (n = 1); Germany (n = 1); United Arabs Emirates (n = 1); Palestine (n = 1); and across several countries (n = 2). 3.2. Instruments of Data through interviews [ [2](#B2-nutrients-15-02298), [61](#B61-nutrients-15-02298), [96](#B96-nutrients-15-02298), [99](#B99-nutrients-15-02298)] and three of these studies used focus groups [ [92](#B92-nutrients-15-02298), [95](#B95-nutrients-15-02298), [97](#B97-nutrients-15-02298)]. 3.3. and safe [ [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298), [82](#B82-nutrients-15-02298)] by pharmacists and by the general population (respectively, useful [ [62](#B62-nutrients-15-02298), [84](#B84-nutrients-15-02298), [85](#B85-nutrients-15-02298)] and safe [ [62](#B62-nutrients-15-02298), [68](#B68-nutrients-15-02298), [88](#B88-nutrients-15-02298)]). In addition, they were considered to be easy to use by the general population [ [62](#B62-nutrients-15-02298), [88](#B88-nutrients-15-02298)]. Other healthcare professionals also considered these products to be useful [ [77](#B77-nutrients-15-02298)] and easy to use [ [81](#B81-nutrients-15-02298)], and patients considered them to be safe [ [7](#B7-nutrients-15-02298), [64](#B64-nutrients-15-02298), [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298), [87](#B87-nutrients-15-02298), reported that herbs/supplements prevent and/or cure diseases, including diabetes [ [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298), [64](#B64-nutrients-15-02298), [76](#B76-nutrients-15-02298), [88](#B88-nutrients-15-02298)], and alleviate other health problems, such as constipation and acne [ [64](#B64-nutrients-15-02298)], or cancer [ [10](#B10-nutrients-15-02298), [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298), [91](#B91-nutrients-15-02298)]. In other studies, the general population used these products to help combat COVID-19, to prevent contagion, and to cure it, along with other medications [ [92](#B92-nutrients-15-02298), [98](#B98-nutrients-15-02298)]. Pharmacists [ [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298), [88](#B88-nutrients-15-02298)] and the general population [ [95](#B95-nutrients-15-02298)] used these substances for the home treatment of hypertension and related symptoms. Patients [ [2](#B2-nutrients-15-02298), [7](#B7-nutrients-15-02298), [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298)] and the general population [ [72](#B72-nutrients-15-02298)] used them to increase disease control. Some reported that supplements were important for maintaining a healthy life, namely the general population [ [72](#B72-nutrients-15-02298), [84](#B84-nutrients-15-02298), [88](#B88-nutrients-15-02298), [92](#B92-nutrients-15-02298)], patients [ [64](#B64-nutrients-15-02298), [ [78](#B78-nutrients-15-02298)]. [7](#B7-nutrients-15-02298)] reported a panoply of understandings about the functions of herbs/supplements among patients, some of which were described above. For example, in patients' views, these products were beneficial for low-level deficiencies, fertility, overall health, brain health, breast feeding, energy, diabetes and blood glucose regulation, depression, sleep, relaxation, joint pain and arthritis, increased metabolism, heart health, eye health, post-workout muscle-strength recovery, gastrointestinal health, menopause and hot flashes, good skin-hair-nails, prevention of urinary tract infections, increased immunity, prostate health, sexual enhancement, weight loss, aging, decreased cholesterol levels, migraines, anti-inflammatory action, memory, post-bariatric surgery, lowered blood pressure, post-traumatic stress disorder, chemotherapy, liver, nausea, and increased circulation and blood flow. Studies have also reported the use of herbs/supplements without technical advice or supervision, by both the general population [ [62](#B62-nutrients-15-02298), [95](#B95-nutrients-15-02298)] and patients [ [64](#B64-nutrients-15-02298), [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298)]. In other studies, herbs/supplements were used by patients in view of the limited benefits obtained from conventional medicines [ [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298)]. In some studies, patients reported having a more natural treatment with the use of herbs/supplements, and others used these products as a complementary measure to treatment [ [97](#B97-nutrients-15-02298)]. For pharmacists, herbs/supplements were used for maternal health purposes, such as to reduce colic and treat hemorrhoids [ [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298)]. For patients, they were used for increasing lactation and for weight control [ [2](#B2-nutrients-15-02298)]. For healthcare workers [ [66](#B66-nutrients-15-02298), [99](#B99-nutrients-15-02298)], pharmacists [ [73](#B73-nutrients-15-02298)], and the general population [ [95](#B95-nutrients-15-02298)], HM was considered to be the most frequently recommended treatment [ [66](#B66-nutrients-15-02298), [73](#B73-nutrients-15-02298), [95](#B95-nutrients-15-02298), [99](#B99-nutrients-15-02298)]. Some participants, such as pharmacists [ [69](#B69-nutrients-15-02298), [86](#B86-nutrients-15-02298)] and healthcare professionals [ [71](#B71-nutrients-15-02298)], were not sure if they had used HM [ [69](#B69-nutrients-15-02298), [71](#B71-nutrients-15-02298), [86](#B86-nutrients-15-02298)], or if they have any knowledge on herbs/supplements (some healthcare professionals) [ [71](#B71-nutrients-15-02298), [79](#B79-nutrients-15-02298)]. In other studies, the general population [ [68](#B68-nutrients-15-02298)], pharmacists [ [82](#B82-nutrients-15-02298)], and patients [ [83](#B83-nutrients-15-02298)] had no knowledge about herbs/supplements at all, or little specific training on these products [ [10](#B10-nutrients-15-02298), [78](#B78-nutrients-15-02298), [96](#B96-nutrients-15-02298)], general [43](#B43-nutrients-15-02298)] and pharmacists [ [89](#B89-nutrients-15-02298), [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)], in particular, about some of the benefits that certain types of supplements have on people's lives. For example, in community pharmacists' perspectives, Echinacea is used to boost immunity; St John's wort is commonly used for mild to moderate depression; Arnica is used for minor skin irritations and bruising; Ginger is used for motion sickness, nausea and pregnancy-associated vomiting; Ginkgo delays dementia; and Chamomile is indicated for inflammation, anxiety, and insomnia [ [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)]. 3.4.2. Interaction between Herbs/Supplements and Prescription Drugs [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298), [83](#B83-nutrients-15-02298), [87](#B87-nutrients-15-02298)]. In other studies, patients [ [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298)], pharmacists [ [74](#B74-nutrients-15-02298), [75](#B75-nutrients-15-02298)], and the general population [ [68](#B68-nutrients-15-02298), [72](#B72-nutrients-15-02298)] believed that herbs/supplements can interact with prescription drugs and with other herbs/supplements [ [93](#B93-nutrients-15-02298)], and that some groups (in one study, the elderly and children) were more likely to experience interactions when compared to other groups [ [72](#B72-nutrients-15-02298)]. [89](#B89-nutrients-15-02298), [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)] and other healthcare professionals [ [77](#B77-nutrients-15-02298)] are aware of the risks of possible interactions. In some studies, pharmacists reported the possibility of Ginkgo increasing the risk of bleeding when combined with Warfarin, and the cautionary use of Valerian if patients are using benzodiazepines [ [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)]. In other studies, pharmacists reported that the risks associated with HDIs with medications included, for example, increased bleeding, heart or blood pressure problems, and altered mental status [ [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298)]. Those studies that provided more detailed data showed some of the better-known interactions by healthcare professionals, namely, doxycycline and levofloxacin antibiotics with magnesium and iron [ [79](#B79-nutrients-15-02298)]. [68](#B68-nutrients-15-02298)]. Some patients stopped their medications when using herbs/supplements only because they felt that the medications had not improved their health [ [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298)]. In other studies, pharmacists [ [61](#B61-nutrients-15-02298), [80](#B80-nutrients-15-02298)] and healthcare professionals [ [77](#B77-nutrients-15-02298), [78](#B78-nutrients-15-02298), [79](#B79-nutrients-15-02298)] believed that interactions between herbs/supplements and conventional medicines can cause adverse reactions due to the lack of a high rate of recognition of the interactions open to their use, healthcare professionals reinforce the need for more research about the safety and effectiveness of herb/supplements, as well as more regulation of herbal practitioners, and more regulation on product quality and possible interactions [ [96](#B96-nutrients-15-02298)]. 3.4.3. Effects and Risks of Herb/Supplement Use [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298)], or showed no knowledge about such effects [ [87](#B87-nutrients-15-02298)]. In contrast, pharmacists were aware of the risks associated with taking supplements [ [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298), [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)]. As an example, pharmacists [ [89](#B89-nutrients-15-02298), [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)] and other healthcare professionals [ [77](#B77-nutrients-15-02298)] observed that gastrointestinal consequences, such as diarrhea and obstructive constipation, were the most commonly experienced side effects in CAM therapies with the general population [ [88](#B88-nutrients-15-02298)]. Pharmacists also showed awareness about the possibility of St John's wort increasing the level of digoxin (a highly carcinogenic organophosphate) in the blood, and reported that Maca root should be avoided in patients with goiter, Ginseng can increase blood pressure [ [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)], and Green tea was associated with insomnia [ [30](#B30-nutrients-15-02298), [89](#B89-nutrients-15-02298)]. The supplements classified as most dangerous by healthcare professionals were St John's wort and Ginkgo, whereas creatine and vitamin C were perceived as safer [ [77](#B77-nutrients-15-02298)]. In other studies, pharmacists have reported that Garcinia, Green tea, and Chromium are more dangerous, due to their potential risks [ [89](#B89-nutrients-15-02298)]. In one study, some consumers perceived that certain types of supplements have more serious side effects than others [ [43](#B43-nutrients-15-02298)]. In another study, healthcare professionals reported that the incorrect use of herbs/supplements can cause health risks [ [99](#B99-nutrients-15-02298)], specifically, the risk of overuse of medicinal plants and herbal medicines, and the risk of misuse according to the type of plants that can be cooked and those that cannot [ [99](#B99-nutrients-15-02298)]. Finally, about perceived risks, studies have reported that a lack, or a low level, of knowledge about herbs/supplements and about HDIs may result in inappropriate advice by the pharmacists [ [70](#B70-nutrients-15-02298), [73](#B73-nutrients-15-02298), [74](#B74-nutrients-15-02298), [80](#B80-nutrients-15-02298)]. 4. Discussion [56](#B56-nutrients-15-02298), [100](#B100-nutrients-15-02298)] and the recommendations of the guidelines for reporting systematic reviews [ [56](#B56-nutrients-15-02298)]. [44](#B44-nutrients-15-02298)] described in the introduction, the evidence in the studies prevents the exploration of how the anchoring process was developed. It is unknown which terms would be anchored to facilitate the communication of the values, ideas, and practices associated with the concepts of herb/supplements among group members, institutions, and the media. Similarly, the objectification process is also unclear because data about some visual or/and linguistic tools that have served to describe and make the belief psychologically tangible were not found in the studies. The concepts of herbs/supplements may be associated with terms such as health, medicine, and cure, but this is speculative because there was no systematic search for theoretically driven knowledge in the studies. [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)]. Other studies even worked on the specific interactions between medicines and/or antibiotics with the use of some better-known herbs/supplements to prevent the repercussions of these interactions [ [77](#B77-nutrients-15-02298), [79](#B79-nutrients-15-02298), [89](#B89-nutrients-15-02298)]. However, these studies are very specific and do not cover all the possible herbs/supplements or drug interactions that may occur and be used. Therefore, there is a gap between what is known and what remains to be known. [43](#B43-nutrients-15-02298)]. In addition to believing that these products are safe because they are natural, people also use them due to the belief that they are cheaper and easier to use than is conventional medicine. This review has shown that the rate of awareness about herbs/supplements and their interactions is very low. [7](#B7-nutrients-15-02298), [93](#B93-nutrients-15-02298)], others reported that no knowledge existed about its effects [ [65](#B65-nutrients-15-02298), [87](#B87-nutrients-15-02298)], and others showed that awareness existed about the risks associated with herb/supplement intake [ [7](#B7-nutrients-15-02298), [90](#B90-nutrients-15-02298)]. These studies identified side effects such as gastrointestinal effects (e.g., diarrhea and obstructive constipation), insomnia, and risk of bleeding, associated with the use on semantic relationships to identify possible HDIs in the biomedical literature. This involved, first, identifying the most pertinent herbal and drug entities and subsequently applying an unsupervised extraction method to cluster all potentially related pairs of entities. Essentially, this method groups entity pairs based on their relationship type, with different clusters representing distinct types of relationships. [105](#B105-nutrients-15-02298)] have developed an automated PubMed-based article retrieval system for HDIs. This system eliminates the need for users to write a PubMed query by accepting medication and herb names as input and returning only the relevant articles. [106](#B106-nutrients-15-02298)] developed an application called SUPP.AI. The application uses a pre-trained language model called RoBERTa to extract information from scientific literature on HDIs. To train the model, the researchers used data from a related task of identifying DDIs assisting them in refining the language model and identifying HDIs more accurately. As a result, the SUPP.AI application allows users to search for evidence of these interactions and aims to close the information gap on dietary supplements, providing the most recent data on HDIs for healthcare professionals, scientists, and consumers to access easily. This research provides proof that some AI techniques, which have been suggested for managing DDIs, are also potentially effective when used in the context of HDIs. [107](#B107-nutrients-15-02298)]. [108](#B108-nutrients-15-02298)] developed an expert system using a microcomputer to assess its effectiveness in predicting DDIs in hospitalized patients. The system was able to predict 27 interactions, of which 10 did occur and were the cause for hospital admissions. In this way, clinicians were able to easily adjust the offending medications once they were made aware of the interactions. In a different study, Roach et al. (1985) [ [109](#B109-nutrients-15-02298)] developed an expert system to structure and encode pharmacological information into rules and tables for systematic retrieval. This approach made the information easily accessible through natural language and a menu-driven interface. Thus, clinicians were able to use this system to understand the possible consequences of combining two drugs, why it occurs, and how harmful interactions can be alleviated. Additionally, the system provides information on related drugs that may also be involved in similar interactions. Still to answer the challenge regarding DDIs, Mahdi et al. (2018) [ [110](#B110-nutrients-15-02298)] introduced a consultation tool to aid in prescribing medications and minimize the risk of potential drug interactions. The expert system incorporates the Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm, allowing it to deduce conclusions from complex interactions and identify all possible interactions and their negative effects based on the drug input. Additionally, the system can suggest alternative medicines based on the patient's medical history and conditions. [55](#B55-nutrients-15-02298)]. In addition to the standard rule engine, the system will leverage the capabilities of ML models to enhance its performance. By using this system, pharmacists can enhance their awareness of HDIs and reduce the risk of ADRs. It is worth highlighting that the newly developed system will be entirely scalable to other interactions, such as DDIs and HDIs. This versatility has the potential to enhance the functionality of pharmacy systems. [44](#B44-nutrients-15-02298)] illustrates this argument very well. Alongside the absence of a theoretical rationale, the lack of a clear and common definition of \"beliefs\" also seems to explain the dispersion in the results, as well as in their interpretation. These theoretical and methodological limitations have implications for the validity of the evidence obtained in the study of the phenomenon. The fact that most studies had cross-sectional designs and that several used qualitative methods also limit the scope of the results, both in terms of internal and external validity, namely, compromising the possibility of generalization of those results. In this review, the lack of consensual information also exists regarding herbs/supplements. Some studies mention supplements, others mention dietary supplements, and others talk about herbal medicine. The lack of a consensual language, reflected in the use of several terms, makes it difficult for the reader, and for the potential users or sellers, to understand which substances are being documented in the literature. It is important to reinforce that healthcare professionals still have misconceptions about these products, and different opinions about their effectiveness and acceptability, which calls for the need of more scientific evidence on this topic, whether in terms of the substances' effectiveness, indications or contraindications, and interactions with other products. [44](#B44-nutrients-15-02298)]. Cultural beliefs and the uses of herbs/supplements vary from country to country, resulting in the dispersion of the results. The legislation for these types of products in each country is also related to that culture's social representations. For example, looking at the legislation of these products in various countries, a structured model is not followed across countries. Instead, countries define natural products in different ways and have different laws regulating their distribution, manufacturing, licensing, and safety concerns [ [111](#B111-nutrients-15-02298)]. This not only reflects, and contributes to the development of different representations, but also affects how these products are labeled. All these aspects limit the capacity to organize all the data coherently. Furthermore, the deliberate consideration, in this study, of the perspectives of various target groups (health professionals, pharmacists and the general population) may require a careful reading of the results to avoid misleading interpretations. 5.
