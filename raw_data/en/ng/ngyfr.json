Recruitment Criteria | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||18 Years and Over| |Gender||All| Inclusion Criteria: - - Age 18 years. - - Anaphylactic reaction at least 3 weeks old prior to allergology consultation, when administered a COVID-19 vaccine. - - Affiliation to a Social Security system. - - Signature of the informed consent. - - Stop taking antihistamines at least 3 days before skin allergy tests are performed. Exclusion Criteria: - - Other non-anaphylactic systemic reactions after administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (serum sickness, vasculitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) - Pregnancy and lactation. Trial Details | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use. The sponsor is the organization or person who oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyzing the study data. The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. Category of organization(s) involved as sponsor (and collaborator) supporting the trial. The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. Eligible patients who experience an anaphylactic reaction after the first COVID-19 vaccine injection as part of their routine vaccination will be identified through the hotline set up by our expert center. Three to five weeks after the anaphylactic reaction, the patients will be called for a consultation in the dermatology and allergology department of Tenon hospital for a complete allergological check-up. Then, in the framework of a collegial meeting ,the patient's file will be reviewed in order to specify the history of the allergic disease and the modalities of subsequent COVID-19 vaccination. A follow-up telephonique call at 6months will be made systematically for patients who have received the 2nd dose of vaccine to ensure thatthere are no significant adverse events related to the COVID-19 vaccine.
