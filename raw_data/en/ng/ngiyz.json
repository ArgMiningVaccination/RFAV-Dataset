Received: 1 revised form: 31 March 2012 / Accepted: 31 March 2012 / Published: 16 April 2012 Abstract: Historically, natural products have been used since ancient times and in folklore for the treatment of many diseases and illnesses. Classical natural product chemistry methodologies enabled a vast array of bioactiv e secondary metabolites from terrestrial and marine sources to be discovered. Many of thes e natural products have gone on to become current drug candidates. This br ief review aims to highlight hi storically significant bioactive marine and terrestrial natural products, their use in folklore and dereplication techniques to rapidly facilitate their discovery. Furthe rmore a discussion of how natural product chemistry has resulted in the identification of many drug candidates; the application of advanced hyphenated spectroscopic techniques to aid in their discovery, the future of natural product chemistry and finally adop ting metabolomic profiling and dereplication approaches for the comprehensive study of natural product extracts will be discussed. Keywords: natural , 2 304 1. Introduction 1.1. Natural Products in History Natural products (secondary metabolites) have been the most successful source of potential drug leads [1-5]. However, their recent implementation in drug discovery and development efforts have somewhat demonstrated a decline in interest [1]. Nevertheless, natural produc ts continue to provide unique structural diversity in comparison to standard combinat orial chemistry, which presents opportunities for discovering mainly novel low mol ecular weight lead co mpounds. Since less than 10% of the world's biodiversity has been evaluated for potential bi ological activity, many more useful natural lead compounds await discov ery with the challenge being how to access this natural chemical diversity [3]. The earliest records of natural products were depicted on clay tablet s in cuneiform from Mesopotamia (2600 B.C.) which documented oils from Cupressus sempervirens (Cypress) and Commiphora species (myrrh) which are still used today to treat coughs, colds and inflammation [3]. The Ebers Papyrus (2900 B.C.) is an Egyptia n pharmaceutical record, which documents over 700 plant-based drugs ranging from gargles, pills, infusions, to ointments. The Chinese Materia Medica (1100 B.C.) (Wu Shi Er Bing Fang, contains 52 prescriptions ), Shennong Herbal (~100 B.C., 365 drugs) and the Tang Herbal (659 A.D., 850 drugs) are documented records of the uses of natural products [3]. The Greek physician, Dioscorides, (100 A.D.), recorded the collection, storage and the uses of medicinal herbs, whilst th e Greek philosopher and na tural scientist, Theo phrastus (~300 B.C.) dealt with medicinal herbs. During the Dark a nd Middle Ages the monasteries in England, Ireland, France and Germany preserved this Western knowle dge whilst the Arabs preserved the Greco-Roman knowledge and expanded the uses of their own resour ces, together with Chinese and Indian herbs unfamiliar to the Greco-Roman world [3]. It was the Arabs who were the first to privately own pharmacies (8th century) with Avicenna, a Pe rsian pharmacist, physician, philosopher and poet, contributing much to the sciences of pharmacy and medicine through works such as the Canon Medicinae [3]. 1.2. Medicinal Plants in Folklore The use of natural products as medicines has been described thr oughout history in the form of traditional medicines, remedies, potions and oils with many of these bioactive natural products still being unidentified. The dominant sour ce of knowledge of natura l product uses from medicinal plants is a result of man experimenting by trial and error for hundreds of centuries through palatability trials or untimely deaths, searching for available foods fo r the treatment of diseases [6,7]. One example involves the plant genus Salvia which grows throughout the southwestern region of the United States as well as northwestern Mexico and which was used by Indian tribes of southern California as an aid in childbirth [6]. Male newborn ba bies were \"cooked\" in the hot Salvia ashes as it was believed that these babies consistently grew to be th e strongest and healthiest members of their respective tribes and are claimed to have been immune from all respiratory ailments for life [6]. The plant, Alhagi maurorum Medik (Camels thorn) secretes a sweet, gummy material from the stems and leaves during hot days [8]. This gummy sap is called \" manna \" and consists mostly of Metabolites 2012 , 2 305 melezitose, sucrose and invert sugar and it has be en documented and claimed by the Ayurvedic people that the plant aids in th e treatment of anorexia, c onstipation, dermatosis, epista xis, fever, leprosy, and obesity [8]. It was also used by the Israelis who boiled the roots and drank the extract as it stopped bloody diarrhea. The Konkani people smoked the plant for the treatment of asthma, whilst the Romans used the plant for nasal polyps [8]. The plant Ligusticum scoticum Linnaeus found in Northern Europe and Eastern North America was eaten raw first thi ng in the morning and was believed to protect a person from daily infection [9]; th e root was a cure for flatulence [ 10-12], an aphrodisiac [12] and was used as a sedative in th e Faeroe Islands [10,13]. Atropa belladonna Linnaeus (deadly nightshade) is found in central and Southern Europe, Western As ia, North Africa, North America and New Zealand. Its notoriously poisonous nature (three berries are su fficient to kill a child) firmly excluded it from the folk medicine compilation and seemed to have been accepted as da ngerous to handle or to experiment with [14]. 1.3. Medicinal Natural Products from Other Sources Used in Folklore The fungus Piptoporus betulinus , which grows on birches was steam ed to produce charcoal, valued as an antiseptic and disi nfectant [15]. Strips of P. betulinus were cut and used for staunching bleeding and were also found to make very comfortable corn pads [16]. Another example is the fungus Agaricus campestris Linnaeux ex Fries (field mu shroom) found in the northern a nd southern temperate zones and the Caribbean. A. campestris , had reportedly been stewed in milk to soothe cancer of the throat [17]. As early as the 17th-18th century, lichens had been used as dyes a nd were far more valued than oriental spices. To date there ar e no lichen derived drugs approved on the market but their applications in folklore has been well documented [18]. Lichens ha ve been used as the raw materials for perfumes and cosmetics, medicine from the time of the ear ly Chinese and Egyptian civilizations [19]. Well known examples include Usnea dillenius ex Adanson which was traditionally used for curing diseases of the scalp and is still sold in pharmacies as an ingredient in anti-dandru ff shampoos and in Ireland to treat sore eyes [19]. The lichen U. subfloridana Stirton was mixed with tobacco and butter, boiled and then cooled and appl ied as a lotion [14]. Parmelia omphalodes (Linnaeus) Acharius, which is abundant in the British Isles, was used in brown dyes. In the highlands it was traditionally sprinkled on stockings at the start of a journey to preven t inflammation of the feet [20,21] a nd in Ireland it was used as a cure for bad sores under the chin as well as for burns and cuts [14]. By comparison, the marine environment has very fe w reported applications in traditional medicine. The red algae Chondrus crispus and Mastocarpus stellatus were sources of a beverage, which was popular as a folk cure for colds, so re throats, chest infections includ ing tuberculosis. Th e alga was also boiled in milk or water and used for kidney trouble and burns [22,23]. Furtherm ore, three spoonfuls of the juice of the red alga Porphyra umbilicalis (Linnaeus) K\u00fctzing, taken every morning followed by fasting for three weeks was found to be effective agai nst cancers, in particul ar breast cancer [24]. P. umbilicalis has also been described in the Aran Isla nds for easing indigesti on. and was also boiled and given to cows to relieve th eir springtime constipation [10,25]. Metabolites 2012 , 2 306 1.4. Primary and Secondary Metabolites (Natural Products) The biosynthesis and breakdown of proteins, fats, nucleic aci ds and carbohydrates, which are essential to all living organisms, is known as prim ary metabolism with the compounds involved in the pathways known as \" primary metabolites\" [26]. The mechanism by which an organism biosynthesizes compounds called secondary metabolites' (natural products) is ofte n found to be unique to an organism or is an expression of the individu ality of a species and is referred to as \" secondary metabolism \" [26,27]. Secondary metabolites are generally no t essential for the growth, development or reproduction of an organism and ar e produced either as a result of the organism adapting to its surrounding environment or are prod uced to act as a possible defens e mechanism against predators to assist in the survival of the or ganism [26,28]. The bios ynthesis of secondary me tabolites is derived from the fundamental processes of photosynthesis, glycolysis and the Kr ebs cycle to afford biosynthetic intermediates which, ultimately, results in the formation of secondary metabolites also known as natural products [26]. It can be seen that although the number of building blocks are limited, the formation of novel secondary metabolites is infi nite. The most important building blocks employed in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites are those derived from shikimic acid, meval in countless biosynthetic pathways, involvi ng Cl aisen and Schiff base formation [26]. It is hypothesized that secondary metabolism utilizes amino acids and the acetate and shikimate pathways to produce \" shunt metabolites \" (intermediates) that have adop ted an alternate biosynthetic route, leading to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites [29]. Modifications in the biosynthetic pathways may be due to natural causes (e.g., viruse s or environmental change s) or unnatural causes (e.g., chemical or radiation) in an effort to adapt or provide longevity for the organism [29]. It is the unique biosynthesis of these natu ral products, produced by the coun tless number of terrestrial and marine organisms, which provides the characteristic chemical structures that possess an array of biological activities. 2. Historically Important Natural Products Traditional medicinal practices have formed the ba sis of most of the earl y medicines followed by subsequent clinical, pharmacological and chemical studies [5]. Probably the most famous and well known example to date woul d be the synthesis of th e anti-inflammatory agent, acetylsalicyclic acid ( 1) (aspirin) derived from the natural product, salicin ( 2) isolated from the bark of the willow tree Salix alba L. [30]. Investigation of Papaver somniferum L. (opium poppy) result ed in the isolation of several alkaloids in cluding morphine ( 3), a commercially importa nt drug, first reported in 1803 (Figure 1). It was in the 1870s that crude mo rphine derived from the plant P. somniferum , was boiled in acetic anhydride to yield diacetylmorphine (heroin) and found to be readily co nverted to codeine (painkiller). Historically, it is documented th at the Sumerians and Ancient Greeks used poppy extracts medicinally, whilst the Arabs described opium to be addictive [30]. Digitalis purpurea L. (foxglove) had been traced back to Europe in the 10 th century but it was not until th e 1700s that the active constituent digitoxin ( 4), a cardiotonic glycoside was found to enha nce cardiac conduction, thereby improving the Metabolites 2012 , 2 307 strength of cardiac cont ractibility. Digitoxin ( 4) and its analogues have long been used in the management of congestive heart failure and have po ssible long term detrimental effects and are being replaced by other medicines in the treatment of \"h eart deficiency\" [30]. The anti-malarial drug quinine (5) approved by the United States FDA in 2004, isolated from the bark of Cinchona succirubra Pav. ex Klotsch, had been used for centuries for the treatment of malaria, fever, indi gestion, mouth and throat diseases and cancer. Formal use of the bark to treat malaria was established in the mid 1800s when the British began the worldwide cultivation of the plant [30]. Pilocarpine ( 6) L-histidine-derived alkaloid, wh ich has been used as a clinical drug in the treatment of chronic open-angle glaucoma and acute angle-closur e glaucoma for over 100 years. In 1994, an oral formulation of pilocarpine ( 6) was approved by the FDA to treat dry mouth (xerostomia) which is a side effect of radiation th erapy for head and neck cancers and also used to stimulate sweat glands to measure the concentrations of sodium and chloride (Figure 1) [31]. In 1998, the oral preparation was approved for the management of Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that damages the salivary and lacrimal glands. Figure 1. Acetylsalicyclic and Pilocarpine ( 6). 2.1. Natural Products from Fungi Macro and micro fungi have been part of human life for thousands of years. They were used as food (mushrooms), in preparation of alcoholic beverages (yeasts), medication in traditional medicine and for cultural purposes. Currently with the advances in microbiology, their uses have extended to enzymes, biological control, antibiotics a nd other pharmacologically active products [32]. Metabolites 2012 , 2 308 Undoubtedly one of the most famous natural product discoveries derived from a fungus (microorganism) is that of penicillin ( 7) from the fungus, Penicillium notatum discovered by Fleming in 1929 [33]. A countercurrent extractiv e separation technique which produced 7 in high yields was required for the in vivo experimentation that ulti mately saved countless lives and won Chai n and Florey (together with Fleming) the 1945 Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine (Figure 2) [34]. This discovery led to the re-isolation and clinical studies by Chain, Florey and co-workers in the early 1940s and commercialization of synthetic penicillins, which ultimately revolutionized drug discovery research [35-38]. After publication of the first clinical data on penicillin G ( 7) between 1942-1944 there was a worldwide endeavor to discover new antibiotics from microorganisms an d bioactive natural products [39,40]. Up until 1968, old methods for detecting -lactams were still being utilized and it was concluded that all natural -lactams had been discovered [39]. Nevertheless, this was not the case as with the introduction, in the 1970s, of new sc reening methods, the production of bacterial strains supersensitive to -lactams, tests for the inhibition of -lactamases and specificity for sulphur- containing metabolites resulted in the discovery of novel antibiotic structural classes (norcardicins, carbapenems and monobactams) including the is olation of norcardicin ( 8), imipenem aztreonam ( 10), respectively (Figure 2) [39,4 1]. There are presently nine -lactams (two cephalosporins, six carbapenems and one penem) in clinical trials or undergoing drug registration, along with the novel class of broad spectrum an tibiotics called the gl ycylcyclines [41]. ( 9) and O OCO2HH HOHHNOH OCO2H H2N N O COOHHO N O SO3H7 9108 OOH NHCH3 NNSH2N O HO O Macro fungi such as polypores are a large group of wood-rotting fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota (basidomycetes) and Ascomycota, which are a major source of pharmacologically active substances. There are about 25,000 species of basidiomycet es, of which about 500 are members of the Aphyllophorales [42]. Approximately 75% of tested polypore fungi have shown strong antimicrobial activities and may constitute a viable source for the development of novel antibiotics. Many compounds have displayed antiviral, cytotoxic, an tineoplastic, cardiovascular, anti-inflammatory, immune-stimulating and anticance r activities [42,43]. Fungi are more commonly microorganisms, some of which can spend at least pa rt of their life cycle inside plan t tissues without ca using any visible Metabolites 2012 , 2 309 sign of infection or disease [44,45]. They have b een found to inhabit trees, grasses, algae and herbaceous plants and live in the intercellular spaces of plant stems, petioles, roots and leaves without affecting the host organism [46] . Collectively these fungi are know n as endophytes. Novel bioactive secondary metabolites derived from fungal sources ha ve yielded some of the most important natural products for the pharmaceutical industry [3]. In 1953, Edmund Kornfeld first isolated vancomycin ( 11) a glycopeptide antibiotic produced in cultures of Amycolatopsis orientalis which is active against a wide range of gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococci and Streptococci and against gram-negative bact eria, mycobacteria and fungi and was approved by the FDA in 1958 (F igure 3). It is used for the tr eatment of severe infection and against susceptible organisms in patients hypersensitive to penicillin ( 7) [5]. The macrolide erythromycin ( 12) from antibacterial which contains a 14-membered macrocycle composed entirely of propionate units (Figure 3). Erythromycin ( 12) has broad spectrum activities against gram-positive cocci and bacilli and is used for mild to moderate, upper and lower respiratory tract infections [5,26]. Currently there are three semisynthetic which are in c linical development [1]. Figure 3. Vancomycin ( 11) and Erythromycin ( 12). Single cell viruses represent the smallest existi ng life forms causing cold, influenza, ebola and SARS. Presently, there seems to be a limited number of antiviral natural pr oducts or synthetically derived analogues fungi [47]. Betulinic acid ( 13), triterpenoid obtai ned from the bark of Betula pubescens was originally identified as a weak inhibitor of HIV replication [48,49]. Betulinic acid can inhibit topoisomerase I and is being evaluated in Phase I tria ls as a cancer chemo-preventive agent (Figure 4) [50]. Bevirimat (PA-457) ( 14), extracted a Chinese herb Syzygium claviflorum is in Phase IIb clinical trials and is believed to inhibit the final step of the HIV Gag protein processing [51]. Ganoderic acid (15), isolated from the frui ting bodies and spores of Ganoderma lucidum , displayed significant anti-HIV-1 prot ease activity with an IC 50 value of 20 \u00b5M (Figure 4) [52]. Metabolites 2012 , 2 13), Bevirimat (PA-457) ( 14) and Ganoderic acid (15). In 2002, hydrochloride ( 16), related to the anthracycline, doxorubicin ( peucetius . Doxorubicin ( 17) is used to treat acute leukaemia, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, lung cancer, thyroid cancer and both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas (Figure 5) [5,26]. Torreyanic acid ( 18) was isolated from an endophyte from the endangered tree, Torreya taxifolia [53] and was tested in several cancer cell lines and found to display 5-10 times greater potentenc y/cytotoxicity in cell lines that are sensitive to protein kinase C causing cell death by apopto sis (Figure 5) [54]. Figure 5. Amrubicin hydrochloride ( 16), Doxorubicin ( 17) and Torreyanic acid ( 18). 2.2. Natural Products from Plants Plants have been well documented for their medicinal uses for thousands of years. They have evolved and adapted over millions of years to withsta nd bacteria, insects, fungi and weather to produce unique, structurally diverse sec ondary metabolites. Their ethnopharmaco logical properties have been used as a primary source of medicines for early dr ug discovery [55,56]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 80% of people st ill rely on plant-based traditi onal medicines for primary health care [57] and 80% of 122 plant derived drugs were related to their orig inal ethnopharmacological purpose [58]. The knowledge associated with tradit ional medicine (complem entary or alternative herbal products) has promoted further investigations of medicinal plants as pot ential medicines and has led to the isolation of many natural products that have b ecome well known pha rmaceuticals. The most widely used breast cancer drug is paclitax el (Taxol\u00ae) ( 19), isolated from the bark of Taxus brevifolia (Pacific Yew). In 1962 the United States Department of Agricu lture (USDA) first collected the bark as part of their exploratory plant screening program at the National Cancer Institute Metabolites 2012 , 2 311 (NCI) (Figure 6) [59]. The bark from about three ma ture 100 year old trees is required to provide 1 gram of 19 given that a course of treatment may n eed 2 grams of the drug. Current demand for 19 is in the region of 100-200 kg per annum ( i.e., 50,000 treatments/year) and is now produced synthetically [26]. The first of several FDA approvals for various uses for Taxol\u00ae was announced in 1992 [60]. Taxol\u00ae (19) is present in limited quantit ies from natural sources, its synthesis (though challenging and expensive) has been achi eved [61]. Baccatin III ( 20) present in much highe r quantities and readily available from the needles of T. brevifolia and associated derivatives is an example of a structural analogue that can be efficiently transformed into 19 (Figure 6) [26]. Figure 6. Paclitaxel (Taxol\u00ae) ( 19) and baccatin III ( 20). Other examples of antitumor compounds curren tly in clinical tria ls include ingenol a derivative of the polyhyd ingenol isolated from the sap of Euphorbia peplus (known as \" petty spurge \" in England or \" radium weed \" in Australia) which is a potential chemotherapeutic agent for skin cancer is currently under clinical develo pment by Peplin Biotech for the topical treatme nt of certain skin cancers (Figure 7) [62,63]. PG490-88 ( 22) (14-succinyl triptolide sodium salt) trip tolide is a diterpene-diepoxide isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii which is used for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in the People's Republic of China [64,65]. Combretastatin A-4 phosphate ( 23) a stilbene the South African Bush Willow, Combretum caffrum acts as an anti-angiogenic agent causing vascular shutdowns in tumors (necrosis) and is currently in Phase II clinical trials (Figure 7) [66,67]. Figure 7. ingenol 3- O-angelate 21OOOO OPO 3 23OOO OO HO OOO Na 22 The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic in the 1980s forced the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and other or ganizations to explore natural produ cts as sources of potential drug Metabolites 2012 , 2 312 candidates for the treatment of AIDS. Over 60,000 extract s of plants and marine organisms were tested against lymphoblastic cells in fected with HIV-1. The most important result of these tests is the class of compounds known as the calanolides. In par ticular the isolation of calanolide A ( 24) and calanolide B (25) from the Calonphyllum species, along with prostratin ( 26) from Homalanthus nutans , have now progressed into clinical and preclinical de velopment (Figure 8) [68-70]. Calanolide A ( 24) was licensed and evaluated to Phase II clinical trials by Sarawak Medichem Pharmaceuticals, however there has been no subsequent announcement for further drug development. In 2010, Phase I human clinical trials of prostratin ( 26) were carried out by the AIDS ReSearch Alliance in Los Angeles, California (Figure 8). Figure 8. Calanolide A ( 24), Calanolide B ( 25) and Prostratin 26). Arteether ( 27), introduced in 2000, as Artemotil is derived from artemisinin ( 28) (introduced in 1987 as Artemisin) which was fi rst isolated from the plant Artemisia annua and are both approved antimalarial drugs (Figure 9) [47]. The plant was originally used in traditional Chinese medicine as a remedy for chills and fevers. Othe r derivatives of artemisinin ( 28) are in various stages of clinical development as antimalarial drugs in Europe [3,26]. To date, a synthetic trioxolane modeled on the 28 pharmacophore, is being assessed in combination with piperaquine (a synthetic bisquinoline antimalarial drug) in an effort to treat malaria (F igure 9) [71]. Figure 9. Arteether ( 27) and 28). Grandisines A and B ( 30) are two indole alkaloids which were isolated from the leaves of the Australian rainforest tree, Elaeocarpus grandis (Figure 10). Grandisine A ( 29) contains a unique tetracyclic skeleton, while Grandisine B ( 30) possesses an unusual comb ination of isoquinuclidinone and indolizidine ring systems. Both 29 and 30 exhibit binding affinity for the human -opioid receptor Metabolites 2012 , 2 313 and are potential leads for analgesic ag ents [72]. Galantamine hydrobromide ( 31) from the plant Galanthus nivalis and has been used traditionally in Turkey and Bulgaria for neurological conditions and is used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease [73,74]. Apomorphine ( 32) is a derivative of morphine ( 31) isolated from the poppy ( P. somniferum ) and is a short-acting dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonist, as well as a pot ent dopamine agonist , used to treat Parkinson's disease (Figure 10) [75]. \"Curare\" is the arrow poison of the South American Indians and is prepared in the rain forests of the Amazon and Orinoco. Tubocaurarine ( 33) isolated from the climbing plant, Chondrodendron tomentosum (Menispermaceae) is one of th e active constituents used as a muscle relaxant in surgical operations, re ducing the need for deep anesthesia. The limited availability of tubocurarine ( 33) has led to the developm ent of a series of synthetic analogues which are now preferred over the natural product (Figure 10) [26]. Figure 10. Grandisine A ( 32) and tubocaurarine ( 33). 2.3. Natural Products from the Marine Environment Though plants have proven to be a novel source for bioactive natural products the marine environment has a clear track record in also offering novel structural entities. \" We are not marine organisms \", says Fenical, \" so until about 1970, no one even thought of the ocean. It was left as a deep secret. It seemed ridiculous to me that the ocean \u2014 with such a vast habitat \u2014 had escaped anyone's notice. But there are good reasons. People fear the ocean; it has be en considered a very hostile, inhospitable place \" [76]. Given that 70% of planet earth's surface is covered by ocean, pharmaceutical companies began to realize that the ocean would possess unique biodiversity and may be a possible source for potential drug candidates [77]. Exploration of the marine environment and orga nisms (algae, sponges, ascidians, tunicates and bryozoans) became possible due to modern snorkeli ng, the introduction of SCUBA (1970s), to the use of manned submersibles (1980s) and more recently the use of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) (1990s). These progressive advancements in the past 40 years of expl oration of the marine environment have resulted in the isolation of thousa nds of structurally unique bioactive marine natural products. To date, the global marine pharmaceutical pipeline consists of three Food and Drug Metabolites 2012 , 2 314 Administration (FDA) approved drugs, one EU regi stered drug, 13 natural products (or derivatives thereof) in different phases of the clinical pipe line and a large number of marine chemicals in the pre-clinical pipeline [78] . Some examples include, Ziconotide (P rialt\u00ae, Elan Corporation) a peptide first discovered in a tropical cone snail, which was a pproved in December 2004 for the treatment of pain. Plitidepsin ( 34) (Aplidin\u00ae, PharmaMa), a albicans [79,80]. Plitidepsin ( 34) is effective in treating various cancers, including melanoma, small cell and non-small cell lung, bla dder as well as non-Hodgki n lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is currently in Phase II clinical trials (Figure 11) [78,81]. Ecteinascidin 743 (ET743; Yondelis) ( 35) was isolated in lo w yields from the ascidian Ecteinascidia turbinata [82,83]. The quantities of ET743 ( 35) required for advanced pre-cl inical and clinical studies was achieved by adopting very large-scale aquaculture of E. turbinata in open ponds, however the semisynthesis of ET743 ( 35) has been well esta blished (Figure 11) [81,84,85]. In October 2007, Trabectedin ( (also known as Ecteinascidin 743 or ET-743) (Yondelis, PharmaMar) became the first marine anticancer drug to be approved in the European Union [78]. Trabectedin ( 35) has been approved by the European Agency for the Eval uation of Medicinal Pr oducts (EMEA) and is completing key Phase III studies in th e US for approval [78]. Spisulosine ( 36), isolated from the marine clam Spisula polynyma , exhibited substantial selective activ ity against tumor cells compared to normal cells [86]. It advanced to Phase I clinical trials against solid tumors but was withdrawn in late 2006 [87-89]. Cryptophycin ( 37) was selected for clinical trials in the mid 1990s then advanced to phase II trials but was terminated in 2002 due to t oxicity and lack of efficacy (Figure 11) [90]. Figure 11. ( Metabolites 2012 , 2 315 2.4. Natural Products from Marine Algae Algae (macroalgae, seaweed) are represented by at least 30,000 species worldwide supplying oxygen to the biosphere, food for fish and man, medicine and fertilizers as well as being a prolific source of structurally unique na tural products [91]. The terpen oids are a class of compounds predominantly isolated from marine algae in th e 1970-1980s. Chemical investig ations into terpenoid- type structures have led to the isolation of many classes includi ng brominated, nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles, acids, amines and guanidine derivatives [92]. With respect to biological activity, green, brown and re d algae have been intensively assessed for their antibacterial and antifungal activities [93]. Polycavernoside-A ( 38) isolated from the red alga Polycaverosa tsudai was suspected to be the toxic glycoside responsible for seafood poisoning, when, in 1991 thirteen people became ill and three died in Japan (Figure 12) [94-96]. The brown alga, ( 42) which antitumor activities [9 7,98]. Another example is crenuladial ( 43), from the brown alga Dilophus OHOAc Metabolites 2012 , 2 316 Red algae, in particular the genus Laurencia (Rhodophyta), are unsurpassed as a source of halogenated sesquiterpenes. Chemical investigations into the genus Laurencia for secondary metabolites have been active since the 1970s. Th e most commonly occurring secondary metabolites are the halogenated sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Furthermor e, this genus is unique in producing C 15-acetogenins, for example those constituents which possess a terminal enyne such as 44 [100]. Other examples include the class of compounds known as th e chamigrenes, which are halogenated terpenes possessing unique structures such as 45 and 46 (Figure 13). There have been many cham igrenes, which have been isolated to date from the genus Laurencia , which grows in many very diffe rent geographical areas [101-104]. Figure 13. Compound ( 44), ( agricu lture in the last half cent ury has been as a result of advances in pest control due to synthetic chemical pesticides (SCPs) [105]. However, the search for new pesticides has been necessary due to the significant rise in the resistan ce to current control agents . It has been documented that between 1984 to 1990 resistance to synthetic chemi cal pesticides by insects and mites increased by 13% [106,107]. As a result, a significant amount of res earch has focused on the isolation of insecticidal leads from marine algae. This has led to the is olation of over 40 active c onstituents [107]. Some examples of natural insecticid es include the isolation of 1 -(2-E-chlorovinyl)-2 ,4,5-trichloro- 1,5-dimethylcyclohexane the Chilean red alga Plocamium Metabolites 2012 , 2 317 cartilagineum (Figure 13). These compounds show insecticid al activity against th e Aster leafhopper, Macrosteles from the red alga L. nipponica Yamada. These have all shown to display potent insecticidal activity against the mosquito larva, C. pipiens (Figure 13) [110]. 2.5. Natural Products from Marine Sponges Sponges (Porifera) are sessile organisms, which l ack a nervous, digestive and circulatory system and maintain a constant water flow through their bodies to obtain food, oxygen and to remove wastes. All sponges are 'current' or 'filter' feeders and have few physical mean s of defense against predators. They are considered to be the first multicellular anim als and have changed very little in approximately 500 million years. The first notable discovery of biologically active compounds from marine sources can be traced back to the reports of Bergmann on the isolation and identification of C-nucleosides, spongouridine ( 51) and spongothymidine ( 52) from the Caribbean sponge, Cryptotheca crypta in the early 1950s (Figure 14) [111]. These compounds we re found to possess antiviral activity and the synthesis of structural analogues le d to the development of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) as a clinical anticancer agent, together with (Ara-A) as an antiviral agent 15 years later [111]. This was an important discovery since previously it was belie ved that for a nucleoside to possess biological activity, it had to have a deoxyribose or ribose sugar moiety. These investigations led to the identification of (Ara-C) as a potent antileukemic agent [112]. HO OO OHHOHO 2.6. Natural Products from other Marine Sources The class of synthetic derivatives known as the bryologs, such as 53, are derived from bryostatin 1 ( 54), an antineoplastic compound Bulgula neritina [5,113]. Bryostatin 1 ( 54) has been isolated in sufficient quantities to permit more than 80 clinical trials to date, with 20 being completed at both phase I and phase II levels (Figure 15) [78]. It has displayed positive responses acting as a single agent with effects ranging from complete to partial remission [28]. From 2007 to date there were four Phase I and eight Phase II clinical trials, all combination studies with biologicals or cytotoxins against multiple carcinomas. Currently, 54 is in two Phase I clinical trials and is being assessed as an anti-Alzheimer's drug (Phase I trial approved) [78]. Halichondrin B ( 55) has been isolated from several sponges including, Halichondria okadai (Japan) [114]; Axinella sp. from the Western Pacific [115], Phakellia carteri from the Eastern Indian Ocean [116] and from Metabolites 2012 , 2 318 Lissodendoryx sp., off the East Coast of the South Island of New Zealand (Figure 15) [117]. Halichondrin B ( 55) has been successfully synthesized [118] along with several structural analogues including Halichondrin E-7389 ( 56) which has been selected for further development and is currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of breast carcinoma (Figure 15) [113].

Drug Discovery: Natural Product Chemistry versus Combinatorial Chemistry After the 'Golden Age of Antibiotics' and the worldwide incentive to discover new antibiotics many major pharmaceutical industries at the time initiate d natural product discovery (NPD) programs which focused not only on antibacterial an d antifungal targets but also on inf ectious diseases. These programs provided lead compounds for the treatment of cancer, microbial in fections, hypercholesteremia and tissue rejection in organ transplantations [119,120] . However, many of the larger pharmaceutical companies decommissioned their NPD programs duri ng the 1990s and early 2000s. It was the advent of automated high throughput screening (HTS) whic h increased the momentum of biological testing and combinatorial chemistry began to be promoted as a better approach to creating \" drug-like \" compounds for HTS. As a result, many of the pha rmaceutical companies disbanded or sold their collections of screening extracts [121,122] as it was believed that traditional extract-based screening resulted in the continu ous re-discovery of previously isolat ed compounds and that the structural complexity of natural products required total synthe sis and derivatization whic h is both economically and synthetically problematic. Beca use of supply problems, the time required to develop a natural product from an extract hit to a pharmaceutical was deemed to be too long; HTS technologies rely on combinatorial chemistry to generate large compound libraries. In th e past two decades \" classical natural product chemistry \" has largely been replaced by molecu lar target based drug discovery, utilizing large combinatorial libraries to obtain efficient \" hits\" [120]. Nevertheless advances in technology and sensitive instrument ation for the rapid identifica tion of novel bioactive natural products and structur e elucidation continues to improve the natural produc t discovery process [119]. From the 1980s onwards it was thought that combinatorial chemistry would be the future source of numerous novel carbon skeletons an d drug leads or new chemical enti ties (NCEs). This has clearly not been the case as there has only been one co mbinatorial NCE approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in that time peri od, the kinase inhibitor sorafendib ( 57) (approved by the FDA, 2005) for renal carcinoma (Figure 16) [123]. Figure 16. Sorafendib ( 57). 57Cl F FFN HO NHOO NH Combinatorial chemistry has indeed revolutionized the development of novel active chemical leads resulting in the synthesis of struct ural analogues [123]. At the time, co mbinatorial libraries consisted of hundreds to thousands of new compounds, but during th e late 1990s synthetic chemists realized that these libraries lacked the complexity of the intricate natural pr oducts synthesized by nature [123]. The concept of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) wa s adopted in which synthetic chemists would synthesize compounds that resembled natural products (mimics) or that are based on natural product topologies. These compounds are current ly being tested in a large nu mber and variety of biological Metabolites 2012 , 2 320 screens in order to determine their role (s) as leads to novel drug ent ities [123]. Inspection of the rate of NCEs approvals demonstrates that natural products still contribute to or are i nvolved in ~50% of all small molecule testing between the years 2000 -2006 [47]. Though the pharmaceutical industry has expended a considerable amount of resources to both HTS and combinat orial chemistry [47] overall of the 1184 NCEs diseases/countries /sources between the ye ars 1981-2006, 30% were found to be synthetic. It is also worth noting that 52% (t otal) of these compounds are either a natural product, a mimic or a chemical modification of an existing natural product pharmacophore [47]. 3.1. Dereplication A drug discovery program endeavors to search fo r (a) novel bioactive natural product(s), which possess(es) some form of potent biological activ ity. Nevertheless, the isolation of known and undesirable natural products with no chemical or pharmacological intere st is inevitable. The process of identifying known compounds responsib le for the activity of an extract prior to bioassay-guided isolation is referred to as derepl ication [28,29]. At present there are many advanced methodologies and protocols that distinguish novel en tities from known natural compounds at an early stage of a drug discovery program or in a natural product isolation st rategy [29]. It is important to realize that the isolation of novel natural products was far more frequent during the 1970s and is steadily declining, although natural sources (e.g., plants, fungi, marine and microbial sources) ar e still regarded as inexhaustible sources for novel chemicals. As such, the time, effort and cost to find new chemical entities must be considered as their discove ry has become far more infrequent [124]. Furthermore, even the selection of new types of or ganisms (terrestrial and/or marine) tends to lead to the rediscovery of previously re ported natural products as they are often present in more than one phylum or genera [125]. It has been estimated that it takes $US 50,000 and thr ee months of work to isolate and identify an active compound from a na tural product source [ 126]. Therefore, it is exceedingly important to recognize previously known compounds early on, not only for saving time and money, but to allocate resources to more prof itable extracts. It is ev ident that natural product programs require more patience and perseverance for the identifi cation of adequate l ead compounds than programs strictly based on synthetic chemicals. This is also dependent on availability of bioassay- guided fractionation, in-house screening, accessibility to higher field NMR and mass spectrometers, all of which are necessary to efficiently run such a program. Lead compounds arising from natural product discovery programs are structurally unique due to their co-evolution with target sites in biological systems. However, the speed at which lead compounds can be generated and progressively advanced is slower than correspond ing synthetic drug discovery approa ches [119]. With the advent of new hyphenated spectroscopy technologies such as HPLC-MS, HPLC-NMR and HPLC-NMR-MS, further means of rapid compound identificati on and dereplication ar e now possible [119,127]. 3.2. Dereplication Methods Dereplication strategies generally involve a combination of bioassay, separation science, spectroscopic methods, and database searching and can be regarded as chemical or biological screening processes. There are a number of ways in which na tural product programs approach Metabolites 2012 , 2 321 dereplication, which is based upon availability of screening methods/instrumentation, time and the cost to identify possible \" biological leads or novel compounds \" from a crude extract. 3.3. Database Searching There are many commercially available databases, wh ich can assist in the de replication process and will often reduce the time taken for structure eluc idation of known compounds . The Chapman and Hall Dictionary of Natural Products [128] ; The Dictionary of Marine Natu ral Products (on-lin e) (subset of the Dictionary of Natural Pr oducts) containing over 30,000 compounds [129]; MarinLit- The Marine Natural Products Database containing up to date bibliographic data on marine organisms with the number of references from 1,200 journals/books and data for ~21,000 compounds [130]; AntiMarin is a more recent database, in which the number of methyl groups, the number of sp3-hybridised protons, alkene, can be searched [131,132]. SciFinder Scholar and SCOPUS is a research discovery tool (Che mical Abstracts on-line) [133,134] and NAPRALERTTM is a database of all natural produ cts, including ethnomedical information, pharmacological/biochemical informa tion of extracts of organisms in vitro , in situ , in vivo , in humans (case reports, non-clinical trials) an d clinical studies [135]. Access to scientific databases such as the ones mentioned, is a fundamental and crucial step in a well-governed natural product program. Thorough and extensive literature searches are neces sary when the following questions need to be addressed: Have there been any previous lite rature reports on the target orga nism (terrestrial or marine?) Is there potential to isolate novel compounds (geographical or s easonal variations?) What kind of compound classes has been isolated from the species and if not from the species, then the genus or family? Is there incomplete or poor NM R spectroscopic data for previ ously uncharacterized natural products? Are there any new biological activities for known compounds that have been overlooked? It is fundamentally important to address these questions early as one of the most common issues that occurs is the time consumi ng process of isolating, purifying a nd determining the structure of a suspected novel compound and real izing that it has already been reported in th e literature. 3.4. Hyphenated Instrumentation \"Classical versus Hyphenated (on-line) Approaches\" Natural product extracts often c ontain a large number of constituents including those, which are challenging to separate. The comb ination of classical techniques such as Ultraviolet absorption Spectroscopy (UV), Infra-red spectroscopy (IR), Mass spectrometry (MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) of ten permits the unambiguous structure determination of pure compounds. In cases where the absolute configur ation cannot be determined, synthesis or single-crystal X-ray analysis is utilized. As classical separation techniques are tedious and time consuming, the direct hyphenation of an efficien t separation technique with powerful spectroscopic techniques can assist in the dereplication process [136]. Such hyphenated systems (though not in widespread use) include HPLC-FTIR, which is usef ul for the detection of functional groups in major Metabolites 2012 , 2 322 constituents of mixtures. HPLC -FTIR has been used by their designers but has not found wide application due to limitations in compatibility; that is, obtaining opt imal separation together with sufficient detection [136]. FIA-NMR involves a sample, which is injected as a plug into a fluid stream, which is then swept into the NMR detector coil. FIA-NMR uses the mob ile phase as a hydraulic-push solvent to carry the injected sample from the injector port to the NMR flow cell. After the pump stops, the spectrometer acquires the scout scan to determine the location of solvent peaks and then acquires the solvent suppressed spectrum. After completi on, a signal is sent to the solven t pump to flush the old sample from the NMR flow-cell [136]. HPLC-NMR-MS is an advanced spectrometric hyphenated technique which is used in the dereplication of natural product extr acts (typically plant extracts) [137] . Apart from its efficiency, the most important advantage of HPLC-NMR-MS is the unequivocal matching of the MS data to the NMR spectrum. Furthermore, as HPLC-NMR does not pr ovide information about silent functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl and amino moieties) as a result of D 2O exchange, these functionalities can be readily detected by MS techniques. Chemical and biological investigat ion for the search of novel bioact ive natural products involves the extraction, isolation, purificati on and structure elucidation (cla ssical natural product isolation methodologies), which can be challenging and/or tim e consuming. The extraction is normally the first step for both marine and terrestrial organisms. Th e choice of the extraction solvent followed by solvent partitioning or by trituration can result in many problem s including the formation of artifacts. Further, homogenization and lyophili zation with organic solvents can affect the nature and relative amounts of extracted secondary metabolites present. The applic ation of HPLC-NMR to the crude extracts (NMR and UV profile from PDA HPLC detection) was found to be a powerful spectroscopic tool which had advanced in the last decade, in particular with th e advent of higher field ma gnets and cryo-probes. In recent years the advances in microcoil HPLC-N MR and capillary NMR (CapNMR) has allowed for smaller quantities of samples to be analyzed in th e order of 40-120 \u00b5L, this in combination with higher field magnets has greatly increased the sensitiv ity in profiling and dereplication natural product extracts [138-140]. Microcoil HPLC-N MR is generally suited for on- line HPLC-NMR typically where components present in higher concentr ations in an extract are separate d and analyzed in a conventional HPLC-NMR system using either on-flow, st op-flow or time slicing experiments [103,141-143]. Capillary NMR allows for the use of non-deuterat ed solvents in the off-line HPLC separation providing a broader range of solvents to be used a nd low costs. Isolated compounds are redissolved in deuterated solvents and injected into the CapNMR flow probe using volumes of approximately 6 \u00b5L with 1H-NMR spectra obtained for sample quantities in the order of 2-30 \u00b5g, thereby providing a substantial increase in sensitivity with the potential of identifying novel low level secondary metabolites [144]. Apart from providing a \"high-fidelity\" snapshot of the constituents in the extract, the information acquired from both 1D and 2D NMR spectra may be sufficient to id entify compound classes, therefore providing information which will a llow rational decisions about the best method of fractionation or whether to further pursue the isolation. A number of recent publications have b een reported in utilizing this approach [103,104,141,142]. The technique and use of HPLC-NMR in natural products identification/characterization is well documented in th e literature but applica tions of its uses have Metabolites 2012 , 2 323 predominately dealt only with the chemical profiling of plants [145-147]. Various modes of HPLC-NMR (predominantly on-flow and stop-flow modes) combine the resolving power of chromatography, which is interfaced with th e structural insight provided by NMR. 4. Combining Natural Product Chemistry and Metabolomics Approaches in Drug Discovery Systems biology is an emerging field encompassing tools in the post-genomi cs revolution such as transcriptomics, proteomics, glycomics and fluxomics with the ambition to char acterize all gene and cell products including mRNA, proteins, glycan struct ures and metabolites in the most comprehensive manner. The objectives of metabolomics are to construct unbiased obs ervations with highly reproducible analytical tools followe d by data analysis to locate correlations betw een all available data. In the emerging field of metabolomics a single an alytical technique capab le of profiling all low molecular weight metabolites of a given organism does not exist. This emerging field combines analytical chemistry, biochemistry and sophisticated informatics allowing the analysis of thousands of small molecules (metabolites) in any biologica l system. Mass spectrometry magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy ar e the leading analytical platforms . Both primary and secondary metabolites in tissues and biofluids ar e extracted utilizing unbiased crude extraction procedures aiming to efficiently extract all or most metabolites in their natural form prior to analysis in the solvents used. Since metabolite extracts are ex tremely complex, given the huge chemical diversity of metabolites they represent, there is no one single analytical platform and methodology, which is capable of analyzing all metabolites simultaneousl y. Multiple separation chemistries have to be employed to achieve the greatest compre hensiveness in th e analysis [148]. Due to the improvement in sens itivity, resolution and advances in instrumentation hundreds of compounds can be simultaneously anal yzed with subsequent refined informatics tools developed to extract information from the resulting data, filtering algorithms to remove background noise, detection and integration of peaks throughout large data sets and normalizatio n and transformation of resulting data matrices prior to any statis tical analysis can now be achieved [149]. The greatest bottleneck in metabolomics is the ability to identi fy the detected signals with respec t to their chemical nature. Even now, about 60 to 80 % of all detected comp ounds are unknown [149,150] and the metabolomic community has implemented many di fferent initiatives to tackle the problem by creating large mass spectral or NMR spectral libraries. Many of these unknown structures ( i.e., secondary metabolites) detected may be undiscovered natural product resources. Fingerprinting, footprinting, profili ng or target analyses are common terms used in this field. Fingerprinting aims to take a \" snapshot \" of the organism where the sign als cannot necessarily be used to detect/identify specific metabolites and depends strongly on the technique used. Metabolite profiling techniques require that signals can be assigned to a specific metabolite whether it is of a known or novel nature. The term target analysis aims to determin e and quantify a specific metabolite of interest [151]. There are few reports in the scientific literature, which discuss the unison of classical natural product chemistry approaches with metabolomics to identify novel bioactive natural products. These have generally focused on the study of plants [151]. The identifica tion of bioactive natural products from plants remains a multifaceted task because of their high chemical diversity and complexity. By Metabolites 2012 , 2 324 measuring the metabolome of different extracts or fractions of a plan t and combining these data with its corresponding biological activit y, signals related to the compounds related to the di splayed activity can potentially be determined. In one example, myxoprincomide ( 58), a novel NRPS/PKS natural product from Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 was identified by combining methods of targeted mutagenesis, liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass sp ectrometry (LC-HRMS), and a statistical data evaluation (Figure 17). Mutant an d wildtype strains were grown in small-scale fermentation in quadruplicate, replicate extracts were analyzed by LCHRMS, and data were pretreated by using a compound finding algorithm, resulting in the defin ition of >1,000 molecular features per sample. Molecular features specifically mi ssing in culture extracts from DK1622 mutant strains were identified using PCA to the preproce ssed LC-MS datasets [152]. Figure 17. Myxoprincomide ( 58). Five medicinal Panax herbs (ginseng species) were subjected to a metabolomic analysis using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupol e Time Of Flight Spectrometry (UPLC- QTOFMS) and multivariate statistical analysis techni ques. PCA of the analytical data explained that the five Panax herbs could be separated into five diffe rent groups of phytochemicals [153]. 62) which accounted for the variance which was identified through the loadings plot of the PCA, and tentatively by the accurate mass of TOFMS (Fi gure 18) [153]. The results and methodology demonstrated this method to be reliable for the rapid analysis of a group of metabolites present in natural pr oducts extracts [153]. In the case of NMR of crude extrac ts, patterns can be visualized a nd interpreted which is generally combined with multivariate data analysis. This can be carried out in a comparative manner distinguishing differences between relatively similar extracts or it can be linked with a specific (generally in vitro ) biological activity. Ultimately this enable s the construction of a complex database of the metabolome [154-156]. An NMR based metabolomics approach has recently been utilized in the study of Galphimia glauca , a Mexican plant which has been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of central nervous disorder s [157]. Six collections from the Mexican area demonstrated sedative and anxiolytic activities, with only two collections of G. glauca showing significant activity. 1H-NMR metabolomic profiling was conducted on all six ex tracts and was analyzed by partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS -DA) using previous information on their bioactivities [157]. The PLS-DA loadings plot demonstrated a signal strongly correlated with sedative a nd anxiolytic activities was found to be galphimine ( 63) (Figure 19). A targeted HPLC metabolomic approach was also Metabolites 2012 , 2 325 conducted which provided evidence that the two colle ctions possessing strong sedative and anxiolytic activities contained high amounts of galphimine while both other (le ss active) samples did not [157]. Figure 18. Ginsenoside 19. Galphimine ( 63). Zhi and co-workers analyzed the e ffect of different antibiotics w ith different modes of action on various microbes [158]. The results conclude d that dihydrocucurbita cin F-25-O-acetate ( 64), a major constituent of the Chinese plant Hemsleya pengxianensis , showed antimicrobial activity [158]. The metabolome of a Staphylococcus aureus culture treated with a plant extract, 64 and several known Metabolites 2012 , 2 326 antibiotics were compared. PCA analysis revealed that 64 was the component responsible for the main antimicrobial activity on S. aureus in H. pengxianensis through its ability to inhibit cell wall synthesis, as in the case of vancom ycin (Figure 20) [158]. 64). NMR based metabolomics has many applications in plant science and can be used in functional genomics to differentiate plants from different or igin, or after different treatments [159]. Kim and co-workers describe the advantag e of a NMR metabolomic analysis and the possibility of identifying metabolites by comparing NMR data with references or by structure elucida tion using 2D-NMR [159]. Deyrupa and co-workers also demonstrated the us e of 2D-NMR spectroscopy to screen a library of biorationally selected insect metabolite samples for partial structures. This investigation enabled the detection of novel compounds in comp lex metabolite mixtures without prior fractionation or isolation. This led to the discovery and isolation of two families of tricyclic pyrones in Delphastus catalinae , a tiny ladybird beetle that is empl oyed commercially as a biological pest control agent [160]. The D. catalinae pyrones represent ring systems not previously found in nature [160] . 5. Conclusions In summary, we propose that a combination of metabolomics technologies with natural product discovery processes will be beneficial on multiple levels. Firstly, by increasing the number of identifications in our metabolomics data we may provide novel structures to be tested for bioactivity for any disease under investigation. Multi-parallel analysis using meta bolomics technologies will also enhance and increase throughput of chemical character ization processes of many different species from natural resources. Secondly, as mentioned above, natu ral product chemists have collected a lifetime of compound libraries of active and also inactive pure compounds which can now be analyzed to construct mass spectral and NMR spectral libraries a nd therefore improve biologi cal interpretations of metabolomics data. The advancements in analytical instrumentation and s ophisticated hyphenation of separation techniques with high se nsitive detectors have allowed for greater detection of small molecule compounds measurable in biological systems ( i.e., primary and secondary metabolites) and undoubtedly will now be used to advance the discovery of natural product chemistry to identify potential novel drugs candidates which will assist in sustaining health and the fi ght against disease and illness.
