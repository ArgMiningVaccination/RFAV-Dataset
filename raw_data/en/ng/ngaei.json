Chronic pain is commonlythought to be caused by a variety of factors, includingphysical, sociocultural, and psychological decits [2]. It is awidespread health problem that has negative consequencesfor both patients and society, including diminished pro-ductivity, lower quality of life, and a higher cost to thehealthcare system. Multidisciplinary pain programs appearto be the best therapeutic choice for patients with compli- catedchronicpain[3]. wQ_hereis,therefore,aneedfor awell- designed interdisciplinary pain pain, osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis(RA),headache,neckpain,bromyalgia,andirritablebowelsyndrome. wQ_he literature review in this article was done using the advanced search engine in the PubMed database and used acombination of English keywords, i.e., \"chronic pain,\"\"yoga,\"and\"inflammation.\"Painmanagementisoneofthemost challenging tasks for medical practitioners. For betterpain management, several pain-relieving medications areavailable like are usually recommendedby physicians for the treatment of moderate to severe pain[4, 5]. All these pain-relieving medications provide pain reliefbutforashortdurationwithaccompanyingsideeects the case of opioids [6, 7]. wQ_heHindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume Article ID 5448671, 15 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5448671persistence of pain aects the quality of life of an individual simultaneously generating stress and mood disorders. Tillnow, no such pain-relieving measures are available whichcan alleviate the pain completely and provide relief withoutany side eects. wQ_hese lead to the attention towards tradi-tional therapies such as yoga and meditation which can minimize biological stress and correspondingly improve immunity and can also counter the psychological andemotional suering caused due to pain. Pain is an unpleasant experience which carries both sensoryandemotionalaspectsthatarelinkedwithpotentialor actual tissue damage. Pain arises due to tissue injury andrepetitive noxious stimuli which leads to unpleasant sen-sation. wQ_his sensation is processed by complex and inte-grative signaling mechanisms from the periphery to thecentral nervous system (CNS) where inputs are ultimatelyintegrated and then a reflex response is generated [8]. wQ_his mechanism includes ascending pathway and descending pain pathway. wQ_his neural pathway consists of three relaystations. At the periphery, the free nerve endings are callednociceptors which belong to unmyelinated C-bers, re-sponsiblefordullpain,andmyelinatedA berswhichcarry a slow conductionvelocity of 2 m/second and the diameter of nerves is less than 2m. However, A bers are the smallest myelinated nerves and have a fast conduction velocity of 3m/sec. wQ_hediameter of the nerves is m [9]. wQ_hese are pri- mary aerent bers bodies are located in thedorsal root ganglion. wQ_hese nerve endings have specic receptors for dierent stimuli such as Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) P2X receptorsfor purinergic ion channels for hydrogen ions, or polymodalreceptorsthatcanbeactivatedviadierenttypesofstimulus[11]. When tissue damage occurs due to a noxious stimulus, it leads to the production of inflammatory mediators suchas prostaglandins which sensitize the nociceptors toaccepting the stimulus or directly activate them. Further-more, other molecules like histamine, bradykinin, nerve growth factor, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins (ILs), ATP, hydrogen ions, and potassium are released byinltrating inflammatory cells which directly activate thenociceptors [12]. Activation of nociceptors causes theopeningofvoltage-gatedionchannelsaccompaniedbytheinflux of ions such as sodium and calcium into the cyto-plasm to generate an action potential. wQ_hese signals aretransmitted to the primary sensory neurons of the dorsalroot ganglion (DRG) followed by transmission to sec-ondary sensory neurons located in the dorsal horn of thespinal cord (Rexed lamina I, II, and V) [8]. wQ_he bers of spinalneuronsdecussateandascendtoformasynapsewith the tertiary sensory neuron located in the ventropostero-lateralnucleusofthethalamus.Finally,thetertiaryneuronbers send signals to the somatosensory cortex where painsignals are perceived. During their course of amygdala, and input from the spinaldorsal horn. wQ_hen, PAG integrates the magnus andnucleus reticularis gigantocellularis) according to which the processing of nociceptive signals is regulated by the spinal dorsal horn neurons [8, 13]. wQ_he neurotransmitters serotonin are involved in regulating the fa-cilitatory and inhibitory mechanism of the pain pathway. 2.Modulation of Pain Signal Transmission via Gate Control Theory wQ_he theory was reported by Melzack and Wall in 1965. wQ_heconcept suggests that inhibition or decrease in transmissionofpainsensationcanbepossiblethroughactivationofnon-painfulsensation[14].wQ_heprocessinvolvesperipheralpain-carryingbers(A which communicatewithinhibitoryinterneuronsoflaminaeIIandalso make synapses with primary aerent bers of pain and second neurons. So, the non-painful input carrying bers activate the inhibitory interneuron, leading to the release ofgamma-aminobutyricacid(GABA),resultinginpresynapticinhibition of noxious stimulus. Based on gate control theory, some stimuli are used to generate non-noxious signals for closing the gate for painsignals such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS), massage, heatand cold therapy,and movements ofjoints [14-16]. wQ_he gate control theory mainly suggests thathow pain signals are perceived by the brain through thebody's nervous system can be inhibited or decreased and enhanced by psychological factors [17]. So, it is suggested that mind-body practice like yoga can inhibit pain signalsand it has the potential to change the way an individualexperiences pain. Paincanbeclassiedbasedonduration,siteoforigin,or location. Following are few types of pains which can beencountered upon various external and internal noxiousstimuli. 2.1. Acute and Chronic Pain. When pain lasts for hours to days or for short period then it is considered acute pain. Acute pain mainly acts as a warning signal for the body towardstheharmfulstimuli.Itisspecic,sharp,andusually comes suddenly. Acutepaindisappearswhenthecauseofpaingoesaway (postoperative pain, fracture of bones, cuts, and wounds).However,chronicpainlastsformorethansixmonthsanditpersists even after the healing and removal of the cause ofpain (arthritis, bromyalgia, cancer, and neuropathic pain)[18]. Chronic pain also produces emotional stress, anxiety,anddepressionwhichadverselyaectthequalityoflifeofanindividual [19].2 as nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic. 2.2. Nociceptive Pain. Nociceptive pain occurs due to in- ternal tissue damage when expose to noxious stimuli like extreme heat, cold, or trauma. wQ_he nerve endings which areactivated by such stimuli are nociceptors which are locatedin the skin, bone, muscles, joint capsules, and other tissues.wQ_hey sense chemical, mechanical, and thermal sensations. wQ_he nociceptors are A myelinated bers, activated by thermal or mechanical stimuli. However, unmyelinated C-bers are activated not only by thermal and mechanicalbut also by chemical stimuli [8]. 2.3. Neuropathic Pain. Neuropathic pain is dened as the occurrence of pain due to a lesion or disease of somato- sensory nerves. It mainly arises from the pathology of thenervoustissueduetoinjury,diseasessuchasdiabetes,nervecompression, and autoimmune diseases. wQ_his causes in-flammation within the nerve tissue that could lead to bothperipheral and central sensitization. Peripheral neuropathyshowed alteration in electrical properties of sensory nerves,resulting in impairment of excitatory and inhibitory sig- naling [18]. In turn, sensory signals transmission and dis- inhibition mechanism are altered at the spinal level whichcould move to the state of hyper excitability. With time thissequence of changes from the periphery to the CNS con-tributestoneuropathicpainbecomingchronic.Alterationinthe ion channels, within the aected nerves for exampleupregulation of sodium channels lead to increased excit-ability, signal transduction, and increased release of neu-rotransmitters at the spinal cord terminus of the primaryaerent bers 21]. Enhanced activation of neu-ronsexpandstheeldofmanymodalities(lowthresholdA wQ_his causes the increase in excitation of second-order neurons in the spinal cord which generates centralsensitization.wQ_heincreaseinsignalsfurtherincreasesthe excitatory release of state hypersen-sitivity [18]. Moreover, the non-neuronal cells such as as-trocytes and microglia also contribute either directly orindirectly to the development of hypersensitization [22]. 2.4. Inflammatory Pain. Pain caused by activation of nociceptors via the release of inflammatory mediators by damagedcellsisknownasinflammatorypain.Inflammation occursasanaturalbiologicalresponseproducedbythebodytissues as a reaction to noxious stimuli to remove the ne-crotic cells and initiate the tissue repairing process. Duringinflammation,neutrophilsmovethroughthebloodstreamtothe injured site followed by the release of chemical medi-ators. Other responses like the release of platelet-activatingfactor (PAF) by mast cells followed by the release of sero-tonin (5-HT), and macrophages augment the inflammatoryresponse protons, and ions. Together, itproduces cardinal inflammatory signs such as redness,swelling, hotness, and inflammation at the site due to in-creased blood flow. wQ_hese mediators like bradykinin,prostaglandins, and 5-HTcan directly activate their recep-torsandG-proteinreceptorspresentattheperipheralnerve ending[8].wQ_hisisaccompaniedbyactivationofacascadeof signaling mechanisms such as protein kinase A and Csignalingpathwaywhichfurtherrecruitsmorereceptorsandenhanced the sensitivity of primary aerent bers resultingin peripheral sensitization [24]. As a result, non-noxiousstimulilikelighttouchproducepainsensation(allodynia)ornormal painful stimuli produce intense pain sensation(hyperalgesia) [25]. Even inflammatory pain can be categorized into two types:acuteandchronic.Asarstrespondenttotheharmfulstimuli, accumulation of leukocytes and plasma cells at the site of injury takes place to assist the inflammatory process. wQ_his stimulates the activation of primary aerent berswhich are normally mediated by A bers, resulting in the generation of intense pain which lasts for a short durationcalled acute inflammatory pain. However, in chronic in-flammatory pain, prolonged inflammation is accompaniedby the persistence of pain which lasts beyond the healingperiod. wQ_he nociceptive signals are typically mediated byC-bers and they occur due to the recruitment of mono-nuclearcellsattheinflammatorysiteaswell[8].Someothermediators are also released from the necrotic tissue duringtheinflammatoryprocesslike5-HT,kinins,histamine,nerve growth factors (NGF), ATP, glutamate, leukotrienes, nitric oxide (NO), NE, and protons which also contribute to in-activation of nociceptors within the inflamed area [26].Further,thisincreasestheaerents'inputinthedorsalhornof the spinal cord and leads to the development of centralsensitization resulting in persistent pain. 2.5. Biomolecules Involved in Induction, Transmission, and Modulation of Pain Signaling. Glutamate is the main neu- rotransmitter involved in the shaping of transmission of pain signaling. It is also involved in the generation andmaintenance of central sensitization [27, and ATP are alsoreleased by primary sensory neurons which act as a trans-mitterandneuromodulatorsandtheyaredistributedbothatthespinalcordandperipheralnerveendings.Stimulationofprimary sensory bers releases these transmitters to bind toneurokinin-1, NMDA, and AMPA, CGRP receptors on thepostsynaptic site in the dorsal horn and also bind to the receptorspresentonthemicrogliaandastrocytes.Microglia releasepro-inflammatorymediatorswhichactinaparacrinemannerandenhancedthepaininputatthedorsalhornlevelinthespinalcord.wQ_heinflammatorymediatorslikeTNF,IL-1, and IL-6 play important role in the induction andmaintenance of pain signals. Activation of chemokines re-ceptors, present on the peripheral nociceptors, lowers thethreshold of DRG neurons and leads to the state of hy-persensitivity.Transientreceptorpotentialvanilloid1(TRP)or capsaicin-sensitive receptors are well known in the painEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3signaling mechanism [29]. TRPV1 is widely distributed in sensory nerve bers and partiallyin nerve bers CNS. It activates by chemical and noxious heat stimuli the pe-ripheral and CNS [30-32]. Activation of TRPV1 increasesthe Ca ion influx and release of pain facilitatory neuro- transmitters and neuropeptides into the dorsal horn of thespinal cord [33-35]. TRPV1 also play a role in the acti-vation of spinal glial cells and contributes to the inductionand maintenance of pain [36]. Multiple phosphorylationsites are present on TRPV1 through which various (PKA), hyperalgesia or sensitiza-tionofprimaryaerentstomechanicalandthermalstimuli[37]. Besides these, oxidative stress plays role in the in- ductionandmaintenanceofneuropathicandinflammatory pain [38-40]. Reactive oxygen species contribute to neu-ropathic pain by triggering the phosphorylation ofCAMKII signaling [39]. Pain and inflammation are closely related and inte- grated, not merely via acute peripheral sensitization at thejointbutalsoderivedfromthemodulationintheprocessingof pain signals at the central level. RA is an inflammatoryjointdiseasethatoccurswithaprevalenceraterangingfrom0.3-4.2%,basedonthestudiedpopulation[41,42].RApainmainly occurs in small joints such as joints of the hand andfoot, wrist, ankle, knee, and hip joints. For the management of pain symptoms, a variety of treatment options have been explored to help patientsmanage their symptoms of pain, including pharmaco-logical approaches, physical therapy, exercise, surgery,psychological therapy, and complementary and alterna-tive therapies. Pain medications, such as opioids, arefrequently given. wQ_he use of opioids in the treatment ofchronic non-malignant pain is a contentious topic be-causeoftheadverseeects,short-termecacy,andsafetyof pain medications, as well as the danger of abuse andaddiction [43]. Various adverse eects of opioids have been listed in Table 1 [44]. Patients with chronic non- malignant pain face a complicated interaction of bio-logical, psychological, and social variables, thus therapymust take all of these elements into account [45]. Psy-chological factors play a signicant role in decidingwhetherornotapatientwithchronicnon-malignantpainwill respond therapy [46]. 3.Role of Tryptophan Metabolites Formed via Kynurenine Pathway in Pain Tryptophan is an amino acid that metabolizes to formvariousactivebiologicalmoleculessuchasserotonin,NAD +, andmelatonin.wQ_hemetabolismofTRPinvolvesmainlytworoutes: the serotonin pathway which includes 5% TRPmetabolism and 95% is taken place by the KP pathwayresulting in the formation of kynurenines. Kynurenine isinvolved in the regulation of several biological processessuch as host-microbiome signaling, the excitability ofneurons, and the response of the immune cells [47]. In theKP pathway, TRP converts also called kynurenines: 3-hydroxykynurenine HK), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and then the end product of its lateral branch. Glutamate bindstoAMPAandNMDAreceptorswhichregulatepain transmission and cognitive function.

In vitro studies suggested that astrocytesare mainly involved in the synthesis of neuroprotectiveKYNA, and activation of microglia/macrophages duringvarious neuroimmunological diseases [49, 50]. wQ_he link between the development of neuropathic pain and the activity ofKynurenine pathway enzymes was explored in dierentneuropathic pain models. Several studies reported theupregulationofKPenzymes(IDO1/2,KMO,andKYNU)in the CNS tissues in various neuropathic pain models[51, 52] (Figure 1). Moreover, inhibition of IDO 2 andKMO enzymes resulted in alleviation of mechanical,tactile, or thermal hypersensitivity in neuropathic painmodels [53]. RA is the most common inflammatory arthritis. wQ_he role of yoga as an eective adjunct intervention has beendocumentedintheliteraturetoassistinthemanagementof chronic diseases like RA concerning its clinicalsymptoms like pain perception, stress management,disability outcomes, sleep quality, functional ability,QOL, and psychosocial outcomes has amultifactorial etiology, heteroge-neous clinical phenotypes this disease comprises apsychosomatic component, hence an integrative ap-proachofyogamightimproveclinicaloutcomesinRAbybringing changes in all interconnected biological com- ponents and at various levels-molecular, cellular, organ systems, andtheperson asa whole.RAservesas amodelfor chronic inflammatory pain. With this context inmind, this article contains RA as an inflammatory modeland the aim is to investigate the eects of yoga and itsmechanism of action and analyze their association withthe clinical health outcomes including disease activity,functional status, depression severity, and quality of life.4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine3.1. Mechanism of Pain in RA. RA is associated with in- flammation of the synovial that correlates with the severity of pain in joints. RA pain arises as a result of the combinedinteraction of joint pathogenesis and modulation in theneuronal and is release of pro-inflammatory mediators by local im-munecells.wQ_hiscausesdirectactivationandsensitizationofsensory-free nerve endings called subchondral bone,and [57, 58]. Even during the late phase, theosteochondral junction is disrupted by subchondral erosionand exposes the nerve ending which approaches the de-generative part resulting in an enhancement ofinflammatory response. wQ_hese free nerve endings are theperipheralprocessofprimarysensoryneuronslocatedinthedorsal root ganglion and carry pain signals to secondarysensory neurons located in the spinal cord [8, 58]. Directstimulationinducespainandsensitization;asaconsequencenormal pain can be felt due to non-noxious stimuli (allo- dynia) such as pressure, weight-bearing, and movement [57]. wQ_he following illustration shows the central and pe-ripheral mechanisms of pain and the various componentsinvolved in the process (Figure 2). 3.2. Mechanism of Peripheral Sensitization in RA. Peripheral sensitization leads to the genesis of chronic pain.It constitutes a decrease in the threshold of nociceptors andan increase in their response towards pathway.Table1: Adverse eects of opioids [44]. S.No. Organ system Adverse eects 1 Respiratory system Respiratory depression, obstructive and central sleep apnea, ataxic breathing, respiratory arrest, and death 2Central nervous systemIncreased risk of falls, cognitive impairment, myoclonus, sleep disorders 3Cardiovascular systemOrthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, vasodilation, and events, e.g., myocardial infarction 4Gastrointestinal systemConstipation, nausea and vomiting, gastric reflux, delayed gastric emptying, abdominal cramping, and distension 5 Immune systemDecreasedwoundhealing,pruritus,alteredcytokineproduction,increasedhistaminerelease,inhibitionof macrophage, neutrophil, and natural killer cell activity and recruitment, increased HIV replication, and cancer progression 6 Endocrine systemOpioid-induced endocrinopathy (usually only with high opioid doses, long-term), resulting in decreased libido, testicular atrophy, early menopause, and sexual dysfunctionEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5occurs because of post-translational changes in and alter- ation in the tracking of ion channels and transducer re-ceptors. wQ_his is initiated by the activation of nociceptors bylocal inflammatory mediators at the inflammation site,resulting pain hypersensitivity [60, 61]. wQ_his isknown as primary hyperalgesia. Medications that bind to opioid receptors are increasingly being prescribed for the treatment of multiple and diverse chronic painful condi-tions. wQ_heir use for acute pain or terminal pain is well ac-cepted. wQ_heir role in the long-term treatment of chronicnon-cancer pain is, however, controversial for many rea-sons. One of the primary reasons is the well-known phe-nomenonofpsychologicaladdictionthatcanoccurwiththeuse of these medications. Abuse and diversion of thesemedicationsisagrowingproblemastheavailabilityofthesemedicationsincreasesandthispublichealthissueconfoundstheir clinical utility. Also, the extent of their ecacy in the treatment of pain when utilized on a chronic basis has not been denitively proven. Lastly, the role of opioids in thetreatment of chronic pain is also influenced by the fact thatthese potent analgesics are associated with a signicantnumber of side eects and complications. It is these phe-nomena that are the focus of this review. Common side eects of opioid administration include sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, physicaldependence, tolerance, and respiratory depression. Physicaldependence and addiction are clinical concerns that mayprevent proper prescribing and in turn inadequate painmanagement.Lesscommonsideeectsmayincludedelayedgastric emptying, muscle rigidity, and myoclonus. wQ_he mostcommonsideeectsofopioidusageareconstipation(whichhasaveryhighincidence)andnausea.wQ_hesesideeectscan be dicult to manage and frequent tolerance to them does notdevelop;thisisespeciallytrueforconstipation.wQ_heymaybe severe enough to require opioid discontinuation andcontribute to under-dosing and inadequate analgesia. Sev-eralclinicaltrialsareunderwaytoidentifyadjuncttherapiesthat may mitigate these side eects. Switching opioids and/or routes of administration may also provide benets forpatients. Proper patient screening, education, and pre-emptive treatment of potential side eects may aid inmaximizing eectiveness while reducing the severity of sideeectsandadverseevents.Opioidscanbeconsideredbroad- spectrumanalgesicagents,aectingawidenumberoforgan systems and influencing a large number of body functions[44]. wQ_he signaling molecules are involved sensitization such that activate unmyelinated sensorynerves [58]. Furthermore, NGF- and cytokines such as IL- 1, IL-6, and TNF- also increased which can sensitize the peripheral sensory nerves in synovium and subchondralbone of RA patients [60, bers phosphorylation cascade inthe neuronal cell. Synovitis is also associated with alterationin the expression of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators,and their receptors at nociceptive neurons located in theDRG and dorsal horn of the spinal cord [60]. 3.3. Mechanism of Central Sensitization in RA. Central sensitization is responsible for a variety of chronic pain diseases including RA [64, 65]. Central sensitization is theenhanced response of nociceptive neurons the CNS to-wardstheirnormalandsubthresholdaerentinputs.wQ_hisisknown as secondary hyperalgesia. Stimulation of noci-ceptors results in the generation of action potential leadingto the release of excitatory neurotransmitters at the spinallevel. At the spinal level, central sensitization occurs in thedorsalhornwhichrelievesinputsfromanenlargedreceptive eld leading to pain hypersensitivity. wQ_his occurs in two steps: in the acute stage, primary aerent bers releasedglutamate which binds to their receptors on postsynapticneurons and the chronic stage includes activation of spinalmicrogliaandthetranscriptionofpainregulatorymolecules[27]. Glutamate is the key transmitter that activates bothNMDA and non-NMDA receptors on spinal cord neurons[63]. wQ_his leads to the release of various inflammatorymediators and in turn, initiates the central hypersensitivityor central sensitization [57, 66-68]. diagram showing pain mechanism in (modied from Cao et al., [59]).6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicineaccompanied by upregulation of SP, CGRP, and their re- ceptors in the spinal cord [27, 57]. Stimulation of primarysensory bers releases these transmitters to to neu-rokinin-1, NMDA, AMPA, and CGRP receptors and astrocytes Microgliareleasepro-inflammatorymediatorswhichactina me-diators like TNF, IL-1, and IL6 play important role in theinduction and maintenance of pain signals [12]. Microgliaalso secrete other pro-inflammatory molecules like nitricoxideandsuperoxideanionwhichactinapositivefeedbackmanner and lead hyperalgesia [57]. On the genetranscription. Pain signals from sensory neurons of thedorsal horn in the spinal cord transmit to the sensoryneurons of the ventroposterolateral region of the thalamus.wQ_hen to the somatosensory cortex where nally pain signalsare perceived in the brain. In response, the pain regulatorymechanism of the CNS activates the descending painpathway. wQ_hese pathways transmit signals from the brainthrough the brainstem to the spinal cord. In the brainstem,aerent signals are received by periaqueductal grey (PAG) from the frontal cortex, amygdalae, and hypothalamus re- lated to stress and mood which influence the perception ofpain. wQ_he signals are integrated by PAG ventromedial medulla pathways RVM cantransmit or inhibit the pain [42]. Even RA pain is alsomanifested due to non-inflammatory factors like sleepdisturbances, anxiety, and depression which aect theperception of pain [71]. RAhasbecomeoneofthemajorpublichealthproblems and around 1% of the world population is aected [72]. Among these, it is more common in women than men. wQ_he condition of RA is manifested by pain, swelling, stiness,loss of joint function, and increased acute-phase reactantlevels [73]. Management provides pain relief butnever cures it completely so it is necessary to search foreective therapy which includes better pain managementwith fewer or no side eects. Individuals suering fromchronic pain may benet from mindfulness training as a therapy option [75, 76]. wQ_he deliberate and nonjudgmental consciousawarenessofthecurrentmomentischaracterizedas mindfulness. Psychological factors have been proven tohaveasignicantinfluenceonhowpatientsfeelandtoleratepain, yet they are frequently overlooked when chronic non-malignant pain treatment strategies are adopted. Chronicpain is associated with dysregulation of emotional andcognitive functions leading to anxiety, depression, alteredattention, fear, etc. [2]. wQ_hese alterations are also linked tothephenomenaof\"paincatastrophizing,\"whichisdescribedastherepeatednegativethoughtsthatoccurduringorbeforepain[77].Anxiety,depression,drugusedisorders,andsleepproblems are just a few of the variables that can make thepain worse. Hence, management of these comorbidities becomes essential to control the overall patient's pain state. A multi-disciplinary treatment approach model which in-corporates both pharmacological and non-pharmacologicalinterventions is more eective in managing chronic painthan single treatment modalities [78]. A systematic reviewreported that there was evidence of better eectiveness ofmulti-disciplinary treatment groups compared to the singletreatmentgroupinthemanagementofmusculoskeletalpain[78]. wQ_here is a wide range of social, psychological, non-pharmacological, and non-opioid pharmacological treat-ment options available for patients with chronic non-ma- lignant pain. It may be essential to test several therapies combinations to discover the optimal treatment option foreach patient [43]. wQ_here are various non-pharmacologicaltreatment options in the management of chronic pain likephysical therapy, yoga, tai-chi, massage, acupuncture, andcognitive behavioral therapy. 3.4. Yoga in the Management of Chronic Pain. As chronic painismultidimensionalandaectsanindividual'sdierent organ systems, hence an integrated mind body medicine approach like yoga is highly benecial. Pain is divided intove categories based on its neu-ropathy, sustainedpain, nociceptive, and cognitive-aective pain. Every oc-currence of pain is evaluated from many perspectives, i.e.,sensory,emotional,behavioral,andcognitive[19].wQ_hebrainis built to anticipate the worst and tends to take caution byeliciting a strong pain response quickly. For the sake ofeciency, the brain creates streamlined neuropathwaysbased on previous experience for coping with comparable dangersandusesthemforeachepisodeofpain.wQ_hephysical body, physiology, mental appraisal, emotional reaction, andgeneral attitude towards life must all be considered whilemanagingchronicpain[79].Yogaisacollectionofphysical,mental, and spiritual disciplines that originated in ancientIndia and are aimed at controlling the mind as well asrecognizing the detached consciousness. wQ_he ve koshas(Panchamaya model) consist of ve main layers of oursystems: physical structure, physiological processes, thecontent of minds, ideas, and attitudes towards our sur-roundings, and our sense of connection to other people, society, and the Universe [80, 81]. Each of those layers includes tools established by the yoga tradition to promotebalance and healing (Figure 3). Yoga is a profound science-basedhealthdisciplineandcanbeusedasacomplementary,integrative, and adjunct medical therapy that impacts thebody,andmindasawholeandresultsinpromotingphysicalandmentalhealthandimprovingqualityoflife[82].Yogaisa technique associated with mind-body relaxation and actsasacushiontothechangingcellularimmunityrelatedtothestress.Yogamainlyfocusesonregulatedbreathingpractices,Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7mind, and body which includes mild to moderate postural exercises (asana), breathing exercise (pranayama), andmeditation such as IL-6 andTNF-from their basal level in healthy yoga practitioners [83]. Chronic elevation in these markers leads dysregulated immune response and sets stage for autoimmune progres- sion of inflammatory diseases like RA. Yoga decreases systemic and local inflammation in RA bynormalizingcirculationlevels(IL-6,IL-17A,andTNF-)and mRNA transcript levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines(IL-6, TNF-) [84]. Yoga also improves autonomic reflexregulation systems and restores the balance between sym-pathetic and parasympathetic limbs in inflammatory situ-ations [85]. Yoga practice also reduces the level of oxidativestress and improves the anti-oxidant levels [86]. wQ_herefore,one of the possible mechanisms by which yoga could be reducingRApainisbydecreasingthelevelofinflammatory mediators. wQ_his leads to peripheral reduction of inflam-matory mediators levels which results in the decrease ofstimulation of nociceptors so the transduction and trans-missionofpainsignalsarereducedfromtheperipherytothespinalcord.wQ_hereisadecreaseinthelevelofoxidativestressat the spinal and brain level due to less activation of spinalneuronsandnon-neuronalcells.Together,overallitreducesthe level of pain hypersensitivity throughout the painpathwayfromtheperipherytothecentrallevel.Inaddition,the pain pathway is also regulated by GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. In chronic pain, the level of GABA is reducedinthebrainanditisalsoinvolvedinthegatecontrolmechanism of pain signals. wQ_his includes the GABAergicinterneuron that controls the transmission of signals.Practicing yoga on regular basis also increases the level ofGABA which could facilitate the inhibitory action on thetransmission of pain signaling. Yoga is now being used more often to alleviate painful ailments and enhance emotional resilience and enhancethreshold to pain. Studies are being conducted to look atprobableneuroanatomicalchangesasaresultofyogapractice.A study conducted on North-American yogis analyzed theanatomical alterations in the grey and white matter of thebrain which indicated that yogis had more left intrainsularwhite matter integrity than controls, and they were able toendure more pain than the control group due to their parasympathetic activation and enhanced awareness [87]. Yoga, as an integrated health technique, has both psycho-logicalandphysicalcomponents,makingitappropriateasanadjunct management approach for severe, debilitating au-toimmune arthritis such as RA [85, 88, 89]. Yoga has asubstantial impact on RA because it helps to reduce articularand extra-articular symptoms while also improving systemicindicators of inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellularhealth [84]. Yoga works through psycho-neuro-immuno-logical systems to attain life's homeostatic equilibrium [90].Yoga enhanced the quality of life in active RA patients by lowering pain perception, disability quotient, disease activity, and severity of comorbid depression [84, 85, 90-92]. Pranayama is a voluntary breathing regulation that is commonly practiced in conjunction with yoga asanas andmeditation. wQ_he three phases control, which hasadditionalfavorableeectsonthebody'sorgansystems.wQ_heparasympathetic nervous system is activated when pra-nayama breathing is done with the extended breath reten- tion [93]. wQ_he mode of action of yoga is vagal stimulation, which improves baroreflex sensitivity and lowers inflam-matory Yoga is a profound science-based mind body practice thatmaybeutilizedasadjuncttomedicaltherapythataectsthe whole body and mind, boosting physical and mental Physical sheath ANNAMAYA KOSHA Vital Air Sheath PRANAMAYA illustration by Maya Chastain).8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinehealth and enhancing the quality of life. It is a low-cost mind-body intervention that, unlike medicines, has no side eects and has a benecial influence on the entire body, allowingforlongerperiodsofremissionwithfewerrelapses.Yoga has a benecial influence on the genome and epige-nome, resulting in molecular remission and immunologicaltolerance [85, 95-97]. Various studies from our lab showedthat 8 weeks of yoga intervention signicantly reduceddisease activity, altered methylation patterns, improvedmitochondrial integrity and biogenesiss and thus sloweddown the rate of functional decline associated with aging,normalized the systemic biomarkers of inflammation, oxi-dative stress, immune-senescence, aging, and promoted neuroplasticity [90, 91, 98, 99]. wQ_his is due to the impact on thegenomeand epigenome,leadingtothenormalizationofgene expression and epigenetic marks. wQ_here was an im-provement in various systemic, molecular, epigenetic, andgenetic markers associated with RA pathogenesis. Also,there was a favourable clinical outcome of RA with a re-duction in disease activity, disability index, pain acuity,depressionseverity,andimprovementinqualityoflife[90]. 3.5. Impact of Yoga on Inflammatory Cytokine Prole. Yoga decreases systemic and local inflammation in RA bynormalizing circulation levels (IL-6, IL-17A, Yoga also improves autonomic reflexregulation systems and restores the balance between sym-pathetic and parasympathetic limbs in inflammatory situ-ations[85].Variousstudieshaveseenamarkedreductioninthelevelsofinflammatorymarkersafteryogainterventioninvarious conditions (Table 2). 3.6. IL-6. wQ_heIL-6gene on chromosome 7 encodes a pleiotropiccytokinethatplaysacrucialroleintheetiologyof RA and has a signicant positive association with diseaseactivity and joint damage [108]. It has pro-inflammatoryeects by attaching transmembrane activatinggp130, atransmembraneprotein,which pathway stimulates numerous signaling, resulting in CD4 prolif- eration,dierentiation,andactivation[109].Inthepresenceoftransforminggrowthfactor(TGF)-,IL-6enhanceswQ_h17cell over Treg cell populations. By activating B cells,IL-6isapowerfulstimulatoroftheHPAaxis,causingacutephase responses and the generation of autoantibodies [111]. In inflammatory conditions, the HPA axis is by inflammatory cytokines. Stressors/pro-inflam-matory thecorticotrophin-releasing stimulates theadrenal gland to generate and release cortisol by acting onthe anterior pituitary and inducing the production ofadrenocorticotropic hormone. Cortisol counteracts thestressor and reduces the prevailing inflammation [112].However, the HPA axis becomes hypersensitive as a resultof persistent inflammatory stimulation and negative Neurotransmitter level alteration Cytokine level alterationHormone level alterationParasympathetic activation Decreases inflammation Hormonal homeostasis MindfulnessYOGA Physical, Mental & Emotional health wellbeingCHRONIC STRESS Activation of Hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis Production of Cortisol Altered immune response Altered cytokine productionInflammationChronic pain / chronic disease progressionFigure4: Yoga in reducing chronic stress and its consequences. Table2: Reduction of various inflammatory markers in dierent disease conditions. Condition Inflammatory markers References and anterior pituitary begins. wQ_his condition leads to adrenalinsuciency. Yoga reduces stress and inflammation byinhibiting the hypersensitive HPA axis and regulatingcortisol levels [100]. 3.7. TNF-. TNF-is one of the most important pro-in- flammatorycytokinesinthepathogenesisofRA[113].TNF- functions increasing vasodilatation adhesion expression of adhesion molecules and contributing tooxidative stress in sites of inflammation [114]. In the TNFsignaling pathway, TNF cytokines interact activate MAPK and NF-B pathways resultinginthereleaseofleukocyteinflammatoryfactors.wQ_hereleasedinflammatory factors further activate the membrane re-ceptorsleadingtoaviciouscircleofinflammatoryresponses.ItisreportedthatstimulatingtheNF-B andTNFsignalingpathways could promote cell inflammation in RA [115].Recent studies from our lab showed that yoga aids in the regressionofinflammatoryprocessesbythereductioninthe levels of TNF- and IL-6 cytokines homeostasis and producesperipheraltolerancethroughitsregulatoryactivities.TGF-enhancesthedierentiationofinducedTregcellsusingIL-2and retinoic and preserves the survival of naturallyexisting Treg cells. Treg cells monitor abnormal immuneresponses and are thought to be protective against anoveractive immune system and the onset of autoimmunity[116]. A study from our lab showed that yoga holds theimmune-regulatorypotentialandreducestheseverityofRAbyelevating TGF-transcriptlevelsandcirculating levelsof TGF-hence developing immunological tolerance. 3.9.IL-17A. IL-17A is for articular symptoms as it induces inflammation in synovial tissue. As ROS damagethe mitochondrial DNA, this might be a compensatorystrategy to ensure appropriate ATP levels. Simultaneously,there is a reduction in OS and overexpression of genes thatpreserve mitochondrial integrity, (wQ_h17) increased pro-duction of interleukin IL-17, indicating that mitochondrialchanges play a signicant role in the wQ_h17 cell eectorphenotype. wQ_he immune system equilibrium between Tregs and eector wQ_h17 cells is disrupted. [117]. Dysfunction of Tregs fails to maintain peripheral tolerance and inautoimmunity IL-10, cytokines byeector wQ_h17 cells and a loss of Treg suppressor areboth linked to immunological dysregulation in RA [117]. Inan unpublished study from our lab, the mean proportion ofwQ_h17 cells (CD3 +CD4+IL17+RORt+Tcells) in the yoga group decreased signicantly from baseline to the eighth week, butthemeanpercentageofTregcells(CD3 +CD4+CD25+CD127- Foxp3+Tcells) increased signicantly in the yoga group. wQ_he mean percentage of aged wQ_h17 cells(CD3 +CD4+IL17+RORct+CD28Tcells), as well aged Treg non-yoga group. wQ_here was an upregulation of solubleHLA-G levels in RA patients followed by yoga intervention.HLA-G, a non-classical HLA class I molecule, has anti-in-flammatoryandimmune-modulatoryeects.Itisanexcellentreference parameter for autoimmune and inflammatorydisease prevention, diagnosis, and therapy since higher levelsare linked to less severe illness and fewer relapses in RApatients. 3.10. Impact of Yoga on Endogenous Neurotransmitters. Encephalin and endorphins are endog- enous opioids that are generated largely in the brain andhave various eects throughout the body [120]. Opioidantagonists can limit the activity of encephalin and en-dorphins, which act on opioid receptors. Increased neurotrophic (BDNF), dehydroepian-drosterone and -endorphins suggest a signicant improvement in mind-body communication indicators following yoga practice. Yoga raises the levels of BDNF, a key neuroplasticity biomarker, neurotropin [121, Multipleneurotransmitters in the brain are altered by regular yogapractice. In a study, yoga practice for one hour boostedGABA levels in the brain [123]. BDNF has neuroprotectiveand [122, 124]. Yoga promotesmind-body communication, which controls neuroplasticityand decreases the stress cascade by increasing BDNF,DHEAS, and -endorphins. DHEAS is dysregulated anti-in- flammatory DHEAS levels substantial increase in DHEAS levels after yoga,indicating that yoga can help with emotional control,neurocircuits,cognition, emotionalresilience, andmemory.Upregulated DHEAS levels following a yoga practice havealso been shown to lower depression severity in individualswith major depressive disorder and situations of comorbiddepression, such as in RA patients [98]. Anotherstudyfoundthatdoingyogaforonehourevery day for three months reduces adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) wQ_his neuro-hormone func-tions as a neuro-regulator and its levels in the blood tend torisewithintenseandlong-lastingphysicalexercise[128].Asa result, yoga has the ability to increase -endorphin levels and generate a good sensation of pleasure, wellbeing, andsecurityinRApatientswhoarealreadydepressed[98].Yoga10 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicinehastheabilitytoreorganizethestructureandfunctionofthe nervoussystemwhichwasmanifestedbytheupregulationofmarkers of neuroplasticity. Yoga intervention leads to de-cline in severity of the disease which further influencespsychologicalhealthviachangesinbiomarkersatasystemiclevel. wQ_he yoga group was more compliant with the therapy and able to conduct daily activities without any diculty as theirpsychologicalhealthanddepressionseverityimproved[84]. Improvement in the overall quality of life, as well ashealth assessment questionnaire, was seen after the yogaintervention, with improvement in the physical, psycho-logical, social, and environment domain scores of theWHOQOL-BREF questionnaire [90]. Yoga improvedphysical and emotional tness, psychological health, andoverall wellbeing in patients who practiced it [85]. 4.Conclusion Yoga, a mind-body medicine and is a profound science andtechniqueforachievingoptimalhealthandwellbeing.Ithasimmune-modulatory properties, lowers pain perception, regulates the psycho-neuro-immune axis, reduces depres- sion severity, reduces disability quotient, and improves thequalityoflife.Hence,yogaisusefultopatientswithchronicpain as a complementary treatment that improves physicalfunctionandenhancesemotionalresilienceandmentalwell-being.
