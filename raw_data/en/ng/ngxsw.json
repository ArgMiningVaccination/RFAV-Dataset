Plus, understand nursing home costs and payment options.", "sitename": "Best Nursing Homes In Houston, Tx", "date": "2023-09-05", "cleaned_text": "In the state of Texas, all assisted living, memory care, and skilled nursing homes must be licensed and regulated by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (also known as the HHSC or HHS) before providing housing and care services to residents. Additionally, if a nursing home or senior care facility wishes to accept Medicaid or Medicare, it must be certified to do so by the HHSC. Below, you'll find a summarized list of HHSC certification requirements for nursing homes and senior care facilities in Texas: Resident admission processes - Using a doctor's order, skilled nursing facilities must develop a [person-centered care](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/person-centered-care) plan for each resident, and it must encompass the patient's dietary, therapeutic, social, psychological, and daily care needs. - In assisted living and memory care facilities, a similar procedure must be followed, except the facility is not required to use a doctor's order for care plans. For memory care facilities, there must also be a specialized admissions process in place to identify a resident's need for memory care services. Management and staffing requirements - Texas nursing homes and skilled nursing units are required to have licensed and registered nurses, certified nursing assistants, and nurse aids on staff. All nursing facilities must also meet specific staff-to-resident ratios (one on-site nurse for every 20 residents at all times). - Assisted living facilities require a full-time manager on-site to oversee the facility's daily operation. These managers are required to complete at least one 24-hour assisted living management course along with their staff. - Memory care facility managers and staff members must continually participate in specialized [memory care training](https://www.aplaceformom.com/caregiver-resources/articles/memory-care-staff-training) in order to remain a licensed memory care facility. Safety and healthy environmental standards - A certified skilled nursing facility in Texas must meet design, construction, and equipment standards that support the health and safety of residents, staff, and visitors. Each nursing facility must have safety equipment and emergency protocols for accidents, fires, or power outages. - Both assisted living and memory care facilities are required to have similar provisions and protocols in place. Memory care facilities must have additional measures in place to prevent residents from harming themselves or wandering. All facilities must allow for safe access to fresh air and common areas for activities. - Memory care facilities must designate an activities director to encourage socialization among residents. It's required for the director to tailor activities based on each individual resident's abilities. Directors must also arrange for special equipment in order to ensure that all residents can participate in activities. Nursing home and senior living facility inspections Texas Health and Human Services performs inspections on all skilled nursing, assisted living, and memory care facilities. These inspections are done approximately every two years and check for a facility's compliance with the life safety code, physical plant requirements, and health code requirements. The health code and life safety code include a survey of the following in nursing homes and senior care facilities: - Adequate staff-to-resident ratios - Employee background checks - Management of the facility - General construction of the facility - Safety and emergency features - Protection from hazardous areas - Documentation of fire drills, system checks, etc. Families can access a licensed community's most recent inspection report and general facility information through the Texas Health and Human Services [Long-term Care Provider Search](https://apps.hhs.texas.gov/ltcsearch/).

Nursing home reviews In an effort to continually enhance the quality of care provided in Texas nursing homes, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission implemented a new [Quality Monitoring Program](https://www.hhs.texas.gov/providers/long-term-care-providers/nursing-facilities-nf/quality-monitoring-program) (QMP) to monitor nursing facilities with a history of resident-care deficiencies. These QMPs are conducted by nurses, pharmacists, and dieticians. During their inspections, they may recommend the following: - Changes to a facility's policies or procedures - The facility's need for technical assistance - Staff trainings and education on evidence-based best practices Another inspection effort, called the [Nursing Facility Quality Review](https://utw10048.utweb.utexas.edu/research/nfqr.html), was spearheaded by the former Department of Aging and Disability Services and the University of Texas at Austin School of Nursing. These reviews were conducted every few years to identify problem areas and provide solutions in Medicaid-certified nursing facilities across the state. The primary goal was to assess clinical topics related to resident care, review medication management, and evaluate residents' satisfaction with quality of care and quality of life within the facility. The most recent [available report](https://utw10048.utweb.utexas.edu/docs/research/nfqr2015report.pdf) was published by the HHSC in 2017. Families can also visit the federal [Medicare website](https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=NursingHome&redirect=truehttps://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?providerType=NursingHome&redirect=true) to compare and contrast ratings, staffing practices, and overall quality of Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes.
