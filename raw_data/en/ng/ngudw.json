Nikolich has been guiding the young Amnestix, which was founded in 2006, primarily in the area of designing small-molecule drugs for memory-related disorders. Sygnis has confirmed it will continue to pursue the development of these therapeutic compounds. [Sygnis Pharma AG](http://www.sygnis.de/)announced it had acquired Burlingame, Calif.-based biopharmaceutical company [Amnestix Inc.](http://www.amnestix.com/)for approximately 4 million in cash and shares. Amnestix is known for applying high-end genome-scanning and other molecular diagnostics technologies to the discovery of drugs for diseases of the nervous system. As part of the acquisition, Sygnis will also gain access to a broad range of central nervous system (CNS) projects within the Arizona-based [Translational Genomics Research Institute](http://www.tgen.org/)(TGen).

Nikolich has been guiding the young Amnestix, which was founded in 2006, primarily in the area of designing small-molecule drugs for memory-related disorders. Sygnis has confirmed it will continue to pursue the development of these therapeutic compounds. Amnestix was founded by scientists from TGen, with seed funding from the [Brain Trust Accelerator Fund](http://www.braintrustvc.com/)to develop novel therapeutics for improving cognition and memory, which are impaired in a broad spectrum of neurological diseases. The founders of Amnestix, Dr. Dietrich Stephan and Dr. Matthew Huentelman, have discovered a series of novel patentable genes and pathways that play a fundamental role in memory performance in humans. \"[Amnestix], with its powerful CNS drug discovery engine, complements our CNS R&D capabilities. Furthermore, it opens direct access to the leading neurogenomic expertise of TGen, and the wider CNS experts in the U.S., through the Amnestix founders,\" says Dr. Alfred "}
