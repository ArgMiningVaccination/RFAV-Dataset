Because violence is so common in many people's lives, I've begun to ask all my patients about it. I'm concerned that your symptoms may have been caused by some-one hurting you. I don't know if this is a problem for you, but many of the women I see aspatients are dealing with abusive relationships. Some are too afraid or uncom-fortable to bring it up themselves, so I've started asking about it routinely. Some of the women and men we see here who are gay are hurt bytheir partners. Does your partner ever try to hurt you? Direct Verbal Questions Are you in a relationship with a person who physically hurts or threat-ens you? Did someone cause these injuries? Was it your partner? Has your partner or ex-partner ever hit you or physically hurt you? Hashe or she ever threatened to hurt you or someone close to you? Do youfeel controlled or isolated by your partner? Do you ever feel afraid of your partner? Do you feel you are in danger?Is it safe for you to go home? Has your partner ever forced you to have sex when you didn't want to?Has your partner ever refused to practice safe sex? Have you ever been hurt or threatened by your partner? Have you ever been hit, kicked, slapped, pushed, or shoved by yourpartner?Domestic Violence Assessment2167_Tab01_001-033.qxd 9/4/09 3:59 PM Page 2324Have you ever been hit, kicked, slapped, pushed, or shoved by your partner during this pregnancy? Have you ever been raped or forced to engage in sexual activity againstyour will? Are you currently or have you ever been in a relationship where youwere physically hurt, threatened, or made to feel afraid? Have you ever been forced or pressured to have sex when you did notwant to? A pedigree, or a picture of a medical family history using symbols, can be a time-saving, inexpensive diagnostic and screening tool. Many cliniciansask about family illnesses as part of a client's medical evaluation, writingout the history in textual form. However, once a clinician is used in gener-ating a pedigree, it usually requires less time than writing out text, is eas-ier to review later, and is often more concise and specific. An accuratepedigree can be just as useful in determining that a condition is not genet-ic as it is in establishing that a condition is inherited in a family. It is alsoextremely useful in assessing the hereditary component of common can-cers, such as breast and colon cancer.SCREENING Developing a Genetic Pedigree Chart 2167_Tab01_001-033.qxd 9/4/09 2425 SCREENINGIndividual Affected individual (Define shading inkey legend) Affected individual (more than one condition) Deceased individual Stillbirth (SB) Pregnancy (P) Affected SAB Affected TOPMultiple individuals, number known Multiple individuals, number unknown Spontaneousabortion (SAB) Termination of pregnancy (TOP)b. 1925Male 30 yFemale 4 moSex Unknown d. 35 y d. 4 mo 30 wkSB 34 wk male female male female5 n55 PPP *nnCommon Symbols Used to Develop Genetic Pedigrees Source: Bennett, R.L., Steinhaus, K.A., Uhrich, S.B., et al: Recommendations for standardized human pedigree nomenclature.

Continued*Overweight and obesity are associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. However, the presence of abdominal obesity is more highly correlated with the metabolic risk fac- tors than is an elevated body mass index (BMI). Therefore, the simple measure of waist circum-ference is recommended to identify the body weight component of the metabolic syndrome. **Some male patients can develop multiple metabolic risk factors when the waist circumfer- ence is only marginally increased (e.g., 94-102 cm [37-39 in.]). Such patients may have astrong genetic contribution to insulin resistance. They should benefit from changes in lifehabits, similarly to men with categorical increases in waist circumference.

Every provider interaction with a patient is therapeutic. Every patient is unique and should be evaluated as an individual. An established interviewing technique should be followed. Trust in the provider takes time to develop. The physical environment should be conducive to patient comfortand privacy. Legal and ethical parameters should be maintained, such as informedconsent, privacy, and confidentiality rights. Effective assessment requires clear communication. Interactions, including verbal and physical examination, should beaccomplished using language and actions matched to respect patientdignity and characteristics, such as age, mental status, education, ethnicity, culture, and religion. A qualified interpreter should be available if needed; a family memberor caregiver may be needed in certain situations, such as in an elderlypatient with some dementia, or in certain cultures. Nonverbal and verbal cues from the patient are critical to consider. Authentic listening to patient means attention, skill, and focus are onpatient; only necessary interruptions should be permitted. Patients are often stressed when visiting a provider; adequate learn-ing may not take place initially; written information and follow-up arerequired. The history interview is done with the patient dressed or covered andcomfortably seated or in bed (if in the hospital). The patient is providedwith privacy to disrobe, a gown, and adequate drapes.Patient Assessment Assumptions and Guidelines Record all findings in acceptable, medically descriptive terms. Use correct legal abbreviations. Use the approved process for documentation for the organization. Avoid recording information as guesses or slang; put diagnoses in theproper section of record, not in physical examination section wheredescriptions of findings are recorded. Avoid making any disrespectful notations; all documentation is part ofthe legal record.Documentation GuidelinesASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 34If patient's own words are to be used as part of record, put them in quotation marks. Code accurately (see Tab 5, Coding and Billing). SOAP Method The SOAP method provides consistency and ease of critically evaluating each problem or reason for visit. Problems should be numbered. OneSOAP entry for each numbered problem is indicated. S-Subjective CC, HPI, relevant PMH, FH, PSH, ROS, and other relevant historical data O-Objective data: Includes all physical assessment data and any lab A-Assessment: Includes diagnosis(es) P-Plan: Includes nonpharmacotherapeutic, pharmacotherapeutic, educa- of therapy outcomes 35 ASSESSClinical Pearl: The health history records subjective data. It is important whether the visit is an annual or episodic exam. By the end of the historyportion of the exam, the provider should have a good idea of the health-related problems or diseases you patient has. Take your time with thehealth history, be thorough, seek confirmation, and let the patient know you are interested in what he or she is saying. Identifying Data Also called demographic/biographic data. Record the following: Name Age Place/date of birth Nationality Gender Race/ethnicity Religion Marital status Address (and alternates); phone (and alternates) Health History2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 3536Educational level Occupation Any required legal/insurance information, such as Social Security Number Person(s) for emergency notification, advance directives Recheck data collected by clerk with patient for accuracy. Source of Referral and Reliability of Person Giving History Note both. Report may need to be requested from referring provider. Reliability of patient may be in question; if family member or caregiver present, note that person's presence and reliability. Clinical Pearl: When obtaining a history from a person who does not speak English, it is important to have an interpreter who can provide information about the patient. If the interpreter is a family member, there may be change to information the patient is not willing to share with the person translating. Chief Complaint or Reason for Visit (RFV) Record short statement in patient's own words of symptoms or rea- sons for seeking care; note complaint in a time frame (for example, CC: Chest pain for 2 hours with nausea and vomiting for last hour; RFV: I need a routine woman's health exam and Pap). Use caregiver's words if patient is unable to participate in assessment. CC is not a diagnosis; it is the main symptom/sign or complaint of thepatient. History of Present Illness or Current Health Status Record in narrative form: Usual state of health Chronological development of chief complaint (CC) See PQRSTOA table on pages 27 and 28 in Tab 1: Screening for guidance in gathering data related to patient's signs and symptoms Other pertinent data for HPI, including: Past occurrences Others in family with problem Relevant personal history, such as mild MI 5 years agoASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 36 Relevant family history, such as father died at age 56 of MI Disability Significant negatives related to symptoms and signs, such as nohistory of heart disease, HTN, respiratory illness Clinical Pearl: The HPI extracts relevant data from the ROS. Include rele- vant medications, habits, and allergies. If the patient is having a routinecheckup, record information on state of health since last visit, any impor-tant findings from last examinations and test results, relevant medica- tions, and significant negatives for visit. Past Medical History (PMH) or Past Health Status (PHS) Medical, surgical, OB/GYN, psychiatric past history with dates/places, such as hospitalizations, serious illnesses, surgeries, accidents andinjuries, and pregnancies, including delivery outcomes, and gestationlengths Immunizations and dates Screening tests, dates, places, and results Recent travel, including where and why Medications and Therapies Clinical Pearl: During the health history it is important to ask what over- the-counter medications or supplements patients are taking. Some time may be required to obtain a complete answer because patients often don'tconsider things such as aspirin, vitamins, minerals, or herbal supple-ments to be important or they may be unwilling to tell their health-care provider about these products. Clinical Pearl: Polypharmacy is especially problematic for older adults and may account for cognitive problems or other presenting symptoms. Be sureto ask patients to bring all medications in their appropriate bottles to the visit.Then a complete list of medications can be established, and the provider can determine if medications are being taken appropriately. Dosages, frequencies, routes of administration, and side effects of all current medications, including over-the-counter and prescription med-ications, contraceptives, herbs, and supplements Current therapies, including complementary and alternative therapies,such as acupuncture, hypnosis, and therapeutic touch 37 ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 3738Allergies All allergies, known causes, and responses to allergies, such as dys- pnea, swelling, hives, itching, erythema All sensitivities (rather than allergies) to drugs or other substances Family History List or diagram of all grandparents, parents, and siblings with agesand health or illnesses or, if dead, age deceased and cause of death Specific diseases within family Personal/Social History* *Also called psychosocial and personal/spiritual history Cultural and ethnic values and health beliefs Living environment and safety Family and household members' relationships, roles, and support persons Violence and abuse issues Occupation and risks to health Economic situation Nutritional habits Use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances with potential for abuse Exercise and physical activity patterns Health habits and patterns of care Education, including how patient learns best Recreation, relaxation, and hobbies Stress and coping methods Sleep and rest pattern Daily profile Seatbelt use Helmet use Goggles and other protective equipment use Sexual History May be recorded separately or with personal/social history; questionsdependent on specific patient Includes sexual preference, activity, contacts, function, satisfaction,concerns, issues, and abuse ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 38Violence History May be recorded separately or with personal/social history Includes description of abuse or violence patterns in patient's life, phys- ical and psychological sequelae, and measures being taken to be safe Reproductive/Gynecologic History For women (describe here, in PMH, or in ROS): Date of last menstrual period (LMP) Date of previous menstrual period (PMP) Age at menarche Pattern of menstrual periods, including frequency, first day of one to first day of next, duration, characteristics of flow, bleeding between periods Number of pregnancies Number of deliveries Number of abortions, including spontaneous and induced Complications of pregnancies Methods of contraception, including problems Condom use Age of menopause, symptoms, postmenopausal bleeding Exposure to DES if born before 1971 History of exposure to STDs/HIV/AIDS and treatments For men, see ROS genitalia 39 ASSESSGuidelines Record in an orderly process what the patient tells you about pres- ence or absence of specific diseases or symptoms and signs commonto each major body system.

Ensure that patient has voided prior to examination. Provide privacy, gown/draping, comfortable environment. Apply measures to prevent infection, including clean hands and universal precautions. Conduct examination in head-to-toe approach, unless other approachindicated based on age or physical and mental status of patient. Use system assessment approach if a focus on specific system is indicated; may need to begin with obvious problem. Provide abbreviated, focused examination for episodic or some routine examinations. Save genital and rectal examinations until last in most circumstances. Observe patient for signs of discomfort or pain; provide comfort asindicated. Apply techniques of examination in order of inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation accurately for each system or region; exception is abdominal examination, in which the order is inspection,auscultation, percussion, and palpation. Ensure that equipment and materials needed are in place, operational,and used appropriately. Offer patient relaxation suggestions, such as breathing and imagery,during the examination. Provide anticipatory advice and information during examination. Avoid facial expressions and comments that may convey negativethoughts. Look, listen, and touch with care; the senses and ability of theprovider to think critically are the most valuable assets to the assess-ment process. Compare right and left body systems/sides for similarity. Be gentle and respectful in physical contacts. Equipment Thermometer (oral, tympanic, rectal) Sphygmomanometer with varying cuff sizes Gloves (nonlatex) Water-soluble blades, nasal/ear specula Penlight Reflex hammer Tuning forks (128 Hz and 512 Hz) Safety pins or box of straight pens (use once each and discard) Tape measure Pocket visual acuity card Occult blood card Vaginal specula and associated materials for tests Accurate scale to measure height and weight Other equipment indicated, depending on history and physical examination General Survey State of health: Look at patient for general appearance of health or ill health; listen and look for subtle clues before touching patient. Height and weight, habitus: Obtain height, weight, BMI, nutritional status; note body build, posture, and symmetry of body parts. Sexual development: Note whether level of sexual development is appropriate for age/race/gender. Motor activity and gait: Observe for abnormalities with walking, sitting, and moving during examination. Personal characteristics: Note appropriateness of dress, grooming,and hygiene and any abnormal odors. Emotional state: Observe reactions, facial expressions, manner, and affect. Awareness/consciousness: Note level of alertness, words, and speech. Vital Signs See table for examples of normal vital signs by age group and the appropriate physical assessment reference for in-depth information. Temperature Use correct route, device, and application for safety and accuracy offindings; consider patient age, mental status, and condition. Temperatures fall during sleep and are lowest between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.; they rise during the day to peak between 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 46Routes are tympanic, oral, rectal, and axillary. Body temperature in infants and young children is higher until age 3 years; children's temperature fluctuates in a day up to 3\u00b0F, even to 100.8/9\u00b0F. Older men have lower oral temperatures compared with older women. Heart Rate/Pulse Obtain initial radial or apical pulse for 1 minute; recheck character ofheart and pulse, including rate, rhythm, and volume/intensity, whenconducting cardiovascular or peripheral vascular examination. Heart rate is higher normally in infants and children. Respiratory Rate Observe or obtain initial respiratory rate for 1 minute; recheck withrespiratory examination. Respiratory rate in infants and children has greater range. Blood Pressure Obtain initial BP using accepted method, such as removing allclothing, correct sphygmomanometer cuff placed smoothly around upper arm, arm at level of heart on arm rest, stethoscope applied over brachial artery at elbow below cuff, pressure inflated above systolic pressure in brachial artery, released slowly at about 1 mm Hg/sec. Listen for all Korotkoff sounds and record first (systolic) and last(diastolic), even if muffled. Consider that patients with hypertensionmay have an auscultatory gap. Record the exact numbers heard and note patient position; recheck BP in supine and sitting positions in both arms (and legs if indicated)if elevated. Consider patient-altering conditions when taking and documentingvital signs: Patient arriving late for appointment, making him or her hurried or anxious Patient smoking a cigarette or drinking hot or cold drink within theprevious 30 minutes Patient taking medication 20 minutes before arriving Examination room being too hot or cold47 ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 47Examples of Vital Sign Ranges by Age Infant Child Child Adolescent Adult Elder (55 years Vital Sign (3 mo-1 year) (3-5 years) (9-13 years) (14-18 years) (19-55 years) older) Temperature (\u00b0F) Oral Rectal or tympanic Axillary Heart/pulse rate (resting) (beats/min) Respiratory rate (resting) pressure (mm Hg) Diastolic Inspect and palpate skin on face and other body systems during exam- ination for color or discolorations, lesions, temperature, moisture, andturgor.

Gently compress nipples and note color, consistency, and amount of any discharge. Withlarge, pendulous breasts, palpate with patient sitting, then supine. Note specific location, size, shape, consistency, tenderness, andmobility of any nodule or mass. Heart With patient supine at 30 degrees, inspect and palpate the precordiumat 2nd right and left interspaces and apical (PMI) at apex (gen-erally midclavicular line 5th left intercostal space), noting characteris-tics of impulse, including location, duration, diameter, and amplitude.If PMI not felt, assess with patient on left side partly in the left lateraldecubitus position. Auscultate systole pulmonic listening areas with bell, then diaphragm. Look and listen for S3 and S4. Listen at apex with patient in sitting position, leaning forward forextra sounds.53 ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 5354Note characteristics heard in systole and diastole for abnormalities; grade murmurs based on timing, shape, maximal location, radi ation, and intensity as fraction. Murmur Grading Grade 1 (1/6): Very difficult to hear; not usually heard in every listen- ing position Grade 2 (2/6): Heard when stethoscope placed on chest but not loud Grade 3 (3/6): Moderate loudness Grade 4 (4/6): Loud; thrill present Grade 5 (5/6): Quite loud; heard with stethoscope off chest partly; thrill present Grade 6 (6/6): Quite loud; heard without stethoscope on chest; thrill present Assessing Jugular Venous Pressure Assess if indicated by history and prior findings of physical examina-tion, such as abnormal carotid pulsations or bruits, and abnormalheart examination findings. Internal jugular veins lie between carotid arteries and sternocleidomas-toid muscles bilaterally. Pulsations undulate, reflecting right atrial pres-sure changes, dynamics of blood volume pressures, and heart function. Clinical Pearl: Distinguish from carotid artery pulsations, which are palpable, have more intense pulsations that are not changed by position changes or inspiration, and reflect systolic and diastolic pressure changes, particularly ventricular effects. Raise examination table or bed to 30 degrees. A small pillow under the head is acceptable. To focus on internal jugular venous pulsations,may need to lower or raise head; the change in height will not affectthe findings. Use tangential lighting to see pulsations, and ask patient to turn headthe opposite way. Inspect both sides of the neck to find external and internal jugularpulsations. Find peak of pulsations of internal jugular artery; placelong straight card or object in horizontal position from pulsation'shighest point so that it crosses a vertical ruler placed from the sternalangle to form a right angle. Measure the distance in centimeters from the sternal angle (reflect pressure in right atrium) to where the horizontal card or object crossesthe ruler. ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 54Repeat on opposite side and record left JVP and right JVP measurements. Abnormal JVP is more than 4 cm above the sternal angle. Peripheral Vascular Assessment* Inspect all extremities completely: fingertips to shoulders for arm; ends of toes to groin and buttocks. Compare one side to the other. Inspect and palpate for size, edema (note severity of slight to excessivepitting on 4-point scale), symmetry, venous pattern/enlargement/varicosities, skin texture, temperature (with backs of hands), color/discoloration, pigment changes, lesions, and hair patterns, particularlyon lower extremities. and 1+ (weak, diminished),2+ (brisk), 3+ (increased), or 4+ (bounding). Record grade for each pulse. Inspect/palpate right and left epitrochlear nodes and superficialinguinal nodes (horizontal and vertical) for size, tenderness, consis-tency, discreteness, and mobility. Auscultate for bruits with bell over aorta and iliac and femoral arteries. *May be done with abdominal, musculoskeletal, or neurologic examination. Abdomen Inspect abdominal skin for color, lesions, scars, striae, venous pattern;inspect umbilicus for signs of infection or hernia. Know, in your mind's eye, the normal location of all abdominalorgans in left and right upper and lower quadrants and centralabdomen from epigastrium to symphysis pubis. Inspect symmetry, organs or masses, peristaltic waves,and pulsations. Note if contour is flat, round, protuberant, excessivelyconcave or hollow (scaphoid), or local or flank bulges. patient tolift head up slightly; note bowel sounds with diaphragm (normally 5-34 clicks/gurgles/minute). Listening in one quadrant only is acceptable because ofsound transmission efficiency in abdomen. If abnormality suspected,listen in all quadrants carefully. Auscultate aorta, arteries, and femoral for Auscultate upper middle abdomen (epigastrium) for venous hum. Percuss upper and lower borders of liver at RMCL; tympany becomes dullness at lower border; resonance becomes dullness at upper border.55 ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 5556Measure distance between borders in centimeters (normal 6-12 cm at MCL; 4-8 cm immediate left of sternal border). Percuss for enlargement by finding and left low-est interspace in left anterior axillary line; when patient is asked to take adeep breath, percussion note changes from tympany before the breathto dullness during the breath, indicating the spleen may be enlarged. Percuss entire abdomen for tympany (gas) and dullness (masses/fluid/feces); note any tenderness with percussion. Note dullness level ofdistended bladder above symphysis pubis. Palpate first with light palpation over abdomen to find tenderness, any masses/organs near the surface, or resistance of the musculature. Palpate second with deep palpation systematically in all quadrants for masses and characteristics, tenderness (note rebound tenderness ifpresent), and pulsations. Palpate liver border for consistency, irregularity, contour, and tender-ness; normally liver edge is smooth, regular, and not hard or firm.With an abdominal deep breath, the liver falls about 3 cm belowcostal margin for better evaluation. Strike flat hand resting on lower right rib cage with ulnar side of otherhand to assess for tenderness, which may indicate hepatitis or con-gestion; compare with left side (should be absent). Palpate kidneys bilaterally for size (enlargement), contour (masses,irregularity), and tenderness. It is rare to palpate normal left kidney;normal right kidney may be palpable if person is thin and relaxed. Strike ball of one hand over each CVA with ulnar fist of other hand toassess for kidney tenderness. Normally, no pain is elicited. Palpate aortic pulsations in upper abdomen; assess width of aorta ifpossible. Normal aorta is not wider than 3 cm. Musculoskeletal System* Inspect and palpate joints of upper extremities for joint formed from bursae, ligaments, tendons, capsules, and surrounding tissues of upper extremities for crepitus, atrophy,nodules, swelling, tenderness, or bruising. Compare sides. Test ROM for upper body and upper extremeties: Neck: Flexion, extension, rotation, lateral bending Shoulders: Abduction, adduction, flexion, extension, internal and external extension, pronation, supination Wrists: Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction; opposi- tion for the t humbs Inspect posture, movement, and gait with walking from and toprovider. Note width of base, pelvic shift, knee flexion, smoothnessand continuousness of rhythm. Note stance and cycle of weight-bearing foot and swing of foot that is not weight-bearing. Inspect spine and hips from side and behind with patient standing.Inspect curves of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine; alignment ofspinal processes; and alignment of shoulders and scapulae. Inspectparavertebral muscles, hip surfaces, and condition of skin over backand hips for abnormalities. Palpate spinous processes, joints, and paravertebral muscles fromneck, down spine, and through sacroiliac joints for tenderness,spasm, or obvious lack of or too prominent spinal process. Test ROM of spine, including flexion, extension, rotation, and lateralbending; and hips, including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction,and internal and external rotation. Spinal ROM tested while standing;hips ROM tested while standing or supine. Inspect and palpate joints of lower extremities for alignment, swelling,tenderness, warmth, redness, deformities, nodules, thickenings, or atrophy: Hip palpate muscles, bursae, ligaments, tendons, capsules,menisci, surrounding tissues of lower extremities for crepitus, atrophy, nodules, swelling, tenderness, thickening, bogginess, or bruising. Compare sides. Test ROM of knee for flexion and extension, ankle for plantar flexionand PM Page 5758*Temporomandibular joint and masseter muscle assessment done with HEENT; range of motion and evaluation of spine and gait often completedat beginning of examination or very end. See Nervous System, page 58,for motor and strength assessment.ASSESS Nervous System Mental Status/Behavior Some Assumptions Some assessment of the patient's mental status occurred from first meeting the patient, conducting the interview to gather history data,and performing the physical examination to this point. The general survey provided specific data that applied to the nervoussystem evaluation of the mental status and gave indication for furtherassessment. An in-depth evaluation of the mental status does require specific questions and activities that seek specific indications of normalcy ordeviations. If the provider has concerns that a more in-depth assessment is neededfor mental status, the next sections would be indicated. More detailedinformation about these sections may be accessed in a reputable healthassessment text. Appearance/Behavior Consciousness: Patient is alert, awake, aware of and understands questions, responds appropriately within an acceptable period oftime, and stays on track. Dress, grooming, body and clothing hygiene: Dress and appearance are appropriate for the person's situation, age, and sociocultural back-ground; clothing is clean, in good condition, right-side out, and inplace and fastened; skin and teeth are clean, and hair, nails, and bodyhair are groomed and hygienic. Posture, motor activity: Body movements and posture are evidence of patient's state of relaxation or stress or other, such as pain, and arenot influenced by other activities in the area. Facial expression: Patient's expressions change in response to ques- tions, statements, and activities of provider during examination orremain unchanged throughout process of assessment. Manner, affect, relationship to others and things: Patient's affect is appropriate to the situation, circumstances, and topics asked or 2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 5859 ASSESSdiscussed; patient is open and may be approached by others; reac- tions are appropriate. Patient converses only with provider or otherperson invited to be present, does not talk to someone absent or seeor hear something the provider does not see or hear. Clinical Pearl: When an older adult presents with sudden-onset confusion, the provider should consider delirium rather than dementia. Common causes of delirium in older adults include infection, electrolyte imbalance, polypharmacy, fecal impaction, and cardiac arrhythmias. Speech and Language Quantity, rate, volume: Patient responses and speech are sponta- neous, acceptable in quantity and loudness, without excessive words. Word articulation, fluency: Spoken words are clear, distinct, and with inflections; without nasal characteristic, hesitations, substitutions for words unable to recall, or paraphasia of words. Mood, Thoughts, and Perceptions Self-perceptions of mood: Patient responds to questions about feel- ings related to specific life events, current feelings and spirits, feel-ings of depression or discouragement, how he or she sees self in thefuture, and thoughts of death or suicide (if so, how it would be doneand what he or she believes death is like). Assess if the patient has aplan and the means to carry out the plan to commit suicide. Thought processes, content, perceptions, insights, judgment: Patient's thought processes are logical, organized, relevant, understandable, coherent, and goal oriented. Thought content does not exhibit compul- siveness, obsessions, phobias, anxieties, feelings of unreality or deper-sonalizations, or delusions. Perceptions do not seem to be misinterpre- tations of reality or hallucinations. Insight is appropriate to questions/ statements. Judgment and decisions/planning are realistic, not sugges- tive of psychosis, impairment, anxiety, low level of intelligence, or disorientation. Cognitive Function Rudimentary Cognitive Functions Orientation: Patient answers questions correctly related to information that can be confirmed, such as time of day, week, month, season, date,year; place of health visit, town or city, and state; own name, names offamily members or others that can be verified. 2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 5960Attention: Patient's concentration is evidenced by correct repeating of numbers in the digit-span exercise, subtracting 7s from 100 in about 1.5 minutes, or spelling words backward. Remote and recent memory: Patient is able to give generally accurateinformation that can be verified, such as jobs held, anniversary, his-torical events and people; gives accurate information that is recent,such as time for appointment, medications, weather of the day. Learning and immediate retention: Patient is able to repeat back at the end of the examination a series of 3 to 4 words given at beginning ofexamination. Words are correct; patient is aware of correctness. Higher Cognitive Functions Information and vocabulary: Patient has a higher cognitive function; able to discuss topics intelligently or answer more complex, directquestions accurately. Calculating ability: Patient is able to complete addition and multiplica- tion correctly at simple and slightly more complex level or give correctanswers to situational math problems. Abstract thinking: Patient is able to draw the face of a clock, complete with numbers, accurate size of hands, or give reasonable, nonconcreteinterpretations of common proverbs, such as \"a stitch in time savesnine,\" \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease\"; patient is able to say howthings are alike accurately and the relevance, such as a church and a theater or a piano and a violin. The degree of abstractness or concrete- ness is accurate. Clinical Pearl: Screening for cognitive impairment in older adults is important. Cognitive impairment can significantly affect the information provided by the patient, and another health-care informant may berequired. In addition, cognitive impairment may affect the patient's safetyat home and their ability to complete activities of daily living and may bethe cause of somatic complaints. Cranial Nerves, Motor and Sensory Systems, and Reflexes Selected Assumptions Assessment of some components of the nervous system takes place dur- ing the earlier physical examination, such as cranial nerve when doingHEENT and neck.ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 60Assessment of motor and sensory systems and reflexes may be integrated into assessment of specific regions of the body, such as combined with peripheral vascular and musculoskeletal of theupper extremities, and so on. Always test and compare opposite sides of the body, such as eachnostril separately for smell acuity, each eye separately and bothtogether, each pupil separately for pupillary reactions. and feet separately for sensory function. Compare proximal with distal areas of the body; use nonrepetitivepatterns to assess so the patient is not able to anticipate the test area. Cranial Nerves and Motor System Assess cranial nerves (CN 1-12) Inspect and palpate motor system by observing body position at restand during activity, inspecting for involuntary movements; inspectingand palpating muscles for size and contour, atrophy, fasciculations,maintenance of tone when muscle is relaxed, decreased resistancewith passive movement by provider, spasticity and rigidity, and floppiness. Test coordination with: Rapid alternating movements (arms, legs) for rhythm, speed, and smoothness Point-to-point function (arms, legs) for smoothness, accuracy, andlack of tremor Gait (walk naturally, heel-to-toe, walk on toes, walk on heels) forbalance, posture, appropriate swing of arms and leg movements,and smooth turns Hopping in place and shallow knee bends for position sense andbalance, testing with each leg separately (may substitute standingfrom sitting position without using arm support and stepping up onsturdy step if patient is ill or older) Testing for muscle strength (see table on page 62) Test stance for balance, position sense, and intact corticospinal tract with the: Romberg test: Ability to maintain upright position with no support for 20 to 30 seconds after closing eyes while standing Test for pronator drift: Ability to keep both arms straight forward with palms up and eyes closed for 20 to 30 seconds; ability toreturn to prior position when provider taps arm and arm drifts only slightly 61 ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 61Test Spinal Root Method for Testing Biceps flexion Triceps extension Wrist extension Grip Finger abduction Thumb opposition Spinal flexion, extension, bending Hip flexion 62Test and grade muscle strength for the following muscles and spinal nerve roots; see tests and method for testing below followed by grad-ing scale for strength.

Sensory System and Reflexes To test sensory system: Sample dermatomes and peripheral nerve areas, comparing sym- metric sides for sensory intactness; map areas where deficits found. Avoid holding patient's hand, foot, or other body part with pressureor in way that alerts patient or interferes with test accuracy. 2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 6364ASSESS Patient's eyes must be closed. Alter test site opposites irregularly during test so patient cannot anticipate sensation. Retest any test area lacking sensation. Test for pain with sharp, clean safety pin, broken cotton-tipped applicator,or other clean tool that has a blunt end and a sharp end. Test for light touch with cotton wisp swiped lightly to a sampling of areas. Test for vibratory sense using vibrating tuning fork (128 Hz) placed ondistal joint of one finger on each hand and joint of big toe on eachfoot. Test for position sense by holding big toe lightly on each side andmoving up and down in small arc.

Response examples: \"I can do my job.\" \"I can play sports.\" \"I am able to enjoy being with my family.\" \"I can clean the house, garden,and do my knitting.\" Ask what \"poor health\" means to the patient. Response examples: \"I have a lot of pain with my arthritis.\" \"I can't take care of myself as well anymore.\" \"I had to give up playingbasketball.\" Learn about dominant cultural and ethnic background beliefs and values related to health care in your area. Ask what the patient feelsis important for his or her own health care. Response examples: \"I want a doctor who doesn't look down on me because I go to a se\u00f1or\u00eda for health care.\" \"I'm African American. My family uses a lot of herbs. I wish I could talk with my health provider about that, but she thinks it's unhealthy.\" \"Islamicculture requires a female family member to be present during myannual exam. A female provider is important too.\" Consider unique personal and cultural responses of the patient and family because they may be different for each person in a culture or ethnicity. Response examples: \"I know I've got a castiga [Italian for curse] on me! It must be that woman down the street who is making me sick.\" \"In my family [Puerto Rican], we try to eat some hotand cold foods to keep well.\" \"I don't talk with my priest to helpme with this disease!

People inour area are so rude.\" Learn some general information about a culture or ethnicity related to health care, but be aware that beliefs and values differ widely withingroups; don't stereotype patients. Find out what actual ethnic or racial factors may be influencing thepatient's condition, such as growth patterns or propensity for higherrisks for certain diseases within the ethnic or racial group; this is dif-ferent from values and beliefs. See table that follows for examplesof illnesses/genetic conditions found in certain ethnic groups. Recognize your own values, beliefs, biases, and stereotypes; be willing toaccept other cultures as equal although different. If unable to, refer thepatient to someone who can care for that patient in an unbiased manner. Obtain effective and accurate translator support to interact effectivelywith a patient from another culture who does not speak your languagewell or at all. Use good judgment if patient insists on a family member;this may be a cultural or religious need. In every interaction, seek to show respect, to communicate effectively,to listen authentically, and to collaborate with the patient in his/herown care.

When taking the patient's history, assess the role nutrition plays: HPI: Does diet influence this or other illnesses? PMH: Did nutrition play a role in past illnesses or surgeries FH: What role has nutrition played in the family history? ROS: Are specific systems influenced by the patient's dietary/ supplement intake, such as cardiovascular, and how? Also assess how the following have influenced the patient's diet: Body weight history Medications Allergies and sensitivities PSH Assess the willingness of the patient and family or caregiver to consider indicated nutritional modifications. ASSESS 2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 72Assess how the patient learns best, such as through written materials, oral instructions, or visual cues; decide with the patient, family, orcaregiver what the most effective ways to help him or her make nutri-tional changes would be; consider past efforts' success or failure. Refer patient and family/caregiver to nutritional specialist if indicated. Taking a Diet History Aim for a description of the patient's eating habits, foods, drinks, andchanges since or during the illness. Consider one or more of three methods of obtaining information for adiet history: 24-hour recall: Requires the patient to remember what food and drink were consumed through the entire previous day, including the times and how much of these were consumed; most people can remember this information, but the day of recall may not betypical Typical day description: Requests the person to give a usual diet for a day; may give the most information unless there is no typicalday for the person Food frequency method: Requests how often and what amounts of specific foods are eaten; provides way to focus on certain areas ofconcern Questions about intake related to the specific disease or illness may be helpful, such as consumption of calcium and vitamin D with osteoporosis. With patients at risk related to nutritional factors, including overweight,obese, underweight, malnourished, and elderly patients, obtain adetailed history that includes diet history, psychosocial and culturalinfluences, and ROS and conduct a complete physical examination. 73 ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 73Assessment of Anemia Type of Anemia Cause Blood Values Treatment Iron deficiency Macrocytic 74ASSESSLow iron levels in the blood, decreasing the ability of the red cell to carry oxygen Vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency Pernicious anemia Chemotherapy Gastric bypass or banding Inability to absorb B12 due to lack of intrinsicfactor in stomach Microcytic 80;

Philadelphia, F.A. Davis, 2003. *These guidelines assume that the examiner is alone without a nursing assistant. Responsibilities of Examiner Patient should be informed when she makes the appointment not to have coitus; douche; or use tampons, foams, creams, jellies, or sup-positories for 48 hours prior to examination. Instruct the patient thatPap smears may not be done during menses. Provide and assure privacy for the patient. Obtain signed informedconsent if required in institution. Notify patient in writing within 30 days of results of tests and follow-up needed. Wash hands thoroughly before the examination begins.Basic Gynecologic Examination*2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 80Place gloves on both hands before touching patient; double glove if concerned with infectious material. Maintain universal precautions.Use nonlatex gloves in case of latex allergy of patient. If any equipment malfunctions during examination, have replacementsavailable. Do not contaminate the outsides of test containers that other personnelwill touch in transferring specimens from sites to containers. Do not leave the patient in lithotomy position with speculum in placeif you have to leave the room to retrieve additional equipment.Remove speculum, put patient's legs down on table extension, thenreposition and reinsert speculum after returning. Record findings as soon as possible. Inform patient of findings or anyconcerns because this examination often brings forth questions andconcerns from women. Schedule appropriate follow-up. Preparation of Equipment and Room Have all necessary equipment clean, checked, and ready to use beforepatient is prepared. Arrange equipment for ease and order of use. Basic equipment required: Examination table with adjustable stirrups Rolling stool with adjustable height Excellent light source, such as lighted speculum, gooseneck lamp, head lamp Clean nonlatex gloves Clean coverings for table and draping Vaginal specula Testing equipment: Labels with patient information/date Cytological equipment Warm water Water-soluble lubricant; be sure never to touch outlet of tube or bottle with glove during any part of examination; drop lubricant onto fingers. Discard any contaminated tube/bottle. Preparation of Patient Have patient empty her bladder; save specimen if indicated. Explain all procedures and equipment. Ideally, patient has been provided with written information prior to examination. 81 ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 8182Ask patient to remove clothing covering lower abdomen and pelvis. She may leave shoes on if more comfortable. Assist patient to assume lithotomy position; adjust table so that headof table is elevated about 30 degrees. This is not done until after theabdominal examination is completed. It does not interfere with pelvicexamination findings and provides patient with more control. Be sure legs are equally positioned in stirrups. If shoes off, placeclean paper towels in stirrups under feet. Position patient's buttocks slightly off end of table so that speculummay be introduced without interference of table. Assure patient of explanations during the examination and help herrelax. Deep breathing techniques are helpful for relaxation. External Genitalia Assessment Inspect discharge, edema, nodules, or parasites in hair. Inspect but do not touch areas of perineum, rectum, and anus. Thiscan be done at time of rectal examination. Assess sexual maturity level of genitalia, including hair pattern. If ulceration present, take specimen for diagnosis. Check Bartholin's glands with index finger and thumb at 5 and 7 o'clock for swelling or tenderness; test any discharge from openings inside introitus. Assess vaginal support for cystocele, rectocele, or prolapse. Separatelabia with fingers; ask patient to bear down, and note location andextent of any bulging. If patient has indicated urinary incontinence,examiner should lean to the side during this examination in case offorceful urine loss. Internal Vaginal and Cervical Examination Insert one finger and identify location/position of cervix and anyobstructions. Insert appropriate-size warmed, lubricated speculum at slight angle toavoid urethral meatus, turn horizontally, and open to see ectocervixand cervical os. Gently remove excessive discharge that interferes with view with cotton-tipped applicator. Determine cervical size, shape, color, and position; determine locationof lesions, nodules, masses; identify any bleeding or 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 82Obtain wet mount or saline test tube specimens of cervical discharge; take specimen from under cervix prior to Pap smear to avoid blood inspecimen; do not take from cervical os or ectocervix. Evaluate micro-scopically after exam for abnormal epithelial cells, blood cells, ororganisms. Check pH of cervical discharge with pH paper strip; compare colorwith standards. Obtain cervical cytology specimen (Pap smear) using institutional pro-cedure and equipment; important to gain cells from the transformationzone and the ectocervix. Specimens may be obtained with cervical spatula from ectocervix andwith endocervical brush, cervical broom, or some other preferredmethod from endocervix. For pregnant women, use short rounded portion of spatula for ectocervical specimen and saline-moistened cotton-tipped applica-tor for endocervical sampling. For women using birth control pills, the transformation zone maybe out on the ectocervix. For postmenopausal women, transformational zone may need tobe accessed further into cervical os because it recedes with aging. Prepare sample as directed on slides with fixative within 10 seconds, or place slide in fixative bottle. If indicated, obtain specimens for sexually transmitted diseases;swabs from syphilitic ulcerations should be taken. If patient bleeds from cervix after tests completed, apply pressurewith large cotton-tipped applicator for several minutes. May need toapply Monsel's solution to stop bleeding. Inspect the vaginal walls by turning and opening speculum blades(and during withdrawal) to visualize for nodules, masses, ulcerations,other lesions, color, erythema, discharge, and presence or absence ofrugae. Bimanual Pelvic Examination Remove speculum; place inside clean glove to retain if further dischargespecimens needed, otherwise dispense in proper covered container. Lubricate index and middle finger of dominant hand; tell patientyou're going to insert two fingers to check internal organs and keepfingers of other hand on her lower abdomen to palpate the uterusand other organs between internal and external fingers. 83 ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM Page 8384Palpate all vaginal walls; fornices around cervix; and region of urethra and bladder for nodules, masses, or tenderness. Palpate cervix for shape, size, position, consistency, and mobility andany irregularities or tenderness. Determine position of uterus: anteroverted, retroverted, retroflexed,or midplane. Palpate the uterus between both sets of fingers for size, shape, consis-tency, and mobility and for tenderness or masses. If uterus cannot be palpated with the abdominal hand, it is retroverted,retroflexed, or midplane, or the patient may be obese or have exces-sive fluid in the abdominal/pelvic cavities. Palpate each ovary and adnexa between the two sets of fingers forsize, shape, consistency, mobility, and tenderness. The ovaries maynot be palpable if the woman is obese, has pain, or is very tense. Assess pelvic muscle strength as withdrawing by spreading the twofingers before exiting vagina and asking patient to squeeze vaginalmuscles around your fingers. Note seconds squeeze can be maintainedand movement of fingers upward and inward. Rectovaginal Examination Replace glove used for vaginal or uterine examination with a newglove. Lubricate index and middle fingers. Ask patient to bear down as if having bowel movement to relax sphinc-ter; insert index finger into vagina and middle finger into rectum slowly,advising patient she will not defecate even if feels she will. Find cervix with vaginal finger; palpate area behind cervix of the cul de sac and along the rectovaginal wall for nodules, masses, ortenderness. Palpate posterior surface of uterus, left and right ovaries and adnexalstructures. Clinical Pearl: Retropositioned uteruses are best evaluated with midplane not be easily palpated. Anorectal Examination Change gloves; lubricate one finger. Inspect area of perineum, external rectum, and anus for color bleeding,or discharge.ASSESS2167_Tab02_034-101.qxd 9/4/09 7:31 PM 84Assessment Used Findings Spinal reflexes Motor pathways CoordinationPalpate external rectoanal area, and gently insert lubricated finger as high as comfortable for patient in rectum. Palpate accessible rectal wall for nodules, masses, internal hemor-rhoids, or tenderness.

Risk factors warranting increased suspicion include obesity, age, trauma, cancer, immobility, smoking, use of oral contracep-tives, and recent surgery. Women of childbearing age often present with sharp abdominal pain and nausea similar to appendicitis or gastroenteritis. Other signs may include vaginal bleeding and fever. If the tube ruptures, pain becomes extreme and shock can ensue. This makes ectopic preg-nancy an emergency diagnosis. When DVT is suspected based on history and signs and symptoms, send patient immediately for an ultrasound of the affected area and D-dimer test. D-dimer is useful as a negative predictive test for DVT (if D-dimer is negative, it is unlikely the patient has a DVT).

DEXA is the standard method for measur-ing bone mineral density. When to Use Bone density is used to diagnose osteoporosis. DEXA is used to measurebone mineral density (BMD) by exposing parts of the body to small dosesof ionizing radiation. It is usually performed on the lower spine and hips.Portable devices measuring wrists, fingers, or heel are used only forscreening purposes. Once the scan has been completed, two scores willbe reported to the provider. Z Score The Z score reflects the amount of bone the patient has compared withother people in the same age group. T Score The T score reflects the amount of bone the patient has in comparison toyoung adults of the same gender and is the most important measurementof risk for fracture development. A score higher than -1 is considered nor-mal. A score between -1 and -2.5 is classified as osteopenia, the firststage of bone loss. A score of less than -2.5 is defined as osteoporosis. Mammogram A mammogram is a low-dose x-ray of the breast used to determine whetherabnormal growths or cysts are present. It is an important tool for earlydetection of breast cancer and is recommended for all women older thanage 40 years. Screening Mammogram A screening mammogram is an x-ray exam of the breast in a woman whohas no symptoms. The goal of its use is to find cancer when it is still toosmall to be felt by a woman or her doctor.LABS X-Rays2167_Tab03_102-129.qxd 9/4/09 7:32 PM Page 102Diagnostic Mammogram A diagnostic mammogram is an x-ray exam of the breast in a woman who either has a breast complaint, such as a breast mass or nipple discharge,or has had an abnormality found during a screening mammogram. Duringa diagnostic mammogram, more pictures are taken to carefully study thebreast condition. In most cases, special images involve magnification tomake a small area of suspicious breast tissue easier to evaluate. Clinical Breast Examination A clinical breast exam (CBE) is done to detect breast abnormalities orevaluate patient reports of symptoms to find palpable breast cancers at anearlier stage of progression. It should be performed by a health careprovider at least every 3 years for women older than age 20 years andyearly in women starting at age 40 years. Breast Self-Examination The breast self-exam (BSE) is an important part of cancer prevention, andwomen should be educated to perform monthly BSEs and to immediate-ly report any changes in breast architecture. US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations Women Aged 40 Years and Older Screening mammography, with or without CBE, every 1-2 years. Women Aged 20-40 Years CBE as part of a regular health examination at least every 3 years. Women at High Risk (greater than 20% lifetime risk) MRI and a mammogram each year High risk includes: Known BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation First-degree relative with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation Lifetime risk of breast cancer of 20%-25% or greater, according to risk assessment tools based mainly on family history103 LABS2167_Tab03_102-129.qxd 9/4/09 7:32 PM Page 103Diagnostic Use by Anatomic Region Region Diagnostic Use Head Chest Pulmonary angiogram Cardiac (cardiac CT angiography)LABS 104Computed Tomography NO CONTRAST used for ruling out a bleed CONTRAST used for ruling out a mass Detection of acute and chronic changes in lung parenchyma Evaluation of chronic interstitial processes, such as emphysema and fibrosis Continuous images provided by high- resolution CT done during inspiration and exhalation IV CONTRAST used for the detection of air- space disease and boundaries of the greatvessels and assessment of the mediastinumand hilar regions for lymphadenopathy(important when a diagnosis of lung cancer issuspected) Preferred method for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism Test completed in less than 5 minutes Any mass/filling defect such as an embolus appears dark in place of the contrast filling Can be used with retrospective electrocar- diogram gating Exposes patient to high levels of radiation (equivalent to 600 chest x-rays) 90% sensitive for coronary artery disease, with a negative predictive value of 93% Continued2167_Tab03_102-129.qxd 9/4/09 7:32 PM Page 104Diagnostic Use by Anatomic Region\u2014cont'd Region Diagnostic Use Abdominal and pelvic Extremities MRI, rather than CT, should be performed in the following situations: In patients with serious allergies or renal failure because contrast- enhanced MRI is safer than contrast-enhanced CT For imaging of the liver because it does not use the ionizing radiationassociated with CT scanning For imaging of the pancreas, adrenals, and kidneys at centers with consid-erable MRI experience (at centers with CT experience, CT is adequate;practice should change, however, with more centers doing MRI) In male and female patients requiring imaging of pelvic organs (althoughultrasound is effective for many noncomplex female pelvic conditions) For imaging of the bowel at a few centers105 LABS Very sensitive method for diagnosing abdominal disease CONTRAST used for ruling out appendicitis and diverticulitis NO CONTRAST used for ruling out kidney stones Used to determine stages of cancer and follow progress Can be used to investigate acute abdominal pain, renal stones, appendicitis, pancreati- tis, diverticulitis, abdominal aorticaneurysm, and bowel obstruction The first line for detecting solid organ injuries after trauma Used in osteoporosis studies alongside densitometry Diagnosis of complex fractures, especially around the joints Diagnosis of ligamental injuries and dislocations Magnetic Resonance Imaging 2167_Tab03_102-129.qxd 9/4/09 7:32 PM Page 105LABS 106For imaging of large- and medium-sized vessels, mainly for safety reasons In patients with vessel disease (particular strengths in this area; described as MR angiography) CT is preferred over MRI in the following situations: In patients with suspected kidney stones For imaging of small vessels In patients with most lung diseases In patients with most types of severe acute trauma For determining the location of tubes and catheters in very sick patients Ultrasound Diagnostic Ultrasound Use by Anatomic Region Region Diagnostic Use Thyroid Prostate Ovary Pregnancy Pelvis Cardiac Bone FetusIdentification of nodules and differentiation of types of thyroid cancer Guidance during biopsy procedureIdentification of types of adnexal massesIdentification of intrauterine growth restriction Identification of and location of products of conception.

Diagnosis codes indicate medical necessity and therefore drive reimbursement. V codes (V01-V83) are used for preventive services that are covered, such as \"woman's health yearly exam.\" E codes establish medical necessity and identify causes of injury and other problems. E codes are never the primary code; they can speedup reimbursement. Child abuse takes precedence over all other Ecodes; next comes cataclysmic events, and third is transportationaccidents. Examples of E codes follow: E884.0: Fall from playground equipment E917.0: Struck accidentally by an object or person in a sports event E901.0: Excessive cold Identify each service or procedure, or supply with a diagnosis code. Chronic diseases should be reported if appropriate. Always use the code with the highest degree of specificity. Properly link all diagnosis codes to the CPT code. Do not use \"rule out,\" \"suspected,\" \"probable,\" or \"questionable.\" Use signs and symptoms when a definitive diagnosis code is not available. Code the primary diagnosis first.

Standard care is what medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, and allied health professionals, suchas registered nurses and physical therapists, practice. Alternative medicineincludes treatments that fall outside of standard ones. Complementary med-icine means using nonstandard treatments alongside standard treatments,such as tai chi or massage, in addition to prescribed medication. Conventional health-care providers are learning more about comple- mentary and alternative medicine because they recognize that more thanhalf of people try some kind of alternative treatment. Many health-careinstitutions have begun integrating therapies that aren't part of main-stream medicine into their treatment programs, and a number of medicaland nursing schools now include education on nontraditional techniquesin their curriculum. As complementary and alternative therapies proveeffective, they're being combined more often with conventional care. Thisis known as integrative medicine. The primary principles of complementary and alternative health care include the following: Prevention is key to good health. The body has the ability to heal itself. Learning and healing go hand in hand. The focus is on holistic care that treats the patient as a whole person greater than the sum of his or her parts. Many herbs and supplements (Hs/Ss) commonly used could not be pre-sented in this section because of space limitations.

According to traditional Chineseacupuncture theory, these acupuncture points lie along meridians alongwhich qi, the body's vital energy, flows. Acupuncture originated in Chinaand is most commonly associated with traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). The acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing andquestioning the patient so as to make a diagnosis according to the tradi-tion that he or she used. Some of the conditions successfully treated withacupuncture include headache, hypertension, muscle and joint pain,fibromyalgia, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, drug dependence,and smoking cessation. Acupuncturists must be licensed in each state they practice.Complementary Therapies2167_Tab07_207-228.qxd 9/4/09 4:01 PM Page 221CAM 222Efficacy: In research studies acupuncture has been shown to decrease pain; improve acne outbreaks; decrease asthma exacerbations; decrease chronic pain including lower back pain, dental pain, andpostoperative pain; improve depression symptoms; improve gout;decrease relieve the pain ofarthritis and tendonitis; and improve wound healing. Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is the art and science of helping living things towardwholeness and balance using the essential oils that can be extracted fromliving plants. Essential oils are liquids obtained from plants that evaporateat room temperature with characteristic aromas. Aromatherapy use wasdocumented as early as ancient Babylonia in 5,000 BC. Research has demonstrated that aromatherapy is effective for anxiety, depression,insomnia, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Efficacy: In research studies, aromatherapy has been shown to decrease anxiety and stress; decrease postoperative and pregnancy-induced nausea; decrease depression, blood pressure, and insomnia;clear sinuses; increase the immune system by increasing white blood cell production; and improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Arts Therapies Arts therapies are forms of expressive therapy. These therapies combinetraditional psychotherapeutic theories and techniques with an under-standing of the psychological aspects of the creative process. These professionals are employed in many clinical settings with diverse patientpopulations. Efficacy: Arts therapy has been shown to decrease depression and improve mood even in patients with severe mental illnesses. Musictherapy has been effective in reducing depression, alleviating anxiety,and improving cognition. Drama therapy and dance therapies havebeen effective in improving cognition, reducing depression, and alleviating anxiety even in cases of severe mental illness.2167_Tab07_207-228.qxd 9/4/09 4:01 PM Page 222Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine is a medical system that has been used for thousands of years to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease. It is based on thebelief that qi (the body's vital energy) flows along 20 meridians (channels)throughout the body and keeps a person's spiritual, emotional, mental, andphysical health in balance. TCM aims to restore the body's balance and harmony between the natural opposing forces of yin and yang, which canblock qi and cause disease. It includes such treatments as herbal medicine,acupuncture, dietary therapy, Tui na and Shiatsu massage, qigong, and Tai chi TCM theory is extremely complex and originated thousands of years ago through meticulous observation of nature, the cosmos, and the human body. Included in Chinese medicine is herbal therapy andacupuncture. Chiropractic Medicine Chiropractic medicine is grounded in the principle that the body can healitself when the skeletal system is correctly aligned and the nervous system is functioning properly. To achieve this, the practitioner uses hisor her hands or an adjusting tool to perform specific manipulations of thevertebrae. When these bones of the spine are not correctly articulated,resulting in a condition known as sublimation, the theory is that nervetransmission is disrupted; this disruption can cause pain in the back andother areas of the body. Chiropractic is one of the most popular alterna-tive therapies currently available. Research has also supported the use ofspinal manipulation for acute low back pain. Some anecdotal evidencesuggests recommending chiropractic treatment for ailments unrelated tomusculoskeletal problems, but there is not enough research-based datato support this. However, a chiropractor may be able to treat problemsand diseases unrelated to the skeletal structure by using therapies otherthan spinal manipulation. Efficacy: Chiropractic medicine that uses spinal manipulation has been shown to reduce pain and muscle spasms, increase immuneglobulins, and improve posture.223 CAM2167_Tab07_207-228.qxd 9/4/09 4:01 PM Page 223CAM 224Feldenkrais Feldenkrais is an educational system centered on movement, aiming to expand and refine the use of the self through awareness. It is intended forthose who wish to improve their movement repertoire, such as dancers,musicians, and artists; for those wishing to reduce pain or limitations inmovement; and for those who want to improve their general well-being.Because it uses movement as the primary vehicle for gaining awareness,it is directly applicable to disorders that arise from restricted or habituallypoor movement. But as a process for gaining awareness, it can expand aperson's choices and responses to many aspects of life: emotions, rela-tionships, and intellectual tasks. The Feldenkrais method holds that thereis no separation between mind and body, and thus learning to move better can improve one's overall well-being on many levels.

Healing Touch Healing touch is a practice derived from an ancient technique called layingon of hands. It is based on the premise that the healing force of the therapist affects the patient's recovery and that healing is promotedwhen the body's energies are in balance. Practitioners of healing touchbelieve that by passing their hands over the patient, healers can identifyenergy imbalances. The major effects of therapeutic touch are relaxation,pain reduction, accelerated healing, and alleviation of psychosomatic2167_Tab07_207-228.qxd 9/4/09 4:01 PM Page 224symptoms. Studies have shown that therapeutic touch also has a beneficial effect on the blood because it has the ability to raise hemoglobin values.It also affects brain waves to induce relaxation. Efficacy: Studies have shown that healing touch is effective in reducing anxiety and stress, increases the function of the immune and adrenalsystems, decreases blood pressure, improves depression and painsymptoms, increases endorphins, and improves cognition. Homeopathy Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine first defined by SamuelHahnemann in the 18th century. A central thesis of homeopathy is that anill person can be treated using a substance that can produce, in a healthyperson, symptoms similar to those of the illness. Practitioners select treat-ments according to a patient consultation that explores the physical andpsychological state of the patient, both of which are considered importantto selecting the remedy. Claims to the efficacy of homeopathic treatmentbeyond the placebo effect are unsupported by the collective weight of scientific and clinical evidence. Efficacy: Oscillococcinum, a homeopathic remedy, has been shown to decrease length and symptoms of flu. Other remedies have reducedGI distress in children, especially diarrhea, and for arthritis. Massage Massage is the application by hand of systematic stroking or soft tissuemanipulation for therapeutic purposes, such as the relief of pain and discomfort.

Probiotics, which in Greek means \"for life,\" are products containing living microbes that assist with restoring balance between beneficial and patho-genic microflora that live in the intestinal tract. These bacteria protect thegut by interacting in the human immune system to prevent pathogenicbacterial invasion. They are used for the following: Diarrhea Other suggested preventions or duration reductions: atopic diseases in infants, allergies, common cold, influenza, healthy people withsome bowel irregularity. Contraindications: Probiotic products are not regulated by the FDA. Advise caution in unsupervised use; may interact adversely with prescribed and OTC drugs and supplements; may cause side effectsand an allergic response; long-term effects unknown. Other: Considered generally safe because normally reside in human intestine. 227 CAMProbiotics2167_Tab07_207-228.qxd 9/4/09 4:01 PM Page 227CAM 228Scientific evidence for use: A true probiotic must contain a predeter- mined dose of living, active bacteria as shown on the label and must be supported by evidence from valid and reliable clinical trials thatshow a suggested benefit. Research is ongoing to show effects ofprobiotic products with colon cancer, other causes of diarrhea orinfections in the digestive system, heart disease, other cancers, lipidmetabolism, and more. 2167_Tab07_207-228.qxd 4:01 PM Page 228Abbreviation Definition ADC Vaan Dimsl229 TOOLSEquivalents 1 centimeter = 0.4 inches 1 inch = 2.5 centimeters 1 meter = 39.4 inches 1 teaspoon = 5 milliliters 1 tablespoon = 15 milliliters 1 ounce = 30 milliliters 8 ounces = 1 cup = 240 milliliters 1 quart = 946 milliliters 1 grain (gr) =60 milligrams 30 grams = 1 ounce 1 gram = 15 grains 1000 micrograms = 1 milligram 1000 milligrams = 1 gram Abbreviations for Tests (EKG, MRI)L\u2014Laboratory tests ContinuedMany healthcare facilities have a specific list of abbreviations that are acceptable.
