When she got pregnant, she wanted the same for her child, Emery. The 39-year-old from Malagash, N.S. developed this desire into a hobby, making homemade diaper creams and other all-natural balms. \"I love making something from nothing and decided to take an aromatherapy certification in order to learn what essential oils were safe for me and the baby and how to create creams and balms,\" she said. \"After all, our skin is the largest organ on our body.\" After reading up on ingredient lists for diaper creams, Creighton knew she had to take matters into her own hands, she said. \"I was also cloth diapering and not many diaper creams were cloth diaper friendly,\" she explained. \"I knew the ingredients I wanted to use and, through trial and error, created a diaper balm for Emery. \"It worked wonders, healing any rash in one application. I was hooked.\" Turning hobby into business Creighton is a single mother and, as Emery got bigger, Creighton decided to turn her hobby into a small business called Emerything Baby. \"People started purchasing the balm and using it on themselves ... and it worked,\" she said. \"For razor burns, for bug bites for yeast rashes. For excessively dry skin. Even for eczema. \"I had one mother tell me she'd tried all the creams for her daughter, even those prescribed by her doctor ... and only my balm worked. I get very excited every single time I hear about a product working well for someone. I still can't believe I get to make natural, organic and safe products that really work and are safe for moms and babies.\" Creating and selling the products has been an interesting and fulfilling learning curve for Creighton. \"I enjoy the process of making my own creams, salves and balms,\" she said. \"It's calming and fills my heart.\" She uses all organic ingredients, mainly from a supplier in Montreal, Que. She began setting up a booth at the Tatamagouche Farmers' Market every couple of weekends and joined several The Mom Market markets in Halifax and Moncton. Her business was growing, so she transferred her company, Emerything Baby, into a little store-front boutique. \"It's equipped with a family wellness studio that offers classes to support education, mental, physical and emotional health and community,\" described Creighton. \"My hobby of making my own organic balms and creams birthed this entire company.\" The boutique also carries products from several local vendors across the Maritimes. However, inflation is starting to hit Creighton's production, something many small businesses are feeling the heat of. \"I've tried to keep my pricing affordable, but with container pricing doubling in cost and things like organic olive oil jumping from $17 to $24 without notice, it's getting more and more difficult to swallow the extra costs,\" she said. Dahlia Merlo is a dedicated customer of Creighton's, having discovered her business through a post-partum gift she received. \"It was a lovely basket filled with products for mama and baby and I fell in love with each one,\" said Merlo. \"It felt like a very luxurious gift at a time where I myself did not feel so luxurious.\" The 35-year-old from Montreal has tried a variety of Creighton's homemade organic products, including body butter, hand cream, lip balm, all-purpose balm, magnesium cream, post-partum bath soak and post-partum tea. \"I've really enjoyed using all of them,\" she said. \"My favourites are definitely the body butter, lip balm, all-purpose balm and the magnesium cream. I recommend them to friends. \"I use the products mostly on myself, but I also use the magnesium cream and all-purpose balm on my son, who is now one year old. I love that I understand what's on the ingredient list and I don't need a science degree to figure out what I'm putting on mine and my son's bodies.\" Creighton hopes to continue growing her business. \"I'd one day like to turn my boutique and family wellness studio into larger facilities spread across Canada, equipped with safe spaces for children and caregivers alike,\" she said. \"Spaces that support your needs in a healthy way. That fill caregivers and children's cups.\" With a small business that bloomed from a curious hobby, Creighton strongly encouraged others to try any and all hobbies that pique their interest. \"For anyone starting up a hobby and maybe turning it into a passion that fuels your world, ensure it aligns with your core values,\" she advised. \"If it does? Do it. Do it today. Life is too short. Lead with your heart and leap.\" (This is the third in a series.) "}
