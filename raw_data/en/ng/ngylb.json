Many promising candidates identified through virtual screening and preclinical studies fail in clinical trials due to poor efficacy or lack of improvement in the standard of care. Instead, a target-centric approach, based on the repurposing of safe compounds with known mode of action (MoA), offers many advantages. First, alternative indications (diseases) with high medical need and market potential are identified for a given target, by linking information about the MoA, disease state, and patient populations obtained from large public and proprietary datasets. Subsequently, suitable disease models are chosen (e.g. by literature mining), and therapeutics are fast-tracked for approval, thus limiting the risk of failure. The aim of this project is to develop and integrate novel machine learning methods, with emphasis on explainability of the predicted outcome, to improve the overall performance of Boehringer Ingelheim's drug repurposing pipeline. Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow '21Topic: A bioinformatics journey: from EHR to genetic dataProject Summary: As a postdoc at Yale Center for Biomedical Data Science, Xiayuan is going to work on high-throughput biomedical data, including electronic health records (EHRs) and genetic data. His research will focus on extending state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in health using EHRs, developing machine learning algorithms for drug discovery and adverse drug effects, and applying statistical methods to investigate the challenging problems in genetic data. Based on his PhD research, he believes family history linked EHRs succinctly encompasses shared genetic, epigenetic, and environmental features which enhance the analysis of human disease. He plans to apply machine learning algorithms in healthcare domain, such as disease risk prediction, precision medicine and clinical applications using family history linked EHRs. From the perspective of genetic data, his research work is devoted to addressing challenging problems in single-cell RNA sequencing data, developing innovative statistical models on analyzing the impact of genetic variants in human disease. Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow '21Topic: Identify brain functional subnetworks and associated genetic vulnerabilities with comorbid mental disordersProject Summary: Emerging evidence indicates that 1) boundaries of psychiatric illnesses are not sharp with behavioral traits and brain function; 2) individual behavioral differences are linked to variability in functional brain networks. These suggest that the spectra of symptom profiles observed in patients may arise through discernible patterns of functional connectome, with the disturbance of individual systems preferentially contributing to domain-specific, but disorder-general, impairments. Meanwhile, gene transcription could strongly correlate with network topography, potentially driving comorbidity between symptomatically related disorders. Hence, our overarching goal is to identify brain functional network fingerprints, link them to dimensional symptom profiles, and characterize the associated genetic underpinnings through a suite of powerful, biologically plausible and computationally efficient statistical models. Successful completion of this research will discover network-level biomarkers and associated genetic vulnerabilities, and facilitate the development of novel treatments and future classification schemes. Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow '22Topic: Multi-omics Analytics and Emerging TechnologiesProject Summary: Graph genome-based models can characterize genetic variation across both microbial organisms and diverse regions of the human genome. We aim to investigate whether these models can also be used to characterize the extensive genetic diversity observed within immunogenetic sequencing datasets (e.g., B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing). We will develop graph-based approaches to 1) analyze high-throughput immunogenetic sequencing (e.g., BCR repertoire profiling) and 2) perform genetic association tests focused phenotypes related to the host immune response to vaccines, infection, therapeutics developed by Boehringer Ingelheim, and autoimmune diseases. We will also assess whether graph structure/topology is clinically informative and, by annotating regions across the graph using external multi-modal data, assess whether annotated genome graphs can facilitate immunogenetic-focused genome-wide association studies. Yale-Boehringer Multimodal network-based cancer heterogeneity analysisProject Summary: In the past decade, the maturity of profiling techniques has led to the discovery that previously defined cancer types/subtypes, which is based on pathological images, can be further classified into sub-subtypes. This refined classification has different omics landscapes and clinical paths and demand different treatment strategies. Accordingly, the first guiding principle of this study is that effectively integrating multimodal data, in particular pathological imaging and multi-omics data, can lead to more refined cancer heterogeneity structures. In heterogeneity analysis, incorporating the interconnections among variables can future reveal more subtle cancer heterogeneity structures. As such, the second guiding principle is that utilizing cutting-edge methods to incorporate interconnections can further improve cancer heterogeneity analysis. Our overarching goal is to develop more effective statistical learning methods for cancer heterogeneity analysis, which can deepen our understanding of cancer biology and facilitate more personalized treatment. Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow '22Topic: Multi-omics Analytics and Emerging TechnologiesProject Summary: Recent effort has been made in using CRISPR knockout or activating to screening target to boost T cell effector function and further leverage the immune killing function. However, the manipulating of a single gene might still be hard to overcome the resistance due to genes that can compromise its function in immune cell signaling. Paralogs derived from the same ancestors are reported with synthetic lethal interactions, which might function jointly in augmenting cancer immunity. In this project, we will establish a computational model for predicting paralogs pairs that can team up their function in cancer immunotherapy, by integrating genome-wide CRISPR screens perturbation molecular profiles from Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) and Connectivity Map (CMap), and cancer datasets with patients receiving immunotherapy. The outcome of this research will deliver in silico tools for screening paralog pairs that can boost immune response, which could inspire effective combination therapeutic strategies toward precision treatment. Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow '22Topic: Mechanism-based identification of biomarkers and intervention targets from multi-omics datasets Project Summary: Recent technological advances allowing for the global characterization of genomic variants, transcription profiles, epigenomic profiles, and protein markers, often down to the single-cell level, have provided unprecedented insights into the homeostatic and perturbed states of biological systems. Analyzing these vast multi-omics datasets to obtain clinically actionable biomarkers and promising intervention targets remains a formidable challenge. Prediction of the individual immune response quality and quantity in health and disease is one quintessential case. Our proposed research will combine statistical analyses with causal inference and multi-scale mathematical modeling to develop a multi-omics data analysis pipeline that (a) provides mechanistic insights into the underlying biological process, (b) captures the diversity seen across individuals, and (c) identifies complex features and rules that are predictive of the response to perturbations. We will apply our approach to datasets characterizing the vaccination response to identify predictive biomarkers and intervention targets to improve vaccine efficacy. Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow '23Topic: Moving from GWAS to Casual Genes and Variants Project Summary: The size and ethnic diversity of emerging sequencing datasets are growing rapidly. Combining these data with emerging single cell omic datasets and AI models for predicting gene activity (eg: expression) offers an unprecedented opportunity to uncover the causal genes and cell types that drive human traits and disease. However, in emerging sequencing datasets, the strong, often perfect, linkage among associated ultra-rare variants can yield an unwieldy list of candidate causal variants. This problem is exacerbated by the presence of multiple causal variants (allelic heterogeneity) and migration events, both of which are more common in ethnically diverse datasets. This fine mapping enigma motivates our current research. Using novel statistical methods, we aim to develop an automated yet interpretable approach that does not seek to isolate causal variants, but rather to directly identify target genes and pathways from phenotypic and single cell xQTL data across different cohorts. Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow '23Topic: Moving from GWAS to Casual Genes and Variants Project Summary: Genome-wide association studies have revealed many disease-associated variants, but identifying causal variants is challenging. This proposal aims to address this by developing deep learning models to predict regulatory effects of variants based on massively parallel reporter assay data. By exploring how these functional predictions relate to genomic signatures of natural selection across evolutionary timescales and disease categories, it will assess when evolutionary constraint can serve as an informative proxy for regulatory function in interpreting GWAS. The predictive models and constraint maps will then be applied to nominate likely causal variants from GWAS of autoimmune and metabolic diseases. This research will nominate candidate causal variants across diverse human ancestry groups, advancing understanding of the precise regulatory mechanisms disrupted in common human diseases. Overall, this proposal develops and applies integrative genomic methods to elucidate complex disease genetics. Yale-Boehringer Ingelheim Biomedical Data Science Fellow '23Topic: Multi-omics Analytics for Personalized Medicine Project Summary: First, we will develop a framework that integrates single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq, high-resolution data to identify tissue microenvironments. By utilizing network-based variable selection and regression of cell morphology, we will aggregate selected features using cell adjacency matrices to cluster tissue areas into microenvironments. This multi-modal integration promises to uncover new microenvironment characteristics for targeted therapeutics. Second, we will focus on identifying disease progression-associated changes in tissue microenvironments. Using known biomarker genes, we will differentiate microenvironments and assess disease severity and progression. We will analyze changes in cell compositions, expression profiles, gene regulatory networks, and cell-cell communication networks. Deconvolved spatial transcriptomics and causal network approaches will aid in constructing gene regulatory networks, while Connectome and graph attention network methods will establish cell-cell communication networks. Correlations with disease progression will be examined independently and combined using neural networks to gain a comprehensive understanding for precise therapeutic development.

Assistant Professor of GeneticsSteven Reilly received his B.S. in Biology from Carnegie Mellon University in 2009. Motivated by the rapid emergence of new technologies to map the full epigenomes, he joined Jim Noonan's Lab in the Genetics Department of Yale School of Medicine. There he built gene regulatory maps of the developing human, rhesus, and mouse cortex to identify changes underlying unique aspects of human brain morphology and cognitive abilities. Steve received his Ph.D. in 2015 and then joined the laboratory of Pardis Sabeti at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT to interrogate the function of genetic variants at the intersection of natural selection and human disease. As evolutionary adaptive genetic variants have been shown to underlie diversity in disease risk and morphology across human populations, the lens of evolution remains a powerful, yet underutilized method for understanding human biology He is specifically interested in furthering our understanding of non-coding variation, the main cache of human genetic diversity. The has created novel machine-learning methods to predict the subset of human variants under selection that are functional, and experimental methods to characterize variants in a massively parallel fashion. Steve has developed endogenous CRISPR perturbation methods and synthetic DNA technologies coupled with genomic readouts to directly assess the cellular phenotypes of non-coding alleles. Steve joined the Yale Department of Genetics as an Assistant Professor in September, 2021. The Reilly lab develops and applies new high-throughput experimental approaches to interrogate the genome, such as non-coding CRISPR screens and the Massively Parallel Reporter Assay. Computationally, we also develop machine-learning approaches to predict the functions of these CRE perturbations. Together with these new tools, we use evolution as a powerful lens for characterizing genomic signals of positive selection that impact modern human phenotypes and diseases. The lab has three main foci: Developing new, large-scale experimental screens to perturb CREs, and new computational tools to model their functionIdentifying evolutionary adaptive alleles likely impacting modern human phenotypesApplying these functional genomic tools to phenotypically interesting loci important for human disease and evolution.
