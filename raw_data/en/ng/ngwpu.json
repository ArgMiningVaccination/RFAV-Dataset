Read Full LicensePage 2/37Abstract Purpose We examined the impact of using a probiotic containing three different Lactobacilli(3L) on the gut microbiome of rats following cyclophosphamide (CTX) treatment. CTX corresponded to chemotherapy which is used for human cancer treatment and known to have adversive effects on the immune system. Methods We conducted our experiment with ten rats in \u0000ve different experimental groups which included control, CTX treated, and then low, medium, and high probiotic treatment with CTX treatment. Of these ten rats in each group, we sequenced the stool of three of them using both ITS and 16S sequencing. We then went on to examine the taxonomic composition of these samples to determine whether probiotic treatment helped the rat's microbiome return to similar structure as the control rats. Results We used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to generate sequencing data from microbial genomic DNA libraries, which is useful for testing the effects of 3L on bacteria and fungi. Microbiome analysis, phylogenetic and classi\u0000cation reports, and community data have all backed up the experiments and \u0000ndings that 3L had a signi\u0000cant positive impact on the microbiome. Furthermore, the effect on speci\u0000c metabolic pathways aids in deriving the study's conclusion (use of 3L in chemotherapy) to the mode of action, mechanistically by correcting microbiota composition and enhancing speci\u0000c gut metabolic functions. Conclusions Through experimental results using an in vivo model, we suggested the role of novel natural probiotics 3L, 3 Lactobacilli in the establishment of a strong and sustainable bene\u0000cial healthy gut \u0000ora, after CTX chemotherapy. We suggested some new adjuvants to chemotherapy as drugs + lactobacillus treament using the rat CTX model (immunosuppression caused by cyclophosphamide). Furthermore, in numerous studies that reported the use of probiotics involving Lactobacillusin post-chemo or post-surgical procedures, we proposed a new probiotic formulation (L. acidophilus + L. casei + L. plantarum) to be further studied and explored in the prevention of health condition loss by alteration of the general immune system. Introduction Various research challenges are critical for the cancer care continuum and \u0000nding treatment at various levels of the most threatening disease to human health [1]. Following an accumulation of mutational, genetic, and epigenetic alterations, abnormal cells begin to divide without control and soon form a mass of extra-tissue (or tumor) that can spread to the entire body through bloodstream and lymph and becomes deadly [2-5]. Disease-speci\u0000c mutational events can serve as reliable cancer biomarkers for diagnosis [6-7], which is especially important given that human cells can develop multiple types of primary cancerous tumors [8- 10]. However, the high diversity of genetic mutations in mitochondrial DNA, non-coding RNA, microRNA, ubiquitin, RNA editing, peptide mutation, spliceosome and/or RNA splicing, and phenotype-speci\u0000city of drug sensitivity, which is largely dependent on tumor-stroma interactions, are reasons for cancer treatment di\u0000culties [11-18]. The effects of radiation, nanomedicine, nanoparticles, extracellular vesicle bioengineering, gene therapy, thermal ablation, and particularly immunotherapy and chemotherapy on the treatment of cancer have thus been the subject of numerous studies [19-22]. Cancer treatment has given special focus to immunotherapy, or the increase of T cells' ability for antigen-directed toxicity [23]. This is also important since, in addition to the disease's targeting of the immune system, anticancer strategies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy also negatively affect it [24-26]. Chemotherapy in particular is the cancer treatment most likely to impair immunity and cause neutropenia [27-28]. Chemotherapy is used to treat cancer cells that divide quickly, but it also affects many healthy cells in the body, including neutrophils, making it di\u0000cult to treat infections while receiving chemotherapy [29]. This makes any strategy to try dealing with the preservation of immune system for chemotherapy extremely relevant.Page 3/37Similar to radiotherapy, \"chemo\" has a temporary effect on the immune system, and after a few months, one may regain normal or almost normal immune functioning depending on the type of treatment, how long it lasts, and other variables including smoking, age, and general patient health problems [30]. As described for cyclophosphamide, or cyclophosphane, an antineoplastic in chemicals known as Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) used to treat various forms of cancers from lymphoma to sarcoma, and to suppress the immune system, in a manner similar to aging, chemotherapy is thought to shorten lifespan due to medical complications like heart disease, pulmonary \u0000brosis and/or endocrine system-related disease [31-32]. The drug cyclosphosphamide, commonly known as Neosar\u00ae or Cytoxan\u00ae (CTX), is also used in veterinary medicine [33], making the study it undertook a good illustration of how human and animal medicine can complement one another in cancer research. More than half of all cancer patients receive ionizing radiation therapy, which results in late in\u0000ammatory reactions and/or over time, especially with high dose rate radiation, the patient's immune system may develop disorders linked to in\u0000ammation [34]. Cyclophosphamide-chemotherapy, which is likely used to treat the other half of cancer cases, has the potential to have negative effects on the lungs, most frequently manisfesting as diffuse alveolar destruction [35]. When the dose of CTX is increased, there is a risk that chemotherapeutic resistance will develop [36]. After using CTX for a long time, there is even a risk of developing another cancer, and CTX-chemo is known to permanently affect the growth of neurons and sensory abilities [37-38]. Concerns about immune system modi\u0000cation and cell transplantation are yet another signi\u0000cant CTX-related source of worry. In allogeneic hematopoietic blood-forming stem cell transplants, post-transplant CTX changes immunological markers and results in poorer T cell reconstitution [39]. Finding novel approaches to continue using radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, which are essential to promoting T cell lymphocyte activity in order to treat the disease, while preserving the patient's natural barriers and immune functions to \u0000ght other infections and/or preserve stem cells in case of transplantation, is thus one of the most di\u0000cult challenges for cancer research [40-46]. The idea of employing complementary and/or alternative, more natural medicine to treat cancer is not new; microbe mediated tumor therapy, which treats cancer by injecting bacteria nearby, is well known [47]. However, microbe-based approaches may be increasing popularity in our contemporary modern lifestyles. Bacteria-mediated tumor therapy has been practiced for more than a century. Nowadays, it looks as simple as that; the good bacteria move to the tumor and multiply there, activating the patient's immune system [48]. But things might be trickier than that. Microbiological studies show that the gut microbiota is necessary for the effectiveness of CTX-chemotherapy [49]. Therefore, understanding how the CTX drug affects the gut microbiota and immune system and how the gut and immune system can be protected from chemotherapy remain critical. Given the relationship between the immune system and the gut, gut bacteria (or micro\u0000ora) have also emerged as a key target for enhancing T cells and in\u0000uencing the effectiveness of cancer therapies [50-51]. It has been proven through the use of several cancer model studies that a healthy gut \u0000ora signi\u0000cantly affects the effectiveness of anticancer medications like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), CTX and other phosphamide chemical drugs [52-55]. The current Lactobacillus study is comparable to any commercially available probiotic preparation, such as L. rhamnosus, which is known to limit the growth of cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner [56]. In terms of enhancing the gut microbiota and preventing tumor genesis, it is comparable to L. rhamnosus GG, the microbe model of cancer that has been the subject of the most research [56-59]. In this novel and di\u0000cult research area, which mostly focuses on colon cancer, an uniform 'probiotic' strategy is intended to prevent patient selection in light of the various chemical treatments and unique host responses to gut modi\u0000cation [60]. Because of this, we eventually developed a unique 3L Lactobacillus bioproduct for use in medicine, which is a natural combination of L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. plantarum. It has been shown that this product (\"3L\") signi\u0000cantly improves the physiological and biochemical state of hyperlipidemic animals. In mice, \"3L\" has been shown to signi\u0000cantly reduce blood lipid levels, cholesterolemia, the LDL/HDL ratio, and weight gain in addition to promoting healthy gut \u0000ora [61-62]. Rodents are the best models for examining diseases linked to obesity and metabolic problems in humans [63]. They are also excellent research subjects for investigations into immunology and immunotherapy for human cancer [64]. As a result, we used \u0000ve different groups of rats as our experimental models to investigate the effects of 3L on intestinal gut \u0000ora and CTX chemotherapy, as a prelude to a more comprehensive examination of the effect of 3L on the immune system. In this pilot experiment, we examined the gut microbiota following chemotherapy using Illumina MiSeq sequencing that is optimized for full complete microbial genome applications. Our results showed that CTX treatment considerably altered the composition of the microbiome. This is related to a prior study using the same groups of rats, which revealed that treatment withPage 4/37CTX altered the immune system [65]. The rats we used in this pilot experiment were healthy rats that received the chemical substance cyclophosphamide CTX; they were not sick or malignant. Three doses were tested: low (L), medium (M), and high (H) on the microbiome of chemotherapy rat models because the effects on leukocytes, T helper cells, interleukins, and TNF-alpha were dose-dependent [65]. With regard to the group of animals treated from one week to one month (28 days) with the high dose of Lactobacillus preparation (H-dose: 5 mg/kg), as opposed to the group of animals given CTX alone, white blood cells counts in particular rose [65]. Then, we looked at how 3L and chemotherapy affected the intestinal gut \u0000ora and health of CTX-injured rats. The overall results of the Lactobacillus+CTX chemotherapy treatment were favorable to a degree that had not previously been noted. The microbial gut \u0000ora signi\u0000cantly improved when the dose of 3L (acidophilus, casei, and plantarum) was increased. Using a microecosystem like these three Lactobacilli did not treat cancer in the rats we utilized since they were normal, not tumor or cancer model animals. However, despite CTX, which is chemotherapy used to treat tumors, it helped to enhance intestinal health. A pharmacological bioproduct rich in three Lactobacillus strains has been reported to considerably support a healthy gut microbiome despite CTX treatment (chemotheray). In order to prevent a chemotherapy-induced changed gut, we suggest a new bioactive microbial natural medicinal product that will \u0000rst be evaluated in sick malignant rats and later on humans. This medicine may be used to cure tumors or cancer or, at the very least, prevent the altered gut caused by CTX chemotherapy. Materials And Methods Lactobacillus preparation for medical-industrial use. We previously developped a three-strain lactobacillus probiotic formula (3L) to combat cholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia [62-63]. Our Industrial Laboratory platform for natural medicine in Jinan (Shandong Province, P.R. China) produced the same probiotic formula used in this study against gut and immune damages in cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (L. acidophilus SD65, L. casei SD07, and L. plantarum SD02). Following Yue et al. (2014) [62], pure cultures of the three bacterial strains were grown in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar liquid medium and placed in an anaerobic workstation held at 37\u00b0C (industrial platform). Each strain's bacterial cells were harvested for 3L preparation by centrifugation at 2000 \u00d7 g for 20 min (4\u00b0C). Each strain's cell pellet was resuspended in sterile saline water solution at a concentration of 109 CFU/ml and stored at 4\u00b0C. The tripartite L probiotic solution (3L) was freshly prepared by mixing equal volumes of cold suspensions of SD65, SD07, and SD02 and stored in cold conditions (4~10\u00b0C) for later use. Rats were given a daily dose (0.3 ml) of bioproducts administered intra-gastrically via a stainless-steel needle, along with chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, CTX; Fig. 1). Preparation of \u0000ve groups in a CTX-induced immunosuppression model in rats. Jinan Pengyue Laboratory Animal Company supplied the rats (Product license SCXK (LU) 20140007). In our laboratory, the rats were bred in the Class II clean animal facility of the Institute of Medicine (Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences) with the setting temperature of 20-26\u00b0C (relative humidity: 40- 70%, ventilation rate 15 times/hour). They all passed the quarantine inspection (Laboratory animal use license No.: STXK(LU)20170003, issued by Shandong Provincial Department of Science and Technology). The feed and drinking bottle were replaced every two-three days or if necessary. Fifty healthy Speci\u0000c Pathogen Free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were divided into \u0000ve experimental groups (N=50 males, young adults, 8-9 weeks old; body weight: ~260-316 g): 1) Control healthy (CK), 2) Immune attacked (IM), 3) Immune attacked and treated with low Lactobacillus dosage of 1.25 ml/kg bodyweight (L), 4) Immune attacked and treated with middle Lactobacillus dosage of 2.5 ml/kg bodyweight (M), and 5) Immune attacked and treated with high Lactobacillus dosage of 5.0 ml/kg bodyweight (H). The total number of rats studied was 50, with 10 rats in each group (Fig. 1). They were fed in two \u0000ve-rat cages (feeding density: 5/cage). Four rats in each cage were labeled with neutral red on the head, neck, back, and tail. The \u0000fth rat was unmarked. Before the experiment, each group was given an equal volume of animal drinking water, and 5.0 ml/kg of animal drinking water was supplemented before gavage). The control rats (CK group) were given a continuous gastric perfusion of normal saline (NS). The immune system of rats in groups 2-5 was attacked by an intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (CTX, 10 mg/ml). Another study using the same experimental design looked at the effects of CTX on the immune system of rats [65]. This companion study highlighted the negative effects of CTX cyclophosphamide chemotherapy on the rat immune system as wells as the bene\u0000cial effects of Lactobacillus preparation on cyclophosphamide- induced immunosuppression [65]. Following the \u0000ndings from Zhang et al. (2020) on CTX chemotherapy and immunodepression in rats [65], the current experiment on chemotherapy and microbiome was followed for approximately 28 days (D28). CTX was only administered to \"nude\" rats on day 1, 5, 8, 15, and 22 (IM group; Fig. 1). On each of the \u0000ve shots, CTX was injected intraperitoneally at a dosage volume of 4 ml/kg. The control group received saline shots of the same volume. The 3L preparation was administeredPage 5/37via gavage, which is a tube that runs from the mouth to the stomach. \"Covered\" rats received a 3L continuous gastric perfusion in NS (1.25 ml/kg, low dose, L group; 2.50 ml/kg, middle dose, M group; 5.0 ml/kg, high dose, H group; Fig. 1). L, M, and H, like IM, corresponded to \u0000ve CTX injections chemotherapy (Fig. 1). In each rat group, feces were collected every day. Fresh fecal samples were collected for analysis on D28. Feces were collected with sterile disposable plastic spoon (SteriPlast sample spoon) and placed in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube that had been sterilized. Fecal samples from the control CK, IM, L, M and H groups were stored at -80\u00b0C until DNA extraction, Illumina MiSeq Sequencing, and microbiome pro\u0000ling comparisons between the \u0000ve groups (Fig. 1). Preparation of microbial genomic DNA samples for Illumina MiSeq. DNA was extracted from the \u0000ve groups of rats (CK, IM, L, M, and H) in the chemotherapy model using the method previously selected for mice and piglet fecal microbiome analysis [62, 66]. This method was dependable for fecal DNA sample testing, quantity, purity, and quality control, as well as Illumina sequencing [66]. As described in Yue et al. (2020) [66], 2.0 g of fecal samples from Group CK-H rats were processed for microbial genomic DNA Fast DNA Stool MiniKit GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and used as template (10 ng) in PCR reactions employing universal primers. For 16S samples 5'-ACTCCTCGGGAGGCAGCA-3' and 806R 5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT 3' (Personal The primers ITS5F 5'- GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3' and ITS1R 5'-GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC-3' (Personal Biotechnology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China) were used in PCR reactions for ITS (ITS1, 250 bp, Miseq-PE250). Each Illumina sequencing sample corresponded to three rats from the same group. Consequently, \u0000fteen biological samples were tested in each group of rats during microbiome analysis in relation to CTX chemotherapy, so we conducted individuals, replicates, and comparison groups. Prior to sequencing, ITS and 16S rDNA products (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) were ampli\u0000ed in a Takara Master Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara, Dalian, China) programmed for an initial denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a \u0000nal extension of 72\u00b0C for 7 min. Q5\u00ae high-\u0000delity DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, was used for group's PCR products or amplicons a 2 percent agarose gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Beijing, China) and a gel recovery kit (Axygen\u00ae, AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit, New York, USA). The PCR product concentration was determined in a microplate reader sequencing by Illumina was used to generate sequencing data from microbial genomic DNA libraries for chemotherapy+bioproduct research. We used the same Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA LT Library Prep Kit used gut microbiota MiSeq's goal was to add adapter sequences to the ends of microbial DNA fragments in order to generate indexed libraries for single- and paired-end reads [68]. To begin, rat fecal microbial genomic DNA amplicons were subjected to terminal end repair. End Repair module (Mix2) excised the 5'-end of DNA and replaced it with a phosphate group. Meanwhile, the 3'- end's missing base was \u0000lled. To prevent self-ligation, an adenosine base was added to the 3'-end of each microbial DNA sequence. This also ensured that the sequencing linker was properly linked to each DNA target sequence. To immobilize DNA in \u0000ow cells, a sequencer corresponding to a library-speci\u0000c tag (Index Sequence) was added to the 5'-end of the PCR amplicons. To purify the microbial library system, self-ligated fragments removed using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, Illkirch, France). PCR amplicons were used as a template in a second-PCR run to enrich the libraries as much as possible for the DNA of interest. The PCR conditions were the same as described in the section on preparing microbial genomic DNA samples were puri\u0000ed using the Beckman magnetic beads screening method and analyzed by 2 percent agarose gel electrophoresis. Prior to high-throughput sequencing, the quality of each rat fecal microbial genomic DNA library was checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer with an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Waldbronn, Germany). On Agilent check, each DNA library produced only a single peak and no joints. The sequence librairies were then quanti\u0000ed using the Quanti\u0000uor \u0000uorescence quantitative system (Promega Corporation, Madison, USA). The concentration of the library was greater than 2 nM. DNA samples were mixed after serial dilutions, and sequenced. IlluminaPage 6/37MiSeq a MiSeq Sequencer (Illumina Next Generation) to perform two-end sequencing with 2 x 300 bp reading length. The target DNA fragment's optimal sequencing length was between 200 and 450 bp. Based on primers and barcode information, reading sequences were identi\u0000ed and assigned to the corresponding samples. USEARCH (v5.2.236, http://www.drive5.com/usearch) was used to remove all chimeric sequences (or artifacts formed by incorrectly joined sequences) [69]. QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology, v1.8.0, http://qiime.org) was used to identify unreliable sequences (replication errors, nucleotide base substitutions, insert deletions, and so on) for microbial genomic DNA [70]. Sequences with more than one base mismatch and/or more than eight consecutive identical bases were discarded [69-71]. Other sequences were classi\u0000ed into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), which were then used for microbial DNA taxonomic identi\u0000cation and phylogenetic analysis [72]. The diversity level of each sample was assessed using OTU values, and the depth of sequencing (enhanced microbial community analysis) was demonstrated using rarefaction curve analysis [73]. The composition of the \u0000ve samples corresponding to the \u0000ve rat groups (CK-H) was examined at different taxonomic levels: phylum, order, class, family, genus, and species (i.e. complete microbiome; Fig. 1). Tables, box plots and histograms were used to display the microbiome results (OTU, 100%; R software). Rare OTUs (with an abundance proportion of less than 0.001%) were excluded from microbiome analysis [74]. Venn diagrams in R (Treat*/2.5.1_Venn) were used to display shared and unique OTUs within each group (as calculated by R). Rarefaction curves were drawn to re\u0000ect the microbial diversity among samples using an OTU abundance matrix to study complete microbial structure in each group. Speci\u0000cally, we compared the number of OTUs in \u0000ve different groups of rats (CK-H) at the same sequencing depth and justify the level of diversity in each sample (QIIME2, alpha rarefaction curve). The length of the curve re\u0000ects the number of sample sequencing depths; the longer the curve, the greater the sequencing depth, which increases the likelihood of observing increased microbial diversity. The slope of the curve re\u0000ects the effect of sequencing depth on the sample's microbial diversity. A rarefaction curve with a \u0000at slope indicates that the sequencing results are su\u0000cient to re\u0000ect microbial diversity and that increasing sequencing depth will not detect more novel OTUs. A bump rarefaction curve (high slope) indicates that the diversity has not been exhausted, and that increasing sequencing depth could aid in the detection of more OTUs (Treat*/2.3.2_arare). We also measured \"Specaccum\" (species accumulation curve) in \u0000ve groups of chemotherapy-treated rats and 3L. Specaccum, like the rarefaction curve, indicates the extent of increase in microbial community richness with increasing sample size [75]. We estimated whether the sample size was su\u0000cient to re\u0000ect the different underlying bacterial communities of the different groups or samples using R's specaccum function. Using R in vegan (S3 method; Treat*/2.3.3_specaccum), the specaccum species accumulation curve was plotted for the total number of OTUs in each sample from the OTU abundance matrix [76]. Furthermore, the rank abundance curve (RAC) was used to determine the number of highly abundant versus rare OTUs in each community [77]. For RAC, OTU values were sorted and transformed into Log2 data in R (Treat*/2.3.4_rabund). Other multiple indices were used to assess microbial alpha diversity in different rat groups. Using QIIME software (QIIME 2) in R, we included the Chao1 index and ACE index to re\u0000ect community richness, and Shannon-Simpson indices to re\u0000ect both evenness and richness of the bacterial community in each of the \u0000ve groups of rats related to cancer chemotherapy and lactobacillus treatment (CK-H) [71- 77]. Multiple statistical analysis tools (Metastats) in Mothur software (http://metastats.cbcb.umd.edu) were used to analyze the differences in gut \u0000ora structure and related microbial species between the groups, providing the sequence difference (or absolute abundance) of two samples/groups based on P and Q values [78]. Composition analysis included OTU number analysis of each taxonomic level. According to OTU classi\u0000cation results, we analyzed the OTU number of every sample at each taxonomic level (Kingdom, Phyllum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species). The results were plotted as a histogram by R language. OTU number of groups and individual samples was shown at each taxonomic level. The ordinate showed the relative abundance of each taxon, the longer the bar means the higher the relative abundance of the corresponding taxon in the sample. To show the differences in the composition of taxa between samples (groups and individual samples), the abundance difference between \u0000ve groups and \u0000fteen samples was compared one by one, and whether the difference was signi\u0000cant was determined by statistical test (Metastats analysis, Mothur Software) [79]. A heatmap [80] was used this descriptive study to show fungal microbial taxa clustering based on the abundance of each taxon in \u0000ve groups and \u0000fteen individual samples related to chemotherapy and Lactobacillus treatment in rats. The relative abundance of each taxon in each sample was used to create a microbial species heatmap (Treat*/2.2.1_taxa). The relative abundance values were all log transformed to reduce the degree of difference. If the taxon's relative abundance is 0, half of the minimum abundance value will be substituted for it. As a result, heatmaps were created using the R sofware package \"gplots\" of sofware R, and the distance algorithm is \"euclidian\", and the clustering method is \"complete\", as used by Yue et al. (2020) on curing piglets [66, 80].Page 7/37LEfSe was used to calculate the difference in community composition between groups based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size. LDA is combined with Krustal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests in LEfSe analysis to identify key biomarkers (i.e, key community members) [81]. The Galaxy Online Analysis Platform was used for sample group comparison and visual analysis results for LefSe analysis (http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy; Treat*/2.5.5_LEfSe). Sequence denoising or clustering. The primary tasks carried out the DADA2 method are priming, quality \u0000ltering, denoise, Mosaic, and chimera removal [82]. Instead of clustering based on similarity, it now only uses dereplication, or 100% similarity clustering. The Amplicon Sequence Variants feature sequences (corresponding to the OTU representative sequences) are referred to each decontamination sequence produced by the use of DADA2 quality control, and the feature schedule is the frequency of these sequences in the sample or group of samples (corresponding to the OTU Options). The current mainstream analysis platforms (QIIME2 and VSEARCH) promote the denoising and feature sequence represented DADA2 \"the features produced by clustering methods\" in QIIME2. It is believed that the clustering analysis method was established on the basis of OTUs, which is not ideal or accurate (https://docs.qiime2.org/2019.7/tutorials/overview). DADA2 is therefore picked for analysis by default. However, the OTU clustering based VSEARCH method from Rognes et al. (2016) [83] is still an option because the aforementioned methods have not yet been optimized for all amplicon types. Priming, splicing, quality \u0000ltering, weight removal, chimera removal, clustering, and so forth are all the main components of the VSEARCH method [83]. VSEARCH is a 64-bit open source free analysis program speci\u0000cally for USEARCH. The accuracy of the software's clustering and chimera removal is superior to that of USEARCH's UPARSE algorithm [see 71, 83]. Therefore, for functional gene analysis, the VSEARCH approach was automatically chosen. Classi\u0000cation and phylogenetic analysis. OTU representative sequences were used as in construct phylogenetic trees (Newick) [84]. MEGAN [85], the abundance and taxonomic composition of OTUs in each sample were projected to the microbiological classi\u0000cation tree from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy). At each taxonomic level, hierarchical trees (GraPhlAn) were constructed using the entire sample population. Taxonomic units were distinguished by different colors in GraPhlan, and their abundance distribution was re\u0000ected by the node size, i.e. the average relative abundance of the taxonomic unit [86]. KronaTools 2.4 software was used to deliver interactive presentations of community taxonomy to groups of chemotherapy-related rats [87]. The primary goal of the \u00df-diversity analysis was to compare the similarity of community structure between the various groups. Principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and clustering analysis (CA) were used to observe differences between groups using the natural decomposition of the community data structure and sample ordination. PCA compares the similarity of samples using Euclidean distance, regardless of the original variables's possible interrelationship (R software). Before classifying the group or sample distances, nonmetric MDS only considers the size of the relationship between samples (UniFrac distance matrices of Unweighted and Weighted in R software). CA methods such as Unweighted Pair-Group Method with like Nonmetric analysis, any distance to evaluate sample similarity (QIIME-R). The T-test was used to test the Weighted and Unweighted UniFrac distance between or within groups using QIIME. 1000 Monte Carlo permutations were used to test the statistical signi\u0000cance. This fully describes the differences in \u0000ora structure size between or within groups of chemotherapy-related rat fecal samples. Finally, the massive amount of community data generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing in \u0000ve groups of rats (CK-H) necessitated the use of more statistical analyses such as Constrained Ordination and Supervised Learning. The commonly used Constrained Ordering and Supervized Learning methods, including redundancy analysis (RDA), canonical analysis (CNA), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA, Variable Importance in Projection or VIP value in R), extracted the pattern characteristics associated with the original microbial community in accordance with a known sample correlation (a sample distribution or grouping information) or a sample test indicator (continuous variable). The greater the VIP value, the greater the species's contribution to group differences. Furthermore, using QIIME software, Adonis/PERMANOVA (permutational multivariate analysis of variance) analysis was performed to determine whether the differences between groups were statistically signi\u0000cant. In terms of P value, the smaller the P value, the greater the difference between chemotherapy groups of rats. Identi\u0000cation of microbiomes and pathway abundances. Most of the current population diversity studies using 16S rRNA genes use 97% sequence similarity as the OTU threshold, which is roughly equivalent to the sequence similarity used for species identi\u0000cation in taxonomy in our descriptive study using chemotherapy rat models. The UCLUST sequence alignment tool from Edgar (2010) [71]Page 8/37was used with the QIIME sofware to merge bacterial sequences with the similarity value of 97% into speci\u0000c OTUs and select the highest abundance in each OTU as the representative bacterial sequence, as described for ITS and fungal sequences. The matrix \u0000le (i.e. OTU table) was then constructed based on OTU abundance in each sample, and this matrix \u0000le (i.e. OTU table) was transformed to BIOM (Biological Observation Matrix) \u0000le format, which was then transferred to other analysis tools. Using QIIME software with the default paramaters, the taxonomy information for each OTU was obtained by comparing the representative sequence of OTU to the template sequence of the corresponding database, as described for analysis of ITS sequences. Different types of sequences (e.g. 16S rRNA sequences of bacteria or ITS sequences of fungi) were classi\u0000ed based on the corresponding database: a) 16S rRNA gene database for bacteria (Greengenes database; Release 13.8, http://greengenes.secondgenome.com) [88], and b) ITS sequence database for fungi (UNITE database; Release 8.0, https://unite.ut.ee) [89]. In theory, all microbial sequences should be able to be classi\u0000ed into speci\u0000c species and strains. However, due to the wide variety of micro-organisms, it is di\u0000cult to include complete information on all species in the current commonly used database. Furthermore, sequencing read length limits classi\u0000cation ability. As a result, not all OTU representative sequences can obtain genus or species taxonomic information as found for ITS. The microbiome analysis was two-steps: 1) Classify-sklearn algorithm with QIIME2 (https://github.com/QIIME2/q2-feature-classi\u0000er) was used for UNITE database (release 8.0; ITS) and Greengenes database (Release 13.8; 16S). Species annotation was performed in QIIME2 software using a pre-trained Naive Bayes classi\u0000er with default parameters for each ASV/OTU representative sequence. 2) The BROCC algorithm was used for the NT database (https://github.com/kylebittinger/q2-brocc#the-brocc-algorithm) [90]. We used blastn to align the OTU sequence with the NT database (or a speci\u0000c sequence \u0000ltered from it). The brocc.py script is then called to get the comment information based on the recommended parameters. Using this procedure, for fungal ITS sequences, in the UNITE database, Candida (CUG-Ser1 clade, (Candida: C. africana/albicans sp. ; Pichia: P. aff. Alni/barkeri/bovicola sp. ). The same was done for Penicillium (formal name) and Talaromyces fungi. The International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants (ICN) mandated single name nomenclature for fungi [91]. The abandonment of dual nomenclature resulted in signi\u0000cant changes in Penicillium and Talaromyces taxonomy and nomenclature. Houbraken and Samson (2011) that species formely classi\u0000ed in the Penicillium subgenus Biverticullium are resolved monophyletic clade with the former teleomorph genus Talaromyces, but the remaining Penicillium species are associated with the younger teleomorph genus name Eupenicillium based on four phylogenies [92]. The general scienti\u0000c community working on this fungi accepted this classi\u0000cation fairly well [see 93]. Identi\u0000cation of Fusarium www.fusarium.org. (monophyletic node F3) [94]. We used the localization of the nt (2019.8 download, ftp:/ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db) database for functional genes and other requirements such as pathways identi\u0000cation in MetaCyc. The largest metabolic reference database in the life sciences with experimental data is called MetaCyc (metacyc.org). At the moment, it has 2,722 pathways from 3,009 various organisms. Information on different primary and secondary metabolic pathways, as well as associated metabolites, biochemical processes, enzymes, and genes, can be found in MetaCyc. By storing representative, experimentally veri\u0000ed metabolic pathways, it seeks to categorize all life's metabolic processes [95-97]. We can attempt to identify bacterial metabolic pathways with notable differences between groups after obtaining the abundance data for those pathways. Here, we apply the metagenomeSeq method (normalized pathway abundance). FitFeatureModel is used to \u0000t the distribution of each ASV/OTU sequence with a zero-selective log-normal model, and used to assess the signi\u0000cance of the difference. These are the analysis's \u0000ndings for differences in MetaCyc metabolic pathways between groups: Group A refers to the A group before the folder name, and group B is up-regulated relative to Group A when the value of logFC(log2(fold change)) on the horizontal axis is positive and down-regulated when it is negative. The label for the each different MetaCyc metabolic pathways is in the ordinate. Different colors indicate the level of signi\u0000cance. Finally, the species composition of the various metabolic pathways was examined using the strati\u0000ed sample metabolic pathway abundance table (PATH_abun_strat.TSV), which was based on the signi\u0000cantly different metabolic pathways. To specify the speci\u0000c metabolic pathways we the \"-f $pathway\" option when calling humann2_barplot_py. The ordinate value was set as the relative abundance, the abscissa was arranged according to the sample group, and the samples within the group were arranged according to similarity. The outcomes are presented as Figs. 7 & S13. By default, we conducted species composition analysis for MetaCyc metabolic pathways with differences. ResultsPage 9/37Microbiome comparison in rat groups in relation to chemotherapy and Lactobacillus. This descriptive study investigates the fecal microbiota of rats subjected to chemotherapy (cyclophosphamides for cancer) and signi\u0000cant health gut improvement when co- treated with a cocktail of three Lactobacillus spp. in continuation of our work on Lactobacillus/bacillus on cholesterolemia, lipidemia, diarrhea, and scour [61-62, 66]. Although the sample size is smaller (N=50), the topic is extremely important in cancer pharmacological treatments because cyclophosphamides (CTX) used against cancerous tumors are frequently found to severely damage the patient's immune system. We used rats that did not have cancer. They were healthy rats who had been severely harmed by CTX treatments (chemotherapy). The CTX-bioproduct study design includes \u0000ve different experimental groups: healthy control rats (1), treated rats (CTX chemotherapy) that were either only treated with CTX (2) or treated with CTX and a low (3), middle (4) or high (5) complement dose of Lactobacillus spp. (Figure 1). In a previous study, leukocyte concentration, CD4/CD8, interleukin, and TNF-alpha expression were measured in each group (1-5), showing that CTX has a signi\u0000cant effect on the rat immune system [see 65]. Here, the microbiome was assessed in each group (1-5) using ITS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform, suggesting that health can be maintained despite CTX when using Lactobacillus (Figures 2-5 & S1-S13 and Tables 1-2 & S1-S4). The Venn Diagram depicting the relationships between the \u0000ve groups in relation to chemotherapy and Lactobacillus suggested a relationship between healthy control and CTX + increasing dose of Lactobacillus spp. (CK and M-H; Figure S1). The position, con\u0000guration, and overlap of the circles indicating the relationships between the groups showed a gradual increase in gut \u0000ora and overall health depending on the Lactobacillus spp. complement dose (L-to-H; Figure S1). The IM group (CTX alone) was further along the bottom representing a higher number of total unique OTUs (17.24%), similarly to L dose (number of total unique OTUs: 15.82%). The Venn Diagram showed that the core microbiomes in the H and control groups were related when we looked at the number of total unique OTUs (10.52-10.82%), whereas M complement doses of Lactobacillus spp. remained too closely related to CTX alone conditions (15.07%; Figure 2A). The middle complement dose (\u00d72, two-fold) fell between the control (CK) and immune- damaged (IM) groups (Figure S1). The H-dose group was opposite the IM group, with no overlap with the control group (CK). As a result, increasing the Lactobacillus concentration (more than \u0000ve-fold) appeared to be required to produce an even more signi\u0000cant bene\u0000cial effect on the microbiome of rats treated by CTX (Figure S1). The \u0000ve groups appear to have relatively similar levels of similarity on Venn diagrams (Figure S1). All samples (three per group) and OTU numbers were consistent across the groups CK-H. In each group, approximately the same number of ITS and 16S sequences were obtained in different biological replicates (Table S1). The \u0000ve different groups obtained roughly the same sequence quantity (Table S1). There were no differences in the number of OTUs found at each taxonomic level (phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species; Tables S2 & S3). Although all of the OTUs could be classi\u0000ed, the classi\u0000cation of OTUs at different taxonomic levels in \u0000ve rat groups related to chemotherapy and Lactobacillus treatment revealed no discernible differences in OTU counting (Tables S2 & S3). This was seen in both grouped (CK, IM, L, M and S2 & S3). As a result, the sample sizes were similar, particularly for Family and Genus (Figure S2). Using the OTU table for sample diversity in PCA, rank abundance curve, NMDS, principle coordinate analysis (PcoA), Bray-Curtis distance plot (default semimetric), binary Jaccard distance matrix (metric), and UPGMA, however, H was clustered with CK. The PCA based on OTU composition revealed signi\u0000cant differences in the \u0000ve groups (Figure 2AB). At the community level, PCA revealed similarities between the chemotherapy + high lactobacillus spp. and control groups, with Fusarium, Talaromyces, Sarocladium, Aspergillus, and Mucor falling outside a common spectrum of microbe genera (Figure 2A). Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures and Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) showed Mucor and Talaromyces to be associated with ill conditions (chemotherapy alone), but a wide range of microbes to be associated with control and chemotherapy + high Lactobacillus conditions (Figure 2B). The OPLS-DA analysis showed that the distances between the CK and H groups were very small, while the L, M, and IM groups were clearly separated. Fusarium, Sarocladium, Kodamaea, Verticillium, Candida, and Chlamydomyces were among the fungi with overlapping distributions in the two groups, CK and H. Trichoderma, Acremonium, and Malassezia were more closely associated with the Lactobacillus groups H, M, and L. Pichia and Aspergillus were separated from this group but mixed with the CK control group. Microbial fungi such as Mucor and Talaromyces, as well as Xeromyces, Xerochrysium and Penicillium, were associated with CTX and the immune-damage group (Figure 2AB).Page 10/37In addition to PCA, CK-samples tended to cluster with H-, M- and L-samples in NMDS (Figure 3). The IM group differed signi\u0000cantly from the other groups, with clear mean differences between microbiomes from CTX-treated samples and those from controls (no treatment) and rats treated with Lactobacillus in addition to CTX (Bray-Curtis; Figure 3A). The NMDS graph using the Jaccard index collapsed very clear information: CK grouped with H-samples, showing mean similarities between H-microbiomes and controls (Jaccard; Figure 3B). Using PcoA as a principle analysis, the same grouping was observed, lending support to PCA and NMDS (Figure 4). Both the Bray-Curtis (abundance) and Jaccard (0/1 data) indices showed a pair of communities with comparable species richness (H and CK; Figure 4). The similarity between the CK and H samples was con\u0000rmed by unweighted and non-metric MDS analysis (UPGMA). H branches clustered with CK with a low distance value (0.005-0.0028) on the UPGMA tree (Figure S3A). There were also unweighted pairs found between M and L groups (distance value 0.031-0.111, Figure S3A; 0.003, Figure S2B). The branches representing the immune-damaged group (IM) clustered at the bottom of the tree, indicating the mean distance (or difference) of IM compared to CK, H, M, and L (Figure S3). Therefore, many of our results (PCA, PcoA, NMDS, and UPGMA) do show Lactobacillus-control clustering, but even in these plots, it is di\u0000cult to see how much closer the high Lactobacillus group is to controls when compared to IM because of the large outlier within the IM grouping (Figures 2-5 & S3). We couldn't conclude that the control and Lactobacillus groups had more microbial diversity, but in our rank abundance curve (i.e. species richness and species evenness), the IM group (CTX alone) was further along the x axis, representing a higher number of total unique OTUs (Figure S4). We used Specaccum (number of species vs number of samples) to show how species richness increased as sample size increased. The curve rapidly reached a plateau. There were no signi\u0000cant differences in species richness when increasing the number of samples (up to 12) lumped into a single analysis, which was not done on a per group basis (Figure S5). In grouped and ungrouped samples, the Chao1, Simpson, Shannon, Pielou_e, observed species and Goods_coverage indices (alpha-diversity) were calculated (Figure S6 & Table S4). These indices (Chao1, Pielou_e and observed_species) indicated that the CK and H groups had similar community richness and species evenness (Figure S6 & Table S4). The goods_coverage index showed signi\u0000cant differences between H and IM. Goods_coverage metrics at OTU levels (sample completeness, p = 0.76) showed a high level of microbial diversity in H (Figure S6 & Table S4). Mycobiome of \u0000ve different groups of rats pro\u0000led in relation to chemotherapy and Lactobacillus. Examining of individual taxon abundance using heatmaps was useful to analyze fungal taxa clustering based on the abundance of each fungus in the \u0000ve rat groups (Figures 5 & S7). A heatmap analysis of fungi revealed the relative abundance of each taxon in CK, IM, H, M, and L. In this descriptive study, Table 1 lists the various fungal taxa found in the CK, CTX, and 3L groups. From the Acaulium (syn. Scopulariopsis) genus to Xeromyces, several broad types of microbes were identi\u0000ed in the CK group (Figure 5 & Table 1). CK (control, healthy condition) had high Phallus, Xerochrysium, and Xeromyces (Figure 5 & Table 1). However, treating rats with Lactobacillus in addition to Cyclophosphamide increased relative fecal abundance of many group; Figure 5 & Table 1). As a result, among the regulated fungi are species that are not known as animal commensals or pathogens. Lecanicillium fungi are classi\u0000ed as mushrooms are big saprotrophic mushrooms [100]. However, the presence of these fungi in the rat microbiota is not necessarily suspect and may merit further investigation. The breeding history of rats takes place in the Institute of Medicine's Class II animal facility in SAMS (Speci\u0000c Free Pathogen/SPF facilities and acute hospital care settings that are designed to keep organisms in sterile environments). Saprophytic basidiomycetes are well-known wood-decaying fungi, but Phallus sequences have been found in animal penis and urethra, where they play a role in male fertility [101]. In fact, little is known about the fungal \u0000ora of rodent's digestive and reproductory tracts. Lecanicillium species are pathogens that parasitize not only insects but also worms and many other fungi, which could explain their presence in gut fungi associated with rats. Lecanicillium strains have been found in gut fungi associated with marmots [102]. A large variety of 'forgotten' odd fungi, including Ustilaginales and Ustilago sp. , are found in the human digestive tract [103-106], as seen in rodents (Figure 5 & Table 1). So it is not surprising that fungal sequences like Lecanicillium, Phallus, and Ustilago have been found in the fecal DNA of CTX-rat models. It has been described in a variety of other animal species, including humans. What is more unusual or surprising is the discovery that these fungi are differentially regulatedPage 11/37by CTX and/or 3L conditions, which is a critical key point in addressing their prevalence in the gut microbial system (Figure 5 & Table 1). Phallus was found in cyclophophasmide-treated rats and rats treated with CTX + high 3L lactobacilli in the heatmap (Figure 5). Despite CTX treatment, medium and low doses of 3L were able to eradicate Phallus fungi, as shown by triplicate samples (Figure S7 & Table 1), even though Phallus infection was not prevalent in all IM samples (Figure S7). More interestingly, the heatmap analysis highlighted two taxa in particular, Fusarium and Pichia, which were found in high abundance in feces from control and high lactobacillus-treated groups and samples or were repeatedly found in control samples but signi\u0000cantly altered by chemotherapy (Figures 5 & S7). Furthermore, there was a correlation between Rhizopus and Lactobacillus treatment. Chemotherapy signifcantly reduced Rhizopus-levels, but increased when Lactobacillus was added to phosphamide. Rhizopus was found in abundance in H, M, and L groups (Figures 5 & S7). The Rhizopus microbe was more abundant in M samples (CTX + middle dose/2.5 ml/kg bodyweight of Lactobacillus), indicating that a speci\u0000c dose of bioproduct should be chosen for effective regulation of speci\u0000c microbes (Figures 5, S7 & Table 1). We found that high-, medium-, and low-dose 3L cocktail gavages and & Table 1). The microbial composition distribution histograms of each sample were displayed at the phylum, order, class, family, and genus levels (Figure 6 & Table 2) in our descriptive analysis of rats in relation to CTX and Lactobacillus (N=50; analysis of groups and individual samples, the same chemotherapy session, one drug, \u0000ve shots, addition of Lactobacilli, 3L-test, three different doses, comparison with controls, bene\u0000cial effects analysis). The dominant microbial phyla were similar in control and 3L therapy conditions (Figure 6A & Table 2). CTX, on the other hand, caused a signi\u0000cant decrease in Ascomycota-levels, which was not seen with high-doses of 3L during chemotherapy (Figure 6A). 2). Mucoromycota and Olpidiomycota levels in rat fecal microbiomes increased during CTX chemotherapy but remained low when H, M, or L doses of Lactobacillus were added to CTX (Figure 6A & Table 2). Similarly, analysis of the distribution of microbial fungal classes, orders, families, and genera in the \u0000ve rat groups showed speci\u0000c bene\u0000cial effects of Lactobacillus treatment in addition to cancer chemotherapy (Figure 6B-E & Table 2). Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Tremellomycetes were the most abundant microbial fungal classes in healthy control rats without any other treatment than normal saline injection. CTX chemotherapy had a signi\u0000cant impact on all \u0000ve classes. Chemotherapy also increased Mucoromycetes levels in the fecal microbiome. With high dose injections of 3L, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Sordariomycetes were kept at normal levels. Mucoromycetes were kept at normal levels in all three Lactobacilli-treated samples. Agaricostilbocytes, Leotiomycetes, and Tremellomycetes, were also recovered at normal levels after probiotic treatments (Figure 6B & Table 2). Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Saccharomycetales, and Trichosporonales were the most abundant microbes on an order level not only in CK, but also in H group. The IM group had a different microbial order pro\u0000ling, with signi\u0000cantly altered levels of Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Saccharomycetales, and Trichosporonales, as well as signi\u0000cantly increased levels of Mucorales. Lactobacillus treatment restored normal levels of Capnodiales, Cysto\u0000lobasidiales and Glomerellales that had been affected by chemotherapy. Lactobacillus H, M, and L doses were effective in controlling Mucorales levels. A low dose of Lactobacillus was also particularly effective in stimulating Mallasseziales levels, emphasing the importance of controlling Lactobacillus dose to target speci\u0000c microbial orders (Figure 6C & Table 2). Four major microbial families were identi\u0000ed in rat fecal samples related microbial families were vulnerable to chemotherapy alone, but were kept alive by combining 3L with CTX-chemo treatment (Figure 6D). To maintain the levels of Aspergillaceae, a gradual increase of 3L seemed to be required (Figure 6D). CTX also reduced the levels of Cordycipitaceae, Mycosphaerellaceae, Rhizopodaceae, Thermoascaceae, and Trichosporonaceae, but these levels were maintained when CTX was combined with Lactobacillus gavage. This was not true for all of the microbial families found in rat feces. Pichiaceae was one of the microbial families that were down-regulated after CTX treatment, which could not be reversed by adding Lactobacillus during chemo-treatment (Figure 6D). However, Lactobacillus at high, medium, and low doses had a clear bene\u0000cial effect on Mucoraceae control (Figure 6D). Mucoraceae-levels in the IM group were extremely high, which could be reversed by adding H, M, or L doses of Lactobacillus (Figure 6D). A low dose of the bioproduct was found to induce especially high levels of Mallasseziaceae (Figure 6D & Table 2). Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and were the main microbial genera characteristic of the CK and H groups, respectively, while Mucor was a diagnosis of immune-damage caused by CTX treatment. The addition of Lactobacillus to chemotherapy effectively controlled Mucor. Mucor- levels were found to be extremely low in the H, M, and L groups of rats related to Chemo + Lacto treatment. On Xerochrysium,Page 12/37similar effects were observed. Xerochrysium-levels rose during chemotherapy, but were kept under control by using Lactobacillus at low, medium, and high doses. Other microbial genera such as Chlamydomyces, Lecanicillium, Rhizomucor, and Sarocladium were maintained by Lactobacillus at low, medium, or high doses. Only Pichia was not maintained by Lactobacillus treatment, regardless of the dose of 3L bioproduct (Figure 6E & Table 2). When all triplicates were compared (Figure S8), Ascomycota levels were found to be remarkably high in CK and H triplicates (Figure S8A). In contrast, Ascomycota levels were particularly low in IM021, L103, and M201. Mucoromycota and Olpidiomycota (Figure S8A). Mucoromycota and Olpidiomycota were signi\u0000cantly lower Lactobacillus samples, particularly H (H105, H204, and H205). Mortierellomycota were missing in C105) in ungrouped and very low concentrations in IM021. Mucoromycetes were found in abundance in IM015 sample. Eurotiomycetes and Mucoromycetes were kept to normal conditions in all H samples (Figure S8B). On the order level, IM015 was distinguished by a high Mucorales/low Saccharomycetales ratio (Figure S8C). Despite the fact that Saccharomycetales remained low in all H, M, and L Lactobacillus- treated samples, Mucorales levels in Lactobacillus samples were comparable to controls (Figure S8C). Furthermore, Capnodiales levels in medium and high Lactobacillus samples M202-H205 were comparable to those found in C101, C103, and C105. Glomerellales levels were high in both the control (C101 and C103) and Lactobacillus (L104) samples (Figure S8C). Microbial family pro\u0000ling was diverse in all samples, but particularly in the CK and H groups. C101, C103, C105, H105, H204, all showed high levels of Nectriaceae and Trichosporonaceae, as well as a variety of other families ranging from Aspergilaceae to Microascaceae. Notably, none of the Lactobacillus samples had the high levels of Mucoraceae found in IM015 (Figure S8D). In the genus taxa summary from ungrouped samples, IM015 of Fusarium but no Mucor to the extent seen in IM105 (Figure S8E). As a result, ungrouped samples of CTX-related rat fecal microbiomes and the effects of adding speci\u0000c bioproducts also argued for Lactobacillus rather bene\u0000cial role in maintaining host health microbiome during chemotherapy. The analysis of metagenome sequence data (CK versus M) revealed a pattern that overlapped with enriched core microbes in the order Trichosporonales and the phylum Basidiomycota (Figure S9). The Hypocreales, Nectriaceae, and Fusarium in CK and H class samples was very high (above 60000-140000). In the IM, L, and M classes of samples, the relative abundance of Fusarium fungi was less than 50000 (Figure S10A). Fusarium was identi\u0000ed as a key biomarker (i.e, a key community member) of the CK group by LEfSe (LDA, Krustal-Wallis and Wilcoxon; Figure S10B). Comparative metagenomics and network analysis at the phylum level showed a high degree of similarity between control and Lactobacillus-treated rat fecal samples, as well as the dominance of Ascomycota in this network (Figure S11). This CK- Lactobacillus group is not associated with IM samples (in blue; Figure S11A). Mucoromycota (in orange) dominated in CTX- immune-attacked ill rat feces (Figure S11B). CTX and CTX + Lactobacillus therapy effects on bacteriome and metabolic pathways. The relative abundance of each functional category (biosynthesis, degradation/utilization/assimilation, generation of precursor metabolite and energy, glycan pathways and metabolic clusters) was calculated using pathway abundance and read count abundance (MetaCyc; Figure S12). Differential abundance was found primarily for respiration, fermentation, fatty acid/lipid/carbohydrate degradation, and biosynthetic pathways raw counts for metabolic pathways and enzymes, metabolites, and reaction orthologs revealed a strong statistical signi\u0000cance of differential abundance, primarily for cofactor, prosthetic group, electron carrier, vitamin, fatty acid, and lipid biosynthesis (Figure S12B). Some metabolic pathways in the MetaCyc database can be labeled with a low-level bacterial taxon [107]. As a result, we used MetaCyc \u0000nd metabolic pathways and/or bacterial taxa that are speci\u0000cally related to the \u0000ve groups of rats for chemotherapy (Figures 7 & S13). A speci\u0000c pathway (PWY-7839), 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin sarcinapterin) for the biosynthesis of several cofactors in speci\u0000c bacterial strains, was found to be particularly highly expressed in CK and Lactobacillus-treated samples due to an Prevotella, Clostridiales, Bacteroides, and CF231 Paraprevotellaceae (Figure 7A). Treatments with M- and H-doses were clearly effective in increasing the levels of Bacteroides and Prevotella, both of which are essential in the pyridoxine pathway required for vitamin B6 synthesis (PYRIDOXSYN-PWY, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) biosynthesis I; Figure Lactobacillus treatment restored the abundance of helicobacterial taxa required for the TCAPage 13/37cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) or the Krebs cycle. Despite chemotherapy, with Lactobacillus treatment, not only Helicobacter-levels, but also \"Flexispira\" (in purple), Rothia, and Halomonas levels, were maintained (Figure 7C). Lactobacillus L-, M-, or H-doses, had no effects on Bacillales. To control Halomonas, a high dose of 3L (5.0 ml/kg) was strictly required (Figure 7C). In IM samples, a formaldehyde oxydation peak was observed. This was linked to the emergence of Enterococcus bacteria in immune compromised conditions (Figure 7D). Many Enterococcus species are known to be commensals and are not actively causing infection. In our case (Figure 7D), our results show a peak of Enterococcus linked to chemotherapy (CTX alone), implying that Enterococcus is an active infection. The addition of Lactobacillus to chemotherapy completely eliminated it; no Enterococcus peak was observed in CK, H and M groups (Figure 7D). TCA-GLYOX-BYPASS, the superpathway or bypass that integrates the Krebs cycle (TCA) with the glyoxylate shunt, bene\u0000ted from Lactobacillus treatment during chemotherapy (+CTX). In both CK and H-dose conditions, a high diversity of bacterial taxa was observed. Enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae, Rothia, Cupriavidus, Halomonas, and Devosia was detected in controls and persisted during CTX chemotherapy when an additive probiotic treatment with high doses of 3L was used. Treatment with Lactobacillus was ineffective on Bacillales at 1.25-5 ml/kg doses (Figure 7E). Lactobacillus at a medium-dose (2.5 ml/kg) was particularly effective in stimulating Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 7E). Lactobacillus at a high-dose (5 ml/kg) was particularly effective in stimulating Devosia (Figure 7E). Similarly, the additive Lactobacillus treatment positively Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, Halomonas, and responsible for (prokaryotic) TCA (Figure 7F). CTX chemotherapy and/or treatment with 3L bioproduct had a signi\u0000cant impact on tRNA charging and microbiome. We observed the Prevotella, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus (Figure 7G). Finally, Illumina and MetaCyc analyses revealed that a middle dose of Lactobacillus had a strong effect on Enterobacteriaceae, which mediate the bacterial superpathway of coenzyme Q ubiquinol-8 (UBISYN-PWY, Figure types of metabolic pathways were examined (MetaCyc), the effects of Lactobacillus in addition to CTX were less obvious (Figure S13). No particular bacteria were found for the MetaCyc L-methionine salvage cycle III (PWY-7527, Figure S13A). Lactobacillus doses (M and H) primarily stimulated the anaerobic pathway for oleate biosynthesis IV (PWY-7664), however, the IM group had one sample that was much higher in the abundance of this pathway than all the H Lactobacillus group. The medium group appeared to have higher overall levels than the high group, possibly indicating an effect of 3L on this pathway (Prevotella and Bacteroides) but making any dose response relationship di\u0000cult to determine (Figure S13B). M- and H-doses of the bioproduct apparently had similar bene\u0000cial effects on mycolate biosynthesis (PWYG-321), with high levels of Bacteroides accumulating in M- treated samples (Figure S13C). Analysis of bacterial strains involved in the pathway teichoic acid (poly-glycerol) biosynthesis, which is part of cell wall biogenesis, seemed to have a positive effect of 3L bioproduct (M and/or H) as an additive to chemotherapy. Lactobacillus contributed to the low levels of Clostridiales, Mogibacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Gemella, while strains such as Jeotgalicoccus were stimulated (Figure S13D). Except for enterobacter in some low-dose Lactobacillus samples, no speci\u0000c bacterial strains were identi\u0000ed for the superpathway of L-threonine metabolism (Figure S13E). Chemotherapy attacked; the levels of Clostridiales, Ruminococcus, Oscillospira in the pathway UDP-N-acetyl-D- glucosamine biosynthesis I (UDPNAGSYN-PWY), which could be avoided by combining CTX with a high dose (5 ml/kg) of Lactobacillus (Figure S13F). Discussion Cancer, a cell disease caused by DNA changes, is a major burden of threat to human health worldwide. When chemotherapy is envisioned as the primary or perhaps only way to prevent cancer development, the burden of threat to human health increases. Using one or more anti-cancer chemical drugs, such as cyclophosphamide (cytophosphane, CTX), kills lymphoma or any cancer cells, but it also kills or seriously alters the patient immune system, potentially limiting life and health expectancies, just like the disease. This is shown in a previous study from Zhang et al. in rats where CTX was shown to alter several immune marker indicators like the number of white blood cells, CD4+/CD8+ratio, the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin gene expression [see 65]. In this previous study, which used the same chemotherapy rat model (see Fig. 1), the CTX-increased expression of TNF-alpha cytokine, an endocrine mediator of in\u0000ammatory and immune functions, known to regulate cell growth, cell signaling, but with many side effects of cytotoxicity in transformed cells, was another indication of immune attacks in CTX conditions [65]. This is also described in our study of chemo-damaged rats when a strong bene\u0000cial healthy gut \u0000ora is suppressed by CTX treatment. We examined thePage 14/37microbiome of \u0000ve groups of rats in relation to chemotherapy, revealing that rats treated with CTX had a completely altered microbiome. Importantly, we show that Lactobacillus treatments are particularly effective at maintaining healthy gut \u0000ora in the rat intestine, allowing us to establish strong healthy conditions in rats despite chemo (see Figs. 2-4 & S1-S6). Though there have been previous reports on the use of Lactobacillus in gut \u0000ora and gastrointestinal tract protection [108-111], we will always seek the best solution, and we are still looking for a probiotic remedy that has a strong and signi\u0000cant impact on the adversive effects developed by CTX therapy, is active on bene\u0000cal microbes, improves microbial balance, activates nutrients and stimulates gut- powered immune systems. The use of probiotics in chemotherapy is still rather uncommon, not applicable to all ages and populations, and an emerging \u0000eld with many contradictory clinical results when it comes to interaction with the host or patient consumption [112-113]. Manipulation of microbiota by natural probiotics vs. chemical drugs is a constant challenge no only in human but also in veterinary medicine, especially for genetic diseases like cancer. The safety and stability of chemotherapeutic drugs such as CTX in cancer clinical trials are questionable [114-115]. We always look into clinical trials for anticancer methods that are highly e\u0000ciency, have a low resistance capacity, and have no impact on the patient's quality of life or health conditions. Some chemicals can cause the organism to develop resistance. The repeated use of the same class of chemicals to control a disease, such as cancer, can have a variety of negative consequences. When the organism becomes ill and resistant, the chemical (CTX) is used more frequently, and the adjuvant must eventually be added as the CTX level rises. Despite this, no comprehensive microbiological medical study of the impact of Lactobacillus during chemotherapy has been conducted. The rat response to a new bioproduct (3L: L. acidophilus+L. casei+L. plantarum) added to chemo/cyclophosphamide CTX shots was studied as a preliminary set for more extensive biomedicine cancer research. We found that combining acidophilus, casei, and plantarum is especially bene\u0000cial for maintaining the gut \u0000ora and thus the immune system during chemotherapy. We show that combining three Lactobacilli strains has signi\u0000cant bene\u0000cial effects on rat gut microbiota during chemotherapy, prompting us to test the formulation for human health (see Figs. 2-7 & S1-S13). We present MiSeq data for rat feces microbiome variations under \u0000ve different conditions: normal and healthy, CTX chemotherapy and immune-attack, low, medium, and high doses of Lactobacillus (3L), with special consideration for fungi phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species (see Figs. 5-6 & S7-S11). We show in this study, that rats given CTX plus high doses of a new natural microbial biomedical product, the bioproduct 3L, have preserved microbiota that are critical for maintaining a strong immune system and a healthy condition. Such \u0000ndings are especially signi\u0000cant because it has been established that microbial dysbiosis is associated with carcinogeneis in cancers ranging from colon to liver to pancreas. The growth of nocive fungi (Malassezia) in the gut microbiome, in particular, can promote oncogenesis via activation of mannose-binding lectins [116], urging medication to control the microbiome and MBL. Chemotherapy has been shown to alter immune, metabolic, and physiological functions, as well as potentially stimulate invasive fungal infection in patients [117-118]. So it is not surprizing that CTX alters gut \u0000ora and increases mucor or xerochrysium infection in groups of rat models (see Figs. 5-6, S7-S11 & Tables 1-2). The most striking \u0000nding of our study in \u0000ve groups of rats in relation to chemotherapy is perhaps the bene\u0000cial regulation of gut \u0000ora after Lactobacillus (3L) supplementation at various doses. High doses of 3L have been shown to maintain bene\u0000cial healthy normal gut \u0000ora in CTX-treated rats (see Figs. 2-7, S1-S12 & Tables 1-2), urging the method or lactobacillus treatment additive to CTX to be tested on cancer rat models. We show that high doses of L. acidophilus+L. casei+L. plantarum are especially important for regulating Ascomycota and Capnodiales levels. Because ascomycetes are known to be used in medicine with the antibiotics penicillin and cephalosporin [119], and endophytic sooty mold fungi (Dothideomycetes) can be important for tissue health, environmental adaptation, and stress tolerance [120], this could be a signi\u0000cant discovery for cancer treatment. Interestingly, high doses of 3L (H treatment) have been shown to stimulate the levels of many different fungi families, including Aspergilaceae, Microascaceae, Nectriaceae, and Trichosporonaceae. Despite the fact that many of these fungi are plant and human pathogens, many of them are also biodegraders and biocontrol agents that could be used in medical applications [121]. For example, given that these ascomycete fungi can help degrade residual CTX and control cyclophosphamide toxicity [122], this could be used in chemotherapy. Another important aspect of using chemo+ lactobacillus is that 3L (high dose, 5.0 ml/kg) has been shown to like mucormycetes (Mucormycota, Mucoraceae) and chytridiomycetes (Olpidiomycota, 6, S8 & Tables 1-2). High mucorales typically invade the blood vessels and are linked to emerging infectious diseases such as mucormycosis in addition to other zygomycoses [123]. Chytrid fungi cause chytridiomycosis, an emerging disease in amphibians, and subcutaneous phycomycosis in humans [124]. As a result,Page 15/37this is a comprehensive pattern of many different fungal infections that could be regulated by Lactobacillus bioproduct 3L. Furthermore, 3L has the potential to in\u0000uence the magnitude of bene\u0000cial fungal components of the intestinal microbiota, known as the gut mycobiome. Some fungi from the diet or the environment play an important role in mediating interaction in gut bacterial communities and regulating metabolic homeostasis. This is true for Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Saccharomycetales, and Trichosporonales, all of which are important components of the healthy mycobiome in both control and 3L-treated rats (see Figs. 6, S7-S11 & Tables 1-2). The structure of the human gut microbial community is determined by genetics and environmental factors, but the fungi that mediate changes in this structure and cause disease are relatively common in humans and rodents [125-126]. Although it is commonly assumed that probiotics do not colonize the digestive tract or other parts of the human body, there is evidence of transient probiotic or foodborne strain colonization of the human gut via various mucosadhesion-related proteins on the probiotic cell surface [127-128]. There is also the option of encapsulating Lactobacilli [129]. As a result, it may be critical to use 3L during cancer chemotherapy to maintain the mycobiome balance, microbial community interactions, bacterial-fungal interactions, fungal-fungal diabetis [131], caused signi\u0000cant changes in Mortierellomycota-levels, which could be reversed by adding 3L (see Figure S8A). Therefore, using a 3L mix could be extremely useful in targeting speci\u0000c components of the mycobiome, which plays a key role in the development of diseases ranging from cancer to diabetes. It is probably important to note that the effect of 3L tested in rats can be dose-dependent in this prospect for curing or optimizing health. To treat the rats for Mallasseziomycetes, a low dose of 3L Lactobacillus cocktail (1.25 ml/kg) was required (see Fig. 6C & Table 2), which could be important in medications for speci\u0000c pathologies such as colorectal cancer. Mallasseziomycetes fungi are associated with late-stage colorectal cancer [132]. We also found that 3L bioproduct doses have a different effect on the mycobiome during the stages of chemotherapy treatment in rats. Lactobacillus strains must be present in su\u0000cient quantities for 3L to be effective. Lactobacillus ingredients must eventually be gradually increased in order to regulate a speci\u0000c fungal group, such as (see Fig. 6D & Tables 1-2). During chemotherapy, it is critical to regulate the fungal mycobiome. The gut mycobiome is involved in microbiome assembly and immune functionality, prompting the modulation of speci\u0000c fungi to regulate both the gut microbiome and the immune system during chemotherapy [133]. While 3L is effective in modulating yeasts in the order Saccharomycetales (Ascomycota; see Fig. 6 & Table 2), Pichia is one of the few microbial genera that is affected by CTX chemotherapy but does not respond to Lactobacillus treatment (see Fig. 6E & Tables 1-2). One possible explanation is that 3L controls gut fungi but not oral fungi or genera like Pichia and Candida [134]. Perhaps the formulation of 3L can still be improved to treat both oral and gut mycobiomes. Adding one or more Lactobacillus strains, such as L. reuteri, to 3L may be very effective in controlling the entire mycobiome on oral and gut tissues (see J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2017 [135] & our descriptive study on 3L in chemo). The plethora of metabolic functions maintained by 3L treatment in \u0000ve groups of rats in relation to CTX chemotherapy was one of our study's most striking \u0000ndings about Lactobacillus and chemo (see Fig. 7 & S12-S13). Not only cancer, but also chemotherapy, has a signi\u0000cant impact on cell metabolism [136-139]. Therefore, targeting of chemotherapy (and cancer) metabolism as a complementary strategy is a promising approach not only for disease intervention, but also for preserving physiological functions in the patient immune system. We show here that a preparation of L. acidophilus (SD65), L. casei (SD07), and L. plantarum (SD02) is extremely effective in maintaining and/or stimulating many different metabolic pathways via a bene\u0000cial effect on gut \u0000ora (see Fig. 7 & S13). After treatment with our three Lactobacilli cocktail (3L), the gut \u0000ora of chemotherapy-treated rats is rich in Firmicutes-Clostridia-Clostridiales-S24-7, as found in healthy control conditions (see Figs. 7A & 7G). Overall, the detailed composition of the bacteriome using MetaCyc data suggests shared patterns of microbial strains and metabolic activities in healthy and 3L-treated groups for a wide range of systems. Bacteroidales-Muribaculaceae-S24-7 is an important component of the microbiome for carbohydrate metabolism, while Deferribacteraceae upregulates genes for amino acid and vitamin metabolism [140]. In the gastrointestinal tract, Bacteroidales-Prevotellaceae-Prevotella-Paraprevotella plays a key role for glucose (central carbon) metabolism, polysaccharide breakdown, glycogen storage, sulfate assimilation, and the production of propionate, which has anti-cancer and anti-in\u0000ammatory properties [141-144]. Campylobacterales-Helicobacteraceae-Helicobacter (pylori) is not always infectious or linked to metabolic syndromes like atherosclerosis. In many cases, it can be considered very bene\u0000cial to prevent the development of autoimmune diseases in humans. H. pylori can aid in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism. H. pylori is also known to contribute to the metabolic fate of pyruvate to lactate-acetate, nucleotide biosynthesis, oxidative aspect (\"bene\u0000cial pathogen\") highlights the signi\u0000cance of our \u0000nding with 3L controlling Helicobacter levels during chemotherapy (see Fig. 7C). This includes the ability of 3L to control Helicobacters of thePage 16/37genus Flexispira, a urease-producing microorganism from the mid-colon and jejunum in humans that is typically associated with diarrhea symptoms as well as complete febrile illness such as malaise, arthralgias, pain, leg swelling and polyserositis [148-149]. It also includes a bene\u0000cial control of 3L for Actinomycetales-Micrococcaceae-Rothia and Oceanospirillales-Halomonadaceae- Halomonas (see Fig. 7C), which may be important because Rothia and Halomonas are both prevalent in oral (salivae), oropharynx, respiratory tract and intestinal (gut) microbiota where they contribute to maintain healthy mucosal surfaces (iron scavenged from food, breakdown of proline and glutamine-rich proteins, glutamate and central carbohydrate metabolism) [150-151]. The bene\u0000cial effects of high doses of 3L (in addition to CTX in rats) on the levels of Burkholderiales-Burkholderiaceae-Cupriavidus and Rhizobiales-Hyphomicrobiaceae-Devosia further suggest the stimulatory effects of 3L-pharmacological agents on central carbon metabolism and energy production (see Figs. 7E & 7F). Cupriavidus bacteria have a diverse metabolic range that can be used to produce sulfur-biofuels as well as energy sources from hydrogen and CO2 [152]. Similarly, Rhizobium and Devosia are known to express a wide range of metabolic activities, including carbohydrate, cysteine, methionine, branch-chain amino acid, and phosphorus compound metabolism, all of which are ideal for sustaining cellular and genetic component synthesis, energy transfer, and/or mycotoxin degradation [153-154]. Furthermore, the 3L mix may increase the levels of Bacillales-Staphylococcaceae- Jeotgalicoccus (see Figure S13D), which is important for biotin/vitamin H or vitamin B7 metabolism, cofactor in carboxylase activities in the gut, and its relationship with health [155]. The use of Lactobacillus (3L) to potentially stimulate amino acid, biotin, carbohydrate, glucose, iron, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, protein, pyruvate, sul\u0000de, and vitamin metabolism as a complement to chemo has been highlighted (see Figs. 7 & S13). The most notable effect of Lactobacillus treatment on the microbiome is perhaps found for Enterococcus (see Fig. 7D). Chemotherapy (CTX) signi\u0000cantly increases the risk of Enterococcus peak (see Fig. 7D), which in humans becomes a risk of ulcerative colitis or even colorectal cancer [156]. Probiotics such as 3L (3-Lactobacilli) have been found to be very effective in raising bacteroides and clostridiales and keeping Enterococcaceae at bay in order to restore the gut \u0000ora to healthy conditions during chemotherapy (see Figs. 7 & S13). As a result, our 3L cocktail appears to be capable of controlling not only the mycobiome, but also the entire bacterial microbial metabolism in a strain-dependent manner. Different Lactobacilli formulations have been shown to modify gut \u0000ora and thus general metabolism and behavior not only in humans, but also in \u0000shes and rodents [157-158]. We suggest that Lactobacilli, like other general natural bacterial probiotics, can be used as an adjuvant treatment during chemotherapy to maintain gut \u0000ora and stimulate the patient's immune system. Rats outperformed mice as pre-clinical models models for human microbiota engraftment. Rats' microbial communities are more similar to those of humans. More human microbial species were captured by rats than by mice [159]. As a result, rats are frequently used in cross-species microbiome analysis to study a wide range of human pathologies [160-161]. The bene\u0000cial pharmacological effects of a new probiotic formula on the gut microbiota of rats after one-month treatment with three bio, three natural Lactobacilli species in CTX-injury are reported here. The comprehensive and comparative analysis is divided into three parts: (1) healthy condition and chemo, (2) CTX+Lactobabillus, and (3) different Lactobacillus doses. We describe the microbial pro\u0000les associated with chemotherapy, as well as the various Lactobacillus doses required to counteract speci\u0000c aversive or inhibitory effects of CTX in rodents. In addition to the infectious microbial pathogens induced by the CTX chemical treatment, a systematic analysis of the gut microbiota in groups of rats exposed to cyclophosphamide shots+bioproduct suggests the key bene\u0000cial microbial families induced by 3L to help maintain the gut \u0000ora and thereby the immune system. L. casei supports the growth of L. acidophilus, which produces carbohydrate-digesting enzymes, whereas L. plantarum, a more adaptable and versatile strain, produces a slew of antimicrobial substances that aid in their survival in the gastrointestinal tract under any conditions. Our \u0000rst results in CTX chemo-rats could pave the way for future human chemotherapy attempts. As a main result of \"chemo\", fragile health conditions and microbial infections are frequently associated with a weakened immune system. Hence, complementary and/or alternative clinical medicine for cancer prevention and/or treatment is required. One major \u0000nding in our study was that a tritherapy of Lactobacilli could save the body from chemo in rodents by having many bene\u0000cial effects on gut \u0000ora (mycobiome and bacteriome) and cell energy metabolism. The immune system, which relies on energy to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, is strongly linked to body composition (gut \u0000ora and metabolism). Furthermore, because 3L has positive effects on a variety of bacteria and metabolic systems (see Fig. 8), it is highly possible that it might function as an adjuvant to chemical medications not only for cancer but also for a variety of metabolic illnesses. It helps eliminate speci\u0000c invading agents such as fungi (mucor) and infectious bacteria (enterococcus). Addinionally, the diversity of bacteria elevated by 3L treatment (see Fig. 8) is such that it is simple to modify our probiotic formula (L. acidophilus SD65, L. casei SD07, and L. plantarum SD02) to target particular human metabolism systems. Our pilot experiment in rats has the bene\u0000t of showing that different Lactobacillus dosagesPage 17/37have distinct impacts on gut \u0000ora (see Figs. 7 & 8). The impact of various SD65-SD07-SD02 ratios in 3L mixtures or in combination with other Lactobacilli or bene\u0000cial bacteria mixtures should therefore be the subject of further study (see Fig. 8). Here, in this pilot study, we provide a research-feasibility recommendation for the preservation of gut \u0000ora, general metabolism, immunization, or enhanced immune systems throughout chemotherapy. With the use of our 3L bioproduct, a wide family of pharmacological therapeutic microbial bioproducts that would be employed on cancer patients rather than chemo-animal models might be developed. Conclusion The work that is being given here can be used as a component in the design of future experimental and clinical investigations related to cancer, chemotherapy, bionatural pharmacology and microbial treatment. After 28 days of Lactobacillus treatment and \u0000ve chemotherapy injections, the microbiota was evaluated once, and the \u0000ndings show promise for future research and human clinical trials. Rat feces samples were collected at one time point, D28, following nearly a month of 3L treatment under CTX conditions in order to conduct a full complete thorough workshop on microbiome analysis and a group-variation comparison. The 3L probiotic formulation affects the rat gut \u0000ora in chemotherapeutic settings. While CTX and anticancer drugs have a number of potential side effects, as documented here, adding 3L to chemotherapy has been shown to improve gut \u0000ora and consequently health conditions. Bacteria and fungus interact to control health and disease. In this pilot study, 3L seems to keep fungi and bacteria that are good for health. Results on bacteria are constrained to particular metabolic pathways, which seems to be how 3L approaches chemotherapy. The results of this pilot study on rats suggest the effectiveness, frequency, and dependability of high- dose 3L across a month of treatment (\u0000ve CTX-chemotherapy sessions or 'shots'), which is a crucial \u0000nding for designing subsequent research projects and clinical trials. High dose of 3L candidates to maintain health conditions throughout chemotherapy, restore gut \u0000ora to normal levels, and boost the host's overall immunological defense. Although much remains to be learned from studying 3L, such as its long-term effects on the immune system and/or how it affects tumor cell histology, this pilot study is nevertheless important in our continued search for methods to enhance the quality of life for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. In this detailed description of the microbiome, which was evaluated once, following one month treatment and \u0000ve chemotherapy-shots, we can see that the intervention use (3L) has, at least at the level of the intestinal gut \u0000ora, a fairly effective protective effect against CTX toxicity.

VIP>1, the greater the value, the greater the species' contribution to the differences between groups. Mucor contributes signi\u0000cantly to the differences between the IM (immune-attacked, ill, CTX, chemo) and other groups (CK: control healthy conditions and Lactobacillus-treated). 3L-high dose (5.0 mg/kg). Each point or dot represents a sample; dots of the same color belong to the same group; and the same groups (three points or dots) are denoted by ovals (right). The closer the distance between similar groups and the greater the distance beween different groups, the better the classi\u0000cation model. H-dose and CK groups are very close on PLS-DA classi\u0000cation model for rats related to chemotherapy and Lactobacillus, with IM as the far point (R(v3.1.1), BGI Co., Ltd). B) Discriminant Analysis using Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures (OPLS-DA). Fusarium and sarocladium play a signi\u0000cant role in the differences between CK-H groups and IM (see *).

The similarity of all fungal species is indicated by longitudinal clustering between the \u0000ve rat groups. Horizontal clustering denotes the resemblance of speci\u0000c fungal genera among the \u0000ve rat groups (CK-H). The closer the distance and the shorter the branch length, the more similar the genus composition is between the groups and samples. A) Hierarchical clustering based on both groups and taxa (variables: columns and rows). The relative abundance of speci\u0000c fungal genera is used to link groups (map both clustered). B) Hierarchical clustering on taxa (variable: rows). The ordering of groups or samples is unaffected by the relative abundance of fungi (map taxa clustered).
