Wichita Collegiate School INTRODUCTION Adolescents' everyday habits impact their mental and physical well -being. Researchers reviewed published studies investigating intake, mental, physical, and social habits, seeking data to support habits' effects on adolescents' stress, mood, health, and brain physiology. METHODS Twelve students conducted literature searches regarding the neurological, psychological, physical, and social impacts of everyday habits using PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles published before 2020 and non- pertinent to adolesce nts were excluded. RESULTS Eating healthy foods can benefit gut health, leading to an improved immune system, reduced stress, and decreased chronic illness risk. Poor intake habits can lead to substance abuse, obesity, and sleep deprivation. Sedentary hobbies (video games, music, meditation, and reading) can improve brain function. Physical hobbies (meditation, exercise, and yoga) yield better physical health and mood, increase attention span, and release stress. Reading or practicing music increases brain plasticity and connectivity, allowing for efficient use of gray matter volume. Video gaming has multiple effects on physical wellbeing, improving reaction time and spatial awareness, but sometimes causing visual impairment. Excessive social media use produces unhealthy reliances, while reducing usage yields increased productivity. Self -objectification may cause depression. Conflict in family relationships and reduced in- person peer interaction may result in developmental and mental health problems. DISCUSSION Studies support that by engaging in consistent exercise, healthy eating, reading, and other positive habits - while avoiding drugs, social media, sleep deprivation, and other negative habits - adolescents can lead healthier lives. Further research should explore interventions promoting positive habits among adolescents.

Within one -year, SSIs are tasked with providing safe sleep training to at least 10 professionals or parent/caregivers and hosting either one Safe Sleep Community Baby Shower (CBS; group education) or 10 Safe Sleep Crib Clinics (CC; individual education). Beginning in 2021, the conference expanded with funding from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). This study assesses the impact of the FY22 SSI training using the RE -AIM framework. METHODS Reach, Effectiveness (R -E) and Maintenance (M) are evaluated at the conference and recertifications. Adoption (A) includes who SSIs trained (professionals, parent/caregivers) and whether they facilitated a CBS or CCs. Implementation (I) is evaluated by the change in knowledge/intentions pre - to post- training. Professional knowledge was evaluated with 10 -items and parent and caregivers with 4- items. RESULTS During FY22, 49 SSIs from four states were certified. Twelve (24%) SSIs conducted professional trainings, 10 (20%) conducted parent/caregiver trainings, 10 (20%) CBS and 11 (22%) CC. SSIs trained 164 professionals, 117 parent/caregivers, and 300 perinatal persons through CBS/CC; significant increases in knowledge/intentions were observed between pre - and post -test. Only four completed the post - conference trainings at levels requested thus far, but the deadline is April 2023. DISCUSSION The SSI certification was successful in terms of Reach, Effectiveness, Implementation and Maintenance. Adoption was less than expected and infrastructure is being developed to provide additional post - conference support.

SUID accounts for 17% of Hispanic infant deaths in Kansas. This study sought to identify characteristics and behaviors of Hispanic women/birthing persons (WBP) related to SUID. METHODS Linked Kansas birth/death vital statistics data (2005- 2018) were used to identify Hispanic WBP with a singleton birth who experienced SUID. To reduce confounding effects, greedy nearest neighbor matching paired each WBP sequentially with the 8 nearest controls based on age, race, payor source and parity. Matching procedures, likelihood- ratio 2, Fisher exact test and multiple logistic regression model with Firth's penalized maximum likelihood estimation were computed using SASv.9.4. RESULTS Of 86,792 Hispanic singleton births, 475 involved SUID and were matched with 3,800 controls from 83,758 WBPs. No differences were related to population density of residence, marital status, WIC enrollment or language spoken (all p>0.05). SUID was related to lower education and prenatal obese BMI (all p<0.05), however, multivariable models revealed poor predictive accuracy, with area under the ROC curve = 0.574 (95% CI 0.55- 0.60). For maternal behaviors, SUID was related to tobacco use during pregnancy, adequate -plus prenatal care, less -than -recommended pregnancy weight gain, not initiating breastfeeding and refusing to participate in the state immunization registry (all p<0.05). Behavioral multivariable models revealed better, but still inadequate predictive accuracy with area under the ROC curve = 0.682 (95% CI 0.64- 0.72). DISCUSSION SUID deaths to Hispanic families are likely multifaceted. Study results can inform education on risk reduction strategies.

The primary study objective was to evaluate dexamethasone (DEX) and hydrocortisone (HC), each versus placebo, for effects on mortality in preterm infants. METHODS Systematic review and meta -regression were conducted following PRISMA 2020 using a PICOTS format. Data were extracted from 44 RCTs published from 1972 to 2022; 31 studies with DEX and 13 with HC. R version 4.1.3 was used to conduct the meta -analyses and - regression. The population included premature infants less than 30 weeks in the NICU. Search engines included MEDLINE, EBSCO, Web of Embase, CINAHL, and RESULTS Meta -analyses vs. placebo: RR 95% CI 0.84, 95% CI (0.69, 1.02). Results from random effects model with SJ and knha: RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.070. Meta -regression, with 10,000 permutations, showed steroid exposure in placebo had significant impact on mortality: RR adj=1.44, 95% CI (1.09, 1.91), p=0.008, but comparison by drug was not significant: RRadj=1.00, 95% CI (0.77, 1.31), p=0.991. DISCUSSION Neither drug had a significant impact on mortality; although, compared to HC, DEX was given at a higher dose. Steroid exposure in placebo contributed to increased risk of mortality and primarily occurred as a rescue t herapy in U.S. studies. Future studies should be conducted to compare corticosteroids with similar drug regimens, control for confounders and comorbidities in preterm infants.

The DART extubation protocol recommends early low dose steroids; however, the AAP statement of 2022 does not recommend these, stating the evidence is insufficient. We evaluated dexamethasone (DEX) and hydrocortisone (HC) vers us placebo for preventing BPD in preterm infants. METHODS Systematic review and meta -regression were conducted following PRISMA 2020 using a PICOTS format. The population included premature infants less than 30 weeks in the NICU. Search engines included MEDLINE, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane, and others. Data were extracted from 44 RCTs published from 1972 to 2022; 31 studies with DEX and 13 with HC. R version 4.1.3 was used to conduct analyses. RESULTS Meta -analysis results for DEX vs. placebo were RR = 0.66, 95% CI (0.55, 0.78); HC 95% (0.87, 1.10); random effects model with SJ knha was RR = 0.75, 95% CI (0.66, 0.86); I 2 = 86.0%; p < Results from meta -regression with 10,000 permutations were significant: DEX vs. HC, RR adj = 0.75, 95% CI (0.6, 1.0), p = 0.028, with medium dose, RR adj = 0.72, 95% CI (0.5, 1.0), p = 0.031. DISCUSSION Delayed initiation with 2 -3 mg/kg DEX significantly reduced the risk of BPD. HC did not appear to be effective, but lower drug doses were used. These results could help update DART and the NICHD BPD calculator. Publication bias was detected along with potential for confounding effects of steroid exposure in placebo. Future studies should address severity of BPD, control for potential confounds, and monitor long -term follow -up outcomes.

Concerns regarding long- term neurodevelopment al-impairment (NDI) are ongoing; thus, steroid use has decreased since 2002. Our object ive was to assess NDI at follow -up in preterm infants enrolled in RCT with either dexamethasone (DEX) or hydrocortisone (HC) versus placebo to prevent BPD. METHODS A systematic review and meta -analysis was conducted following PRISMA 2020 utilizing PICOTS. Search included MEDLINE, EBSCO, Web of Science, and others. The target population was preterm infants <30 weeks gestation in the NICU who participated in drug trials to prevent BPD, with follow -up occurring 12- 24 months of age. Interventions included dexamethasone or hydrocortisone versus placebo. Outcomes included cerebral palsy (CP), Mental Development Index (MDI), and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI). Meta -analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.3. RESULTS Analyses included 2,116 preterm infants, 9 studies compared DEX to placebo, 5 compared HC to placebo. Incidence of CP in DEX studies showed RR = 0.98, 95% CI (0.60, 1.61) and in the HC studies the RR = 1.15, 95% CI (0.79, 1.67). Random effects model showed RR = 1.06, 95% CI (0.78, 1.45); p = 0.921, I 2 = 61.6%. Standardized mean differences for MDI and PDI were not significant (sparse data); p = 0.664 and 0.778, respectively. High risk of bias was found in many original studies, as were confounding effects of steroid exposure in placebo. DISCUSSION No significant differences were observed for any NDI by either steroid compared to placebo. System ic steroids may be used, with caution, in infants at risk for moderate or severe BPD.

The DART extubation protocol recommends early low dose steroids; however, the AAP statement of 2022 does not recommend these, stating the evidence is insufficient. Our primary objective was to conduct a systematic review of dexamethasone (DEX) or hydrocortisone (HC) versus placebo with RTC studies aimed at preventing BPD in preterm infants. METHODS A systematic review with meta -regression was conducted following PRISMA 2020 and utilizing PICOTS. ROB 2 was used for the bias assessment procedure ; certainty of evidence was conducted with GRADEpro , and EndNote with MS Excel was used for managing the data. Data extracted from the selected studies were analyzed with R version 4.1.3. PICOTS was defined as premature infants <30 weeks gestation, the interventions were DEX or HC, the comparator was placebo, the primary outcome was BPD, the type of studies include d were randomized controlled trials and the setting was the NICU. Secondary outcomes were mortality before discharge and neurodevelopmental impairment at follow -up. Covariates included infant characteristics, comorbidities, drug treatment regimens, recruitment location, and treatment deviations. To explore high heterogeneity within the meta -analyses, mixed model meta -regressions were developed for each outcome. Predictor selection utiliz ed the multimodel.inference function.

However, carbapenems or non- carbapenems may be used to treat ESBL urinary tract infections, if susceptible. In July 2021, a community teaching hospital expanded antimicrobial susceptibility reporting for ESBL - positive urine cultures to include non- carbapenems. This study evaluates carbapenem prescribing patterns for ESBL -positive urine cultures after this intervention. METHODS IRB-approved retrospective chart review of adult patients admitted to a community teaching hospital with ESBL -positive urine cultures and treated with antibiotics. This study was conducted from September 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 and September 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022; reflecting pre - and post - antimicrobial reporting change groups, respectively. Patients were excluded for non- contaminated positive blood cultures, ESBL -positive non -urine cultures, mortality within 24 hours of admission, or pregnancy. The primary endpoint was carbapenem prescribing patterns. Secondary endpoints included percentage of non- carbapenems utilized, 30- day all -cause readmission, medical group prescribing pattern s, and time to de -escalation. RESULTS 216 patients were included (n = 108 pre -group, n = 108 post -group). Carbapenem usage decreased; however, it was not statistically significant (51.85% pre -group, 45.37% post -group; p = 0.341). The most common non- carbapenem was fosfomycin (n = 41). No difference was found for 30- day all -cause readmissions between carbapenems and non -carbapenems (p = 0.413), or the time to de -escalation between pre - and post -groups (p = 0.442). DISCUSSION Expanding antimicrobial susceptibility reporting did not result in a statistically significant reduction in carbapenem prescribing. Education promoting non- carbapenems for uncomplicated cystitis may further decrease the frequency of carbapenems utilized, preserving future use and facilitating discharge.

METHODS Preliminary data were extracted from an ongoing prospective cohort study in which the operative extremity was compared to non -operative extremity. Patients from 14 to 40 years of age who had an ACL reconstructi on with QTB autograft volunteered to have knee assessment including quadriceps isokinetic strength measures and functional knee testing at 6 and 12 months post -operatively. Paired t - tests were conducted to compare postoperative strength and function scores on participants who had minimum one- year post -surgical follow -up. RESULTS Patients had a significant recovery of quadriceps strength as determined by isokinetic testing and single leg hop test. For 31 participants, quadriceps strength of the operative leg measured at 60 deg/sec was 63% of the non- operative leg at six months, increasing to 79% at one year (p < 0.001); when measured at 180 deg/sec, these values were 68% at six months, increasing to 82% at one year (p < 0.001). For 30 participants, single leg hop functional scores of the operative leg were 80% of the non- operative l eg at six months, increasing to 91% at one year (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION After QTB autograft for ACL reconstruction, there were significant gains in quadriceps strength and knee function from six months to one year post -operative. These findings indicated the QTB is an acceptable ACL reconstruction option.

In this retrospective study, we investigated the long- term clinical outcomes of our patients treated for DRUJ instability with the Sanders technique. The midpoint of a free tendon graft is anchored at the ulnar fovea and the two graft limbs traverse the unstable DRUJ. One limb is woven into the palmar wrist capsule, while the other is secured to the dorsal wrist capsule and retinaculum, thereby stabilizing the joint to dorsopalmar stress. METHODS We screened the electronic database of our orthopaedic practice to ide ntify all cases of distal radioulnar ligament reconstruction from 1995 to 2016. Patients were invited to return for long- term follow -up. Primary outcome measures were ulnar -sided wrist pain and DRUJ stability. RESULTS Of 30 patients (31 wrists) treated with this surgical technique, 19 were followed longitudinally for a mean of 10 years (range 3- 21). We found statistically significant improvements in ulnar -sided wrist pain and in DRUJ stability on the dorsopalmar stress test. The modified Mayo Wrist Scores were classified as 3 excellent, 12 good, 3 fair, and 1 poor. Of the 30 patients studied, there were four treatment failures, two from graft rupture , and two from DRUJ arthrosis. DISCUSSION Anatomic reconstruction of t he palmar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments by the Sanders technique is an effective treatment for DRUJ instability, associated with high patient satisfaction and durable outcomes.

In this context, we hypothesized that robotic -assisted TKA would spare periarticular native bone by virtue of more precise osteotomy cuts, resulting in decreased thickness of the polyethylene implant compared to the conventional manual TKA technique. METHODS The medical records of patients who underwent primary TKA by one fellowship- trained orthopaedic surgeon between 2018 and 2020 were reviewed. Patients with end- stage degenerative joint disease were included, while those with post -traumatic or inflammatory knee arthropathy were excluded. Patient demographics, implant manufacturer, and polyethylene insert thickness were entered into an electronic database. Data were analyzed using standard statistical methods. RESULTS We reviewed 222 medical records, 111 for each arthroplasty technique. Mean age at surgery was 64 years for the robotic group, 62 years for manual cohort (p = 0.398). Median polyethylene thickness was 9 mm (range 9- 13) in robotic -assisted cases compared to 11 mm (range 9- 16) in the manual cases. This difference in implant thickness was statistically significant by the Mann- Whitney U test (p < 0.001). Moreover, insert thickness variability was significantly less in the robotic -assisted TKA group. DISCUSSION Our study showed that the median polyethylene component thickness was significantly smaller and insert thickness was significantly less variable in the robotic -assisted procedures implying more precise bone -sparing femoral and tibial osteotomies. These data may be helpful for some surgeons deciding to introduce the robotic -assisted TKA technique into their clinical practice.

The purpose of this study was to determine variations in preoperative fluid resuscitation in a cohort of geriatric hip fracture patients undergoing surgical repair. METHODS At six Level 1 trauma centers, patients aged 65 years with ICD -10 codes indicating hip fracture and surgical repair were identi fied. Patients with multiple injuries were excluded. Variables associated with receiving preoperative fluid resuscitation were assessed with chi -square and Fisher exact tests. Variations in fluid volumes were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank -sum and Kruskal -Wallis tests. RESULTS Among 507 patients, 87% received preoperative fluid resuscitation. The median fluid volume delivered was 1,500 mL (IQR: 1,000- 2,300). There were significant differences in preoperative fluid administration by inter -hospital transfer status, hospital facility, patient body mass index, hospital length of stay (HLOS), and intensive care unit length of stay. Age, gender, time to surgery, time to ambulation, and hospital disposition were not associated with preoperative fluid administration. Also, there were significant differences in median preoperative fluid volumes by inter -hospital transfer status, hospital facility, time to surgery, and HLOS. DISCUSSION There are wide variations in preoperative fluid administration among geriatric hip fracture patients at different health care facilities and among patients at each facility. Future research should correlate preoper ative fluid volumes with risk factors and outcomes with the goal of establishing treatment guidelines to optimize fluid resuscitation for each patient.

Current guidelines recommend more potent agents, ticagrelor and prasugrel, over clopidogrel due to their superiority in preventing adverse cardiovascular events. However, these agents are associated with greater bleeding risk. This study aim ed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes and bleeding risk when de -escalating from ticagrelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel within 30 days of PCI. METHODS This retrospective chart review from June 2014 through December 2022 evaluated a composite outcome of all -cause mortality, urgent revascularization, stent thrombosis, stroke, and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included individual rates of the composite components , as well as a subgro up analysis in patients with prior history of myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetes. Patients who received de-escalated DAPT (DE) with clopidogrel within 30 days of PCI were compared to patients who received unchanged DAPT (UC) with ticagrelor or prasugr el. RESULTS Two hundred ten patients were evaluated (N = 61 DE, N = 149 UC). The primary endpoint occurred in 6 (10%) of the DE and 25 (17%) in UC (P = 0.198). No significant differences were found in the individual rates of the primary composite. No significant differences were found in the rates of the primary outcomes in patients with prior history of MI and diabetes. DISCUSSION De-escalation of DAPT within 30 days of PCI did not lead to a statistically significant difference in rates of adverse cardi ovascular events and major bleeding.

The purpose of this study was to define the top 20 codes billed by the most gynecologic oncology providers to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and to compare utilization of these codes among billing physicians based on gender. METHODS The CMS Physician and Other Supplier Public Use File was analyzed to identify the 20 codes billed by the most gynecologic oncologists in 2016 to CMS. The number of physicians billing and the number of services billed were identified for each code and separated by gender. The average number of services billed by physician gender was calculated. Analysis was performed by means of the Kruskal -Wallis test. RESULTS Among the top 20 codes, a total of 601,877 services were billed in 2016. Male providers billed more services (412,259 ; 68.50%) than female providers (189,618; 31.50%; p = 0.0425). Within these billing codes, there were more male physicians billing than female physicians (p = 0.0138). The average number of services bil led by male versus female providers was not statistically different (p = 0.3867). DISCUSSION For the 20 codes billed by the most gynecologic oncologists to CMS in 2016, more services were billed by male providers and more male providers billed for these services. Though there was no statistical difference in number of cases billed by provider based on gender, disparity in overall billing was seen, likely contributable to the larger number of male providers in the field.

Obstetrics and gynecology (OB -GYN) patients may be reluctant to have students participate in their care. Our study aimed to assess implementation of biography badges during the OB -GYN clerkship to improve patient encounters with medical students. METHODS This prospective study utilized cross -sectional surveys after implementation of biography badges. Each third year OB -GYN clerkship student was given a badge that displayed a QR code that could be scanned by patients, and displayed a profile created by the student. Patients at a single, residency- affiliated OB - GYN clinic were invited to participate in a survey at the end of their visit. Students were invited to complete a survey at the end of their clerkship. RESULTS Nineteen medical students and two patients consented to participate. Most students reported never (47.4%, n = 9) or rarely (42.1%, n = 8) using the badge. Most felt neutral regarding the badges impacting their clerkship experiences (78.9%, 15 of 17). Most students (63.2%, n = 12) did not plan t o use their badge on other clerkships. Out of the two patients, only one reported being shown the badge by the student. Both patients reported students were allowed to perform a basic examination. The patient shown the badge reported feeling very comfortab le with the student performing a medical history and physical exam, and was comfortable having students participate in their future care. DISCUSSION Students felt neutral about the badges and rarely used them during the clerkship. It is unclear whether the biographies improved comfort with medical students due to small sample size.

Type: Poster Opioid Utilization, Education, and Disposal Practices Among OB -GYN Patients and Providers Mariah Jones -Greif of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION The opioid crisis has negatively impacted many people. A substantial number of patients prescribed opioids may not dispose of leftover medication in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations. This study aimed to examine obstetrics and gynecology (OB -GYN) patient and provider utilization, knowledge, and education of opioid disposal techniques. METHODS In this cross -sectional study, surveys were administered to a convenience sample of patients at three local OB -GYN clinics, and OB -GYN providers associated with a single teaching institution. The primary outcome was the percentage of physicians who discuss proper opioid disposal with their patients. Secondary outcomes included knowledge and utilization of opioid disposal techniques among patients and providers. RESULTS Among 34 provider respondents (response rate = 16%), the majority reported never educating their patients about proper opioid disposal (60.6%, n = 20), with the primary reason being lack of knowledge about disposal methods (32.4%, n = 11). Most providers were interested or very interested in receiving education regarding proper disposal of opioids (60.6%, n = 20). Out of 61 patient respondents, 18 patients reported filling an opioid prescription, and 66.7% (12/18) reported having leftover opioids. Ten of the 12 (83.3%) reported keeping them. The majority of patients (59.0%, n = 36) reported they had not been educated about proper disposal of opioids, but 80.3% (n = 49) said they would be more likely to dispose of them if they had received education. DISCUSSION Most physicians do not educate their patients regarding proper opioid disposal bec ause of a lack of disposal knowledge. Patients may dispose of their opioids if they received education regarding proper disposal techniques.

There are no studies assessing medical student participation during their clerkship. The purpose of this study was to assess medical student perceptions, attitudes, and involvement in patient care after completing a rural rotation during the Obstetrics and Gynecology clerkship. METHODS This cross- sectional study utilized an electronic survey administered to third year medical students completing their OB/GYN clerkship at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. The primary outcomes of this study were medical student likelihood to practice in a rural setting, and overall satisfaction with the clerkship. RESULTS Out of 49 respondents, the majority of participants reported an urban hometown (63.3%, n = 31). A little more than one -third of students reported likely practicing in a rural location as their primary clinic setting (34.7%, n = 17). More than half reported likely practicing in a rural location as a satellite clinic (63.3%, n = 31). Out of all respondents, 67.3% (n = 33) were very satisfied with their clerkship experience. Five (10.2%) students participated in a rural rotation during the clerkship. Four of the five rural participants (80%) said they were likely to practice in a rural setting (p = 0.083), and 80% (4/5) were likely to practice at a rural satellite clinic (p = 0.6150). Three of the five rural participants (60%) were very satisfied with the clerkship experience (p = 0.703). DISCUSSION Rural experiences during the OB/GYN clerkship did not affect the overall satisfaction for the clerkship experience. Students participating at rural sites during their OB/GYN clerkship may be likely to practice in rural settings after residency.

The primary aim of this project was to examine a unique population based on its affiliation with a teaching hospital and access to telemedicine to examine if these features can overcome some of these barriers. METHODS This is a prospective study utilizing a cross -sectional web -based survey administered to a convenience sample of patients who sought care between April 2020 and September 2022 at a single private REI clinic. Survey questions included demographics, infertility services utilized, telehealth, and potential barriers to service utilization. Responses were included if any demographic questions were answered. RESULTS Out of 157 responses, respondents were mostly white (89.8%, n = 141) and younger than 35 years ol d (68.2%, n = 107). More than one -third strongly agreed infertility negatively impacted their overall mental health (38.5%, 60/156). Finances (57.1%, 89/156), travel (15.3%, n = 24), providers' religion or beliefs (4.8%, 7/147) and personal religion or beliefs (3.1%, 4/127) were barriers to seeking REI services. There was a statistically significant difference in respondent education status and perceiving their referring provider's religion as a barrier to seeking REI services (p = 0.031). Most respondents participated in a telehealth visit (78.3%, n = 123), and most agreed telehealth visits were beneficial (76.4%, 94/123). Seventeen (10.8%) respondents reported savings of $200 or more using telehealth visits. DISCUSSION Participants reported positive experiences with telehealth and respondents felt their referring providers' religious views did not seem to be a primary barrier to utilization of REI services.

In 2021, a drug shortage led to a shift in dosing protocol to a fixed 400 mg dose at this institution. This study aim ed to evaluate whether 400 mg fixed- dose tocilizumab is non- inferior to weight -based dosing when it comes to escalation of oxygen support in patients with COVID -19. METHODS This retrospective chart revi ew analyzed data from hospitalized COVID -19 patients between March 2020 and August 2022. The primary non- inferiority analysis evaluated the need for oxygen therapy escalation within 48 hours of tocilizumab administration using change from baseline on an or dinal scale. Patients who received tocilizumab before August 13, 2021 were assigned the 8 mg/kg weight -based group (n = 121). Patients weighing above 62.5 kg who received tocilizumab on or after August 13, 2021 were included in the 400 mg fixed- dose group (n = 363). Patients weighing 62.5 kg or less were included in the weight -based group, regardless of administration date. RESULTS The primary outcome of oxygen escalation occurred in 33 (27.3%) patients in the weight -based group and 114 (31.4%) in the fixe d-dose to 1; p = 0.196).There were no differences in the secondary outcomes of seven -day mechanical ventilation rates, ICU length of stay, 28-day mortality, bowel perforation rates, or new or suspected infection rates. DISCUSSION A fixed 400 mg dose of tocilizumab was non- inferior to 8 mg/kg weight -based dosing in preventing oxygen support escalation in patients with COVID -19.

Level: Pharm .D., BCPS Via Christi Regional Medical Center INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether inpatient initiation of paliperidone palmitate in patients with a primary mental health diagnosis had any impact on psychiatric rehospitalizations. METHODS This study was a retrospective, mirror -image chart review study. Data was included from inpatient electronic health records between April 1, 2020 and January 31, 2023. The primary outcome assessed the number of hospitalizations to a psychiatric inpatient unit six months before and six months after in - hospital initiation of paliperidone palmitate . RESULTS Of the 175 patients screened, 113 patients met inclusion criteria. Rehospitalizations to a psychiatric inpatient unit were significantly reduced between the pre -paliperidone and post -paliperidone palmitate group (median 1 hospitalization, IQR 1- 2 vs median 0 hospitalizations, IQR 0- 1, respectively; p<0.001). Secondary outcomes of Emergency Department (ED) and Psychiatric Observation Unit (POU) encounters were not statistically significant, however, all cause hospitalizations were statistically significant (p<0.001). The hospital length of stay was significantly shorter in the post -paliperidone palmitate group (median 0 days, IQR 0- 8.5 days) compared to the pre -paliperidone palmitate group (median 21.5 days, IQR 14 -36 days). The majority of patient s (77% ; 87/112) had a feasible outpatient follow -up plan for obtaining an injection following discharge. The average number of paliperidone palmitate injections received per patient was two injections. DISCUSSION Inpatient initiation of paliperidone palmitate in patients with a primary mental health diagnosis significantly reduced psychiatric rehospitalizations and overall inpatient hospital encounters. There was no difference observed in POU or ED encounters.

This study sought to describe the clinical decision- making process of prehospital behavioral emergencies when paramedics consider ed chemical restraints, and determine the factors associated with choosing specific medications to administer. METHODS Paramedics from a Mid west County in the United States were surveyed from November 18 to 26, 2019. The survey consisted of two open- ended questions, measuring their clinical decision- making process and factors that they considered when selecting a medication. An immersion- cryst allization approach was used to analyze the interviews. RESULTS There was a 53% (79/149) response rate. Six themes emerged regarding the paramedics ' decisions to use medication for cases involving patients with behavioral emergencies: safety of the patients and paramedics; inability to use calming techniques; severity of the behavioral emergency; inability to assess the patient due to presentation; etiology of the behavioral episode; and other factors, such as age, size, and weight of the patient. Six major themes emerged regarding factors paramedics considered when choosing which medication to use in behavioral emergencies: etiology of the behavioral emergency, patient presentation, the patients ' history and age, desired effect and intended outcome of the medication, and other factors. DISCUSSION This study suggests there are several factors, such as safety and the etiology of the behavioral emergency, that contributed to paramedics' decision- making. The results of this study could help Emergency Medical Services administrators in revising behavioral emergency protocols.

A notable amount of content on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are centered around dermatological conditions however, the variability regarding the discussion of these conditions has not yet been explored. The obj ective of this study is to assess and categorize content containing cutaneous conditions in efforts to investigate which platforms incorporate certain types of media. METHODS This qualitative study was conducted by collecting factors, such as views and followers, from three platforms relating to the popularity of 19 dermatological conditions. The platforms studied included YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. The conditions reviewed varied from common skin conditions to rare genetic cutaneous diseases. Analysis was conducted by calculating averages and further stratifying content into categories: curated by patient versus academic center, skin of color content, and advertisements. RESULTS 547 social media posts regarding 19 dermatological conditions were assessed. TikTok contained the most patient created and skin of color content while containing the least number of advertisements. Instagram contained the highest number of advertisements. YouTube comprised the most academic center curated content. Additionally, the top 3 most popular conditions of the 19 searched were noted to be Albinism, Alopecia Areata, and Epidermolysis Bullosa. Alopecia contained the highest number of advertisement -related content. DISCUSSION Social media can prove to be an accessible resource for patients and providers globally through the creation of collaborative content. Some platforms may be more instrumental in knowledge development versus those that may promote product placement.

This study aimed to analyze and identi fy video trends in US adult general psychiatry programs. METHODS Recruitment videos of all general psychiatry residency programs with websites were evaluated between August and November 2022. Program videos were all assessed for certain qualities including length, number, individuals featured, and content. Out of 295 programs listed on the FREIDA website, 281 were assessed and 14 were excluded. Websites were assessed independently by two separate authors, with discrepancies reviewed and decided by a third author. RESULTS Approximately half of the U.S. general psychiatry residency programs include videos (49.11%). Videos varied in length, with the most frequent between two to three minutes (22.7%). Residents were the most common subject (84.1%), followed by program directors (76.1%). Frequent content displayed was program setting (clinic/hospital footage; 79.0%), with regional footage (town/neighborhood) the only other content present in at least half of the videos (50.7%). Resident diversity was addressed in greater than one -third of videos (34.1%) and most programs (<90%) did not include examples of didactics/grand rounds or \"day in the life\" videos. DISCUSSION Recruitment video quantity and content quality varied across programs. Overall, a main conclusi on drawn from analysis is that approximately half of the general psychiatry residency programs do not have a recruitment video on their website. The findings from this study will assist in identifying trends or potential areas of improvement within psychiatry residency recruitment videos.

METHODS A systematic review of eight databases in identifying level I- IV clinical studies published between 1981 and 2021 that reported on burnout in athletes participating in organized sports. Non- athlete burnout, sex or gender differences of burnout not defined, animal or cadaveric studies, review or expert opinion articles, and non- English language articles were excluded. RESULTS Of 2,444 studies, 18 (0.74%) consisting of 5,132 patients met inclusion criteria: 2,793 men (54.4%) and 2,239 women (43.6%). Thirteen of 18 studies (72.2%) utilized the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire as their instrument to evaluate burnout in athletes, while six used a variety of other assessment tools. Ten studies (55.6%) noted no significant difference in burnout between men and women. Seven studies (38.9%) noted an increase in burnout in women compared to men. One study (1/18, 5.6%) found increased burnout in men compared to women. DISCUSSION While some studies noted a significant increase in burnout among women athletes, over half of the studies reported no difference in burnout between genders. The research available is not sufficient to determine a difference in athlete burnout between genders.

A portion of this high re -injury rate is likely due to the lack of a standardized criterion for return to sport (RTS) testing to safely guide the return of athletes to play after a lower extremity injury. Though many utilize hop testing for RTS clearance, no test battery has been officially agreed upon. METHODS A syste matic search of PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, OVID, and Embase databases was conducted to identify clinical studies that included evaluation of a return to sport test or functional test for the lower extremities. Both operative and non- operativ e treatments were included in this review. RESULTS Of 8,705 studies, 65 (0.7%) studies published through October 2021 met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Eighty percent (52/65) of articles discussed RTS for the knee. Furthermore, 96% (50/52) specif ically analyzed RTS following ACLR. The most common RTS test was isokinetic dynamometry testing which is seen in 73% (38/52) of studies. Unfortunately, only 6.2% (4/65) of studies analyzed RTS for the hip and only one study looked at ankle RTS. The remaining studies analyzed healthy participants only. DISCUSSION No standardized criterion for RTS clearance exists for ACL, hip, or ankle injuries. We hope that the suggested test batteries from this review can serve as a framework for future research and valid ation for joint -specific RTS functional testing.

Type: Poster eMOMSTM: Recruitment of Pregnant Populations w ith Elevated BMI in a Feasibility RCT of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION Underrepresentation of pregnant populations in randomized controlled trials of lifestyle change interventions is concerning due to high attrition and pr oviders' limited clinical time. The purpose of this evaluative study was to assess intervention uptake of pregnant individuals enrolled in a three -arm feasibility randomized controlled trial, electronic Monitoring Of Mom's Schedule (eMOMSTM), and examining lifestyle changes and lactation support alone and in combination. METHODS Measures included: (1) participation and completion rates, and characteristics of intervention completers versus other eligible participants; and (2) provider experiences with screening and enrolling pregnant participants. Pregnant people with a pre -pregnancy body mass index 25 and < 35 kg/m 2 were enrolled into the eMOMSTM trial between September 2019 and December 2020. RESULTS Of the 44 consented participants, 35 were randomized, at a participation rate of 35%, and 26 completed the intervention, resulting in a completion rate of 74%. Intervention completers were slightly older and entered the study earlier in pregnancy compared to non- completers. Completers were more likely to be first-time mothers, resided in urban areas, had higher educational attainment, and were slightly more racially and ethnically diverse. A majority of providers reported willingness to participate, believed the study aligned with their organization's mission, and were satisfied with using iPads for screening. DISCUSSION Lessons learned to guide recruitment success include use of: (1) designated research staff in combination with physician support; and (2) user -friendly technology to help mitigate time burde n on physicians and their staff. Future work should focus on successful strategies to recruit/retain pregnant populations in clinical trials.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is suggested for diagnosis but limited by inconsistent findings and incongruent nomenclature. The purpose of this study is to summarize the literature regarding MRI evidence of CMI to allow for more accurate diagnosis and treatment. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in April 2022 to identify studies focused on MRI findings of CMI. Studies examining incidence, clinical correlation, and return to play (RTP) were included. Studies focusing on treatment or other imaging modalities were excluded. RESULTS A total of 1 ,912 studies were identified, 23 of which met inclusion criteria. Of the included studies, 15 assessed the pubic symphysis, 17 assessed adductors, 12 assessed the abdominal wall, and 6 assessed hip flexors. The three most common MRI findings in CMI assessment were bone marrow edema at the pubic symphysis, adductor longus lesions, in asymptom atic patients ranged from 4.7% - 23%. DISCUSSION MRI is a useful tool in determining the presence or extent of CMI, but findings should be considered alongside the clinical presentation of the patient due to high rates of evidence in asymptomatic patient s. MRI is useful in assessing the extent of injury, which can give an accurate time frame for athletes returning to their previous level of activity. Understanding the variable MRI findings associated with CMI allows expedited and specific diagnosis, assis ting with accurate estimated times for RTP.

Understanding the effect of GAHT on transgender bone health and fracture risk is essential.The purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence and locations of fractures in trans compared to cis gender patients while assessing the comorbidities present that may affect fracture risk. METHODS A retrospective analysis of fractures f rom January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2021 was performed with chart review being utilized to identify trans patients. The prevalence and anatomic locations of fractures in trans patients were then compared to that of cis gender patients. Comorbidities of both populations and assessment of bone mineral density with Dual -Energy X -ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans in trans patients was also recorded. RESULTS The transgender population experienced more shoulder and upper arm fractures (p = 0.004) and less lumbar spine fractures (p = 0.009). There was no difference in the anatomic distribution of other fractures.The number of fractures per individual in both cohorts was similar (p = 0.984). The prevalence of hypertension and depression was higher in the trans population (p <0 .001). Osteoporosis was lower in prevalence in the transgender population (p <0 .001). DISCUSSION Fracture prevalence and anatomical location do not seem to be significantly different between the trans and cisgender populations. However, longitudinal prospective studies are needed to better understand the impact of GAHT on fracture risk among transgender patients. An emphasis on adequate charting for gender identity disorders and DXA scans is important for medical management in patients receiving GAH T.

However, the DLIF surgical approach of the L1/L2 spinal level can be obstructed by the ribs. It is unknown if patients undergoing a DLIF with rib removal experience more pain than their counterparts without rib removal. This study sought to determine if there is a difference in post -operative pain among patients with DLIF who had rib removal compared to those who did not. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted with patients who underwent DLIF by a single spine surgeon at Wesley Medical Center between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018. Patients were stratified into two groups - those who experienced a rib removal and those without rib removal. The primary outcome was postoperative pain, measured by a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) visual analog scale. RESULTS A total of 136 patients' data were included in the analysis. There were no differences in patient demographics between the two groups. There was no difference in pain at discharge between patients with rib remov al (7.6, SD 2.1) and those without rib removal (7.8, SD 1.8). In a multivariate model, there was no difference in discharge pain between the two groups; the only variable associated with pain at discharge was morphine milligram equivalents (p = 0.028). DISCUSSION Patients undergoing a DLIF with rib removal expressed no difference in post -operative pain compared to patients without rib removal.

METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted, identifying two cohorts of patients diagnosed with G/E adenocarcinoma. 119 patients met the study inclusion criteria defined as progression on prior chemotherapy and have received ICIs (cohort A: 59 patients) or chemotherapy (cohort B: 60 patients) in third line setting. RESULTS There was no significant difference in OS, PFS, or ORR (using RECIST 1.1) between cohorts (p = 0.9, 0.7, 0.8 respectively). Results showed a chemotherapy cohort with median OS of 8.3 months (m) (95% CI: 5.63- 9.5) compared to ICIs of 5.9m (95% CI: 4.63- 12.07). In the chemotherapy cohort, 15 patients are PD -L1 positive with median OS of 9.1m 5.6) and PFS of 4.27m (95% CI: LL 3.9). In the ICIs cohort, 39 patients are PD -L1 positive with median OS of 4.67m (95% CI: 3.43- 6.87). The chemotherapy cohort has 16 patients with ERBB2 positive with median OS of 8.7m (95% CI: LL 4.8). ICIs cohort has 17 patients with ERBB2 positive status with median OS of 13.6m (95% CI: 7- 21.4). DISCUSSION A trend toward better survival outcome s seen ( including in PD -L1 positive patients) with chemotherapy vs ICIs. HER2 positive status appear s to predict better survival outcome s with ICIs vs chemotherapy. Future larger size cohorts' analysis is needed to better understand the contribution, predictive, a nd prognostic value of multiple pathologic and molecular characteristics of this heterogene ous disease.

Local Health Equity Action Teams (LHEATs) were formed in each of 20 Kansas counties, comprised of local community stakeholders and focused on identifying activities aimed to address underlying social determinants of health. Community health workers (CHWs) were also hired in each county to work directly with at -risk community members. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent that CHWs and LHEAT members use social media to communicate about activities within their networks. METHODS A semi -structured qualitative interview script was developed to assess participants' perceptions of the COPE initiative, including information dissemination to the community about COPE. Interviews were conducted via Zoom, recorded, and transcribed. Data from interviews were coded by the COPE Evaluation Team. RESULTS In total, 40 CHWs and 50 LHEAT members participated. Results varied considerably between participants - though some described no use of social media, many indicated using email, Facebook, and radio -affiliated platforms to disseminate information about COPE events. While most cited using only on-behalf -of-COPE social media postings, some reported using their personal social media accounts for COPE purposes as well. More traditional outreach strategies (e.g. flyers, church bulletins) were also discussed, often engaging people using face -to-face opportunities. DISCUSSION The degree to which COPE members reported using social media was likely associated with each participant's own comfort with and interest in the technology. The socially -isolating circumstances of COVID -19 have accelerated the possibility of leveraging this technology into more effective healthcare outreach.

All have been scrutinized intensely for their safety. It is important to understand and interpret the adverse events or reactions (AERs) associat ed with these vaccines in an objective and analytical manner. The goal of this descriptive study was to provide a resource outlining AERs associated with the three available vaccines in Kansas. METHODS Reports were obtained from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), representing AERs observed in Kansas from December 11, 2020, to May 13, 2021. All data were screened and coded, and descriptive statistics were used to describe AERs based on vaccine manufacturer, patient age, biological sex, and reported deaths. RESULTS Only 0.00068% of COVID -19 vaccine doses given in Kansas were associated with an AER (1,445/2,120,350). There were 4,297 individual AERs reported, and 0.002% of COVID - 19 vaccine doses in Kansas were associated with a death (38/2,120,350). DISCUSSION No reported AERs were unexpected compared to national data, and no VAERs report provided a causal relationship between vaccine administration and death. Providing a resource of potential AERs could aid in individual decisions to receive a vaccine and may help in the control of COVID -19. Future studies in this area may look to identify interventions that alleviate vaccine hesitancy based on perceived or reported side effects.

While the BVI community has hope for FAVs, there is concern for their accessibility. Considering the need to design accessible human- machine interfaces, we conducted a pilot questionnaire study to explore the perceived challenges, information needs, and interface preferences of BVI users when using FAVs. METHODS The questionnaire consisted of both open- ended and rating questions conducted via telephone. Participants were asked their perceived challenges and information needs during the process of using an FAV. Participants also ranked their preferences for interfaces with the vehicle in different contexts within the scenario. RESULTS Participants included 7 individuals with blindness (no light perception or light perception only) and 13 with severe visual impairment (vision worse than 20/200 with at least form perception). Most participants (19/20) stated they would accept FAVs as their main transportation, with concerns about cost, safety, and maintenance. Within the scenario, handling emergencies, finding the destination, and identifying the car were ranked the most difficult. Perceived challenges demonstrated concerns about safety an d functionality of the FAV, and participants desire communication of proper functioning. Human -machine interface preferences included voice and cell phone interaction, and speaking with an assistant during emergencies. DISCUSSION Perceived challenges and interaction preferences regarding fully- autonomous vehicles demonstrate safety concerns and need for sufficient communication with the vehicle via voice interaction or cell phone. Specific needs of people who are BVI when using FAVs should be considered when developing fully -autonomous vehicle user interfaces.

This research examined the accuracy of Hollywood movies depicting DM1 from childhood into adulthood. METHODS We conducted a Google search using \"Diabetes in Movies\" that resulted a list of movies 1971 to 2022. We assessed 11 fictional movies from 2000 through 2022 for accuracy of symptoms, management, and outcomes. RESULTS The most common symptom presented was hypoglycemia; earlier movies depicted severe hypoglycemia and use of glucagon to counteract it. Hypoglycemia was mostly portrayed accurately, although characters' responses to high and low insulin levels were unrealistic. Movies from the early 2000s emphasized checking blood sugar, and a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was recently illustrated. Insulin injection vials were the norm, although in 2022, an insulin pump was shown. Characters struggled with self -awareness and wanted to fit in, whereas few were successful as they managed their DM1. DISCUSSION A small sample of fictional movies have been describing DM1 symptoms accurately, but portraying outdated technology for monitoring and treatment. Insulin pens were rarely seen, although commonly used in the United States. It could be beneficial for future movies to reflect the advances in closed loop CGM/insulin pumps, and its usefulness to prevent hypo/hyperglycemia. Also, it could be influential to include more positive messages about teenagers with controlled DM1 who fit in, despite their chronic illness. Finally, it may heighten awareness if more movies showed consequences of poor DM1 control such as dialysis, amputation, or blindness.

This study evaluates the safety of F/E radiographs among these patients. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of patients (age 14 years) with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15, who sustained a blunt injury with concern for cervical spine injury. RESULTS Of the F/E radiographs performed, 84% were negative, 10.2% were incomplete, 3.2% were positive, and 2% were inconclusive. Three patients (0.6%) who had an initial negative F/E returned to the clinic with complaints concerning cervical myelopathy. All three patients had resolution of their symptoms and no sequelae at future follow -up appointments. Among patients with an incomplete F/E, three (0.6%) had an isolated ligamentous injury confirmed with an MRI. DISCUSSION Study findings suggest that flexion- extension appears to be a radiographically safe exam. However, consideration should be given to performing MRIs on patients who have a F/E that is unable to definitively rule out ligament injury, specifically in those who suffer significant pain and discomfort that prevents performing the F/E.

METHODS Participants were limited to worksites in Kansas that completed a WorkWell Kansas Phase I, II, or III Worksite Assessment or a Pathways to a Healthy Kansas Worksite Assessment from 2013 through 2022. WorkWell Kansas Phases I, II, and Pathways to a Healthy Kansas all used iterations of the same survey. RESULTS Six factors were associated with worksites providing onsite influenza vaccination: the company had a wellness committee, the worksite not yet having implemented wellness programs, having frontline staff on the wellness committee, employees having premium health insurance coverage, the vaccination being fully covered by the employer, and full -time employees being provided insurance through the worksite. Six factors were ass ociated with employees receiving an influenza vaccination: the worksite not yet having implemented wellness programs, having frontline staff on the wellness committee, the wellness committee measuring presenteeism, the vaccination being fully covered by the employer, the type of industry of the worksite, and the employees engage in physical activities that raise their heart rate. DISCUSSION Many factors appear to be related to worksites offering and employees receiving annual employee influenza vaccination rates. In particular, employees having premium health insurance coverage and the worksite wellness committee, including frontline workers , are associated with worksites and employees more likely for provide and receive an annual influenza vaccination.

Most patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and cryptogenic sensory peripheral neuropathy (CSPN) demonstrate axonal injury, with some data suggesting increased likelihood of demyelination in DPN. In this study, we evaluated electrodiagnostic (EDX) parameters across the glycemic spectrum in patients with and without metabolic syndrome. METHODS The Peripheral Neuropathy Research Registry is a prospective cohort of well characterized patients with DPN an d CSPN. 994 patients were grouped based on glycemia (type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or normoglycemia) and presence or absence of metabolic syndrome. We evaluated peroneal motor and sural sensory nerve EDX data normalized across institutions, including conduction velocities, action potential amplitudes, and latencies. The normoglycemic CSPN cohort without metabolic syndrome served as disease control. RESULTS Both DM and metabolic syndrome were more likely to be associate d with abnormal NCS findings. DM patie nts had significantly slowed peroneal motor conduction velocities, reduced sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude, and reduced sural nerve velocities. DM subjects were more likely to have both axonal and demyelinating pathology compared to CSPN subjects. Prediabetic subjects did not differ significantly from CSPN subjects on EDX parameters. Metabolic syndrome was associated with significant slowing of conduction velocity and reduction of action potential amplitude of both sural and peroneal nerves w hen compared to those without metabolic syndrome. DISCUSSION DPN appears to associate with more advanced axonal and demyelinating changes on EDX studies as compared to CSPN, particularly in the presence of metabolic syndrome.

METHODS A retrospective chart review of all the trauma pa tients that required ICP monitor placement was conducted. Comparisons were made between treatment groups. RESULTS General surgery residents placed 94.3% of ICP monitors, 3.6% were placed by attending trauma physicians, and 2.1% by neurosurgeons. Overall minor complications during ICP monitor placement included device malfunction (2.7%) and inaccurate readings (0.5%). There were no major complications during ICP monitor placement. Post -ICP monitor placement complications involved one patient who experienced a central nervous system infection (0.5%) and three patients who had mechanical problems (1.5%). No complications were noted among the neurosurgeon and attending trauma physician treatment groups. DISCUSSION Our results demonstrate that the placement of ICP monitors has been performed safely with no major complications noted in the past 10 years.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is commonly accepted as the cause of this growth. It has been noted in prior research that rural populations face outcome disparities for multiple cancer types when compared to their urban counterparts. Our primary aim was to identify disparities in survival and cause - specific mortality between rural and urban populations with HPV -associated oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS This retrospective, cohort study utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Head and Neck with HPV status database from 2006- 2018. Included adult cases were clinically confirmed head and neck cancers with HPV status confirmed or among HPV -associated sites. Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan- Meier curves were employed to illustrate differences between rural and urban populations with HPV -associated oropharyngeal cancer when it comes to overall survival and cause - specific mortality. RESULTS After controlling for demographics and clinical characteristics, patients with HPV -associated oropharyngeal cancer who lived in rural areas, had a worse overall five -year survival (aHR, 1.29; 95% CI 1.10- 1.50) as compared to urban populations. Further, compared to their urban counterparts, rural patients had a higher risk of cause -specific death among those with HPV -associated oropharyngeal cancers HPV -positive oropharyngeal cancer who reside in rura l areas have poorer survival outcomes when compared to their urban counterparts. Improving rural HPV vaccination rates and raising awareness of the linkage to HPV -associated cancers represent relatively low -cost opportunities for intervention.

This study aimed to evaluate mortality among septic ESRD and/or CHF patients based on the amount of IV fluid received in the emergency department (ED) during the first six hours of admission. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted with three years of data from the University of Kansas Medical Center regarding adult patients admitted from the ED for suspected sepsis with pre -existing ESRD and/or CHF. Demographics, medical history, amount of fluid administered, and primary outcomes (mortality at 72 hours and at discharge) were abstracted. Data were analyzed using SAS v. 9.4. RESULTS Of the 645 patients identified, 410 were excluded due to lack of sepsis diagnosis confirmation. Among the 235 included, 41 died prior to discharge and 17 within the first 72 hours. There was no significant difference in mortality at hospital discharge by the amount of fluid administered. There was a significant decrease in mortality at 72 hours associated with reduced fluid volume (p = 0.019), but this association did not remain signif icant in multivariate analysis. Lower patient weight was associated with greater mortality at 72 hours (p = 0.016). Patients with both ESRD and CHF were 62.4% more likely to die at discharge than patients with one or the other (CI 0.157- 0.9, p = 0.028). DISCUSSION There was no relationship between fluid volume administered in the first six hours and sepsis mortality among patients admitted with ESRD and/or CHF.

Systemic chemotherapy is considered effective treatment for metastatic CRC, but it may not be effective for peritoneal carcinomatosis. To combat this, some institutions have implemented the practice of cytoreductive surgery and subsequent intraoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS - HIPEC). Little is known about the association between the sequencing of chemotherapy on CRS -HIPEC patients' morbidity, recurrence, and survival. Thus, this study sought to evaluate post -operative outcomes among those who received sandwich method chemotherapy (ST) compared to those who received total neoadjuvant chemotherapy (TNT ). METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted with patients who received CRS -HIPEC at one institution. RESULTS Of the 64 patients who met the inclusion criteria 34 received ST. Those who received ST experienced a higher number of readmissions (p < 0.05) and a longer time to readmission than those who received TNT (p < 0.05). Chemotherapy administration method was not associated with other post -operative characteristics (e.g. length of stay, post -operative complications, post -operative mortality, time to OR take back, likelihood of recurrence, or time to recurrence). DISCUSSION The greater number of readmissions among those who received ST was likely due to longer exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, leading to increased morbidity. This increased duration of exposure to chemotherapy likely led to these patients remaining disease -free for longer, increasing time to readmission. As CRS -HIPEC appears to have survival benefits for patients with CRC, it is essential that furthe r research is done regarding CRS -HIPEC treatments.

James Kallail, Ph.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION Phenomenology, as a philosophical field, has long been concerned with the nature of human experience, but very seldom with the nature of experience for those with mental or neurological illnesses. Alzheimer's diseas e has received almost no phenomenological examination. Here the authors will present a phenomenological analysis of the nature of Alzheimer's disease as it relates to forgetting. METHODS The authors examined prior phenomenological thought on the nature of forgetting, principally from the Husserlian perspective, to present a theory of the nature of \"normal\" forgetting. From here, the authors contrast this with the nature of forgetting in Alzheimer's disease as informed by the autobiographical words of a number of published works by individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS Individuals without Alzheimer's are generally aware of their forgetting, but individuals with Alzheimer's disease are often incapable of recognizing that they have forgotten a piece of information. As a result of this aberrant forgetting, individuals with Alzheimer's are more prone to confabulations and other forms of inappropriate memory recall which appear to be completely fabricated. However, these confabulations are not always entirely false. They can occur as a result of the inability to retrieve the entirety of a memory, resulting in the inclusion of inappropriate detail. DISCUSSION The resultant amalgamation of true and false memory appears to the observer as an entirely falsified form of recall, but it may be possible to identify true thoughts and sentiment from such confabulations which can be utilized to better understand the patient, and therefore to better care for the patient.

METHODS Semi -structured interviews were conducted using a script adapted from the World Health Organization's COVID -19 vaccine uptake resource toolkit. Eligible participants had not received a COVID -19 vaccination and were recruited from Sterling Medical Center in Sterling, Kansas. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed to identify recurring themes. RESULTS Five primary themes were identifi ed as reasons for declining COVID -19 vaccination. Participants described 1) no concern for illness from COVID -19 infection, 2) concern of long- term side effects of vaccination and belief that natural immunity provides superior protection, 3) confusion over source trustworthiness for COVID -19 information and distrust of government involvement in vaccine production. When discussing who participants included in their decision- making process regarding COVID -19 vaccination, one theme was identified. Participants reported discussion with immediate family and friends as most influential to their decision. DISCUSSION For participants in this study, vaccine hesitancy was influenced by low concern of infection, perceived long- term risk of vaccination, source trustwor thiness, distrust of government, and perceived superiority of natural immunity. Influence from one's family and friends was an important factor in many participants' decision. Multifaceted communications campaigns and long- term engagement with trusted information sources will likely be necessary to alter uptake of COVID -19 vaccines in rural communities. Primary care providers, pharmacists, nurses and laypersons should all be engaged in efforts to continually present facts to those who remain resistant to re ceiving vaccines.

BASELINE Any patient with a n established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was eligible for referral to the DSMES program. A nutritionist administered our DSMES program. 61 referrals were received with 14 (23%) participants recruited between 07/21 to 04/22. At baseline, the average HgbA1c was 8.8% and, 3/12 patients had HgbA1c 7%. DESIGN Patients were then followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and their HgbA1c was recorded at those intervals. A significant change in the rate of control was tested with McNemar's Chi -squared using the R Programming Language. RESULTS Of the 14 recruited participants, two participants did not have a follow -up HgbA1c level measured to report within the period. The last remeasurement for the participants demonstrated 7 /12 patients with HgbA1c levels at 7% or less, a 60% improvement in patients with a controlled HgbA1c from baseline. At re-measurement, the average HgbA1c was 6.8% demonstrating a 23% reduction in the average HgbA1c. CONCLUSION In this initial assessment of our DSMES project, we found an impr oved control of the HbA1c. We plan to continue and expand the program. The next planned QI project by our team is to work on increasing the referral conversion rate into the DSMES program by addressing identifiable barriers to healthcare including social determinants.

Despite increasing costs of medical school tuition, with an increase of 2.5% an nually, most medical students still find their institutions lacking education in personal and business finance topics. BASELINE The pre-course survey included questions about demographics, familiarity with personal and business finances, debt, and interest levels in financial topics. The post -course survey inquired about the students' changed perspectives on personal and business finance with regards to medicine. DESIGN A one-week elective course was created in January 2022 at the University of Kansas Sc hool of Medicine to assess medical students' knowledge and desire to learn about personal finance. Thirty -eight participants in the personal finance course answered an entry and exit survey with questions assessing their financial literacy, concerns, and interests in the course. RESULTS Students self -reported a high degree of interest, but lack of confidence in their competency to handle their own finances. Majority stated a total debt amount between $25,000 to $75,000 as pre -clinical medical students. The major outcomes of the course included individualized budgets for the participants and an increased fund of knowledge regarding finances in medicine. CONCLUSION Overall, the students reported that they found the course beneficial for their financial futures and that education on the business aspects of medicine should be integrated into the medical curriculum. In summary, medical students desire more education in the realm of personal finance and found this course useful in their financial futures.

Specifically, the fracture risk of anxiolytics remains undefined. BASELINE Therefore, the purpose of this study was to review the literature to assess risk of fracture associated with anxiolytic medications. DESIGN A systematic search of Medline and Embase was conducted to identify clinical studies that included patients who s ustained a fracture while prescribed anxiolytic medications. These studies were then reviewed to evaluate fracture risk associated with anxiolytic medications. RESULTS Of 3,213 studies, 13 (0.4%) met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Anxiolytics defin ed by ATC Class N05B, beta blockers, and zolpidem were specifically included in this review. Benzodiazepines were frequently identified to statistically increase the patient's risk of experiencing a fracture. This risk is reported as high as 2.56 (1.44 -4.57) in 60+ year old patients. Furthermore, the ATC Class N05B showed an increased fracture risk in this class was reported as high as 5.42 (4.86 -6.05) in 55+ year old men and 3.33 (3.03-3.66) in 55+ year old women. CONCLUSION Fractures are a mainstay of tr aumatic injuries and are accompanied by economical, physiological, and psychological hardship. Other anxiolytic medications, such as Zolpidem and beta blockers, show a decrease in fracture risk; however, only one study has been published on each of these m edications. Ultimately, this systematic review helped illuminate the inconsistency of anxiolytic fracture risk assessment while simultaneously illustrating the necessary steps to guide future research.

This is especially true in cases of advanced airway man agement. Protocols are set in place to ensure that less invasive techniques are used initially before more invasive techniques. The purpose of this study was to determine how often EMS personnel followed this protocol, while adequately achieving the goals of appropriate oxygenation and ventilation. DESIGN This retrospective chart review was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Kansas Medical Center. The authors reviewed the Wichita/Sedgwick County EMS system for cases in which patients required airway support. We examined de-identified data to determine if invasive methods were applied in sequence. Cohen's kappa coefficient () and immersion -crystallization approach were used to analyze the data. RESULTS A total of 279 cases were identified in which EMS personnel used advanced airway management techniques. In 90% (n = 251) of cases, less invasive techniques were not used prior to more invasive techniques and in 80% (n = 222) of cases, more invasive techniques were used alone. Dirty airway was the most common reason for using more invasive approaches. CONCLUSION Our data showed that EMS personnel in Sedgwick County/Wichita, Kansas often deviate from advanced airway management protocols. Dirty airway was found to be the main reason for using a more invasive approach. It is important to fully understand reasons why deviations in protocol occur to ensure that current protocols, documentation, and training practices are effective in producing positive patient outcomes.

Testicular tumors are rare, and mostly consist of terato mas, non -seminomatous germ cell tumors , and stromal tumors. Scrotal enlargement and pain are most frequently secondary to vascular compromise or inflammatory processes. Primary testicular lymphoma is an extremely rare entity and is not associated with any specific findings on ultrasound. Treatment failure with the presence of a mass raises concern for an underlying malignant process. This case report aims to discuss an unusual case of isolated primary testicular B -cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in a previously healthy 10- year -old boy. CASE DESCRIPTION A 10- year -old boy with no pertinent past medical history presented to our clinic with a two-day history of abdominal pain, decreased appetite , and right testicular swelling. Ultrasound showed a complex intratesti cular hypoechoic collection concerning an abscess suggesting epididymo -orchitis. Multiple rounds of antibiotics were given without improvement. Testicular germ cell tumor markers (LDH, b- HCG, AFP) were negative. As he had continued redness and pain, a radical inguinal orchiectomy was performed, revealing B -cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Bone marrow aspirate, CSF evaluation, and PET -CT scan were negative for disease elsewhere. The decision was made to start treatment with intensive acute lymphoblastic leukemia chemotherapy per AALL1131 protocol to prevent recurrence. DISCUSSION Isolated testicular presentation of B -cell lymphoblastic lymphoma is very rare , but should be considered in pediatric patients with atypical testicular masses. Although our patient pre sented with localized disease, he was treated with systemic chemotherapy. Such patients may merit intensive acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia type treatment to avoid recurrence.

The most common medication to cause kidney involvement is Allopurinol. In 80% of cases of allopurinol -induced DRESS syndrome, patients had renal impairment before starting the offending agent. This complication was typically seen in the elderly population, but not reported in children. We describe a rare case of minocycline -induced DRESS syndrome in a 13- year -old healthy child complicated by posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and delayed onset acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). CASE DESCRIPTION This is a case of a 13 -year -old boy with a medical history significant for DRESS syndrome, who present ed with altered mental status, hypertension, and acute kidney injury (AKI). He was admitted three weeks prior to presentation for DRESS attributed to minocycline for which he was on a steroid taper. At that time, there was no evidence of renal involvement. Soon after the current admission, he experienced status epilepticus and hypertensive emergency with non- oliguric AKI. CBC showed lymphocytosis and eosinophilia. MRI of the brain was consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Kidney biopsy showed diffuse interstitial edema associated with severe interstitial inflammatory infiltrate with predominant lymphocytes and plasma cells with clusters of eosinophils, consistent with AIN. Subsequently, the steroid dose was increased, which led to complete renal recovery. DISCUSSION This case aims to increase awareness of potential complications of non- allopurinol -induced DRESS syndrome in the pediatric population.

Although the majority of the cases include mild illness with fever and poor feeding in this population, severe illness does cause multiorgan failure presenting as shock with refractory status epilepticus. In this case report, we discuss the presentation, clinical course , and management of two neonates who were admitted to the PICU during the July 2022 outbreak of HPeV. We review the pathogenesis of human parechovirus, treatment strategies , and importance of long term neurologic follow up in these patients. CASE DESCRIPTION A six-day-old female and a six -week -old male presented to our hospital with sepsis, shock , and uncontrolled seizures. Spinal fluid analyses were positive for HPeV with elevated WBC and proteins. They required pentobarbital infusions to control the seizures and were intubated and on vasoactives. They both had a prolonged hospital course with mild neurologic deficits at discharge. DISCUSSION While HPeV -A3 encephalitis is not common, it should still be considered as a possible cause of meningoencephalitis in neonates and young infants with seizures. Treatment of HPeV- A3 encephalitis requires caref ul attention and consideration due to adverse long term neurodevelopmental outcomes. A multidisciplinary team based management is important in caring for critically ill infants. Outbreaks should be monitored with active surveillance , and research focused on host immunity and anti -viral options are important.

However, some studies have found the percentage of patients in remission on lithium monotherapy is only about one -third. The combination of clozapine and lithium can be utilized in the treatment of refractory ill ness. There is a paucity of literature on the combination of these agents and the potential side effects or interactions that can occur. Here we present a case of an adolescent who appeared to develop reversible toxic neurologic symptoms while taking a combination of lithium and clozapine. CASE DESCRIPTION The patient is a 16- year -old female with a past psychiatric history of major depressive disorder who was hospitalized for increasing symptoms of psychosis. She developed manic symptoms including pressure d speech, decreased need for sleep, irritability, and grandiose delusions, prompting a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. Lithium was titrated to a therapeutic range with a level of 0.83 mEq/L. She was then deemed treatment resistant after failing two antipsychotic trials; at which time she was switched to clozapine. The patient's lithium level increased significantly, and she developed symptoms of neurotoxicity despite the level remaining below 1.30 mEq/L. Her symptoms resolved with the d iscontinuation of Lithium. DISCUSSION The combined serotonergic effect of these medications has been proposed as a possible culprit to the increased risk of neurotoxicity. When combining clozapine and lithium, this case shows the importance of using caution, decreasing the dose of both medications, and stringent monitoring of side effects.

Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma may be at increased risk (by 1.91- fold higher) of dementia after radiotherapy, little research exists for those without treatment. This report presents a case of cognitive decline with behavioral disturbances preceding a diagnosis of nasopharyngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma. CASE DESCRIPTION A 76-year -old male, with a history of prostate cancer in remission, was admitted for CHF exacerbation, exhibited aggressive behaviors, and was minimally responsive to oral and intramuscular medications, necessitating physical restraints. There was modest improvement in aggressive outbursts with medicat ion adjustments . Patient developed transient visual hallucinations with persistent disorientation, confusion, and memory impairment , which led to inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. Collateral information revealed a new onset of physical aggression six months prior, followed by an apparent stepwise decline in functioning and progressively increased dependence with activity of daily living. His primary care physician attributed his aggressive outbursts to behavioral disturbances associated with unspecified dementia, initiating a regimen of divalproex sodium delayed release 500 mg twice daily, yielding minimal efficacy. During inpatient psychiatric hospitalization, MRI with and without contrast of the brain and face/neck/orbit showed an aggressive nasopharyngeal tumor protruding through the left foramen lacerum. Biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma. DISCUSSION Dementia is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is thus crucial to perform thorough diagnostic work -up to rule out underlying organic causes, including brain tumors as in our case. The involvement of foramen lacerum in the middle cranial fossa, which houses the temporal lobes, possibly accounts for impairment of memory and other cognitive functions.

This case report depicts partial resolution of oral -buccal -lingual dyskinesia upon discontinuation of levetiracetam. CASE DESCRIPTION An 86- year -old female with a history of seizure disorder was admitted for evaluation of acute encephalopathy due to multiple etiologies, acute -on-chronic kidney injury, bleeding duodenal arteriovenous malformations, an d community- acquired pneumonia. On hospital day three , she developed acute onset choreoathetosis of the tongue that interrupted speech and feeding. Diagnostic work -up, comprised of computed tomography of brain, vitamin B12, folate, thyroid stimulating horm one levels, human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis testing, was unrevealing. Following cross -titration from levetiracetam to divalproex over the course of 21 days, there was global recovery from encephalopathy and ataxia, simultaneous with gradual improvement of her dyskinetic tongue movement, which resolved one week after completion of levetiracetam taper. DISCUSSION Our case highlights the potential implications of levetiracetam in dyskinetic movement, warranting close monitoring of patients taking the medication, particularly in older adults who may be more vulnerable to medication -related adverse effects, as well as consideration of alternative, better tolerated anticonvulsant therapies.

Young infants are most vulnerable to PeV. Severe cases can progress to meningoencephalitis (ME), myocardi tis, or hepatitis. In 2022, an outbreak of PeV ME occurred leading to hospitalization and complications. CASE DESCRIPTION Retrospective chart review was done of PeV ME cases at Wesley from 2017 to 2022 to assess characteristics of PeV cases since intr oduction of the Biofire\u00ae FilmArray\u00ae Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel in April 2017. Frequencies from 2022 cases were analyzed using Chi -squared and T -tests to compare patients with and without seizure. In total, 26 cases of PeV ME were identified, 21 from 2022. Eight patients in 2022 experienced seizures, two with hemodynamic instability and one with confirmed myocarditis. Seven were discharged with anti -epileptic medications, two requiring follow up with rehabilitation therapies. All patients with seizures had brain MRI abnormalities consistent with PeV ME. No significant lab differences between the two groups were seen. DISCUSSION The 2022 PeV outbreak led to a wide range of outcomes with a high rate of seizures. Length of stay and ICU utilization were increased in the seizure group. Thus, seizures were the best indicator for illness severity. Prematurity and younger age were associated with seizures. Cases did not feature classi c clinical or laboratory signs of invasive infection. Clinicians must rely on history, exam, and local epidemiology to guide diagnostic CSF testing to identify patients at risk for severe neurologic outcomes. Further research on the 2022 outbreak can help clinicians better understand PeV and risk factors for severe disease.

Schizophrenia is rare before the age of 12, but psychotic experiences can present as part of other psychiatric disorders, neurologic, genetic, infectious, autoimmune, and other medical conditions. Multiple classes of medications have neuropsychiatric adverse effects and can contribute to psychosis. CASE DESCRIPTION Aseven -year -old female with history of ADHD, asymptomaticUTIs, pyelonephritis, and nocturnal enuresis, treated with oxybutynin,presented and distressed to the hospitalwithvisual and tactile hallucinationsof rats biting her which started that morning. Shehad multiple complaints in the days prior including two episodes of abdominal pain, rhinorrhea, and intermittent cough. The patient'sMethylphenidate ERdosage was increased two weeks prior for ADHD. Pediatricians ordered a urinalysis, drug screen, urine culture and metabolic panel.Psychiatry was consultedandrecommendedholdingMethylphenidate ERand Oxybutynin, due to concerns that both increase dopamine in the brain and have psychosis as a rare side effect. The patient's home Nitrofurantoin was changed to Cefdinir to treat the new E Coli UTI because Nitrofurantoin potentially causes psychosis. Her hallucinations resolved within 48 hours and had not recurred after five months. DISCUSSION Pediatric patients presenting with psychotic symptoms should undergo both a medical and psychiatric evaluatio n, with age, acuity, psychiatric and medical history, and current medications being important clues in appropriate work -up and accurate diagnosis. This case illustrates the importance of considering multiple contributing factors, treating underlying illness, and considering alternative medications with fewer side effects.

He underwent uneventful open carpal tunnel release (CTR) under local anesthesia. CASE DESCRIPTION Although he reported relief of the median paresthesia at the two -week follow -up visit, he complained of new -onset painful snapping in the right palm and associated transient ulnar paresthesia provoked by wrist extension and concomitant digital flexion. On physical exam, there was crepitus and popping at the hook of the hamate (HOH) as the wrist was brought from a palmar flexed to dorsiflexed position. MRI of the wrist revealed the ulnar digital flexor tendons had subluxated from the carpal canal and were positioned palmar to the HOH and adjacent to the ulnar neurovascular bundle. The flexor tendons were displaced by extreme palmar subluxation of the lunate. Plain radiographs of the wrist showed stage III scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) deformity with proximal migration of the capitate and marked palmar subluxation of the lunate. Eight weeks after the index procedure, the HOH was excised through an extended CTR approach. No further snapping with wrist extension was noted intraoperatively and the patient reported complete resolution of symptoms post -operatively. DISCUSSION Snapping wrist from palmar subluxation of the digital flexors over the HOH is a rare complication of CTR. In this case, the underlying cause was extreme palmar subluxation of the lunate from pre -existing SLAC Prompt HOH excision the intermittent flexor tendon snapping and associated ulnar paresthesia.

CASE DESCRIPTION After the dislocated elbow was reduced in the emergency department and the patient was stabilized, his left upper limb orthopaedic injuries were addressed in a staged fashion. During the first stage, three days post -injury, he underwent open debridement, reduction, and internal fixation (ORIF) of the ulna shaft fracture. At the second stage, 13 days post -injury, the comminuted coronoid fracture was approached medially and confirmed to be highly comminuted and irreparable. We elected to perform early coronoid reconstruction using ipsilateral olecranon osteoarticular autograft to restore the greater sigmoid notch with incorporation of the sublime tubercle attachment of the elbow medial collateral ligament and repair of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament to restore elbow stability and to minimize the likelihood o f post -traumatic elbow arthrosis. At the third stage, 15 days post -trauma, the patient underwent ORIF of the distal radius fracture. Three -year follow -up revealed a satisfactory outcome, the patient having returned to work as a farmer with functional elbow range of motion. DISCUSSION Early reconstruction of a highly comminuted coronoid fracture may be a useful salvage option for the polytrauma patient, thereby avoiding complications associated with late reconstruction of post - traumatic elbow instability.

CASE DESCRIPTION A 37- year -old female with intermittent asthma and allergic reactions to certain foods, cefaclor, Tdap vaccine and first dose of Pfizer COVID -19 vaccine, presented to the ER with hives, pruritus and syncope immediately after the second COVID -19 Pfizer vaccine. She was successfully stabilized after 72- hours on an epinephrine drip. One week after, she was admitted to the ICU for a month -long stay for persistent anaphylactic -like symptoms of neck soft -tissue swelling, stridor, dyspnea, urticaria, and tachycardia. Diagnostic testing showed low tryptase and normal complement levels and no vocal cord dysfunction on laryngoscopy. She was treated with epinephrine, antihistamines, high- dose steroids, omalizumab and montelukast. Over the next six months since her ICU discharge, she has had four hospitalizations due to complications with throat -swelling, dyspnea, and pneumonia. As of today, she continues to have persistent angioedema, stridor and urticaria that is treated with antihistamines, omalizumab, tacrolimus, and intermittent steroids. DISCUSSION We would like to shine light on our patient's current battle to control her illness and present her current treatment regimen for other patients who may face the same condition. Ultimately, we would like to push to broaden the known adverse effects of the COVID -19 vaccine and propose a treatment regimen.

It is often triggered by acute illness, surgery, or medications and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Demand ischemic myocardial in farction is a common complication of hypothyroidism and can be exacerbated by a myxedema crisis. CASE DESCRIPTION A 72- year -old female with a history of thyroidectomy due to papillary thyroid cancer presented with confusion and altered mental status. On presentation, the patient was dysarthric, hypotensive, and hypothermic. Physical exam showed periorbital edema, macroglossia, skin cold to touch, and puffiness on extremities. Medical reconciliation revealed that the patient was recently started on an oral proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Laboratory workup showed multiple electrolyte imbalances and elevated troponins without ischemic changes on EKG. Electrolytes were aggressively replaced, and the patient was immediately started on a heparin drip and intravenous (IV) levothyroxine with continued IV replacement until the patient improved. No invasive cardiac intervention was warranted during the inpatient stay. The patient 's clinical status improved and was discharged on optimal medical therapy with outpatient endocrinology and cardiology follow -up. DISCUSSION This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and management of the myxedema crisis to prevent complications. The patient's crisis was likely caused by a sub- optimal dose of levothyroxine and reduced absorption due to oral proton pump inhibitor use. Proper dose adjustments of thyroid replacement therapy are crucial during illness or medication changes to prevent myxedema crisis and related cardiac risks.

Extensive Cardiac Reconstructive Surgery Disease Consultants INTRODUCTION Multivalvular Endocarditis (MVE) carries high mortality and may warrant early surgical repair. We present a case of MVE secondary to raccoon bites. CASE DESCRIPTION A 41- year -old male presented to urgent care with a history of multiple pet raccoon bites and swelling of his wrists for four days with fevers and chills. Broad- spectrum antibiotics were started. Two days later, the patient was found confused and naked in a parking lot. He was in septic shock on arrival to the hospital. Joint aspirate grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. An initial echocardiogram (ECHO) revea led an ejection fraction 40- 45% and a bicuspid aortic valve with mild regurgitation. The patient's status declined on day two and he developed lower limb purpuric lesions. A repeat ECHO showed vegetations on the anterior mitral valve (MV) (4.7 cm x 0.7 cm), tricuspid valve (TV) (1.4 cm X 1.1 cm) and the non- coronary fused cusp of the aortic valve (4 mm X 10 mm) , with severe aortic and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Further imaging revealed multiple occipital infarcts likely due to septic emboli. Ultimately, he was transferred to a higher facility for surgical intervention, and underwent placement of an aortic homograph, replacement of the aorto -mitral repair/vegetation resection, and epicardial decortication. A biventricular pacemaker was placed due to development of complete heart block. DISCUSSION Early valve surgery is indicated in MVE with progressing heart failure, risk of vegetation embolization, and complicated infection. Clinicians should remain vigilant for c omplications from MVE while awaiting definite treatment.

It is often misdiagnosed as chronic pulmonary thromboembolism due to its clinical and radiological resemblance. Thus, early diagnosis is paramount and determines patient outcome. CASE PRESENTATION In this c ase report, we present a n 81-year -old male patient with a past medical history of coronary artery disease with a remote percutaneous intervention (PCI), history of melanoma of the left shoulder (T3b, N0), presents for progressive shortness of breath. Physi cal exam was positive for a left parasternal mid-systolic rate 3/6. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed significant insufficiency and stenosis of the pulmonary valve with a very large, highly mobile echogenic structure within the valve and through the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) system. Further diagnostic testing with functional cardiac MRI with gadolinium and computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirmed the presence of the mass. Eventually, the patient underwent surgical resection of the mass, reconstruction of the main pulmonary artery, pulmonary valve, and RVOT. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of primary intimal sarcoma. DISCUSSION We report a rare case of primary intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery. High clinical suspicion and radiological findings prompted early intervention; otherwise, the patient would have had a poor prognosis.

This case highlights the implication of status epilepticus in prolonged delirium, and the overlapping symptoms of potentially nonconvulsive subclinical seizures and persistent delirium. CASE DESCRIPTION A 64- year -old female with history of resected bifrontal meningioma and breast cancer presented with acute onset aphasia, left gaze preference and right facial twitching, consistent with left frontal seizures status epilepticus, confirmed by 24- hour continuous EEG monitoring. She required intubation for eight days, during which she continued to have intermittent frontal seizures. Two days after being extubated, she developed agitated behaviors, hallucinations, and delusions, warranting antipsychotics. Her antiepileptic regimen included Lacosamide and Depakote. One month after admission, she became more lethargic and had leukocytosis with left shift. No source of infection was identified, and leukocytosis resolved with empiric antibiotics. However, this presumed infection shifted her illness trajectory from hyperactive to hypoactive delirium, demonstrated in background slowing on EEG. Patient has since exhibited disorientation, somnolence, apathy, and is fully dependent on ADLs. DISCUSSION Our case features the multifactorial nature of delirium and further reinforces the presence of multiple, repeated neuropsychiatric insults as predisposing factors for persistent disease. Thorough analysis of pre-existing illnesses, medication, and aggressive investigation into treatable underlying causes will facilitate early recognition and management of delirium.

In particular, the Surpass Streamline flow diverter (SSFD) possesses four attributes, (1) utilization of an over -the-wire (OTW) delivery system, (2) greate r device length, (3) larger potential diameter, and (4) propensity to open in tortuosity, that may offer an important advantage in facilitating the safe and effective treatment of anatomically complex cerebrovascular pathologies . A retrospective review was conducted of cases at The University of Kansas Health Systems from 2019 to 2021 in which patients underwent embolization with the SSFD system. CASE DESCRIPTION We selected four cases with challenging anatomical considerations in which we leveraged the unique properties of the SSFD. Case 1 leveraged greater potential device diameter to embolize a large, recurrent vertebral artery aneurysm. Case 2 leveraged greater device length and propensity to open in tortuosity to manage a symptomatic 20mm cavernous carotid aneurysm. Case 3 utilized greater device diameter, length, and the OTW delivery system to treat a giant intracranial aneurysm previously treated by surgical ligation and high- flow bypass. Case 4 employed greater diameter, length, and the OTW delive ry system to treat a giant, symptomatic, dolichoectactic vertebrobasilar aneurysm. Embolization using the SSFD system resulted in successful and safe management in these challenging cases. DISCUSSION The SSFD has several unique attributes that can prove beneficial in the management of complex cerebrovascular pathologies. Increased awareness of these attributes may allow for a larger number of cases to be treated with the proven mechanism of flow diversion.

Patients are at increased risk for infection, dehydration, and malnutrition. Due to the quality and severe thickening of the skin, many common practices used in anesthesia are not possible in these patients, resulting in the need for creative problem solving. CASE DESCRIPTION A 25- year -old female with suspected lamellar ichthyosis presented for shoulder surgery. The patient had severe skin thickening, ectropion, and eclabium. Due to her skin, there were difficulties in placing the intravenous catheter and securing monitoring devices. The patient's eyes could not close due to ectropion. The patient's condition was not communicated to the team, which led to a delayed surgery starting time. DISCUSSION Placing IV catheters can be formidable in these patients so concurrent ultrasound guidance may be necessary. Securing monitors with adhesive can also be challenging or can cause skin trauma and increased risk of infection. Ichthyosis patients with ectropion may require al ternative methods for protecting the cornea. Careful positioning and temperature monitoring are necessary due to both increased risk of skin trauma and either hyper or hypothermia. Patients with ichthyosis require special considerations in anesthesia management, including potentially difficult IV placement, trouble securing monitors with adhesive, alternative eye protection, and potential difficult airway. Effective communication between pre -operative evaluation and the anesthesia team is essential to ensure proper preparation and management of the patient.
