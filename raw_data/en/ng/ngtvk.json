About 75% of flatus is derived from colonic bacterial fermentation of ingested nutrients and endogenous glycoproteins. Gases include hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Flatus odor correlates with hydrogen sulphide concentrations. Swallowed air (aerophagia) and diffusion from the blood into the lumen also contribute to intestinal gas. Gas diffuses between the lumen and the blood in a direction that depends on the difference in partial pressures. Thus, most nitrogen (N2) in the lumen originates from the bloodstream, and most hydrogen in the bloodstream originates from the lumen. Etiology of Gas-Related Complaints There are 3 main gas-related complaints: excessive belching, distention (bloating), and excessive flatus, a number causes ( see Table: [Some Causes of [ Some Causes of Gas-Related Complaints ](/professional/gastrointestinal-disorders/symptoms-of-gastrointestinal-disorders/gas-related-complaints#v55561389) ). Infants 2 to 4 months of age with recurrent crying spells often appear to observers to be in pain, which in the past has been attributed to abdominal cramping or gas and termed colic. However, studies show no increase in H2 production or in mouth-to-cecum transit times in colicky infants. Hence, the cause of infantile [colic](/professional/pediatrics/symptoms-in-infants-and-children/colic) [ Colic Colic is frequent and extended periods of crying for no discernible reason in an otherwise healthy infant. Although the term colic suggests an intestinal origin, etiology is unknown.... read more ](/professional/pediatrics/symptoms-in-infants-and-children/colic) remains unclear. Excessive belching Belching (eructation) results from swallowed air or from gas generated by carbonated beverages. Aerophagia occurs normally in small amounts during eating and drinking, but some people unconsciously swallow air repeatedly while eating or smoking and at other times, especially when anxious or in an attempt to induce belching. Excessive salivation increases aerophagia and may be associated with various gastroesophageal (GI) disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease), ill-fitting dentures, certain drugs, gum chewing, or nausea of any cause. Most swallowed air is eructated. Only a small amount of swallowed air passes into the small bowel; the amount is apparently influenced by position. In an upright person, air is readily belched; in a supine person, air trapped above the stomach fluid tends to be propelled into the duodenum. Excessive eructation may also be voluntary; patients who belch after taking antacids may attribute the relief of symptoms to belching rather than to antacids and may intentionally belch to relieve distress. A rare cause of excessive belching is supragastric belching. In supragastric belching, a rapid entry of air into the esophagus is expelled after tensing the abdomen. It may occur under volition or unconsciously and can severely affect quality of life ( [1](/professional/gastrointestinal-disorders/symptoms-of-gastrointestinal-disorders/gas-related-complaints#v60970176) [ Etiology reference The gut contains < 200 mL of gas, whereas daily gas expulsion averages 600 to 700 mL after consuming a standard diet plus 200 g of baked beans.

Distention (bloating) Abdominal bloating may occur in isolation or along with other GI symptoms in patients with functional disorders (eg, aerophagia, nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome) or organic disorders (eg, ovarian cancer, colon cancer). Gastroparesis (and consequent bloating) also has many nonfunctional causes, the most important of which is autonomic visceral neuropathy due to diabetes; other causes include postviral infection, drugs with anticholinergic properties, and long-term opiate use. However, excessive intestinal gas is not clearly linked to these complaints. In most healthy people, 1 L/hour of gas can be infused into the gut with minimal symptoms. It is likely that many symptoms are incorrectly attributed to \"too much gas.\" On the other hand, some patients with recurrent GI symptoms often cannot tolerate small quantities of gas: Retrograde colonic distention by balloon inflation or air instillation during colonoscopy often elicits severe discomfort in some patients (eg, those with irritable bowel syndrome) but minimal symptoms in others. Similarly, patients with eating disorders (eg, anorexia nervosa, bulimia) often misperceive and are particularly stressed by symptoms such as bloating. Thus, the basic abnormality in patients with gas-related symptoms may be a hypersensitive intestine. Altered motility may contribute further to symptoms. Excessive flatus There is great variability in the quantity and frequency of rectal gas passage. As with stool frequency, people who complain of flatulence often have a misconception of what is normal. The average number of gas passages is about 13 to 21/day. Objectively recording flatus frequency (using a diary kept by the patient) is a first step in evaluation. Flatus is a metabolic byproduct of intestinal bacteria; almost none originates from swallowed air or back-diffusion of gases (primarily nitrogen) from the bloodstream. Bacterial metabolism yields significant volumes of hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen is produced in large quantities in patients with malabsorption syndromes and after ingestion of certain fruits and vegetables containing indigestible carbohydrates (eg, baked beans), sugars (eg, sorbitol). In patients with disaccharidase deficiencies (most commonly lactase deficiency), large amounts of disaccharides pass into the colon and are fermented to hydrogen. Celiac disease, tropical sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, and other causes of carbohydrate malabsorption should also be considered in cases of excess colonic gas. Methane is also produced by colonic bacterial metabolism of the same foods (eg, dietary fiber). However, about 10% of people have bacteria that produce methane but not hydrogen. Carbon dioxide is also produced by bacterial metabolism and generated in the reaction of bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. Hydrogen ions may come from gastric hydrochloric acid or from fatty acids released during digestion of fats\u2014the latter sometimes produces several hundred mEq of hydrogen ions. The acid products released by bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates in the colon may also react with bicarbonate to produce carbon dioxide. Although bloating may occasionally occur, the rapid diffusion of carbon dioxide into the blood generally prevents distention. Diet accounts for much of the variation in flatus production among individuals, but poorly understood factors (eg, differences in colonic flora and motility) may also play a role. Despite the flammable nature of the hydrogen and methane in flatulence, working near open flames is not hazardous. However, gas explosion, even with fatal outcome, has been reported during jejunal and colonic surgery and colonoscopy, when diathermy was used during procedures in patients with incomplete bowel cleaning.

J Neurogastroenterol Motil 21(3):398-403, 2015. doi: 10.5056/jnm15002 Evaluation of Gas-Related Complaints History History of present illness in patients with belching should be directed at finding the cause of aerophagia, especially dietary causes. In patients complaining of gas, bloating, or flatus, the relationship between symptoms and meals (both timing and type and amount of food), bowel movements, and exertion should be explored. Certain patients, particularly in the acute setting, may use the term \"gas\" to describe their symptoms of coronary ischemia. Changes in frequency and color and consistency of stool are sought. History of weight loss is noted. Review of systems should seek symptoms of possible causes, including diarrhea and steatorrhea (malabsorption syndromes such pancreatic insufficiency) and weight loss (cancer, chronic malabsorption). Past medical history should review all components of the diet for possible causes (see table ). Physical examination The examination is generally normal, but in patients with bloating or flatus, signs of an underlying organic disorder should be sought on abdominal, rectal, and (for women) pelvic examination. Red flags The following findings are of concern: Weight loss Blood in stool (occult or gross) \"Gas\" sensation in chest Interpretation of findings Chronic, recurrent bloating or distention in a patient with abdominal pain that is related to defecation and associated with change in frequency or consistency of stool but without red flag findings suggests [irritable bowel syndrome](/professional/gastrointestinal-disorders/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs) [ Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by recurrent abdominal discomfort or pain with at least two of the following characteristics: relation to defecation, association with a change in frequency... read more ](/professional/gastrointestinal-disorders/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs/irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs) . Long-standing symptoms in an otherwise well young person who has not lost weight are unlikely to be caused by serious physiologic disease, although an [eating disorder](/professional/psychiatric-disorders/eating-disorders/introduction-to-eating-disorders) [ Introduction to Eating Disorders Eating disorders involve a persistent disturbance of eating or of behavior related to eating that Alters consumption or absorption of food Significantly impairs physical health and/or psychosocial... read more ](/professional/psychiatric-disorders/eating-disorders/introduction-to-eating-disorders) should be considered, particularly in young women.

Malabsorption can affect macronutrients (eg, proteins, carbohydrates, fats)... read more ](/professional/gastrointestinal-disorders/malabsorption-syndromes/overview-of-malabsorption) . Testing Testing is not indicated for belching unless other symptoms suggest a particular disorder. Testing for carbohydrate intolerance (eg, lactose, fructose) with breath tests should be considered particularly when the history suggests significant consumption of these sugars. Testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth should also be considered, particularly in patients who also have diarrhea, weight loss, or both, preferably by aerobic and anaerobic culture of small-bowel aspirates obtained during upper GI endoscopy. Testing for bacterial overgrowth with hydrogen breath tests, generally glucose-hydrogen breath tests, is prone to false-positive (ie, with rapid transit) and false-negative (ie, when there are no hydrogen-producing bacteria) results. Testing for rare conditions such as sucrase-isomaltase deficiency can be considered in patients with refractory or severe symptoms ( [1](/professional/gastrointestinal-disorders/symptoms-of-gastrointestinal-disorders/gas-related-complaints#v60970184) [ Evaluation reference The gut contains < 200 mL of gas, whereas daily gas expulsion averages 600 to 700 mL after consuming a standard diet plus 200 g of baked beans.

New, persistent bloating in middle-aged or older women (or those with an abnormal pelvic examination) should prompt pelvic ultrasonography to rule out ovarian cancer. Evaluation reference 1. [Husein DM, Rizk S, Naim HY](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7822125/): Differential effects of sucrase-isomaltase mutants on its trafficking and function in irritable bowel syndrome: Similarities to congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. Complaints Belching and bloating are difficult to relieve because they are usually caused by unconscious aerophagia or increased sensitivity to normal amounts of gas. Aerophagia may be reduced by eliminating gum and carbonated beverages, cognitive behavioral techniques to prevent air swallowing, and management of associated upper GI diseases (eg, peptic ulcer). Foods containing unabsorbable carbohydrates should be avoided. Even lactose-intolerant patients generally tolerate up to 1 glass of milk drunk in small amounts throughout the day. The mechanism of repeated belching should be explained and demonstrated. When aerophagia is troublesome, behavioral therapy to encourage open-mouth, diaphragmatic breathing and minimize swallowing may be effective. Drugs provide little benefit. Results with simethicone, an agent that breaks up small gas bubbles, and various anticholinergics are poor. Some patients with dyspepsia and postprandial upper abdominal fullness benefit from antacids, a low dose of tricyclic antidepressants (eg, oral nortriptyline 10 to 50 mg once/day), or both to reduce visceral hypersensitivity. Complaints of excess flatus are treated with avoidance of triggering substances (see table ). Patients can try reducing their intake of the triggering substances one at a time and noting the effect on their symptoms. Roughage (eg, bran, psyllium seed) may be added to the diet to try to increase colonic transit; however, in some patients, worsening of symptoms may result. Patients can also try a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet. Activated charcoal can sometimes help reduce gas and unpleasant odor; however, it stains clothing and the oral mucosa. Charcoal-lined undergarments are available. Probiotics may also reduce bloating and flatulence by modulating intestinal bacterial flora, but data in this area are limited. Antibiotics are useful in patients with documented bacterial overgrowth. Certain aromatic oils (carminatives) can relax smooth muscle and relieve pain caused by cramps in some patients. Slow-release peppermint oil is the most commonly used agent in this class. Functional bloating, distention, and flatus may run an intermittent, chronic course that is only partially relieved by therapy. When appropriate, reassurance that these problems are not detrimental to health is important. Key Points Testing should be guided by the clinical features. Be wary of new-onset, persistent symptoms in older patients.
