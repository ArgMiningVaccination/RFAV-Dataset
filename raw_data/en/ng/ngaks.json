This article gives details of most useful homeopathy remedies for kidney stones that can reduce the [kidney stone pain](https://hpathy.com/cause-symptoms-treatment/kidney-pain/) and help to dissolve or expel them. Kidney stones, also called renal calculi, are solid concretions (crystal aggregations) of dissolved minerals in urine; calculi typically form inside the kidneys or bladder. Nephrolethiasis refers to renal stone disease; urolithiasis refers to the presence of stones in the urinary system. The majority of stones consist of calcium, usually as calcium oxalate, but they can contain uric acid, and struvite (magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate). What causes kidney stones? The kidneys are the vital organs of our body that filter waste products from the body. Sometimes there is deposition of mineral made up of calcium, uric acid and amino acid cysteine causes kidney stones. Several factors increases the risk for developing kidney stones, including inadequate fluid intake and dehydration, reduced urinary volume etc. anything that blocks or reduces the flow of urine also increases the risk. Infection - Organisms such as proteus, pseudomonas, and klebsiella produce recurrent UTI. These organisms produce urea and cause stasis of urine which precipitate stone formation. Nucleus of the stone may harbor these bacteriae. Hot climate - Causes increase in concentration of solutes, resulting in precipitation of calcium which forms calcium oxalate stones. Dietary factors - Diet rich in red meat, fish, eggs, can give rise to aciduria. - Diet rich in calcium, tomatoes, milk, and spinach produce calcium oxalate stones. - Diet lacking in vitamin A causes desquamation of renal epithelium which precipitates calcium and alters it and kidney stones formation occurs. Metabolic causes - Hyperthyroidism increases serum calcium levels resulting in hypercalcinosis and pelvic stones. - Gout increases uric acid levels and causes multiple uric acid kidney stones. Immobilization - Paraplegic patients secrete large amounts of calcium in the urine resulting in calcium oxalate kidney stones. Inadequate urinary drainage - As in case of hoarse shoe kidney, unascended kidneys are more vulnerable for development of stones due to stasis. Other causes of renal stones include - Less urinary citrate - Any injury to renal epithelium Types of kidney stones - Calcium oxalate stones - Phosphate stones - Uric acid stones - Cystine stones - Xanthine and indigo stones Symptoms of kidney stones A kidney stone usually does not produce symptoms while it is lying silent in the kidneys. However, once it moves, it causes intense pain. The kidney stone pain usually appears first in the back, just below the ribs. Over severe hours or days, the pain follows the stone's course through the ureter toward the groin. Pain stops when the stone passes. The classic presentation of symptoms of kidney stones in a patient feeling intense pain in loin or renal angle or from renal angle extending towards urethra.

USG Kidney ultrasonography is an easily performed, noninvasive, nontoxic test to determine obstructive changes such as hydronephrosis. Diagnosis of the stone and size can be made out. Exact location of the stone can be made out. IVP To locate the kidney stones exactly in relation to kidney and ureter and to asses renal function. Urine culture and sensitivity Urine culture of midstream sample may indicate UTI. Urinalysis may be normal, or may show increased specific gravity and acid or alkaline pH suitable for different types of stone formation. Other urinalysis findings include haematuria., crystals (urate, calcium, or cystene), casts, and pyuria with or without bacteria and white blood cells.

The general measures or advises which should be given to the patient regardless of the type of stone are: \u00b7 Fluid intake should he high at all times. Fluids should be taken at bed time so that nocturia will occur. This will prevent dehydration. \u00b7 Avoidance of milk, cheese and great deal of calcium should be advised. If renal function is satisfactory, sodium cellulose phosphate 5 g T.D.S. with meals should be prescribed to reduce calcium absorption. \u00b7 Urine should be kept acid all the time. Alkalies should be prohibited or used in lesser quantities in those patients who are suffering from peptic ulcer. \u00b7 Vitamin D should be stopped or used in very low quantity. \u00b7 Patients with hyperuricemia should avoid red meats, offal and fish, which are rich in purines, and should receive treatment with allopurinol. \u00b7 Eggs, meat and fish are high in sulphur containing proteins and should be restricted in patients with cystinuria. How effective is homeopathy in the treatment of kidney stones? Homeopathy is very effective in treating kidney stones. Phosphate stones easily pass out as sand and most oxalate stones between size 3 mm to 8 mm come out within days with the right homeopathic medicine. The exact duration depends on the size of stone, shape of stone and location of stone. Stones that are still lying in kidney take longer to flush, esp stones in the lower calyx take longest. Stones in the upper and middle calyx tend to come out relatively quicker. Smaller stones move out more quickly. Stones that have already come down to /are stuck at / lower vesico-ureteric junction, sometimes come out within hours, but will take a few days in most cases. Kidney stones that are larger than 9 mm can also pass with homeopathy but need more skilled practitioners and a more precise simillimum. I have personally seen stones up to 15 mm passing out with homeopathic medicines.
