Are we our thoughts? Many psychologists would say no - thoughts are a constant hum in one's mind, sometimes we act on them and sometimes we don't. They're certainly important in establishing us, who we are, but they aren't everything. Are we our appearance? How we choose to present ourselves gives others an indication into who we are, and how we want to be perceived. But clothes, jewellery, make-up and other physical things can only give people a surface level impression of what a person is. The interior life, identity, thoughts, will remain unknown until we decide to express ourselves, and allow others into the sanctum of our being. The truth is, what makes up a person is a fascinating and beautiful blend of so many different elements and factors. Think about what you do with your day, your routine. Maybe you work nine-to-five in a big city. What is your morning routine? What do you have for breakfast? What does your workout involve? When you walk to the subway, do you take a more scenic route? Do you offer your seat to someone who looks like they need it? Do you like to go for a walk during your break and take in some nature, wherever you can find it? All of these decisions help to craft your person, to paint a picture, always adding new layers of paint to embellish the beauty that's already there. And there are three things that drive this motion through the world: your mind, your body and your heart. While these three things are all connected, like everything else in the body, and indeed the world, they play incredibly unique roles in how we appear to others and to ourselves too. The body is our vessel, and much like a ship it needs to be maintained and cleaned and looked after for it to function at its highest possible level. The body is incredibly powerful, strong, resilient, but also amazingly sensitive - we know very quickly when something isn't right with it. If we look after our internal body, feed it the right things, nurture it with energy from nature, the sun, the sea, our outward reflection will show it too. Diet is incredibly important to this. I have a macrobiotic vegan diet, with grains, beans and vegetables at its core. This means the risk of the disease is dramatically lowered, especially for that most important of organs: the heart. The heart is a magical thing, powered by the electricity of the universe, that keeps energy flowing throughout your entire system. Aside from being the thing that keeps us alive, keeps us going, it's the symbolic centre of all the beautiful emotions we're lucky to have on this earth; love, passion, desire, devotion, intimacy. A healthy heart means a great access to the wonders of the world. The main thing that needs to be kept clean, in my humble opinion, is the mind. Imagine wearing a pair of glasses, but they're covered in fingerprints, dirt, muck, water. You wouldn't be able to see where you were going, what is in front of you, the direction you need to take to get where you're going. But with clarity and cleanliness the world opens up in front of you and you can choose the correct path. The perceptions we make through the power of our minds can change and fluctuate based on where we want them to go and what we want them to do. So we have these three entities: the body, the heart, the mind. The car, the engine, the driver. And for these all to work in tandem they must be kept safe, cared for to equal levels. Once we find ourselves unbalanced, we run the risk of falling, like a tightrope walker. The positive vibration of the earth can, and will, steer us in the right direction - but we have to let it. If you ever think 'something isn't right', ask yourself: heart, body, mind - are they all in sync? Are they as healthy as they could be, am I doing everything I can to ensure that they are always level, connected, united, working as one? They are a team, and a team only wins when it pulls together, in the same direction, for the same goal. Written "}
