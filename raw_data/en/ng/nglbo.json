The materialistic physicians will be entrusted with the task of expelling the souls from mankind\". 1917 The world is in a massive upheaval that is impacting all of humanity. I've written about this Time of Transition and its implications in light of the evolution of consciousness in my article There are impending food shortages, the threat of economic collapse, inflation, recession, as well as new \"diseases\" and \"pandemics\" announced by the \"elite,\" all of which push people more into fear and animalistic survival instinct. Over the past 2.5 years, billions of people have become traumatized because of the Corona/Covid psy-op plandemic, pushing them to get injected with an experimental mRNA vaccine for their \"health\" and \"protection\" under the pretense to get their \"normal\" life back and \"to do the right thing\". Yet, there is no normal to get back to. We are witnessing a global mental health crisis due to the lockdowns, masking, surveillance, and loss of freedom. The repercussions will affect many future generations if people don't take care of their emotional, psychological, and spiritual well-being besides their physical health. A few months ago, I came across a 100-page pdf document, \" It contains some excerpts that were translated from the 491-page book originally published in German titled \" According to Thomas Mayer, I'm very grateful and impressed with Mayer's in-depth research, careful analysis, and presentation of a topic that most people may reject right away or find \"too far out there\" as it may offend their materialistic worldview and beliefs about reality. It's certainly not a book for everyone, nor is everyone ready for it, similar to the topics covered on my website. However, in my humble opinion, it's one of the most important books written in this day and age in light of the times we're in, especially for anyone engaged in any spiritual work. The book's content is deeply revealing, confirming, and disturbing at the same time. Thomas Mayer and his team of \"supersensible\" practitioners and researchers verify my research and insights into the adverse spiritual/metaphysical consequences of the COVID vaxx (and the long-range For any readers new to my work, I recommend looking into the articles in these two categories for context: For the bigger picture context, keep in mind the ultimate goal of the matrix agenda, which has been building up for thousands of years (as I've written in more depth in my essay It is about a complete take-over of the physical vehicle (body) by the occult anti-divine forces, priming and genetically modifying human bodies for opportunities.\" In short, full-on body-snatching and possession via dislodging the spirit/essence from This \" hybridization program\" is priming humanity's transmutation into shell vessels for hyperdimensional possession. There more the soul is anchored in the body, the more we bring forth essence, dismantle the false self and connect to the Divine, and the less any adverse forces can get to us or have any negative effect on us. This article will mostly contain excerpts and case studies from Mayer's book to summarize his work along with my comments and additional insights from other teachings and modalities I've studied and practiced myself. As I mentioned before, the spiritual/metaphysical consequences of the COVID vaccines are far more detrimental and far-reaching than the physical adverse effects, for they affect the afterlife and interfere with soul evolution. Before we start, it is imperative to emphasize a crucial point as a disclaimer before getting into this material: I see a tendency in today's \"truth movement\" and \"conspiracy world\" of over-exaggerated fear and negative sentiments filled with shadow projections and superiority complexes, looking down on the \"sleeping\" masses to the point of projecting hate and pathological anger. This information can also easily be abused and distorted by anyone without a grounded psychological and spiritual foundation and self-awareness. As Thomas Mayer wrote in his book, everyone is affected by the vaccine differently on an individual basis, so we cannot make generalizations. Many known and unknown factors come in: how many doses/boosters a person received, the person's level of being, soul development, spiritual strength, karmic and spiritual lessons, and much more that is impossible for the mind to grasp. \"It is important for me to emphasize that this is not about ideology, but about empirical perception and truth-seeking. Science and spiritual research are always an open process of the search for truth. It must not be driven by personal preferences. ... The aim is not to stimulate negative emotions, but to present research results in a sober and comprehensible way and to point out ways out of the impasse. But ways out can only be found through understanding. That is why there is no way around taking a detailed look at vaccines and their effects, even if the results are unpleasant... It is not about a \"harmless jab\", but about a powerful impulse to initiate a change in the human body, so that it is damaged in its basic evolutionary function as the vehicle for the soul-spiritual being of Man. This impulse can also block human being's existence after death. In this respect it really is about the fundamental question of the future of mankind: It transpires that the four main Corona vaccines, ...in the Western countries, taken as a whole, are a strong attack on the physical body and the energy body. I say this already here, to make clear from the beginning that certain fundamental questions remain open: The situation is not hopeless. I experience again and again that lofty spiritual beings look at the Corona crisis and vaccinations with calmness and confidence. It is a trial from which in the long run much good can come, even if today it is overwhelming for most people. We can yet grow from the corona inoculations, only we must approach this spiritual confrontation with sufficient activity. This is equally true for the unvaccinated as well as for the vaccinated.\" Thomas Mayer Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and Supersensible Research The material and research presented in Mayer's book are based on Rudolf Steiner's work and Anthroposophy. The effects of the vaccine on the astral/energy body, soul, and the afterlife are based on Steiner's cosmology and interpretation of supersensible worlds. Mayer has contacted 50 people (practitioners and bodyworkers) with extrasensory perception and collected their reports. Most practitioners are also trained in Steiner's work/healing modalities, and this is important to keep in mind when reading the information. \"The Goethean researcher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) became a pioneer of modern supersensible investigation. His 354 books with writings and lectures contain infinite depths. He attempted to create a broad foundation for the science of the spiritual world on which humanity can to further build. The term \"anthroposophy\" was coined by Rudolf Steiner with a similar meaning as \"natural science\" or \"social science\". It is about the fully conscious perception and exploration of the supersensible world in all its ramifications and beings. The natural science is divided into physics, chemistry, geology, biology etc. Anthroposophy is subdivided into science of ethers, angelic science, science of elemental beings, science of the dead, karmic science, etc. Just as natural science is based on a theory of knowledge and scientific methodology, in anthroposophy the training in meditative way and the methodology of supersensible perception is elaborated in many ways... The essential methods of perception of extrasensory research - Imagination, Inspiration, and Intuition - were described in detail by Rudolf Steiner, for example in the book It takes years of practice, meditation, working with one's own inner shadows, and study of anthroposophy and other sciences of the soul and spiritual world. It is important that the research rests on a broad background of experience.\" Thomas Mayer I see many similarities between Steiner's work to other esoteric occult teachings that interpret the \"supersensible\" worlds through their own words and symbolism. For example, there are similarities between Sri Aurbobind's cosmology based on Integral Yoga and Steiner's Anthroposophy as explored in Mayer also acknowledged that it is not easy to describe or interpret the non-physical reams in words: \"It is not easy to find words for the supersensible perceptions simply because there are no words that could describe them. This is often only possible by means of reference to the physical world. For example, when we speak of \"holes in the aura\", we are not referring to holes that are visible to the senses, but to areas of the soul that are not penetrated by the I, and into which foreign feelings and beings can enter and persist. Also, the \"hole\" can be the region through which the spiritual and etheric-life force is lost.\" In his book, Mayer gives a general overview of the main concepts of Steiner's Spiritual Science and cosmology, including the various types of members of the human, beings, and entities. In the context of this article, I will briefly outline some of them quoted from his book: \"I would like to emphasize that this is not a theory or a belief system. In the supersensible perceptions, one constantly encounters these beings. It is a condition of a healthy spiritual path of knowledge that one learns to deal with these dark entities as well. Some of these beings/entities listed above have been interpreted and given different names according to various occult esoteric teachings. For example, Sri Aurobindo's name of Disease-Beings is Forces of Illness... Supersensory Observations on Vaccinated People (case studies) Many of us know already about the detrimental physical effects of However, as Mayer notes, Let's look at some of the case studies presented in Mayer's book and how the Corona vaccines adversely affect the \"members\" of the human being. \"Members\" are the different \"bodies,\" both physical and non-physical, that constitute a human being. For example, in Steiner's cosmology, there is the, For a brief description of each \"member\" see Mayer's book (in German) or \"The human being lives also in all areas of the supersensible world and consists of many higher members (bodies), which together form the human aura in its complexity. In former times, these members - often under different names - were part of a cognitive inquiry and spiritual traditions. Today the best-known entity among these members is the material body.\" Before sharing these case studies, Mayer makes an important disclaimer again not to fall into the trap of making generalizations since the vaccines affect everyone differently as mentioned before \"The following research and reports show that the corona vaccinations can have strong disturbing effects on the members of the human being. Of course, this varies from individual to individual... Each individual case must be observed anew. I write this in order to warn against generalizations. It is all about sharpening the attention and the power of perception.\" Let's start with two reports from 2 different CranioSacral therapists who have worked on clients that have taken the COVID vaxx. These cases fascinated me since I had also learned, got certified in, and practiced CranioSacral (CS) therapy on many clients when I worked as a professional bodyworker for over 15 years. In my past work as a bodyworker, an entity sometimes also revealed itself during a CS session (not related to any vaccines), but the client was able to purge it out. Yet, more work needed to be done to close/heal the entry point, and the client was required to take self-responsibility for her psychological, emotional, mental, and spiritual health. The CS pulse/rhythm occurs about 6-12 cycles a minute based on the spinal fluid expanding/retracting between the cranium and the sacrum. These reports also verify my insights/research that these vaccines create entry points for hostile entities to take over the body and \"eject\" the soul. Report 1 - I Have Not Experienced this in Any Treatment in the Last 20 Years A rhythmical massage and craniosacral therapist from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, wrote in May 2021: \"I have been working as a rhythmical masseuse since the 80s and as a craniosacral therapist for about 20 years. During my many years of therapeutic work, I have treated adults and children with very different issues. During a craniosacral treatment, a well-trained therapist with clairvoyant hands can sense changes within the body structure of the client. The therapist takes the client's feet or head in their hands. During such treatments, I can very specifically perceive pain points and blockages in the whole body of the client. I can also perceive the condition of various organs of the client. One of the basic skills of craniosacral therapists is the perception of craniosacral rhythms. Since the beginning of the Corona vaccination campaign in Germany, I have treated two vaccinated clients. The experience of these two vaccinated with mRNA vaccines was new to me and at first frightening. In five craniosacral treatments performed so far, holding the head with both hands repeated the perception of holding a completely hollow, empty head. The etheric brain and the pineal gland felt dried up and shriveled. Also, the otherwise perceptible surficial craniosacral rhythm was not perceptible. With none of my other clients, after more than 20 years of experience, have I ever had such experiences.\" She continued to do four more sessions on her patient and noticed some healing progress: \"With the third treatment, a clear improvement was experienced. The etheric body and the craniosacral rhythms were more clearly felt. After the third treatment, the client performed a liver cleanse according to Andreas Moritz, followed by a colon hydro-cleansing... During the fourth craniosacral treatment, the pineal gland was again more perceptible, and the client spoke of no longer being just functional, but of being more in tune with herself, more able to concentrate and perceive herself...\" This is definitely good news as Thomas Mayer noted: \"This pleasant report shows that it is possible to overcome the blocking supersensory effects of the vaccination. Corona vaccination can be a kind of test. We are now challenged to become strong enough to cope with these massive attacks. This was true for the client as well as for the therapist.\" Report 2 - As If A Dark Being Were Lying On Top Of Her Another differentiated report from a craniosacral therapist from Baden Wurttemberg in April 2021: \"Since I do bodywork, because of the vaccinations, I am now confronted with energies and entities which are partly shocking. I have the feeling that I must protect myself and now I even doubt whether I can continue to treat vaccinated people in the future without leaving the work exhausted. Especially in craniosacral therapy, where I am in direct contact with the etheric body and the other members of the patient's being, I deal with more and more unsightly and frightening images and perceptions and protect myself. I am deeply shocked by what these vaccinations do to people, without them noticing anything. As an example, I would like to tell you about the craniosacral therapy sessions with a 70-year-old patient, whom I know very well and who has been in therapy with me for many years. The first session took place five days after the first mRNA vaccination with the BioNTech Pfizer vaccine. I wondered about her CS rhythm, which I could not perceive. When she told me that she was now vaccinated, it became clear to me. I had the feeling that there was a dark being on top of her, inhibiting all functions. The tissue was as if held, could not breathe and could not move, and was no longer able to pulsate. In the second session, it was even worse than in the first. There was practically no rhythm at all, complete rigidity. Like a thick, sticky mass inside the patient. At the feet, I could not feel anything, completely broken rhythm. Also, in this second session, I experienced again a formless being, dark, black, which laid itself around the upper part as if around it, holding on, as if in a kind of strangulation movement at the etheric larynx and whirring around. Next sessions: Furthermore, no normal craniosacral rhythm was perceptible. Everything was still stuck and no movement, no inspiration and expiration was perceptible. Also, on the bone level no movement. At the end of the treatment once again I saw a strange, first gruesome- black, rather gray being. At the feet was not noticeable at all, completely broken rhythm. Also, in this second session, I experienced again a formless being, dark, black, which laid itself around the upper part as if around it, holding on, like a kind of strangulation movement at the etheric larynx and whirring around. As a therapist, I had to be very careful. As soon as I worked with light, that is, with Christ light, the being had to give way. The patient did not notice it, no change in the cranio-rhythm, for her it was normal as always. Next sessions: Furthermore, no normal craniosacral rhythm was perceptible. Everything was still as if \"glued\" and no movement, no inspiration and expiration were perceptible in the living. Also, on the bone level no movement. At the end of the treatment, I saw again a strange, first grayish-black, later gray being. Maybe the vaccination being? Through the treatment, especially at the end of the treatment, there was in each case a calming down of the being, which before was buzzing around restlessly and irritated. It nestled as if around the shoulders, as if folded over and crawling into the body. I felt as if it had not yet crawled all the way in but was in the process of joining and blending with the body. Unfortunately, after many weeks of therapy, there is no real progress, no movement. The patient cannot experience or comprehend these observations in any way. She has no perception of the being and changes in her vital functions and craniosacral rhythms.\" Report 3 - The Tissue Is As If Solidified And No Longer Able To Pulsate A rhythmic masseuse from Switzerland described other phenomena in June 2021: \"I had the opportunity to share observations with some other therapists who have similar perceptions. In addition, I have known many patients for a long time and can clearly perceive the difference between their state then and now. Often the patients themselves do not notice these changes. On the contrary, they feel really good now, they are relieved and happy and \"free\"(after they received the vaccine). Some, of course, display initial flu symptoms in the first few days after the shot. Only very few suffer and perceive more deeply. In most of the vaccinated people, I experience condensation in the tissues, especially after the second vaccination (often already after the first one). The tissue is as if solidified, no longer mobile, and no longer able to pulsate. Also, a palpable cooling (coldness) shows up in many. With one patient I had the experience of massaging a \"corpse\". Even less than before, people have sensations of their coldness. There are visible changes in the face. The gaze often becomes rigid, the contours firmer or the people get a rather turgid face. The face becomes like a mask, transformed. That which wants to shine through is missing. Often, the old weaknesses and symptoms, which were already improved, reappear on all levels due to vaccination: For example, pain, joint blockages, muscle cramps and stiffness (for example in Parkinson's disease), hardening of the spine, tinnitus etc. In the soul life, I often perceive a strikingly sharp-chiseled gesture, all the way to (latent) aggressiveness. In the soul-spiritual sphere, I observed a phenomenon that I would describe like this: For example, old, basic fears, illusions, rigid ideas, patterns, etc. reappear suddenly. In some, this went as far as clearly perceptible (temporary?) changes in their core being. The effect on me as a therapist is in a modified form like that of the vaccinated people themselves - if I am not vigilant and do not protect myself sufficiently. Above all, I experience that sometimes, out of the blue, the forces are suddenly pulled away from me. It happens completely unexpectedly, even if I have a good day. If I am not completely in myself and especially in my hands, they become more immobile including borderline rigidity and pain. It is also necessary to guide the thought activity well; it is also in danger of being taken over by disturbing thoughts.\" Report 4 - Hardening in The Soul A psychotherapist from Hesse, Germany, in April 2021: \"About one-third of my clients are vaccinated, ten in total. I am no longer able to reach and experience them directly as I used to, but now have to do much more and take longer to get in touch with their \"I\". It feels like they are behind a concrete wall. The concrete wall feeling is with AstraZeneca; with BioNTech and Moderna, it is more as if the \"I\" is choked with lumps. Since the vaccination, I have experienced an increased influence of the dark layers, something has opened up. As a therapist, I have to be more careful not to be drawn into something dark myself and I have to connect more consciously with the light. With the dark layers that are stored individually and collectively in the spiritual earth. I often feel alone in my work now. I know these clients well, but somehow, they are no longer there. In the aftermath of a session, I no longer feel the person, even though they were physically there. There is one exception. With a woman who meditates and has also thought for a long time whether she should be vaccinated, it is not like that. With her, I do not experience any separation. Obviously, she was able to transform the soul-spiritual effects of the vaccination\". The Baden working group had similar perceptions in May 2021: \"While observing vaccinated people (with AstraZeneca and BioNTech) we perceived the process of increasing hardening in the soul-element\". We can see from these reports so far that one person was able to recover slowly from the vaccine, but only after repeating treatments: Another critical observation is that the therapists and practitioners were also affected negatively when working on their vaccinated clients. They had to be very careful not to take on any dark energy or get drained, especially when working on a supersensible level. More Reports From Around The World Thomas Mayer also lists reports from therapists and alternative practitioners that weren't from his personal network (as in the cases above) but found in his research on online forums of therapists and alternative practitioners, confirming what he and his colleagues discovered when treating vaccinated clients. Here's a short selection from 10 different therapists and practitioners: These reports remind me also of the information I shared in my article ' Here's an abridged version of the report: \"I held a session with a person who had received the first and second dose of the vaccine. I had already treated this person energetically, but I did not know that she had taken the vaccine. When I started the treatment, I immediately noticed the change, very heavy energy coming from their subtle bodies. The scariest thing was when I worked on the heart chakra, I connected with her soul, so she was detached from the physical body, she had no contact and it was as if she was floating in a state of total confusion... I continued the treatment by sending light to the heart chakra, the soul of the person, but it seemed that the soul could not receive any more light, frequency, or energy. It was a very powerful experience for me. Then I understood that this substance is in fact used to detach the consciousness so that this consciousness can no longer interact through this body that it has in life, where there is no more contact, no more frequency, no more light, no more energetic balance or spirit... I realized that it is not only polluting the subtle bodies or the physical body, but it is something to do with our soul.The purpose is to damage and try to destroy the contact with consciousness. What Rudolf Steiner said is exactly that. It is not just about damaging the immune system... \" The Schism In The Wellness And Alternative Health Community Before we continue with more case studies and go deeper into the more detailed effects of vaccines on the metaphysical constitution of human beings as shared in Mayer's book, I want to reiterate an important point I made in a There is a very obvious schism and \"splitting\" within the wellness, yoga, alternative health, bodywork/energy healer community regarding the vaccine. Many practitioners and therapists fully support the vaccine, believe all the propaganda, and lies around the so-called \"pandemic\" and corrupted modern allopathic medicine, and have even taken it themselves. As a longtime professional bodyworker, yoga practitioner, and embodiment coach myself, I've been surprised and shocked by how many people in the wellness and alternative health community went along with it, received the jab, and even asked their clients and student to take it. Otherwise, they would not offer their services to them. In my view and (inner) experience, if you are genuinely in tune with your body and essence/soul, i.e., embodied (in the true meaning of the word), you will naturally reject the COVID jab as you will reject any other poison/toxin. You will holistically take care of your health on ALL levels: physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. Then you will also hold the somatic intelligence and intuitive capabilities to see through the lies of this faux pandemic. Intelligence in that sense has nothing to do with degrees or education (which most often clouds real intelligence due to social/educational programming and mostly only gives one a sense of intellectual superiority) but is tied to the intelligence of the body as an expression of essence, connected to the Divine and your true Self. But it also requires lots of inner work to connect to the real part of ourselves. In light of this understanding, here's a big oxymoron: It couldn't be more of a testimony of being out of touch with their body, spirit, and essence/soul. This \"pandemic\" and how people react to it also reveal the true colors, especially within the spiritual, yoga, and wellness community. It's the ultimate litmus test for anyone who claims to have embodied (self) awareness. Years from now, people will see what they have done, and the truth will reveal itself more and more (as it already is) - and it is not going to be a pretty picture. It's a heavy karmic burden to carry. For now, they laugh at us, gaslight us, ridicule and attack us with their ad hominem \"conspiracy theorist\" attacks and socially conditioned virtue signaling, not realizing how they have become vessels for occult hostile forces themselves. Case in point: I've studied a lot of the popular channels over the past twenty years, including Abraham-Hicks (see video below). Truth is mixed with lies, but most channels are New Age deceptions in light of the hyperdimensional matrix, occult laws, and the hidden (non-physical) forces of life, manipulating humanity from unseen realms. Most often, hostile forces pose as positive ones, targeting wishful thinking and emotional bias where many \"New Agers\" mistake their emotional attachments to particular views, unconscious trauma responses, and wishful thinking for \"truth,\" \"intuition,\" and \"resonating.\" There is no deeper psychic discernment, critical thinking, and certainly no awareness of the hyperdimensional matrix with its occult laws, traps, and deceptions. Channeled material is a rabbit hole that I referenced and wrote about over a decade ago. Here's an excellent example of this clever deception. In this video below, Esther Hicks (Abraham-Hicks) is supposedly channeling the \"non-physical energies of doctors and scientists,\" promoting the vaccine as \"standing in their non-physical beingness reveling in the brilliance of these vaccines.\" Looking at some of the responses of this video going around, many New Age type people already swallow it, hook, line, and sinker, believing that the vaccines are now not just not harmful at all but good for them. I've seen other channeled material claiming that, The courageous therapists and practitioners who speak out against the vaccines and expose the COVID psy-op are often met with ridicule and attacks. Some of them even lost their jobs and were \"canceled\" because they refused to get vaccinated or simply for questioning the official narrative and \"consensus science.\" Thomas Mayer encountered that issue in his research as well, and he had to change the names of all the practitioners and therapists who sent him the reports to protect them. \"For confidentiality reasons, all names (of the patients) have been changed in the descriptions of specific cases. This is normal. However, it is not normal that all authors are also named only with pseudonyms. I know them personally, and they do not want to be the target of a defamation campaign. Many of them have normal professions and do not want to lose their jobs. Unfortunately, such fears are justified today, we know many cases of sanctions and dismissals due to non-conformist views.(... ) I had to accept this bitter reality. Only anonymization of the authors creates the necessary protection that enabled the publication of this book. What forces are at work here spiritually behind the scenes, will become transparent in the course of this book.\" Thomas Mayer At the same time, it's also important to understand that anyone who is along with the jab and the COVID Psy-Op is deeply brainwashed and mind-controlled by the media, government, and church of scientism (pseudo-science), reacting out of primal fear and trauma for they \"do not know what they do.\" Once we understand that, we can see them with more empathy and compassion instead of projecting our anger onto them. There is no getting through with facts and logic, and the cognitive dissonance is too strong. They are not only disconnected from their own bodies but also from their inner guidance and hence have become authoritarian followers. Having said that, I have my boundary, and I choose not to receive any treatment from any practitioner or therapist who has received the jab. It is my personal choice. Thankfully, many professional wellness practitioners have refused the jab and speak out actively against it. I won't go so far as to avoid the inoculated population altogether. That attitude would be way too paranoid and fear-based and virtually impossible unless you isolate yourself from society altogether. I trust my own spiritual constitution (taking care of my health holistically on all levels) that I won't just take anything on or be negatively affected. However, I make that boundary when someone is working on me hands-on, physically, or energetically. Detailed Effects Of Corona Vaccinations On The Constitution Of Human Beings Thomas Mayer also shared very detailed supersensible observations of the human constitution by his research group. The terms used in these reports are very specific to Rudolf Steiner's work and his definition of the supersensible members of the human being. I refer to the book or pdf for an explanation of these terms in the chapter on Supersensible Research. Here is one of the cases the research group reported: \"The members of the Working Group Hessen are experienced and accomplished spiritual researchers who work together on a regular basis. From them comes the following three case studies. May 20, 2021: A woman had received her first vaccination with AstraZeneca. After that, she felt bad and did not want to work anymore. She is a psychotherapist and became grumpy with her patients. The investigation revealed: These difficult effects must have come from the vaccination, because before that Elke was in a good condition. She also experienced these effects in the joint examination. She was shocked by the results and wanted to neutralize the Vaccine-Being and harmonize her bodies through spiritual healing work. This happened, and after that she felt a great relief. Gradually the will to work came back\". This example shows how profoundly Corona vaccination interferes with all members of the human being. Everything was taken over and impaired. However, the description also shows that such spiritual vaccine damage can be neutralized if they are approached accordingly. It is important to emphasize this so that the descriptions collected here are understood in the right way. It is a matter of looking at reality soberly to learn and develop the necessary steps. If these reports frighten one, one should not suppress it, but let oneself be touched by it. It must be digested.\" Mayer and his research group identified a common thread and basic pattern of spiritual vaccine damage in people: \"We were able to observe 20 vaccinated individuals on a regular basis during the last months. Even if the effects of the Corona vaccinations are individually different and change over time, there are some basic patterns that often repeat: The body-elemental-being should take care of the human being, now it leaves, and remains only in the proximity. Also, a separation from the angel occurs - angel and man can no longer feel each other. These are very painful conditions for these etheric and spiritual entities which carry and support the human being. Instead of them, the double of the person (the shadow, or the unresolved old karma) connects itself more strongly with the human being. From the spiritual dark subterranean layers of the earth come forces that affect the \"I\"- organization, the higher self, and the angel. We had the impression that the stronger effect of the Double relates to a strengthening of the ego, the lower \"I\" hardened in egoism. This sometimes manifested itself in a more self-confident appearance of the person, which, however, had the source in self-centeredness. In such encounters one did not meet the real human being as before, instead, the ego and the \"primitive man\" were more pronounced(... ) We experience that with the vaccine, Ahrimanic, hardening elemental beings entered the organs. The astral body and the 'I\"-organization of the organs were clearly quenched and contracted. Also, the etheric body became weaker and connected more strongly with the material body; it became more physical in this respect(... ) This distortion within the spiritual constitution of the organs is caused by dark beings, which enter the human being through the vaccination.\" Three Types Of Beings/Entities Gaining Access Through The COVID Vaccine According to the research group, there are three groups of Beings (based on Steiner's work) that appeared in vaccinated people. Mayer outlines them below: Spiritual Healing And How To Counteract The Adverse Effects of the Vaccination The question arises, We know about physical detox methods that may work and help the heal physical constitution of the body. But removing these adverse beings requires deeper spiritual work. Mayer writes: \"The purpose of spiritual healing is to remove these three groups of beings from the human aura. This should proceed out of the activity of the (real) \"I\" of the vaccinated person, who ideally develops strength that makes it difficult for these beings to enter again. Based on my own observations I have the following picture: Mayer also addresses a crucial factor that determines the healing process. It varies from person to person, and a big part of it is under what circumstances an individual received the vaccine. \"One's own decision to vaccinate: If one gets vaccinated out of fear or ideological conviction, there is a danger that the associated entities can penetrate deeper than in people with more composed motivations. Motivation of the doctor: The spiritual attitude of the doctor (or a person; trans.), who administers the vaccine also plays a role. The soul-spiritual atmosphere during the vaccination can invite or discourage hostile spirits. The patient can also influence this, for example, by praying during the vaccination. Awareness of the problem: If one is aware that vaccination may cause soul-spiritual damage and that one must take care of it - such awareness is priceless. This will become a starting point in the soul for a - conscious or unconscious - confrontation with the being of the vaccine. Without awareness of the problem, there is a danger for the soul of blindly falling into it and not finding a way to understand what is happening. Medicinal support: There are various possibilities with natural remedies and homeopathic medicines. For this, please consult a health practitioner or a doctor. Therapeutic support: All therapies that have a special effect on the higher members of the human constitution can help, for example, therapeutic eurythmy, rhythmical massage, craniosacral therapy, art therapy, etc. Basic spiritual strengthening: The more one regularly strengthens the spiritual connection through meditation, prayer, religious ritual, singing or reading spiritual literature, the less one is accessible for spiritual attacks. Spiritual-healing intervention: It seems to me very important to directly confront the beings connected with the inoculation in meditation or prayer; to meet them with the power of Christ, Archangel Michael (assertiveness), Archangel Raphael (healing power), healing Buddha or other higher spirit beings. Through this these adversarial beings can be removed from the aura and their effects can be transformed. Everything that is done in this direction has an effect, even if one is not able to discern this personally. For support, it may be useful to seek the help of an experienced spiritual healer. The processing of the vaccination should not be underestimated, as should have become clear from the previous descriptions. One is dealing with a class of adversary spirits that can quickly overwhelm one. Even if the processing needs only a few weeks with some people, others must work on it for many months.\" As disturbing as some of these reports and findings may be concerning the adverse spiritual effects of the COVID vaccines, the situation is not hopeless. As we've seen in these reports, people who have been inoculated can be treated and helped in their healing process. If you have received the vaccine and made it that far into the article, don't despair but seek help. I've received emails from people asking how to counter-act the metaphysical consequences of the jab. Thomas Maye's work and research give us clues and shine a light into the darkness despite the overall seemingly dire situation. We must not give in to fear or negative thinking but face it as it is. Since many people ask me and email me about it, I also would like to clarify that I do not offer that kind of supersensible body and energy work as Mayer and his team of supersensible therapists. I currently don't work as Both modalities could maybe help vaccinated people in their healing process, but my work has shifted, and I focus more on group work, online courses, and other work I'm called to do by Spirit. I currently also do not know anyone who does the kind of treatments that Mayer and his practitioners offer based on Rudolf Steiner's work. Mayer is based in Germany, and you could contact him directly to inquire (see his book for contact information). How To Choose A Healer And Practitioner I advise common-sense caution (without paranoia) when choosing a therapist and practitioner. Many people are claiming to do this kind of work, and it's a jungle out there in the alternative healing community. There are also charlatans and all sorts of questionable New Age \"healing modalities\" and \"shamans\" that promise to remove entities, balance your chakras (or even worse, \"remove chakras\"), etc. The critical point to understand with this kind of supersensible spiritual work is what Mayer mentioned at the beginning of his book: \"It takes years of practice, meditation, work with one's own inner shadows, and study of anthroposophy and other sciences of the soul and spiritual world. It is important that the research rests on a broad background of experience. The processing of the vaccination should not be underestimated, as should have become clear from the previous descriptions. One is dealing with a class of adversary spirits that can quickly overwhelm one. Even if the processing needs only a few weeks with some people, others must work on it for many months.\" Many self-proclaimed healers and \"shamans\" promise all kinds of \"magic\" healing, but they lack these prerequisites. If you are looking for a practitioner, I suggest keeping these four things below in mind and asking them. Your intuition will tell you if they are honest or lie: Many of us have friends and family members who got vaccinated. Naturally, we want to help them, but we must understand the number one rule in healing work: In other words, we need to respect their free will and don't push them into any treatment or therapy, nor make an appointment with a practitioner for them without asking them for permission. They need to seek it out themselves. Only a person who is willing to heal themselves and takes self-responsibility has the potential to be healed. It is also a long journey and won't be done in just one session, as Mayer pointed out. Moreover, a vaccinated person, or anyone for that matter, who is seeking help from a therapist/practitioner also needs to engage in their own inner work and spiritual work and not expect a \"healer\" to do everything for them. Supersensible Study Of The Vaccines Thomas Mayer and his research team examined the various COVID vaccines via \"tuning into them\" (the \"information field\" of the vaccine substance) with extra-sensory/supersensible perception. Different techniques were used, but a common one was to take the ampule with vaccine residue in one hand during a \"self-testing\" experiment by a qualified practitioner and psychically tune in to the \"information field\" of the vaccine substance itself (i.e., \"resonate\" with it.) The findings were remarkable and very similar to the information gathered when working with vaccinated people. Here are some selected case studies: The W\u00fcrttemberg working group met on May 5, 2021, with two observers: My perceptions: An important result of the studies by the various research groups showed that the effects of, ...are similar. Soul and social life - How does the vaccine affect my needs, feeling life, work, and life planning? Here are a few more impressions of various supersensible practitioners conducting this investigation: \"I no longer felt the need to think and decide for myself, I became content to follow instructions, no questions asked. I became totally gray, everything doesn't matter, everything is ok. My mucous membranes became dry, I felt like a reptile.\" \"I experience distance, no connection, no feeling, no social contacts, I feel lost, my emotional life is cold.\" \"Everything should be strictly organized, I wish for order, I am resigned, on the run, only registering. In my emotional life, I experience shame, malice, and maliciousness.\" \"Contacts do not interest me, I find the distance to other people good. I am grateful for instructions and guidance. I do not have direction in life. In my emotional life, there is no empathy, no interest. In my professional life, I just want to function. In an attempted meditation I bump into a wall and am pushed back.\" The video below is a testimony of a Greek Priest-Monk, who received the Pfizer Vaccine. Father Savvas Agioritis is reading his confession. The Priest-Monk started to feel himself more and more cut off from the spiritual world. He also came face-to-face with a demonic entity which may be the soratic vaccine being: You can also read the transcript On the Supersensible Structure of the Corona Vaccines Maye and his research team also asked the question: Here's what they discovered: \"Often there were the following impressions: These are aggressive and attacking and they seem to be occupied by the Soratic beings. The working group East Germany described in April 2021: Authoritarian Followers and The Zombification of Humanity These reports are very telling in light of the more extensive matrix agenda. Keep in mind that the only way the occult anti-divine forces and their WEF \"Great Reset\" Neo-Marxist-Fascist hybrid New World Order puppets can ensure the enslavement of humanity is with the consent and (manipulated) \"free will\" of the people. They need obedient citizens and authoritarian order followers. There are several ways to turn human beings into robotic authoritarian followers without a single thought on their own. One way is via the \"matrix trauma installment program,\" as I've called it. People who are traumatized are easier to control. It's the foundation of the nefarious MK-Ultra mind control program, only in this case it is a global MK-Ultra experiment. Billions of people have already become traumatized over the past 3 years since the \"pandemic\" started with all the fear, lockdowns, economic, emotional, and psychological hardship as well as the masking (especially children), gaslighting, shaming, and virtue signaling by the corporate media and consensus \"Agent Smith\" citizens. Most people don't even know that they are traumatized, but they have a trauma response: Over the past three years, we've seen a military-level Keep in mind that has already happened without the vaccine. Only people who have a solid spiritual and psychological foundation can withstand this psychological warfare. The easiest way to control people is via traumatizing them, instilling fear and then appearing as the savior, or giving them something that promises them \"safety\" and going back to \"normal,\" i.e., the vaccine. Trauma alone already creates entry points for hostile forces to come in and take over body and mind. As we can see from the reports above, the effects of the vaccine itself re-enforce people to become numb authoritarian followers: It is essential to understand that the reposts above were conducted by professional supersensible practitioners \"tuning into the vaccine\" and hence gave a report of how they felt. The vast majority of people who received the vaccine don't have the self-awareness that they all of a sudden, In fact, most vaccinated people will deny it and claim that they \"think for themselves\" and don't notice any changes. It takes a certain level of being and spiritual strength in a vaccinated person to become conscious and aware of these internal changes. Remember the reports at the beginning of this article by some of the practitioners who worked on vaccinated people stating that: Mind-controlled people do not know that they are mind-controlled. Soul Snatching And The \"Alien\" Invasion Through Our Bodies At the time of publishing this article (May 24, 2022), officially: In light of what we have explored and discovered so far regarding the adverse spiritual effects of the Corona vaccines on humans, these are alarming numbers. It confirms the The \"alien invasion through our bodies\" via genetic modification and the attempted separation of the soul from the body, priming the body for occult anti-divine forces/beings to take over the vessel. As I wrote in 2016: Rudolf Steiner was correct. In light of these revelations and research so far, we can see that these vaccines attempt to expel the soul from mankind, and people are inoculated against their disposition towards spiritual ideas. Based on Mayer's research outlined in this article so far, we can see 4 distinctive effects of the COVID vaccine on people: The first two conditions create entry points for asuric, Soratic/Asuric occult hostile forces to attach and take over the body. The vaccine also seems to have a \"vaccine being,\" an entity that attaches to the vaccinated person takes once the inoculation occurs. These beings/entities then also emphasize the effects of points 3 and 4, and all points/effects are interrelated. The more a human being is disconnected from his real \"I\"/essence/soul, the less they can access their inner guidance and intuition and look for guidance and authority outside themselves. The Soratic Spirits of Transhumanism: The Consciousness Trap The COVID vaccine agenda and its detrimental spiritual effects on the human being tie into the Transhumanism agenda as well. I've written a note on this topic in 2016 titled Laura and I also released a podcast episode called ' What is the Lisa Renee summarizes it well (many years before the COVID \"pandemic\" started): We need to understand that we are in the \"end game.\" The Transhumanist agenda, the merging of man and machine, the expelling of the soul, and the invasion of hostile \"alien\" beings through our bodies are the end stages of a negative agenda by the matrix overlords to enslave humanity that has been building up for thousands of years. These hyperdimensional occult forces have been manipulating humanity from unseen realms for eons and interfered with humanity's \"harmonious\" evolution. The The Soratic beings in Steiner's \"hostile occult forces\" and \"Powers of Darkness\" Sri Aurobindo refers to. They have been given many names over time based on various occult traditions. Rudolf Steiner also hinted at these powers of darkness overtaking and possessing human bodies: When we zoom out and look at the bigger picture of the matrix agenda and what the real purpose is of the global push to vaccinate the entire world population (as The second aim is also a precursor for the Transhumanist agenda to fully expel the soul and merge man with machine. Seeing it from that perspective and in light of the Hegelian Dialect, the entire COVID psy-op has been artificially created as the \"Problem,\" which created a \"Reaction\" in the population, demanding a cure/vaccine. \" Thoms Mayer and his research team made more disturbing discoveries when looking deeper into the effects of the four major COVID vaccines, verifying what Lisa Renee, Sri Aurobindo, Rudolf Steiner, and other esoteric occult teachings have conveyed. It has been called \"the topic of all topics\": \"It took many attempts before we understood the powerful effects of BioNTech, Modern, AstraZeneca, and Johnson&Johnson. Important thing is that - spiritually speaking - at the core, these (vaccines) are filled with Soratic beings. Of course, all other groups of adversarial spirits are also involved. At first glance, one can experience Ahrimanic beings, perhaps also Asuric beings. However, inside of them, the Soratic beings are at work, setting the tone. These beings do not originate from the development of our solar system and in this respect must be considered as outer-planetary spirits. Unlike the Luciferic and Ahrimanic fallen angelic beings, they are not part of the development of our spiritual planetary system, described in detail in Rudolf Steiner's \"Occult Science\". Through human unconscious attraction or conscious invitation, they gain access and can thus influence our life on earth. The Soratic beings are known for thousands of years; they inspire oppression, abuse, hatred, war, black magic, etc. But today a new kind is also emerging. Some people within my research network are skilled in perceiving the Soratic beings. Yet, this new species was at first incomprehensible and unclassifiable to us. There is also no established terminology for this species. We have chosen the term \"Spirits of Transhumanism\" because these beings seem to be at the spiritual core of transhumanism. Transhumanism wants to merge human being with machines and thus to abolish our soul-spiritual being forever. Supersensibly, the transhumanist spirits do exactly that. The spiritual effects are already here even if the brain is not yet connected to a computer - a dream of the transhumanists. They reach for the human being, and if they gain access, human beings lose - partially or completely - their spiritual connection. For this purpose, these beings possess especially the Phantom body (physical spirit body) and the etheric body. They \"glue\" them together and shut them off from soul and spirit and the soul-spiritual surroundings. In this respect these beings want to turn the human being into a \"Machine-Man\", cut off from the spirit. We found that all group spirits of the four examined vaccines are occupied by the spirits of transhumanism. Moreover, we found them in individual ampules, through which they enter the human being by means of vaccination. To spiritual experience, they appear as \"devoid of the \"I\" metallic\", \"brute\" and threatening. A colleague encountered a leading group spirit of one of the vaccines. Its intention came clearly to light: Thomas Mayer In Their Own Words Looking at everything we've uncovered so far in light of the matrix agenda of the hostile forces, listen to these short videos of 1. Humans Are Now Hackable Animals Some highlights from the clips by Yuval Noah Harari: Yuval may already be a vessel for ahrimanic (demonic) spirits and an \" There is no soul, just a mechanical, materialistic worldview. His words give insights into the mindset of many people in positions of high power and specifically the elite of the World Economic Forum WEF around Klaus Schwab. They deny the soul, spirituality, and the Divine, and they want to play God themselves. In fact, they already see themselves as \"Gods,\" determining how many people are supposed to live on this planet and creating human beings in tubes. Klaus Schwab of the WEF and proponent of \" Rudolf Steiner was correct in his vision over 100 years ago: Is It Possible To Absorb These Intrusive Spirits Without Actual Physical Vaccinations? A big question is if unvaccinated people are being affected by the ones who have received the vaccine. Many non-vaccinated women have had irregular menstruation cycles when in closer proximity to vaccinated people. There also seem to be other physical effects related to the spike protein that negatively affect some unvaccinated people. But what about the adversary spirits of the vaccine? Thomas Mayer asked this question in the next chapter of his book: \"The Corona vaccines are filled with aggressive adversary spirits, which through vaccination anchor within the bodies of the human being. But is it possible to absorb these intrusive spirits without actual physical vaccinations?\" Mayer received this remarkable report of a few cases dated May 20, 2021, from the Hesse Working Group in Germany: The implications of these reports can be shocking and fear-inducing to many people. Do the ones who have not been vaccinated need to keep their distance from the vaccinated part of the population to not take on any of these hostile spirits? I don't take this extreme (paranoid) view, as I mentioned before. Yes, there may need to be caution and common sense, and every situation is different and specific. For example, having sex or intimate physical contact with a vaccinated person if you are unvaccinated could end up in taking on soratic adversary spirits. A lot is happening on unseen levels, even without any vaccinations, when engaging sexually, as explored in this article: Regarding relationships where one partner got the vax, and the other didn't get it, this may cause some issues. I'm not here to tell anyone what to do, and I am just sharing this research, insights, and personal views. You need to decide what is right for you. As I said before, personally, I won't receive any treatment from a bodyworker, therapist, or practitioner who has been inoculated. Does this imply that you may have taken on a \"vaccine entity\" when you received treatment from a vaxxed practitioner? No, not necessarily so. Once again, I warn of fear and paranoia. Most importantly, take care of your health on all levels, boost your spiritual immune system with spiritual practices, psychological self-work (to close off any entry points), and live a spiritual life in sincere aspiration and As we can see based on Mayer's research and case studies, bodyworkers, therapists, and practitioners in the healing arts also need to be aware of the possibility of \"taking something on'\" from a vaccinated person they treat. Protection and Clearing measures are imperative for anyone in the healing/therapist space, even without the vaccine issue. If you stay in the body, grounded in the Self, and work with sincere prayer (not mechanical reciting) to receive Divine projection, you can also mitigate any negative effects or intrusions and not take anything on if you work on someone who received the vaccine even if you receive a treatment from a vaccinated person. Mayer also stresses that physical inoculation is far more dangerous because the vaccine itself contains a soratic being and, therefore, is more challenging to harmonize and clear. An unvaccinated person who has possibly absorbed an entity from a vaccinated person is easier to remove and could even clear themselves. How To Protect Yourself From Intrusive Adversary Spirits The most important part to understand is what Thomas Mayer noted above: \"In every aura, there are holes of unresolved old karma. Through these holes beings connected to the corona vaccines may enter - even without the syringe.\" In other words, there needs to be an \"entry point\" for soratic beings to come in. These entry points and holes in the aura of unresolved karma, Mayer is talking about, are related to unresolved (unconscious) trauma (including past life trauma), childhood wounds, and shadow aspects (relating to shadow work) which are all stored in the body just like \" Holes in the aura can be created by trauma, and everyone carries trauma to varying degrees back to the \"original wound\" of (illusory) separation from God. Ego-identification can be seen as a trauma response itself. I've addressed this topic many times over the years in my, Anyone can be subjected to these occult forces with or without a vaccine. Just because someone is \"red-pilled,\" i.e., has some intellectual awareness of the matrix, or hasn't taken the jab doesn't imply they are immune (no pun intended) from any interference and attachments from soratic/asuric beings or any other form of occult hostile forces. Mayer's work is based on the cosmology of Rudolf Steiner, and many other esoteric traditions and occult teachings have talked about similar beings in their own words. Your/our ego blindspots, wounds, traumas, shadow aspects, lower nature desires, etc., serve as \"entry points.\" In addition, overuse of cannabis, medicine plants, pharmaceuticals, etc., also damages the astral body. It creates entry points, so does everyday stress, etc... anytime we have no self-awareness, i.e., don't \"remember ourselves\" (as Gurdjieff would say), we can be subjected to occult interferences. Living a head-centric existence, cut off from the body as most people do in our computerized world also creates a split (holes in the aura) for occult forces to come in. Many red-pilled \"truthers\" are driven and influenced by these forces, especially tempting them to externalize evil, shadow-project, fall into doom&gloom blame/victim consciousness, identify with thoughts that are not their own, etc., mostly people who are not engaged in any form of sincere self-work. Seeking truth and fighting evil only \"out there\" is not enough and in fact, can make things worse if we don't apply shadow work and take back our projections. Augmented via occult forces, the temptation to externalize all evil and see oneself as \"better\" keeps people trapped in the matrix of their own minds and puppets in the hands of occult forces. Shadow work has become more popularized over the past few years, with many distortions and over-simplifications. Anyone who claims who has no triggers doesn't project and is \"done with shadow work\" is severely lying to themselves. It would be the same to claim that one is fully Self-Realized and enlightened. You can also waste years and decades of just intellectualizing the process of shadow work without progressing one bit (I've fallen into this trap for some years in the beginning). It needs to happen somatically on all levels, and the body stores everything. Before applying and doing shadow work correctly, which is highly uncomfortable, messy, and painful, one must know HOW to do it and WHAT it implies. It also requires a certain level of self-awareness, the witness within, and the ability to observe the projections, transference, projection identification, triggers, etc., without justifying, externalizing, or attaching a story to any of it. That is easier said than done, and I'm not taking myself out of the equation. This process also requires years of study and practice, so it becomes \"second nature\"- applied embodied knowledge and not merely intellectual theoretical. It is the gateway to the Divine, which needs to be brought down. No shortcuts... It's the law of ascent and descent and an ongoing process for any of us engaged in The Work. I've addressed some of the major misconceptions about \"The Topic of All Topics\" in my article The solution and remedy? This work entails grounded fundamental psychological work, shadow work, and spiritual work. But that's the work most people shy away from because it's not easy and confronting. It entails conscious suffering and struggles, for the war is within and through us. Anyone who claims to be \"free\" from any interference is the same as claiming to be fully soul embodied, spiritualized, and enlightened. To believe that only others are affected by entities is a matrix trap in itself, overestimating one's level of being and most likely engaging in some sort of bypassing. The path gets very narrow. At the same time, these forces serve as a teaching function in light of the evolution of consciousness and can be \"utilized as teachers,\" They highlight what needs to be healed, integrated, and rejected. Everyone is affected differently by these forces, even the inoculated, and Mayer stresses that point in his book not to make generalizations. One's level of being, karmic lessons, and many unknown factors (to the mind) come into the equation. We are in the dark age and all and everything needs or be revealed within and without during this Time of Transition. This is why we're here, and it couldn't be any other way. The Effects Of Allopathic Medicine And Psychiatric Drugs In The Afterlife In light of soul evolution, the evolution of consciousness implies that the soul progresses and \"grows\" over many lifetimes, reincarnations, and rebirths. The body is the vehicle for the soul. After death, the soul leaves the body and goes through various stages before incarnating into a new body. Millions of reported NDEs (Near Death Experiences) share the same experiences of leaving the physical body, \"going towards the Light,\" experiencing a \"life review,\" etc. Many ancient esoteric traditions, including anthroposophy, describe the laws that govern the afterlife. The Tibetan Book of the Dead is a classical manual helping the soul make the passage to the Light and the various after-death stages, so the soul doesn't get stuck in the Bardo, the transitional state between death and rebirth. The level of being and the state of soul integration/individualization determines the death experience and what happens after death. The whole point of inner esoteric work and consciously engaging on the path towards awakening in this physical body is soul individuation, working through Karma and lessons from lifetime to lifetime. The more embodied you are (soul integration) - the more you are sincerely engaged in the inner work to anchor the Divine (which implies working through traumas/wounds/issues that we all have to vary degrees) - the higher your Level of Being rises, the more Free Will you actually gain/earn and the more awareness/consciousness you will have - all of which will determine what you experience after death. The state of consciousness a person is in at the moment of death also profoundly impacts the afterlife experience. There are traps, dead-ends, and blockages in the afterlife that can prevent a soul from reaching the Light, getting stuck in the lower realm, and bound to earth as an earthbound spirit. Thomas Mayer describes some of these afterlife blockages: ... There are many blockades and dead ends in the afterlife. Soul's Earth-bondage is a very big problem today... I have been working on this topic for many years and have published a long working paper on helping the dead. After-death blockages can have etheric, soul, and spiritual causes. For example, the shock of a very sudden accidental death can lead to an after-death binding. Unsolved and suppressed soul traumas collected during a lifetime often become an insurmountable blockade that the soul cannot get past after death. A too deep willful immersion in a materialistic way of thinking can lead to a darkening of consciousness in the afterlife. In consequence, the soul does not perceive its spiritual environment...\" Dr. Willam Baldwin's work and \"Spirit Releasement Therapy\" go deeper into this topic. An earthbound spirit/soul is the surviving consciousness of a deceased human. It can attach to another living human being as a discarnate entity. It is the most common form of possession. Earthbound spirit possession of the deceased is a big topic on its own. Here is a short article ' I also recommend his books \"Spirit Releasement Therapy\" and \"Healing Lost Edith Fiore's classic \"The Unquiet Dead - A Psychologist, Treats Spirit Possession.\" Their work describes many case studies on how to release unwanted spirits from your body and help confused earthbound spirits cross over to the Light. Poisoning the body with drugs causes blockages in the afterlife However, as Mayer said, Excessive use of allopathic medicine and psychiatric drugs/pharmaceuticals (including \"illegal\" drugs) can negatively affect the afterlife experience and keep the soul earthbound. Dr. Baldwin has made the same discoveries in his work, and so has Steve Richards in his work with Holographic Kineticsics. Thomas Mayer describes such a case (based on asthroposophy) of someone who died of cancer after having received heavy doses of chemotherapy: Cemented ether body after chemotherapy \"During a meditation class, Martin was taken by a deep sadness, which surprised him, and kept him occupied throughout the day. We took a closer look and it turned out that his twin brother, Stefan, died of cancer six years ago...Before his death, he was receiving strong chemotherapy and had a bloated face. The sadness that overtook Martin was not his own feelings, but the feelings of his brother. He was in despair because he was not able to let go - he felt as if he was bound with iron chains by an external power. I didn't understand it at first, because in his soul Stefan was jovial, happy, and free; I couldn't find any bond at all. Only when I looked at his etheric body (life body) did I understand that it was solidified like black glue, compacted like asphalt. These were the consequences of chemotherapy. Stefan's astral body (soul body) could not separate from the ether body; his astral body was not able to leave his earthly life behind and enter the Kamaloka, that is, into the so-called Moon Sphere. This was not possible for Stefan, although he urgently longed for it. I found soratic-ahrimanic beings in his etheric body, which were obviously connected with the substances used in chemotherapy and thus had gained access to Stefan's body. These were side effects of the chemotherapy, which are not described in the package insert. It is known, however, that cemeteries prolong the lying time of dead bodies with chemotherapy because these bodies do not decompose easily (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 199, a newspaper article from 9.5.1997, \"Chemotherapie verzoegert Verwesungsprozess\" - \"Chemotherapy delays process of decomposition\"). This is an earthly expression of what Stefan experienced in the spiritual world.\" In his book, Mayer describes more cases of the detrimental effects of (legal) Euthanasia, Antibody Therapy, Psychiatric Drugs, Morphine, and other Allopathic medicines on the astral/ether body during life and in the afterlife. They can keep the spirit stuck in the lower astral realm and vulnerable to the influence and attachment of soratic hostile forces. \"With these examples, it is not said that all orthodox (allopathic) medications work this way. Many do not, but some do. Such after-death consequences resemble torture. However, the after-death side effects of drugs are not investigated and considered at all...The problem has been known for a long time. Rudolf Steiner spoke a hundred years ago very clearly about how material substances can have an after-death effect.\" Here's another example of a case study of the effects of psychiatric drugs in the afterlife: \"A colleague studied Melperone, one of the most common drugs for agitation, anxiety, and depression. She let the drug act on her bodies and experienced that the \"I\" and the astral body were pushed into the etheric body and the physical body and held in them. As a result, the \"I\" activity was paralyzed, and the astral body became more agile; dullness and rigidity developed. It can be assumed that this has an effect on sleep and that the \"I\" and the astral body could no longer be regularly released from the etheric and the physical bodies at night but remained stuck in it. The soul could no longer be among spiritual beings during the time of sleep. With that, the consciousness of the spiritual world would be extinguished, and the soul would be put into an artificial immobility. Such was the experience of a woman whose mother was given Meloperon while living in the old people's home. The lady, who was over 90 years old and spiritually awake, put into something of this condition in desperate words: Looking at the daughter who visited her, she said: She could no longer rejoice or take part in anything. She also lost interest in anthroposophy, even in praying, which had been part of her life for decades. This condition did not stop with death. Years later it was observed that the soul of the old lady was still in isolation and could not enter a regular Kamalokoa process. It lacked the ability to deeply feel the consequences of one's own deeds in the souls of others. She had an awareness of herself, also memories of her life on Earth, but only from her own point of view. She was stuck in a certain immobility of the soul and could not directly perceive or feel the spiritual surroundings of the human souls belonging to her, or even sense them in the distance. She lived isolated and surrounded by darkness. She received light and warmth only through the loving care of the living - their requests, meditations, and spiritual thoughts. However, these attentions could not fundamentally change the state of isolation itself. This was only achieved through targeted extensive Healing Meditations. What is shocking about this case is that even people who had lived intensively with anthroposophy could be kept in a gray cocoon - in loneliness and without direct perception of their spiritual surroundings - caused by psychotropic drugs. Their process of development in the Kamaloka can be severely hindered by this for years.\" There are more cases of these detrimental effects of pharmaceuticals on the spiritual bodies of humans in Mayer's book. Corona Vaccination Damages In The Life After Death Thomas Mayer and his research team also discovered that the effects of the vaccines don't stop with death. While the physical body is discarded at death, the spiritual beings and forces of the COVID vaccines continue to work. Mayer shows some case studies of what this means for the deceased vaccinated people: \"On February 23, 2021, during a work meeting, I had the opportunity to perceive a deceased person, who had received a corona vaccination before leaving the body. The etheric body of the deceased was contracted, slanted, and tense, the soul was chained to it, sad, suffering, lonely and disoriented in darkness. Normally, after death, the etheric body expands and the tableau of life becomes free, in which the deceased experiences all the memories of his or her past life in simultaneity and greater clarity. This did not happen here, the life tableau was prevented, and the soul was stuck earthbound. No light of the spiritual world reached it. Normally, the deceased are received and enveloped by their angels. That was not the case here, the angel was without connection on the sidelines. From such blocked states souls cannot free themselves from their predicament in foreseeable time. They need an intervention from the outside. Spiritual interventions, which are stimulated by incarnated people, can help here. We did our best for this poor soul to help it in a process of development. Was this just an isolated case or is it common after corona vaccination? That is a burning question. If there is no one to take care of the earthbound deceased, it may take many centuries for their condition to change. \"It's just a jab and then you can travel again\", announce the vaccinations commercials. But in reality, it could mean that the soul cannot make its journey through the spiritual world for hundreds of years after death, stuck, suffering, and thus burdening living ones.\" Mayer also mentions that, He is hinting at the possibility that these earthbound spirits of the deceased can result in spirit attachments to the living population, as Dr. William Baldwin described in his work mentioned before. Mayer is now asking the big question standing like the elephant in the living room, addressing the reality that over half of the global population has become fully vaccinated with at least one short. Many people have had two, three, or even four boosters. We also know that Klaus Schwab (WEF), Bill Gates, and \"As shown in the previous chapters, some modern medicines are known to have similar after-death effects as we have noticed after the Covid vaccinations. Now, however, the whole of mankind is to be vaccinated. If the after-death renewal phase fails for billions of people, what will become of mankind? That would be just as with incarnate humans who are denied a deep sleep break. In-Depth Insights Into Earth-Bounded Vaccinated People Mayer and his team observed supersensibly 11 deceased people who had been vaccinated. Their souls were earthbound, isolated, and became prey for occult hostile forces: \"We have looked supersensibly at eleven deceased who had been vaccinated. These eleven dead people were earthbound. Their higher bodies were so disjointed and devoid of the protection from the higher beings that they were easy prey for Adversarial Spirits. The I- organization, the higher \"I\" and the angel were also earthbound and suffered an attack by these beings. The souls were mostly in a dark spiritual space, filled with fear, despair, and pain. They had no contact with other souls and felt alone and abandoned. These negative feelings and thoughts have a destructive effect on the earth and are used purposefully by the Ahrimanic and Asuric beings.\" There are also deeper \"hell realms\" in the lower astral levels where souls of the vaccinated could be pulled down to: \"We are glad when souls are only earthbound because we also had cases when souls were pulled down into the so-called sixth spiritual dark inner layer of earth. This happens when an explosion of the etheric and astral body took place at death. But this had taken place only in some cases.\" More Cases Of Earth-Bounded Vaccinated People \"... There was a darkening, like small black dots, from the contact with the dark forces. The double is a little closer than normal and has a strong relation to these dark points of the astral body. The body elemental has been hardened; trauma has taken place. Also, the guardian angel had remnants of traumatization. The encounter with the dark beings that come with the vaccines seems to be a great challenge and leaves traces. This example also shows the profound effect of Corona vaccinations. This can be a traumatic, severely hurtful experience, which is why the deceased is often unable to free himself from it by his own efforts. Then help and influence from the outside are necessary. Without such intervention, the state of being earthbound and cut off from the spiritual world can last for a long time. A few hundred years seems possible...\" Another research group in Germany looked at 31 vaccinated deceased people: \"We have looked at a total of 31 vaccinated deceased people, all of whom were earthbound. These people died in March and April 2021 and were mostly over 80 years old. Earthbound means that the etheric body and phantom body (physical spirit body) are solidified and do not expand. The soul is chained to these bodies and therefore lives in darkness - it does not experience life-panorama or their spiritual environment and does not experience its angel. They neither can experience other light-filled dead around them nor the warming spiritual light of the Christ. Due to their bad condition, these earth-bound souls negatively influence the soul- and consciousness life of those incarnated on earth who were connected with them, and thus shape the collective atmosphere, without necessarily being aware of it themselves.(... )\" Another question that comes up in light of these observations is whether it makes a difference if someone dies years later after the vaccination. All the cases mentioned above were of deceased people who died within a few weeks of receiving the vaccine. The supersensible research team asked this question and stated that it is impossible to say since it could not be observed at the time of this research and the release of Mayer's book. After verifying these cases for himself, and realizing the \"horror of the situation\" with regards to the spiritual implications of billions of people who have been vaccinated, Mayer shares his thoughts: \"To verify these experiences, I have worked with these deceased myself and could confirm the earth-boundness and the described peculiarities. The extent of these after-death effects of vaccination is frightening for me. In the last years, I have dealt a lot with blockades in the after-death life and have seen so much, that I was able to develop a kind of professional sobriety, like emergency paramedics who drive from accident to accident. Nevertheless, the extent of this vaccination catastrophe gets under my skin. For my own spiritual hygiene, it is important that I give space to these feelings. That is why I am writing about it. Through that, they turn into the power that makes it possible to stay on the subject and write this book.\" More cases of earthbound spirits of vaccinated people are in Mayer's book, which you can read and study for yourself. For the purpose of this article, I just quote some selected cases to give an overview in light of the overall matrix agenda and the spiritual warfare we are in. As I said many times and as it is becoming even more evident, we are in the midst of a multi-dimensional war over our soul and, essentially, the future of humanity. But not all is lost. At the end of this article, we'll get to that part of \"what to do.\" It's nothing new and what I've addressed over and over again. We all have the power to overcome this frightening situation and reclaim our soul and divine nature, but it does require effort, sincerity, and self-responsibility. Earthbound Spirits Of the Vaccinated Dead As Feeding Ground For Dark Adversary Spirits Mayer made another disturbing discovery. In some cases, the trapped earthbound spirit of a deceased vaccinated person becomes prey on which adversary hostile forces were feeding off, i.e., sucking the life force out of them. Most often, other earthbound spirits become conduits of powerful adversary negative forces as described in this case: \"... During the spiritual intervention, I concentrated first on the soratic-transhumanism spirits in her etheric body. But this was not enough, there were other dark inclusions connected with a group of deceased, who were in a miserable state and had connected themselves with the highest adversarial spirits. These sucked power from the earthbound woman. Only after the possession by this group of the dead was removed, was the spiritual intervention felt to be bringing effects. This sucking out is not surprising; the enslavement of the deceased exists for eons in many variations and was often also brought about consciously. In this case, the vile group of dead souls simply used the \"good opportunity\" and occupied the defenseless woman to help themselves to her powers. Deceased, who are enwrapped by their angel, cannot be possessed, but this angel protection was prevented by the Corona inoculation. How often does it happen that earthbound vaccinated dead are used as feeding trough by spiritual predators? I am afraid, very often, because in the spiritual world there are innumerable miserable dead, who have no connection to the higher spiritual world and who therefore resort to feeding themselves from the powers of other dead.\" Keep in mind that the opposing occult hostile forces I've written about this topic in depth over the years. For a selection of articles and essays on this topic, go The only way to fully protect yourself is via The more you live from essence and have your soul fully embodied, the less these adverse forces can get to you, whether in this physical life or in the afterlife. Freeing Those Who Died Due To Vaccine Damage Can Be Very Difficult In the next chapter of the book, Mayer shares experiences of practitioners helping stuck earthbound spirits of deceased vaccinated people to transition towards the light, getting them out of the grip of dark, hostile forces, and reclaim their spiritual Selves. This work is not easy at all, and it requires a lot of occult knowledge, experience, and supersensible perception. Moreover, the practitioner needs to be careful not to take on an entity him/herself or be negatively affected in other ways. As mentioned before, the practitioners in Mayer's research team and cited in his book are all trained in anthroposophy based on Steiner's work with decades of experience. However, the same healing work of helping earthbound spirits transition and recover from the adverse effects of the vaccination could also be achieved, in my opinion - with Dr. William Baldwin's modality \"Spirit Releasement Therapy\" other spirit releasement modalities can achieve the same (and there are also a lot of nonsense and pseudo-New Age-type modalities), but I can only comment on those I've studied or worked with myself. But whatever the modality may be, it is not easy work but requires many sessions and a lot of time and energy. Keep in mind that we're dealing with a new type of \"demonic\" entity (the \"vaccine being\" and/or \"soratic-transhumanism spirits\") that is being injected directly into a person via the vaccine. Thomas Mayer writes about these challenges to spiritual healers helping the dead: \"However, the report reveals a big problem: Who then is to take care of the immense number of vaccinated deceased? This is not manageable at all. There is an absolute shortage of personnel and training. Only in selected cases will the vaccinated dead be able to get the help they need.\" Realizing the impossibility to help all vaccinated dead, Mayer comes to the most important conclusion which I have continually pointed out as well: \"Those who get vaccinated must do it on their own spiritual responsibility. At present, it is unfortunately quite naive to hope for after-death help. If things go badly, the spiritual world can no longer reach the deceased, and the other incarnated people who have the necessary abilities and experience are hopelessly overloaded.\" I would add that this \"spiritual responsibility\" also needs to be applied by the non-vaccinated or anyone aware enough to engage in this inner (Great) Work on all levels: This is the work of soul embodiment and sincere self-work to expel and reject any dark forces and reclaim your soul. How Many Are Earthbound? The ultimate question is how many of the vaccinated dead didn't transition to the light but became earthbound spirits stuck in the lower astral realm. Thomas Mayer and his research team of qualified and experienced supersensible practitioners found that out of 48 of the deceased vaccinated they worked with, only one of them was not earthbound. In that case, I would say that the person's soul development and spiritual constitution were strong enough to repel the soratic beings of the vaccine even though he took the vaccine. Here are Mayer's notes on that one particular case: \"A very special experience for me was the meeting with Raphael on 5.28.2021, a great soul. Raphael died in March 2021 at the age of 91, three days after the vaccination. He would have died in a foreseeable time even without vaccination. He was demented the few last years, but physically quite fit. He was very close to Anthroposophy.(... ) ... What happened by the Corona vaccination before his death? I try to look at it, and I have the impression that his soul was aware of the deep-dark beings and forces that came with the vaccination. I can feel their quality well, he could probably feel it too. There was a stop, \"You will not enter in here!\" Thus, he remained untouched by them inwardly.\" However, 47 out of the 48 deceased become earthbound after death: \"The question arises: I think so because the tendency is clear. In our research, we have found almost none of the vaccinated dead were not earthbound. Of course, the number of examined cases is still small, but the result is clear. Of the 48 deceased mentioned in this chapter, 47 were earthbound and only one was not. This condition is important because in all cases studied only a few weeks passed between vaccination and death, and the people were mostly already so old or presumably in such a bad condition that hardly any processes could take place. If a person is vaccinated in middle age, leads an active life, and then dies after 30 years, it is to be assumed that completely different preconditions for the afterlife prevail - at least if the Corona vaccinations are not repeated every year.\" There is more information in Mayer's book also with regards to CVOID-19, the \"illness\" itself, and other topics relating to it that are only available in the German edition of the complete book at the time of writing this article. As mentioned before, the English version of the complete book will come out in late Summer 2022. The Situation Is Not Hopeless - The Importance To Engage In The Great Work Despite this dire situation and disturbing revelations about the spiritual effects of the Corona vaccine, let's not forget an important point Mayer (and myself) made at the beginning: Mayer also stated that \"the situation is not hopeless,\" and there are lessons to be learned. I wholeheartedly agree with that statement. In fact, all there are, ARE lessons in light of the evolution of consciousness from the much bigger picture perspective in alignment with Divine Will. It's essential to However, we must also be aware of the danger of spiritual bypassing. This work also includes deep psychological self-work to heal our wounds and traumas, mainly engaging in shadow work, becoming aware of your projections and triggers, and hence healing/closing the entry point for any hostile forces to come in. Over the years, I've written and talked about this necessary deeper (inner) work in depth. This is not easy work by far. Many people say they want to \"awaken\" and engage in shadow work. Still, when the rubber hits the road, it gets messy and uncomfortable when all the suppressed unconscious psychic material comes up. The counter projections kick in with all the justifications and rationalizations, and many well-meaning people cannot cross the threshold at this point and go \"back to sleep.\" We are in the midst of the Kali Yuga (ruled by the demon Kali, not the goddess Kali as most people mistake), the darkest cycle where humanity is the most removed from the Divine and where the anti-divine forces of darkness reign the world, working through humans normalizing all kinds of pathologies. We've been in the Kali Yuga for thousands of years as we descend deeper into darkness. From a higher perspective, this is a natural process in light of the evolution of consciousness according to the Law of Ascent and Descent. In other words, we have not fully surrendered all parts of our Being to the Divine. Everyone, without exception, have trauma going back lifetimes and even just basic childhood wounding from growing up in a world where pathology has become normalized. We all have goals, needs, desires, and wants that stem from the wounded/conditioned false self, the fake desire soul (as Sri Aurobindo called it), mistaking it for your true Self. They are compensations and externalizations not to deal with the pain of not trying to fill a hole within that can never be filled that way. And that is also where the adverse occult forces tag into, feed upon, and even fuel it through temptation. We are not integrally sincere and have all kinds of excuses, rationalizations, and reasons not engaging in the Great (inner) Work. We project our pain externally onto others and justify our triggers and projections. Anyone who claims that they are not wounded/traumatized or has no shadow is even more traumatized than they are aware of. As I continue to dig deep into my own darkness, shining light (consciousness) on all the parts of myself that have been wounded and traumatized, neglected, shamed, and shunned, with all the pain, sadness, anger, and grief that comes up in the process, the more I see it in others who are dreaming of being awake and are checked out of their bodies, mechanically living along like programs. Their entire existence is just a trauma response, as they are puppets by forces they have no awareness of. I'm not just speaking of people who go along with the globalist agenda but also many who claim to be \"awake\" just because they see through the 3D matrix agenda. But they still externalize, and I don't know many people who actually engage sincerely in the inner work to clear the vessel to fully integrally surrender to the Divine. I'm not taking myself out of the equation, for I can see my lack of sincerity at times. The struggle of how my ego-personality interferes with all its attachments, how unconscious trauma/wounding still triggers specific reactions and behaviors in me, and how I can project my shadow onto others and the world at times. I would never claim to be fully \"awake\" in the word's TRUE meaning. So many people overestimate their level of being/awareness just because they maybe can see through the deception of the 3D matrix on an intellectual level. But that is not enough. As Adyashanti once said: In other words, do you really want to awaken or just be happy? The answer to this question and how you act on it is a test of your sincerity, and ultimately the \"solution\" to the madness/darkness \"out there,\" for only your own sincere Awakening can help change the world. If your answer to that question is \"I want both\", you'll see the perfect example of why the world is still in darkness and your own struggle within with all the contradictions. We still have a long way to go, but make no mistake, a genuine awakening is a destructive process within yourself, not just out there. No one can escape the Law of Ascent and Descent. It's about engaging in the Work. I'm putting that mirror right on myself too. "}
