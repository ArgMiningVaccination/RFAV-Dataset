Normalistas 800, Col. Colinas de la Normal, 44270, Guadalajara, Accepted 31 August 2021, Published online 14 September 2021 - Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus ticks are obligatory hematophagous ectoparasites of cattle and act as vectors for disease-causing microorganisms. Conventional tick control is based on the application of chemical acari- cides; however, their uncontrolled use has increased resistant tick populations, as well as food and environmental con- tamination. Alternative immunological tick control has shown to be partially effective. Therefore, there is a need tocharacterize novel antigens in order to improve immunological protection. The aim of this work was to evaluate Cys-loop receptors as vaccine candidates. N-terminal domains of a glutamate receptor and of a glycine-like receptor were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli . Groups of BALB/c mice were independently immunized with four doses of each recombinant protein emulsi ed with Freund 's adjuvant. Both vaccine candidates were immunogenic in mice as demonstrated by western blot analysis. Next, recombinant proteins were independently formulated with the adjuvant Montanide ISA 50 V2 and evaluated in cattle infested with Rhipicephalus microplus tick larvae. Groups of three European crossbred calves were immunized with three doses of each adjuvanted protein. ELISA test was usedto evaluate the IgG immune response elicited against the recombinant proteins. Results showed that vaccine candidates generated a moderate humoral response on vaccinated cattle. Vaccination signi cantly affected the number of engorged adult female ticks, having no signi cant effects on tick weight, egg weight and egg fertility values. Vaccine ef cacies of 33% and 25% were calculated for the glutamate receptor and glycine-like receptor, respectively.

Des ef cacit\u00e9s vaccinales de 33 et % ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9es pour le r\u00e9cepteur du glutamate microplus tick infestations dee- ply affect cattle production because these parasites cause dam-age directly in addition to acting as vectors for disease-causingagents such as Anaplasma spp. and Babesia spp. [ 33]. Chemi- cal control remains the tick control method of choice [ 27]. However, this practice regularly leads to the selection of tickpopulations resistant to the chemical used to treat infested cattle[16,29,32]. Immunological control has emerged as a promis- ing alternative to restrain tick infestations and pathogen transmission. This new approach prompted the development and com- mercialization of vaccines based on the recombinant proteinBm86 [ 7,21,31,36]. This success was, however, overshad- owed by the fact that these vaccines show variable effectivenessin different tick populations, attributable to antigenic variationsin the Bm86 protein between tick populations [ 7,19,37]. Con- sequently, there is a need to characterize novel antigens in orderto improve immunological protection. The reverse vaccinology approach is a promising strategy for the identi cation of novel anti-tick vaccine candidates. Can- didates are selected based on their expression level, subcellular localization, accessibility and biological function, among otherfactors [ 26]. Hence, we focused our attention on members of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) family fromR. microplus tick. Cys-loop receptors are membrane-spanning proteins and they play key biological functions mediating thesynaptic transmission of nerve impulses [ 22]. We have previ- ously shown that genes encoding for a glutamate-gated receptorand a glycine-like receptor are expressed at egg, larval and adultdevelopmental stages of R. microplus [17,18]. Both receptors are membrane-spanning neurotransmitter-gated ion channelsthat are responsible for fast transmission in the peripheral and central nervous systems. They share a common structure of ve subunits. Each subunit has a large N-terminal extracellulardomain (ECD), four transmembrane domains (TMD), a largeintracellular domain (ICD) and a short C-terminal ECD [ 41]. Being proteins located in the cell membrane, their extracellularantigenic regions would be easily accessible to antibodies pro-duced by an immunized bovine host. In the present study, we followed the reverse vaccinology approach and applied the above-mentioned selection criteriato decide on and assess the immunogenicity and protective ef - cacy of recombinant N-terminal ECD of a glutamate-gated receptor [ 20] and of recombinant N-terminal ECD of a glycine-like receptor [ 17] from R. microplus tick. Materials and methods Production of recombinant proteins Nucleotide sequences encoding for the N-terminal ECD of a (GluCl; GenBank accession no. KJ476181 from NJ,USA) and subcloned from pUC57 plasmid into s of pET32b(+) plasmid (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA,USA). These constructs were used to transform electro- competent Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Waltham, MA, USA). Transformants were selected by antibiotic resistance marker and plasmid insertion was con-rmed by restriction enzyme digestions. Transformed colonies w e r eg r o w ni n1L flasks containing Luria-Bertani broth to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.8 -1, at 37 /C176C and 250 rpm. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl- b- D- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h. Then, bacteria lysed using an inphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 0.1% Triton X-100, and cell debris separated by centrifugation. Recombinant proteins were His-tag metal af nity puri 5 mL Bio-Scale Mini Pronity IMAC cartridges (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA, USA), which had been previously equilibrated with bufferA (300 mM KCl, 50 mM KH 2PO4, 5 mM imidazole). After two consecutive washes with one column volume of bufferA, bound proteins were eluted in buffer A supplemented with250 mM imidazole. polyacrylamide matrix by electroelution using an Electro-Eluter (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Recombinant proteins in elution bufferwere mixed with 1% Triton X-114, chilled on ice and warmedat 37 /C176C until formation of two phases. After centrifugation, upper aqueous phase with endotoxin free proteins was recov-ered and residual detergent was removed by dialysis with25 mM HEPES-10% glycerol-150 mM NaCl. Speci cm o l e c u - lar weight of recombinant proteins was con rmed by Western blot after SDS-PAGE in 10% amouse anti-His tag monoclonal (Roche Indianapolis, IN, USA). Mice immunization Seven 6-week-old female BALB/c mice were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Mexico City, Mexico) and main-tained in cages with food and water ad libitum . They were divided into 2 groups of 4 and 3 mice, respectively. Groupswere immunized with 20 lg of recombinant N-terminal ECD of glutamate-gated receptor (rGluCl, 4 mice) or recombinantN-terminal ECD of glycine-like receptor (rGlyR, 3 mice) mixedwith complete Freund 's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for priming and incomplete Freund 's adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for boosting. Immuniza-tions were carried out on days 1, 15, 30 and 45. Blood was col- lected by tail vein bleeding before immunization (bleeding 1), 5, 42 and 50 days after rst immunization (bleedings 2, 32 M.M. Vel\u00e1zquez et al.: Parasite 2021, 28,6 5and 4, respectively). Serum samples were obtained and pre- served at /C080/C176C until use. Mice care and maintenance were carried out in the Vaccine Evaluation Module of Animal Exper-imentation Facilities (Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Western blot assays Western blot assays were carried out to determine the immunogenicity of rGluCl and rGlyR proteins in mice. Brie fly, recombinant proteins were separately electrophoresed on 12%polyacrylamide preparative gels and transferred PBS solutioncontaining and 5% skim milk for2ha t4 /C176C, with gentle rocking. After that, membranes were washed three times in PBS-T, cut into strips (~0.4 mm) andincubated with different mice sera diluted 1:100 in PBS-T-milkin mini incubation trays (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Philadelphia,PA, USA) for 24 h at 4 /C176C. Later, strips were washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad PA,USA) as secondary antibody, diluted 1:3000 in PBS-T-milkfor 4 h, at room temperature, followed by washing withPBS-T solution. Finally, immunoreactive bands were evidencedusing an HRP Substrate and Detection kit (Opti-4CN; Bio-RadLaboratories, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Rhipicephalus microplus tick strain The multiresistant R. microplus tick strain (Isla strain, Mexico) was obtained from a laboratory colony maintained atCENAPA-SENASICA, Jiutepec, Morelos, Mexico. Originally,these ticks were collected from infested cattle in Isla ranch,Padilla municipality, Tamaulipas, Mexico, were fed on cattle and collected after repletion and kept undercontrolled laboratory conditions for oviposition and hatchingin humidity chambers at 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod, 25-27/C176C and 80% relative humidity (RH). Larvae were ~20 days of age at the time of infestations. Cattle immunization and tick infestations The experimental protocol was approved by the Institu- tional Committee of Animal Experimentation of the NationalAnimal cation Services Center (CENAPA, M\u00e9xico; approval number: PE01/16). Cattle were individually housed in isolation pens and were fed on fodder receiving waterad libitum . Three European crossbred calves per group were each immunized with 3 doses (days 1, 30 and 50) containing100lg/dose of rGluCl or rGlyR proteins. A negative control group (three animals) was injected with adjuvant/saline alone.Emulsions were made with recombinant proteins in PBS plusadjuvant Montanide ISA 50 V2 (anhydromannitoletheroctode-cenoate; Seppic, Paris, France) volume ratio. Cattle wereinjected intramuscularly with 2 mL/dose using a 5 mL syringeand an 18G needle. Two weeks after the second immunization, cattle in the vaccinated and control groups were infested with ~1850 R. microplus (Isla strain, Mexico) larvae/animal, and thereafter every third day, totalizing 18 infestations. Cattle werecared for in accordance with standards speci ed in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Cattle blood collection Blood samples were collected from cattle every week for 12 weeks. Those obtained on weeks 1, 5 and 8 were collectedbefore immunization. Samples were collected from the caudalvein into sterile tubes using vacutainer needles (0.8 /C238 mm; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and maintained at 4 /C176C until arrival at the laboratory. Serum was separated from cellu-lar components by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 1 min andstored at /C020/C176C until used. Antibody levels were determined using an antigen-speci c indirect enzyme-linked immunosor- bent assay (ELISA). Determination of serum antibody levels by ELISA Puried rGluCl and rGlyR proteins were diluted in a coating buffer (0.05 M carbonate bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and used tocoat 96-well ELISA plates (0.1 lg/well; Nunc MaxiSorp, Thermo Fisher Scienti c, Waltham, MA, USA), which were then incubated overnight at 4 /C176C. The plates were washed three times with wash buffer (PBS-T) and then blocked with a block-ing buffer (5% skim milk in PBS). Plates were incubated with cattle serum samples diluted 1:100 in PBS-T for 1 h at 37/C176C. After washing three times with washing buffer, plates were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-bovine IgG(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) diluted 1:10,000 for 1 hat 37 /C176C. After washing three times with washing buffer, color reaction was developed with 3,3 0,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Thereaction was stopped with 2 M H 2SO4and plates were read at OD PA, in immunized cattle were expressed as OD 450 nm values and compared between vaccinated and control cattleusing an ANOVA test ( p<0 . 0 5 Data collection and evaluation Adult engorged female ticks from vaccinated and control animals were daily collected, counted, weighed and assessedfor egg laying capacity and fertility to determine the ef cacy of the vaccine candidates, emplo ying the following formulae [ 2,11].

Results Antigen selection Both GluCl and GlyR, two members of the Cys-loop recep- tors family of R. microplus tick, were selected for the present study, after having ful lled several requirements. Figure 1 shows the complete amino acid sequence of GluCl receptor ( Fig. 1A ), the partial amino acid sequence of GlyR receptor ( Fig. 1D ), and the selected regions to produce recombinant proteins. Theseregions correspond to N-terminal domains on both receptors andthey have extracellular location ( Figs. linear B-cell epitopes was applied on thesesequences and results showed that the N-terminal ECD sequenceof GluCl contained eight possible linear B-cell protective whereas the N-terminal ECD sequence epitopes ( and1F).Additionally, both receptors were predicted to be antigenic by using VaxiJen (VaxiJen scores > 0.5). Recombinant protein expression N-terminal ECD of GluCl and N-terminal ECD of GlyR were recombinantly produced in E. coli and puri ed.Figure 2 shows the SDS-PAGE patterns of protein fractions fromE. coli cultures during ( respectively). Recombinant proteins expression was con rmed by Western blot analyses, which showed a band of ~35 kDa for rGluCl ( Fig. Fig. 2D ). Puri ed recombinant proteins were then used for the immunogenicity studies in mice. Mice immunization experiment BALB/c mice were independently immunized with the recombinant antigens. Figure 3 shows that both proteins were immunogenic in mice as demonstrated by Western blot assays. Reactive bands were observed only on days 42 and 50 after rst immunization. Mice immunized with rGluCl showed a variableimmunological response among individuals ( 3B 3C ). Cattle immunization and infestations experiment Afterward, recombinant proteins were independently for- mulated and evaluated in cattle infested with R. microplus tick larvae. Vaccination signi cantly affected the number adult female ticks on cattle immunized with rGluCl(26.39% reduction) and the group immunized with rGlyR(22.74% reduction), as compared to the control group ( Table 1 ). Reductions in tick weight, egg weight and egg fertility valueswere also observed in vaccinated groups, although the differ-ences were not signi cant as compared to the control group (Table 1 ). Vaccine ef cacies of 33% and 25% were rGluCl and rGlyR, respectively. The IgG immune responseelicited in cattle against the recombinant antigens was also determined by ELISA assays ( Fig. 4 ). Results showed that vaccine candidates generated a moderate humoral response onvaccinated cattle, which was more pronounced in cattle vacci-nated with rGlyR. Antibody levels increased after successiveimmunizations and maintained a steady level until the end ofthe experiment. Discussion Considerable efforts have been devoted toward identifying anti-tick vaccine antigens [ 8,30,35]. In this sense, however, transmembrane proteins have not yet been fully exploited invaccination studies, despite the fact that their vaccine ef cacy has been demonstrated through Bm86 orthologs and aquaporin- based vaccines [ 8]. In this study, we tested the immunogenicity and protective efcacy of recombinant N-terminal ECD of two members of Cys-loop receptors, namely, GluCl and GlyR reverse vaccinology approach. These candi- dates were evaluated on the basis that they ful lled a series of selection criteria related to their expression level, biologicalfunction, accessibility and subcellular localization [ 8,26,34]. Moreover, both receptors were predicted to contain severalpotential linear B-cell epitopes and to be antigenic. VaxiJensoftware is an immunoinformatic tool that has been widely usedto identify subunit vaccine candidates among proteins of bacterial, viral, parasite, fungal and tumor origin [ 43]. Recently, VaxiJen was identify putative microplus ticks. Maritz-Olivier et al. [ d e n t i ed 791 vac- cine candidates, of which 176 were membrane-associated and86 secreted soluble proteins.

On the other hand, Richardset al. [ 35] identi ed 21 transmembrane proteins as having a VaxiJen score /C210.5. Interestingly, a putative calnexin showed a higher VaxiJen score (0.91) than that predicted for Bm86(Vaxijen score: 0.77); however, cattle vaccine trials that validatetheirndings are still lacking. Once selected, our vaccine candidates were recombinantly produced in E. coli and puri ed. Recombinant proteins were successfully expressed and obtained at the expected sizes(Fig. 2 ). It is worth mentioning that intense bands were observed on IPTG-induced cultures. However, faint bands werealso observed on un-induced cultures. A possible explanationcould be that the pET32 plasmids we used contain the T7 pro-moter, which is known for having background ( \"leaky \") expression [ 28,39,42]. Figure 2.

In cattle, a moderate humoral response against vaccine candidates was observed ( Fig. 4 ). A decreased anti-rGluCl antibody response was detected inweek 4, which was recovered after booster immunizations.The cause for this decrease is unknown but it could be relatedto problems associated with the stability of the vaccine formu-lation, as suggested by Almaz\u00e1n et al. [ 2]. From other studies, it is known that a direct correlation exists between antibody titersto certain tick antigens and the ef cacy of vaccination [ 10]. Nevertheless, this is not necessarily true for other tick antigens. Several studies have reported potent antigen-speci c antibody responses that did not correlate with the expected protectionlevels [ 3,4,23]. In our study, antibody levels are consistent with the obtained vaccine ef cacies. However, antibody levels were higher against rGlyR than rGluCl, although higher anti-R. microplus efcacy was obtained against the latter. rGlyR was apparently more immunogenic than rGluCl but affordedless protection, con rming previous observations that antibody titers do not always match with ef cacy. The modest immuno- genicity may be a consequence of the bacterial recombinant protein expression system used. Tellam et al. [ 40] have demon- strated that vaccine containing the insect cells-expressed Bm86 have higher ef cacy for the control of tick infestations than those made from E. coli -expressed antigens. Furthermore, glycosylated recombinant Bm86 puri ed from Pichia pastoris was demonstrated to be more immunogenic that non-glycosylated one [ 12]. This suggests that glycosylation on tick proteins may be important for enhancing both immuno-genicity and protective ef cacy of tick antigen formulations [12]. It is worth mentioning that both receptors in this study have multiple potential glycosylation sites (data not shown). Therefore, their production in a eukaryotic system could increase their immunological properties. On the other hand, vaccination in cattle signi cantly affected the number of engorged adult female ticks, whereasit had no signi cant effects on tick weight, egg weight and egg fertility ( Table 1 ). Obtained vaccine ef cacies are similar to those of several tick antigens combining antigens (cock-tail anti-tick vaccines) could improve ef cacies of individual vaccines. However, this still requires experimental validation [30]. We recognize that our ndings are limited by the small number of animals used in the controlled pen trial. Becausebovine individual response to both tick infestation and vaccina-tion is heterogeneous ( Table 1 ), additional trials with more animals are required to reach a conclusion about the usefulnessof tested antigens for the control of cattle tick infestations. Finally, the followed reverse vaccinology approach offers several advantages over the traditional method, such as thespeed in the identi cation of putative protective antigens and this type of approach could obviate the need to use non-bovine animal models to determine if a recombinant tick antigen is immunoprotective, holding the promise of being able to predictnovel potential tick vaccine candidates. However, to improveTable 1. Control of R. microplus infestations in cattle vaccinated with the recombinant antigens.

Vel\u00e1zquez et al.: Parasite 2021, 28,6 5 7such predictions, several considerations must be taken into account. Diverse epitope prediction programs use human or murine major histocompatibility alleles, excluding bovine data sets, which may yield misleading information [ 7,26,35]. With regard to the VaxiJen program, it has been until very recentlyapplied to ectoparasites, generating an large number of putativetick protective antigens [ Vaccination trials will inate protective from non-protective antigens, and this s shouldimprove the predictive potential of VaxiJen for the identi ca- tion of additional anti-tick vaccine candidates. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study reports for the rst time the targeting of nervous system components of R. microplus cattle ticks through vaccination. Recombinant N-terminal Cys-loop receptors domains were immunogenic and conferred partialprotection against R. microplus tick infestations. Changing the recombinant protein expression system to a eukaryotic onecould improve the ef cacy of vaccine candidates.
