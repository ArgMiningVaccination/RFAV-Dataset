Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 26 2.4.4.1.2.2 To the extent possible, TENNCARE shall enrollee all enrollees in Group 6 in the same household in the CONTRACTOR's MCO . 2.4.4.1.2.3 Children eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI will be assigned to the CONTRACTOR's MC O but may opt -out and choose another MCO. 2.4.4.1.2.4 TennCare enrollees who are children in the custody of the Department of Children's Services (DCS) will be enrolled in TennCare Select. When these enrollees exit State custody , they remain enrolled in TennCare Sele ct for a specified period of time and then are disenrolled from TennCare Select. After disenrollment from TennCare Select, if the enrollee has a family member in an MCO (other than TennCare Select) he/she will be enrolled in that MCO. Otherwise, the enroll ee will be given the opportunity to select another MCO. If the enrollee does not select another MCO, he/she will be assigned to an MCO (other than TennCare Select) using the default logic in the auto assignment process (see Section 2.4.4.2 below) . 2.4.4.1.2.5 TENNCAR E may allow enrollment of new TennCare enrollees in TennCare Select if there is insufficient capacity in other MCOs. 2.4.4.1.3 Assignment Provisions for Children in State Custody To decrease the likelihood of recidivism, the enrollment period for children in Group 1.A who are transitioning out of State custody shall be extended by a period to be determined by TENNCARE. Children will be assigned to Group 1.B during this post - custody transition period and shall continue to receive services as specified in Section 3 including access to Best Practice Network providers, unless TENNCARE does not extend the enrollment period for children transitioning out of State custody . After the post-custody period of at least the period determined by TENNCARE, children assigned to Group 1.B shall be moved as appropriate, to Groups 2 -6 and shall remain a member of the new group until the following change period, or until the child loses eligibility for TennCare. At the option of the State, children deemed to be at \"prolonged\" risk of St ate custody may remain in Group 1.B or an on- going basis . 2.4.4.2 Auto Assignment 2.4.4.2.1 TENNCARE will auto assign an enrollee to an MCO, in specified circumstances, including but not limited to, the enrollee does not request enrollment in a specified MCO, cannot be en rolled in the requested MCO, or is an adult eligible as a result of receiving SSI benefits. 2.4.4.2.2 The current auto assignment process does not apply to children eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI or children in State custody. 2.4.4.2.3 There ar e four different levels to the current auto assignment process: 2.4.4.2.3.1 If the enrollee was previously enrolled with an MCO and lost TennCare eligibility for a period of two (2) months or less, the enrollee will be re -enrolled with that MCO. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 27 2.4.4.2.3.2 If the enrollee has family members in an MCO (other than TennCare Select), the enrollee will be enrolled in that MCO. 2.4.4.2.3.3 If the enrollee is a newborn, the enrollee will be assigned to his/her mother's MCO. 2.4.4.2.3.4 If none of the above applies, the enrollee will be assigned using def ault logic that randomly assigns enrollees to MCOs (other than TennCare Select). 2.4.4.2.4 TENNCARE may modify the auto assignment algorithm to change or add criteria including but not limited to quality measures or cost or utilization management performance . 2.4.4.3 Immediate Eligibility for Children in State Custody Until a final determination can be made on their TennCare eligibility, the CONTRACTOR shall accept notification from DCS that a child has entered State custody and adhere to the following requirements to i nsure that eligibility is provided. Upon receipt of notification from DCS, the CONTRACTOR shall determine whether or not the child is otherwise enrolled in TennCare. If the child is not currently enrolled, the CONTRACTOR shall immediately build a forty- five (45) day TennCare eligibility record effective on the date the child was placed in State custody and identify the child as a child in State custody , or group 1.A enrollee. 2.4.4.3.1 The CONTRACTOR shall generate a letter that will explain that the child has been given forty- five (45) days of coverage from their custody date, pending a final eligibility determination. 2.4.4.3.2 The CONTRACTOR is not required to assign a child for whom Immediate Eligibility has been established to a BPN PCP until TennCare eligibility is confirmed. 2.4.4.3.3 The CONTRACTOR shall fax the BPN enrollment form and a letter of notification to the DCS Case Manager. 2.4.4.3.4 The CONTRACTOR's BPN staff shall work with DCS to obtain a TENNderCare visit with a BPN provider within twenty -one (21) days of request but no later than thirty (30) days of enrollment. 2.4.4.3.5 After twenty -five (25) days of I mmediate Eligibility coverage, the CONTRACTOR shall identify children whose Immediate Eligibility will end in twenty (20) days to the DCS Program Coordinator of Health Advocacy. 2.4.4.3.6 The child shall be eligible for the TennCare Medicaid benefit package effective on the date the child was placed in custody through the 45 th day of the Immediate Eligibility period or the date of receipt of a TennCare eligibility record, whichever occurs e arlier. If the CONTRACTOR receives a TennCare eligibility record prior to the end of the forty- five (45) day eligibility period, the child shall be eligible for benefits in accordance with their TennCare eligibility status effective on the date of receipt of the eligibility record . Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 28 2.4.4.4 Non- Discrimination 2.4.4.4.1 The CONTRACTOR shall accept enrollees in the order in which applications are approved and enrollees are assigned to the CONTRACTOR (whether by selection or assignment). 2.4.4.4.2 The CONTRACTOR shall accept an enrolle e in the health condition the enrollee is in at the time of enrollment and shall not discriminate against individuals on the basis of health status or need for health care services. 2.4.4.5 Family Unit If an individual is determined eligible for TennCare and ha s another family member already enrolled in an MCO, that individual shall be enrolled in the same MCO. This does not apply when the individual or family member is assigned to TennCare Select. If the newly enrolled family member opts to change MCOs during t he 45 -day change period (see Section 2.4.7.2.1), all family members in the case will be transferred to the new MCO. 2.4.5 Effective Date of Enrollment 2.4.5.1 Initial Enrollment of Current TennCare Enrollees The effective date of initial enrollment in an MCO for curr ent TennCare enrollees shall be the date provided on the enrollment file from TENNCARE. 2.4.5.2 Ongoing Enrollment In general, a member's effective date of enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO will be the member's effective date of eligibility for TennCare. For S SI enrollees the effective date of eligibility/enrollment is determined by the Social Security Administration in approving SSI coverage for the individual. The effective date of eligibility for other TennCare enrollees is the date of application or the dat e of the qualifying event (e.g., the date the spend down obligation is met for medically needy enrollees). The effective date on the enrollment file provided by TENNCARE to the CONTRACTOR shall govern regardless of the other provisions of this Section 2.4.5.2. 2.4.5.3 In the event the effective date of eligibility provided by TENNCARE or DCS to the CONTRACTOR for either the initial enrollment of current TennCare enrollees or ongoing enrollment precedes the start date of operations, the CONTRACTOR shall treat the e nrollee as a member of the CONTRACTOR's MCO effective on the start date of operations. 2.4.5.4 TENNCARE will be responsible for the direct payment of claims for long- term care services provided to a CHOICES member during the member's period of TennCare eligibili ty prior to the implementation of CHOICES in each Grand Region. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 29 2.4.5.5 Enrollment Prior to Notification 2.4.5.5.1 Because individuals can be retroactively eligible for TennCare, and the effective date of initial enrollment in an MCO is the effective date of eligibility or start date of operations, whichever is sooner, the effective date of enrollment may occur prior to the CONTRACTOR being notified of the person's enrollment. Therefore, enrollment of individuals in the CONTRACTOR's MCO may occur without prior notice to t he CONTRACTOR or enrollee. 2.4.5.5.2 The CONTRACTOR shall not be liable for the cost of any covered services prior to the effective date of enrollment/eligibility but shall be responsible for the costs of covered services obtained on or after 12:01 a.m. on the eff ective date of enrollment/eligibility. 2.4.5.5.3 TENNCARE shall make payments to the CONTRACTOR from the effective date of an enrollee's date of enrollment/eligibility. TENNCARE will be responsible for the direct payment of claims for long- term care services provid ed to a CHOICES member during the member's period of TennCare eligibility prior to the implementation of CHOICES in each Grand Region. 2.4.5.5.4 Except for applicable TennCare cost sharing and patient liability, the CONTRACTOR shall ensure that members are held har mless for the cost of covered services provided as of the effective date of enrollment with the CONTRACTOR. 2.4.6 Eligibility and Enrollment Data 2.4.6.1 The CONTRACTOR shall receive, process, and update enrollment files from TENNCARE , The CONTRACTOR shall also receiv e, process, and update enrollment files from DCS for children in State custody who are to be given Immediate Eligibility for a forty- five (45) day period .

Until such time as an indicator for children in State custody and children transitioning out of State custody can be added to the daily eligibility updates received from TennCare, the CONTRACTOR agrees to accept and process any adhoc report mutually agreed upon by the CONTRACTOR and TennCare to facilitate timely identification of children in State custody or children transitioning out of State custody . 2.4.6.3 The CONTRACTOR shall provide an electronic eligibility file to TENNCARE as specified and in conformance to data exchange format and method standards outlined in Section 2.23.5. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 30 2.4.7 Enrollment Period 2.4.7.1 General 2.4.7.1.1 The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the provision and costs of all covered physical health and behavioral health services provided to enr ollees during their period of enrollment with the CONTRACTOR. The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the provision and costs of covered long- term care services provided to CHOICES members as of the date of CHOICES implementation in each Grand Region.

Enrollees in Group 6 shall only be able to request to change MCO plans during this period to the extent capacity is availab le in another MCO serving the region. 2.4.7.2.2 Annual Choice Period 2.4.7.2.2.1 TENNCARE shall provide an opportunity for members to change MCOs (excluding TennCare Select) every twelve (12) months. Children eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI may re quest to enroll in another MCO or remain with TennCare Select. 2.4.7.2.2.2 Members who do not select another MCO will be deemed to have chosen to remain with their current MCO. 2.4.7.2.2.3 Enrollees who select a new MCO shall have one (1) opportunity anytime during the forty- five (45) day period immediately following the specified enrollment effective date in the newly selected MCO to request to change MCOs.

Newborns that are SSI eligible at birth shall be assigned to TennCare Select but may opt out and enroll in another MCO. 2.4.9.2 A newborn may be inadvertently enrolled in an MCO different than its mother. When such cases are i dentified by the CONTRACTOR, the CONTRACTOR shall immediately report to TENNCARE, in accordance with written procedures provided by TENNCARE, that a newborn has been incorrectly enrolled in an MCO different than its mother.

The CONTRACTOR shall be required to process claims received for services provided to newborns within the time frames specified in Section 2.22.4 of this Agreement. A CONTRACTOR shall not utilize any blanket policy which results in the automatic denial of claims for services provided to a TennCare -eligible newborn, during any period of enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO, because the newborn's mother is not a member of the CONTRACTOR's MCO. However, it is recognized that in complying with the claims processing time frames specified in 2.22.4 of this Agreement, a CONTRACTOR may make payment for services provided to a TennCare -eligible newborn enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO at the time of payment but the newborn's eligibility may subsequently be moved to another MCO. In such event, the MCO in which the newborn is first enrolled (first MCO) may submit supporting documentation to the MCO in which the newborn is moved (second MCO) and the second MCO shall reimburse the first MCO within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of such properly documented request for reimbursement, for the amount expended on behalf of the newborn prior to the newborn's eligibility having been moved to the second MCO. Such reimbursement shall be the actual amount expe nded by the first MCO. The second MCO agrees that should the second MCO fail to reimburse the first MCO the actual amount expended on behalf of the newborn within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a properly documented request for payment, TENNCARE i s authorized to deduct the amount owed from any funds due the second MCO and to reimburse the first MCO. In the event that the CONTRACTOR fails to reimburse the first MCO the actual amount expended on behalf of the newborn within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a properly documented request for payment, TENNCARE may assess liquidated damages as specified in Section 5 .20.2. Should it become necessary for TENNCARE to intervene in such cases, both the second MCO and the first MCO agree that TENNCARE shall be held harmless by both MCOs for actions taken by TENNCARE to resolve the dispute.

Unless and until directed by TENNCARE to serve as a back -up health plan and/or enroll members in CHOICES Group 2 and/or 3 , only members in CHOICES Group 1 will be enrolled with the CONTRACTOR. Therefore, unless and until directed by TEN NCARE to serve as a back -up health plan and /or enroll members in CHOICES Group 2 and/or 3, the requirements in Section 2.6.1.5 applicable only to CHOICES Group 2 and/or 3 will not apply.

Enrollees transitioning from a nursing facility to the community will not be subject to the enrollment target for CHOICES Group 2 but must meet cate gorical and financial eligibility for CHOICES Group 2. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 43 2.6.1.5.3 For persons enrolled in CHOICES Group 2 as a result of Immediate Eligibility for CHOICES Group 2 (as defined in Section 1 of this Agreement), the CONTRACTOR shall provide a limited package of HCBS (personal care, attendant care, homemaker services, home- delivered meals, PERS, adult day care, and/or any other services as specified in TennCare rules and regulations) as identified through a needs assessment and specified in the plan of care.

Acceptable reasons for this request i nclude but are not limited to the following : 2.6.1.5.8.1 A member in CHOICES Group 2 for whom the CONTRACTOR has determined that it cannot safely and effectively meet the member's needs at a cost that is less than the member' cost neutrality cap, and the member declines to transition to a nursing facility ; 2.6.1.5.8.2 A member in CHOICES Group 2 or 3 who repeatedly refuses to allow a care coordinator entrance into his/her place of residence ( see Section 2.9.6); 2.6.1.5.8.3 A member in CHOICES Group 2 or 3 who refuses to receive critical HCBS as identified through a needs assessment and documented in the member's plan of care; and 2.6.1.5.8.4 A member in CHOICES Group 1 who fails to pay his/her patient liability and the CONTRACTOR is unable to find a nursing facility willing to provide services to the member ( see Section 2.6.7.2). 2.6.1.5.8.5 The CONTRACTOR's request to no longer provide long- term care services to a member shall include documentation as specified by TENNCARE. The Sta te shall make any and all determinations regarding whether the CONTRACTOR may discontinue providing long- term care services to a member, disenrollment from CHOICES, and, as applicable, termination from TennCare. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 45 2.6.2 TennCare Benefits Provided by TENNCARE TennCare shall be responsible for the payment of the following benefits: 2.6.2.1 Dental Services Except as provided in Section 2.6.1.3 of this Agreement, dental services shall not be provided by the CONTRACTOR but shall be provided by a dental benefits manager (DBM) under contract with TENNCARE.

The determination of medical necessity shall be made on a case by case basis and in accordance with the definition of medical necessity defined in TC A 71 - 5-144 and TennCare rules and regulations. However, this requirement shall not limit the CONTRACTOR's ability to use medically appropriate cost effective alternative services in accordance with Section 2.6.5. 2.6.3.2 The CONTRACTOR shall not employ, and shal l not permit others acting on their behalf to employ, utilization control guidelines or other quantitative coverage limits, whether explicit or de facto, unless supported by an individualized determination of medical necessity based upon the needs of each TennCare enrollee and his/her medical history. The CONTRACTOR shall have the ability to place tentative limits on a service; however, such tentative limits placed by the CONTRACTOR shall be exceeded (up to the applicable benefit limits on behavioral health and long- term care services provided in Section 2.6.1.4 and 2.6.1.5 above) when medically necessary based on a member's individual characteristics. 2.6.3.3 The CONTRACTOR shall not arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, duration, or scope of a required service solely because of the diagnosis, type of illness, or condition.

The second opinion shall be provided by a contracted qualified health c are professional or the CONTRACTOR shall arrange for a member to obtain one from a non- contract provider. The second opinion shall be provided at no cost to the member. 2.6.5 Use of Cost Effective Alternative Services 2.6.5.1 The CONTRACTOR shall be allowed to use co st effective alternative services, whether listed as covered or non- covered or omitted in Section 2.6.1 of this Agreement, when the use of such alternative services is medically appropriate and is cost effective. This may include, for example, use of nursi ng facilities as step down alternatives to acute care hospitalization or hotel accommodations for persons on outpatient radiation therapy to avoid the rigors of daily transportation. The CONTRACTOR shall comply with TennCare policies and procedures. As provided in the applicable TennCare policies and procedures, services not listed in the TennCare policies and procedures must be prior approved in writing by TENNCARE. The Medical Fund Target described elsewhere in this Agreement shall not be increased or dec reased because of the use of alternative services. The CONTRACTOR shall maintain documentation that demonstrates the cost effectiveness of any non- covered services that are provided to TennCare enrollees and for which the CONTRACTOR seeks reimbursement fro m the S tate. A report summarizing all such documentation for the preceding year shall be submitted by the CONTRACTOR in accordance with Section 2.30.22.3. 2.6.5.2 For members in CHOICES Groups 2 and 3, the CONTRACTOR may choose to provide the following as a cost effective alternative to other covered services: 2.6.5.2.1 HCBS to CHOICES members who would otherwise receive nursing facility care. If a member meets categorical and financial eligibility requirements for enrollment in CHOICES Group 2 and also meets the nursing f acility level of care, as determined by TENNCARE, and would otherwise remain in or be admitted to a nursing facility (as determined by the CONTRACTOR and demonstrated to the satisfaction of TENNCARE), the CONTRACTOR may, at its discretion and upon TENNCARE written prior approval, offer that member HCBS as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility care (see Section 2.9.6.3.13 ). In this instance, TENNCARE will enroll the member receiving HCBS as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility services in CHOICES Group 2, notwithstanding any enrollment target for CHOICES Group 2 that has been reached. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 47 2.6.5.2.2 HCBS to members in CHOICES Group 2 in excess of the benefit limits described in Section 2.6.1. 5.4 as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility c are or covered home health services. 2.6.5.2.3 HCBS to members in CHOICES Group 3 in excess of the benefit limits described in Section 2.6.1. 5.4 as a cost effective alternative to covered home health services. Members in CHOICES Group 3 do not meet nursing fac ility level of care and as such, HCBS in excess of benefit limits specified in Section 2.6.1. 5.4 may not be offered as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility care. 2.6.5.2.4 Non- covered HCBS services to members in CHOICES Group 2 not otherwise specified i n this Agreement or in applicable TennCare policies and procedures, upon written prior approval from TENNCARE. 2.6.5.2.5 For members in CHOICES Group 2 transitioning from a nursing facility to a community setting, a one -time transition allowance, per member.

The total cost of HCBS includes all HCBS (whether otherwise covered or not covered) and other services that are offered as a cost effective alternative to nursing facility care, HCBS, or home health, including, as applicable, the one -time transition allowance for CHOICES Group 2 and NEM T for CHOICES Groups 2 and 3. 2.6.6 Additional Services and Use of Incentives 2.6.6.1 The CONTRACTOR shall not advertise any services that are not required by this Agreement other than those covered pursuant to Section 2.6.1 of this Agreement. 2.6.6.2 The CONTRACTOR shall n ot offer or provide any services other than services covered by this Agreement (see Section 2.6.1) or services provided as a cost effective alternative (see Section 2.6.5) of this Agreement. However, the CONTRACTOR may provide incentives that have been spe cifically prior approved in writing by TENNCARE. For example, TENNCARE may approve the use of incentives given to enrollees to encourage participation in disease management programs. 2.6.7 Cost Sharing and Patient Liability 2.6.7.1 General The CONTRACTOR and all pr oviders and subcontractors shall not require any cost sharing or patient liability responsibilities for covered services except to the extent Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 48 that cost sharing or patient liability responsibilities are required for those services by TENNCARE in accordance with TennCare rules and regulations, including but not limited to, holding enrollees liable for debt due to insolvency of the CONTRACTOR or non- payment by the State to the CONTRACTOR. Further, the CONTRACTOR and all providers and subcontractors shall not c harge enrollees for missed appointments. 2.6.7.2 Patient Liability 2.6.7.2.1 TENNCARE will notify the CONTRACTOR of any applicable patient liability amounts for members in CHOICES Group 1 via the eligibility/enrollment file.

If it can, the member shall be offered a choice of HCBS. If the member chooses HCBS, the CONTRACTOR shall forward all relevant inform ation to TENNCARE for a decision regarding enrollment in CHOICES Group 2 (see Section 2.9.6.3). 2.6.7.2.5 If the CONTRACTOR is unable to find an alternate nursing facility willing to serve the member and the CONTRACTOR determines that it cannot safely and effecti vely serve the member in the community and within the cost neutrality cap, the member declines to enroll in CHOICES Group 2, or TENNCARE denies enrollment in CHOICES Group 2, the CONTRACTOR may, pursuant to Section 2.6.1. 5.8, request to no longer provide l ong-term care services to the member. 2.6.7.3 Preventive Services TennCare cost sharing or patient liability responsibilities shall apply to covered services other than the preventive services described in TennCare rules and regulations. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 49 2.6.7.4 Cost Sharing Schedule The current TennCare cost sharing schedule is included in this Agreement as Attachment II. The CONTRACTOR shall not waive or use any alternative cost sharing schedules, unless required by TENNCARE. 2.6.7.5 Provider Requirements 2.6.7.5.1 Providers or collection agencie s acting on the provider's behalf may not bill enrollees for amounts other than applicable TennCare cost sharing or patient liability amounts for covered services, including but not limited to, services that the State or the CONTRACTOR has not paid for, except as permitted by TennCare rules and regulations and as described below. Providers may seek payment from an enrollee only in the following situations. 2.6.7.5.1.1 If the services are not covered services and, prior to providing the services, the provider informed the enrollee that the services were not covered. The provider shall inform the enrollee of the non- covered service and have the enrollee acknowledge the information. If the enrollee still requests the service, the provider shall obtain such acknowledgment in writing prior to rendering the service. Regardless of any understanding worked out between the provider and the enrollee about private payment, once the provider bills an MCO for the service that has been provided, the prior arrangement with the enrolle e becomes null and void without regard to any prior arrangement worked out with the enrollee. 2.6.7.5.1.2 If the enrollee's TennCare eligibility is pending at the time services are provided and if the provider informs the person they will not accept TennCare assignme nt whether or not eligibility is established retroactively. Regardless of any understanding worked out between the provider and the enrollee about private payment, once the provider bills an MCO for the service the prior arrangement with the enrollee becom es null and void without regard to any prior arrangement worked out with the enrollee. 2.6.7.5.1.3 If the enrollee's TennCare eligibility is pending at the time services are provided, however, all monies collected, except applicable TennCare cost sharing or patient liability amounts shall be refunded when a claim is submitted to an MCO because the provider agreed to accept TennCare assignment once retroactive TennCare eligibility was established. (The monies collected shall be refunded as soon as a claim is submitted and shall not be held conditionally upon payment of the claim.) 2.6.7.5.1.4 If the services are not covered because they are in excess of an enrollee's benefit limit, and the provider complies with applicable TennCare rules and regulations. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 50 2.6.7.5.2 The CONTRACTOR shall requ ire, as a condition of payment, that the provider accept the amount paid by the CONTRACTOR or appropriate denial made by the CONTRACTOR (or, if applicable, payment by the CONTRACTOR that is supplementary to the enrollee's third party payer) plus any applic able amount of TennCare cost sharing or patient liability responsibilities due from the enrollee as payment in full for the service. Except in the circumstances described above, if the CONTRACTOR is aware that a provider, or a collection agency acting on t he provider's behalf, bills an enrollee for amounts other than the applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing or patient liability responsibilities due from the enrollee, the CONTRACTOR shall notify the provider and demand that the provider and/or collecti on agency cease such action against the enrollee immediately. If a provider continues to bill an enrollee after notification by the CONTRACTOR, the CONTRACTOR shall refer the provider to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. 9. Section 2.6.8 shall be delet ed in its entirety and replaced with the following: 2.6.8 Immediate Eligibility for Children in DCS Custody Effective January 1, 2002, when a child enters DCS custody, DCS will provide the CONTRACTOR with the child's information. In order to give children in D CS adequate access to covered services, including TENNderCare , until a final determination can be made on their TennCare eligibility, the CONTRACTOR shall accept notification from DCS and adhere to the following requirements to insure that eligibility is provided. Upon receipt of notification from DCS, the CONTRACTOR shall determine whether or not the child is otherwise enrolled in TennCare. If the child is not currently enrolled, the CONTRACTOR shall immediately build a forty -five (45) day TennCare eligibi lity record effective on the date the child was placed in State custody and identify the child as a child in State custody , or group 1.A enrollee. The CONTRACTOR shall generate a letter that will explain that the child has been given forty- five (45) days of coverage from their custody date, pending a final eligibility determination. The CONTRACTOR is not required to assign a child for whom Immediate Eligibility has been established to a BPN PCP until TennCare eligibility is confirmed. The CONTRACTOR shall f ax the BPN enrollment form and a letter of notification to the DCS Case Manager. The CONTRACTOR's BPN staff shall work with DCS to obtain a TENNderCare visit with a BPN provider within twenty- one (21) days of request but no later than thirty (30) days of e nrollment. After twenty -five (25) days of I mmediate Eligibility coverage, the CONTRACTOR shall identify children whose Immediate Eligibility will end in twenty (20) days to the DCS Program Coordinator of Health Advocacy. The child shall be eligible for the TennCare Medicaid benefit package effective on the date the child was placed in custody through the 45 th day of the Immediate Eligibility period or the date of receipt of a TennCare eligibility record, whichever occurs earlier. If the CONTRACTOR receives a TennCare eligibility record prior to the end of the forty- five (45) day eligibility period, the child shall be eligible for benefits in accordance with their TennCare eligibility status effective on the date of receipt of the eligibility record. In regards to TENNderCare reporting, the CONTRACTOR will continue to only report on those children whose TennCare eligibility has appeared on the DCS Tape received from TENNCARE and who are assigned to MCO 11. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 51 10. Section 2.7 shall be amended by delet ing Section 2 .7 in its entirety and replac ing it with the following and renumbering all references thereto : 2.7 SPECIALIZED SERVICES 2.7.1 Emergency Services 2.7.1.1 Emergency services (as defined in Section 1 of this Agreement) shall be available twenty -four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. 2.7.1.2 The CONTRACTOR shall review and approve or disapprove claims for emergency services based on the definition of emergency medical condition specified in Section 1 of this Agreement. The CONTRACTOR shall base coverage decisions for emergency services on the severity of the symptoms at the time of presentation and shall cover emergency services where the presenting symptoms are of sufficient severity to constitute an emergency medical condition in the judgment of a prudent layperson. The CO NTRACTOR shall not impose restrictions on coverage of emergency services more restrictive than those permitted by the prudent layperson standard. 2.7.1.3 The CONTRACTOR shall provide coverage for inpatient and outpatient emergency services, furnished by a qualifi ed provider, regardless of whether the member obtains the services from a contract provider, that are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition that is found to exist using the prudent layperson standard. These services shall be provid ed without prior authorization in accordance with 42 CFR 438.114. The CONTRACTOR shall pay for any emergency screening examination services conducted to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists and for all emergency services that are medical ly necessary until the member is stabilized. 2.7.1.4 If an emergency screening examination leads to a clinical determination by the examining provider that an actual emergency medical condition exists, the CONTRACTOR shall pay for both the services involved in t he screening examination and the services required to stabilize the member. The CONTRACTOR shall be required to pay for all emergency services which are medically necessary until the clinical emergency is stabilized. This includes all medical and behaviora l health services that may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the member's condition is likely to result from, or occur during, discharge of the member or transfer of the member to another facility. If there is a disagreement between the treating facility and the CONTRACTOR concerning whether the member is stable enough for discharge or transfer, or whether the medical benefits of an un- stabilized transfer outweigh the risks, the judgment of the attending provider(s) actually caring for the member at the treating facility prevails and is binding on the CONTRACTOR. The CONTRACTOR, however, may establish arrangements with a treating facility whereby the CONTRACTOR may send one of its own providers w ith appropriate emergency room privileges to assume the attending provider's responsibilities to stabilize, treat, and transfer the member, provided that such arrangement does not delay the provision of emergency services.

TENNCARE shall notify the CONTRACTOR in writing if the Care Coordination Staffing Plan is insufficient a nd may require modifications to ensure, prior to implementation of CHOICES in each Grand Region, that the CONTRACTOR has sufficient care coordination staff. After CHOICES has been implemented, the CONTRACTOR shall notify TENNCARE in writing of substantive changes to its Care Coordination Staffing Plan, including a variance of twenty (20) percent or more from the planned staffing ratio. TENNCARE may request changes in the CONTRACTOR's Care Coordination Staffing Plan at any time it determines that the CONTRAC TOR does not have sufficient care coordination staff to properly and timely perform its obligations under this Agreement. 2.9.6.11.6 The CONTRACTOR shall establish a system to assign care coordinators and to notify the member of his/her assigned care coordinator's name and contact information in accordance with Section 2.9.6.4.3. 2.9.6.11.7 The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that members have a telephone number to call to directly contact (without having to disconnect or place a second call) their care coordinator or a member of the ir care coordination team (if applicable) during normal business hours. If the member's care coordinator or a member of the member's care coordination team is not available, the call shall be answered by another qualified staff person in the care coordinat ion unit. If the call requires immediate attention from a care coordinator, the staff member answering the call shall immediately transfer the call to the member's care coordinator (or another care coordinator if the member's care coordinator is not available) as a \"warm transfer\" (see definition in Section 1). After normal business hours, calls that require immediate attention by a Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 128 care coordinator shall be transferred to a care coordinator as specified in Section 2.18.1.6. 2.9.6.11.8 The CONTRACTOR shall permit me mbers to change to a different care coordinator if the member desires and there is an alternative care coordinator available.

If directed by TENN CARE to serve as a back -up health plan and /or enroll members in CHOICES Group 2 and/ or 3, t he CONTRACTOR shall offer consumer direction of HCBS to all CHOICES Group 2 and 3 members who are determined by a care coordinator, through the needs assessment/reas sessment process, to need attendant care, personal care, homemaker, in -home respite, companion care services and/or any Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 134 other service specified in TennCare rules and regulations as available for consumer direction. (Companion care is only available for per sons electing consumer direction of HCBS.) A service that is not specified in TennCare rules and regulations as available for consumer direction shall not be consumer directed. Consumer direction in CHOICES affords members the opportunity to have choice and control over how eligible HCBS are provided, who provides the services and how much workers are paid for providing care, up to a specified maximum amount established by TENNCARE (see Section 2.9.7.6.11). Member participation in consumer direction of HCBS is voluntary. Members may elect to participate in or withdraw from consumer direction of HCBS at any time, service by service, without affecting their enrollment in CHOICES. To the extent possible, the member shall provide his/her care coordinator ten (10 ) days advance notice regarding his/her intent to no longer direct one or more eligible HCBS or to withdraw from participation in consumer direction of HCBS entirely.

TENNCARE may establish reasonable limitations on the frequency with which members may opt into and out of consumer direction of HCBS . 2.9.7.1.2 Consum er direction is a process by which eligible HCBS are delivered; it is not a service. If a member chooses not to direct his/her care, he/she shall receive authorized HCBS through contract providers.

Accordingly and notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the C ONTRACTOR agrees that if it is later determined that the true nature of the working relationship between the CONTRACTOR and the State under this Agreement is that of \"employee/employer\" and not that of an independent contractor, the CONTRACTOR may be requi red to repay to TCRS the amount of retirement benefits the CONTRACTOR received from TCRS during the period of this Agreement.

It consists of activities performed by a team or a single mental health case manager to support cli nical services. Mental health case managers assist in ensuring the individual/family access to services. Mental health case management requires that the mental health case manager and the individual and/or family have a strong productive relationship whi ch includes viewing the individual/family as a responsible partner in identifying and obtaining the necessary services and resources. Services rendered to children and youth shall be consumer -centered and family -focused with case managers working with multiple systems (e.g. education, child welfare, juvenile justice). Mental health case management is provided in community settings, which are accessible and comfortable to the individual/family.

The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that the following requirements are met: 1) All mental health case managers shall have, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree; 2) Supervisors shall maintain no greater than a 1:30 supervisory ratio with mental health case managers; 3) Mental health case managers who are assigned to both a parent(s) and child in the same family, should have skills and experience needed for both ages; mental health case managers who are assigned to individuals with co -occurring disorders (mental illness and substance abuse disorders) should have the skills and experience to meet the needs of these individuals; 4) Eighty percent (80%) of all mental health case management services should take place outside the case manager's office; 5) The children and youth (C&Y) (under age eighteen (18)) mental health case management model shall provide a transition from C&Y services into adult services, including adult mental health case management services. The decision to serve an 18 -year old youth via the C&Y case management system versus the adult system shall be a clinical one made by a provider.

Mental health case management activities are correlated to expected outcomes and outcome achievement and shall be monitored, with progress being noted periodically in a w ritten record. Level 1 Level 1 mental health case management is the most intense level of service. It provides frequent and comprehensive support to individuals with a focus on recovery and resilience. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure the provision of level 1 mental health case management to the most severely disabled adults and emotionally disturbed children and youth, including individuals who are at high risk of future hospitalization or placement out of the home and require both community support and treat ment interventions. Level 1 mental health case management can be rendered through a team approach or by Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 344 individual mental health case managers. Team approaches may include such models as ACT, CTT, CCFT and PACT, as described below: Assertive Community Tr eatment (ACT) ACT is a way of delivering comprehensive and effective services to adults diagnosed with severe mental illness and who have needs that have not been well met by traditional approaches to delivering services. The principles of ACT include: 1) Services targeted to a specific group of individuals with severe mental illness; 2) Treatment, support and rehabilitation services provided directly by the ACT team; 3) Sharing of responsibility between team members and individuals served by the team; 4) Small staff (all team staff including case managers) to individual ratios (approx. 1 to 10); 5) Comprehensive and flexible range of treatment and services; 6) Interventions occurring in community settings rather than in hospitals or clinic settings; 7) No arbitrary time limit on receiving services; 8) Individualized treatment, support and rehabilitation services; 9) Twenty -four (24) hour a day availability of services; and 10) Engagement of individuals in treatment and monitoring. Continuous Tre atment Team (CTT) CTT is a coordinated team of staff (to include physicians, nurses, case managers, and other therapists as needed) who provide a range of intensive, integrated mental health case management, treatment, and rehabilitation services to adult s and children and youth. The intent is to provide intensive treatment to families of children and youth with acute psychiatric problems in an effort to prevent removal from the home to a more restrictive level of care. An array of services are delivered i n the home or in natural settings in the community, and are provided through a strong partnership with the family and other community support systems. The program provides services including crisis intervention and stabilization, counseling, skills buildin g, therapeutic intervention, advocacy, educational services, medication management as indicated, school based counseling and consultation with teachers, and other specialized services deemed necessary and appropriate. Comprehensive Child and Family Treatm ent (CCFT) CCFT services are high intensity, time -limited services designed for children and youth to provide stabilization and deter the \"imminent\" risk of State custody for the individual. There is usually family instability and high -risk behaviors exhibited by the child/adolescent. CCFT services are concentrated on child, family, and parental/guardian behaviors and interaction. CCFT services are more treatment oriented and situation specific with a focus on short -term stabilization goals. The primary goal of CCFT is to reach an appropriate point of stabilization so the individual can be transitioned to a less intense outpatient service. Program of Assertive and Community Treatment (PACT) PACT is a service delivery model for providing comprehensive community -based treatment to adults with severe and persistent mental illness. It involves the use of a multi -disciplinary team of mental health staff organized as an accountable, mobile mental health agency or group of providers who function as a team interchangeably to provide the treatment, rehabilitation and support services persons with severe and/or persistent mental illnesses need to live successfully in the community. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 345 Level 2 Level 2 mental health case management is a less intensive level of service than Level 1 and is focused on resilience and recovery. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that level 2 mental health case management is provided to individuals whose symptoms are at least partially stabilized or reduced in order to allow treatment and rehabili tation efforts. SERVICE COMPONENTS The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that mental health case management incorporates the following service components: Crisis Facilitation Crisis facilitation is provided in situations requiring immediate attention/resolution for a specific individual or other person(s) in relation to a specific individual. It is the process of accessing and coordinating services for an individual in a crisis situation to ensure the necessary services are rendered during and following the cris is episode. Most crisis facilitation activities would involve face -to-face contact with the individual. Assessment of Daily Functioning Assessment of daily functioning involves the on- going monitoring of how an individual is coping with life on a day to day basis for the purposes of determining necessary services to maintain community placement and improve level of functioning. Most assessments of daily functioning are achieved by face - to-face contact with the individual in his or her natural environment . Assessment/Referral/Coordination Assessment/referral/coordination involves assessing the needs of the individual for the purposes of referral and coordination of services that will improve functioning and/or maintain stability in the individual's natur al environment. Mental Health Liaison Mental health liaison services are offered to persons who are not yet assigned to mental health case management. It is a short -term service for the purposes of service referral and continuing care until other mental health services are initiated. Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 346 SERVICE Psychiatric R ehabilitation DEFINITION Psychiatric rehabilitation is an array of consumer -centered recovery services designed to support the individual in the attainment or maintenance of his or her optimal level of functioning. These services are designed to capitalize on personal strengths, develop coping skills and strategies to deal with deficits and develop a supportive environment in which to function as independent as possible on the individual's recovery journey. Services included under psychiatric rehabilitation are as follows. SERVICE COMPONENTS Psychosocial Rehabilitation Psychosocial rehabili tation services utilize a comprehensive approach (mind, body, and spirit) to work with the whole person for the purposes of improving an individuals' functioning, promoting management of illness(s), and facilitating recovery. The goal of psychosocial rehabilitation is to support individuals as active and productive members of their communities. Individuals, in partnership with staff, form goals for skills development in the areas of vocational, educational, and interpersonal growth (e.g. household managemen t, development of social support networks) that serve to maximize opportunities for successful community integration. Individuals proceed toward goal attainment at their own pace and may continue in the program at varying levels intensity for an indefinite period of time. Supported Employment Supported employment consists of a range of services to assist individuals to choose, prepare for, obtain, and maintain gainful employment that is based on individuals' preferences, strengths, and experiences. This service also includes a variety of support services to the individual, including side -by-side support on the job. These services may be integrated into a psychosocial rehabilitation center. Peer Support Peer support services allow individuals to direct th eir own recovery and advocacy process and are provided by persons who are or have been consumers of the behavioral health system and their family members and are Certified Peer Support Specialists. These services include providing assistance with more effe ctively utilizing the service delivery system (e.g. assistance in developing plans of care, accessing services and supports, partnering with professionals) or understanding and coping with the stressors of the person's illness through support groups, coaching, role modeling, and mentoring. Activities which promote socialization, recovery, self -advocacy, development of natural supports, and maintenance of community living skills are rendered so individuals can educate and support each other in the acquisitio n of skills needed to manage their illnesses and access resources within their communities. Services are often provided during the evening and weekend hours. Illness Management & Recovery Illness management and recovery services refers to a series of weekly sessions with trained mental health practitioners for the purpose of assisting individuals in developing personal strategies for coping with mental illness and promoting recovery. Supported Housing Supported housing services refers to services rende red at facilities that are staffed twenty -four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days a week with associated mental health staff supports for individuals who require Amendment Number 22 (cont.) 347 treatment services and supports in a highly structured setting. These mental health services a re for persons with serious and/or persistent mental illnesses (SPMI) and are intended to prepare individuals for more independent living in the community while providing an environment that allows individuals to live in community settings. Given this goal , every effort should be made to place individuals in facilities near their families and other support systems and original areas of residence. Supported housing services are mental health services and do not include the payment of room and board. 48.

A.1.2 The CONTRACTOR shall develop written policies and procedures that describe how the CONTRACTOR, in the delivery of NEMT services, shall comply with the requirements of the Agreement, including this Attachment. These policies and procedures must be prior approved in writing by TENNCARE. As part of its policies and procedures the CONTRACTOR shall develop an operating procedures manual detailing procedures for meeting, at a minimum, requirements regarding the following: A.1.2.1 Requesting NEMT services (see Section A. 3 of this Attachment); A.1.2.2 Approving NEMT services (see Section A.4 of this Attachment); and A.1.2.3 Scheduling, assigning and dispatching trips (see Section A.5 of this Attachment). A.2 NEMT IMPLEMENTATION WORK PLAN AND READINESS REVIEW A.2.1 The CONTRACTOR shall implement th e NEMT requirements of the Agreement, including this Attachment XI, in two phases. Phase One shall include the requirements specified by TENNCARE, which shall include but not be limited to vehicle and driver standards in Section A.7 and Section A.8 of this Attachment XI. Phase Two shall include all NEMT requirements of the Agreement that are not included in Phase One. A.2.2 By no later than May 1, 2008 the CONTRACTOR shall submit to TENNCARE for prior written approval an implementation work plan that details a ll of the tasks required to successfully implement all of the NEMT requirements of the Agreement, including both Phase One and Phase Two requirements.

At the option of the State, children deemed to be at \"prolonged\" risk of state custody may remain in Group 1.B or an on-going basis. 2.4.4.2 Auto Assignment 2.4.4.2.1 TENNCARE will auto assign an enrollee to an MCO, in specified circumstances, including but not limited to, the enrollee does not request enrollment in a specified MCO, cannot be enrolled in the requested MCO, or is an adult eligible as a result of receiving SSI benefits. 2.4.4.2.2 The current auto assignment process does not apply to children eligible for TennCare as a result of being eligible for SSI or children in the state's custody. 2.4.4.2.3 There are four different levels to the current auto assignment process: 2.4.4.2.3.1 If the enrollee was previously enrolled with an MCO and lost TennCare eligibility for a period of two (2) months or less, the enro llee will be re-enrolled with that MCO. 2.4.4.2.3.2 If the enrollee has family members in an MCO (other than TennCare Select), the enrollee will be enrolled in that MCO. 2.4.4.2.3.3 If the enrollee is a newborn, the enrollee will be assigned to his/her mother's MCO. 2.4.4.2.3.4 If none of the above applies, the enrollee will be assigned using default logic that randomly assigns enrollees to MCOs (other than TennCare Select). 2.4.4.2.4 TENNCARE may modify the auto assignment algo rithm to change or add criteria including but not limited to quality measures or cost or utilization management performance. 2.4.4.3 Immediate Eligibility for Children in State Custody Until a final determination can be made on their TennCare eligibility, the CONTRACTOR shall accept notification from DCS that a child has entered stat e custody and adhere to the following requirements to insure that eligibility is provided. Up on receipt of notification from DCS, the CONTRACTOR shall determine whether or not the child is otherwise enrolled in TennCare. If the child is not currently enrolle d, the CONTRACTOR shall immediately build a forty-five (45) day TennCare eligibility record effective on the date the child was placed in state custody and identify the child as a child in state custody, or group 1.A enrollee. 2.4.4.3.1 The CONTRACTOR shall generate a letter that will explain that the child has been given forty-five (45) days of coverage from their custody date, pending a final eligibility determination. 2.4.4.3.2 The CONTRACTOR is not required to assign a child for whom immediate eligibility has been established to a BPN PCP until TennCare eligibility is confirmed. 2.4.4.3.3 The CONTRACTOR shall fax the BPN enrollment form and a letter of notification to the DCS Case Manager. Amendment Number 20 (cont.) 112.4.4.3.4 The CONTRACTOR's BPN staff shall work with DCS to obtain an EPSDT visit with a BPN provider within twenty-one (21) days of requ est but no later than thirty (30) days of enrollment. 2.4.4.3.5 After twenty-five (25) days of immediate eligibility coverage, the CONTRACTOR shall identify children whose immediate eligibility will end in twenty (20) days to the DCS Program Coordinator of Health Advocacy. 2.4.4.3.6 The child shall be eligible for the TennCare Medicaid benefit package effective on the date the child was placed in custody through the 45th day of the Immediate Eligibility period or the date of receipt of a TennCare eligibility record, whichever occurs earlier. If the CONTRACTOR receives a TennCare eligibility record prior to the end of the forty-five (45) day eligibility period, the child shall be eligible for benefits in accordance with their TennCare eligibility status effective on the date of receipt of the eligibility record. 2.4.4.4 Non-Discrimination 2.4.4.4.1 The CONTRACTOR shall accept enrollees in th e order in which applications are approved and enrollees are assigned to the CONTRACTOR (whether by selection or assignment). 2.4.4.4.2 The CONTRACTOR shall accept an enrollee in the hea lth condition the enro llee is in at the time of enrollment and shall not discriminate against individuals on the basis of health status or need for health care services. 2.4.4.5 Family Unit If an individual is determined eligible for TennCare and has another family member already enrolled in an MCO, that individual shall be enrolled in the same MCO. This does not apply when the individual or family member is assigned to TennCare Select. If the newly enrolled family member opts to change MCOs during the 45-day change period (see Section 2.4.7.2.1), all family members in the case will be transferred to the new MCO. 2.4.5 Effective Date of Enrollment 2.4.5.1 Initial Enrollment of Current TennCare Enrollees The effective date of initial enrollment in an MCO for TennCare enrollees who are enrolled in accordance with Section 2.4.4.2 shall be the date provided on the enrollment file from TENNCARE.

The effective date of eligibility for other TennCare enrollees is the date of application or the date of the qua lifying event (e.g., the date the spend down obligation is met for medically needy enrollees). The effective date on the enrollment file provided by TENNCARE to the CONTRACTOR shall govern regardless of the other provisions of this Section 2.4.5.2. 2.4.5.3 In the event the effective date of eligibility provided by TENNCARE or DCS to the CONTRACTOR for either the initial enrollment of current TennCare enrollees or ongoing enrollment precedes the start da te of operations, the CONTRACTOR shall treat the enrollee as a member of the CONTRACTOR's MCO effective on the start date of operations. Amendment Number 20 (cont.) 122.4.5.4 Enrollment Prior to Notification 2.4.5.4.1 Because individuals can be retroactively eligible for TennCare, and the effective date of initial enrollment in an MCO is the effective date of eligibility or start date of operations, whichever is sooner, the effective date of enrollment may occur prior to the CONTRACTOR being notified of the person's enrollment. Therefore, enrollment of individuals in the CONTRACTOR's MCO may occur without prior notice to the CONTRACTOR or enrollee. 2.4.5.4.2 The CONTRACTOR shall not be liable for the cost of any covered services prior to the effective date of enrollment/eligibility but shall be responsible for the costs of covered services obtained on or after 12:01 a.m. on the effective date of enrollment/eligibility. 2.4.5.4.3 TENNCARE shall make payments to the CONTRACTOR from the effective date of an enrollee's date of enrollment/eligibility. 2.4.5.4.4 Except for applicable TennCare cost sharing, the CONTRACTOR shall ensure that members are held harmless for the cost of covered serv ices provided as of the effective date of enrollment with the CONTRACTOR. 2.4.6 Eligibility and Enrollment Data 2.4.6.1 The CONTRACTOR shall receive, process, a nd update enrollment files from TENNCARE, The CONTRACTOR shall also receive, process, and update enrollment files from DCS for children in state custody who are to be given immediate eligibility for a forty-five (45) day period.

Until such time as an indicator for children in state custody and children transitioning out of state custody can be added to the daily eligibility updates received from TennCare, the CONTRACTOR agrees to accept and process any adhoc report mutually agreed upon by the CONTRACTOR and TennCare to facilitate timely identification of children in state custod y or children transitioning out of state custody. 2.4.6.3 The CONTRACTOR shall provide an electronic eligibility file to TENNCARE as specified and in conformance to data exchange format and method standards outlin ed in Section 2.23.5. 2.4.7 Enrollment Period 2.4.7.1 General 2.4.7.1.1 The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the provision and costs of all covered services provided to enrollees during their period of enrollment with the CONTRACTOR. 2.4.7.1.2 Enrollment shall begin at 12:01 a.m. on the effective date of enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's MCO and shall end at 12:00 midnight on the date that the enrollee is disenrolled from the CONTRACTOR's MCO (see Section 2.5). 2.4.7.1.3 Once enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO, the member shall remain enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's MCO until or unless the enrollee is disenrolled pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement.

It consists of activities performed by a team or a single mental health case manager to support clinical services. Mental health cas e managers assist in ensuring the individual/family access to services. Mental health case management requires that the mental health case manager an d the individual and/or family have a strong productive relationship which includes viewing the individual/family as a responsible partner in identifying and obtaining the necessary services and resources. Servi ces rendered to children and youth shall be consumer- centered and family-focused with case managers working w ith multiple systems (e.g. education, child welfare, juvenile justice). Mental health case management is provided in comm unity settings, which are accessible and comfortable to the individual/family. The service should be rendered in a culturally competent manner and be outcome driven. Mental health case management shall be ava ilable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service is not time limited and provides the individual/family the opportunity to improve their quality of life. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure mental health case manageme nt is rendered in accordance with all of the service components and guidelines herein. SERVICE DELIVERY The CONTRACTOR shall: Determine caseload size based on an average number of individuals per case manager, with the expectation being that case managers will have mixed caseloads of clients and flexibility between Levels 1 and 2 (Levels 1 and 2 are defined below); and Ensure that caseload sizes and minimum contacts are met as follows: Case Management Type Maximum Caseload Size Minimum Face-to-Face Contacts Level 1 (Non-Team Approach)* 25 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week Level 1 (Team Approaches): Adult CTT 20 individuals:1 team 20 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week Children & Youth (C&Y) CTT 15 individuals:1 team 15 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week CCFT 15 individuals:1 team 15 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week ACT 100 individuals:1 team 15 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week Amendment Number 20 (cont.) 160Case Management Type Maximum Caseload Size Minimum Face-to-Face Contacts PACT 100 individuals:1 team 15 individuals:1 case manager One (1) contact per week Level 2* 35 individuals:1 case manager Two (2) contacts per month *For case managers having a combination of Level 1 & Level 2 (non-team) individuals, the maximum caseload size shall be no more than 30 individuals:1 case manager. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that the following requirements are met: 1) All mental health case managers shall have, at a minimum, a bachelor's degree; 2) Supervisors shall maintain no greater than a 1:30 su pervisory ratio with mental health case managers; 3) Mental health case managers who are assigned to both a parent(s) and child in the same family, should have skills and experience needed for both ages; mental health case managers who are assigned to individuals with co-occurring disorders (mental illness and subs tance abuse disorders) should have the skills and experience to meet the needs of these individuals; 4) Eighty percent (80%) of all mental health case mana gement services should take place outside the case manager's office; 5) The children and youth (C&Y) (under age eighteen (18)) mental health case management model shall provide a transition from C&Y services into adult services, including adult mental health case management services.

Mental health case management activities are correlated to expected outcomes and outcome achievement and shall be monitored, with progress being noted periodically in a written record. Level 1 Level 1 mental health case management is the most intens e level of service. It provides frequent and comprehensive support to individuals with a focus on recovery and re silience. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure the provision of level 1 mental health case management to the most severe ly disabled adults and emotionally disturbed children and youth, including individuals who are at high risk of future hospitalizati on or placement out of the home and require both community support and treatment interventions. Level 1 mental health case management can be rendered through a team approach or by individual mental health case managers. Team approaches may include such models as ACT, CTT, CCFT and PACT, as described below: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) ACT is a way of delivering comprehensive and effective serv ices to adults diagnosed with severe mental illness and who have needs that have not been well met by traditional approaches to delivering services. The principles of ACT include: 1) Services targeted to a specific group of individuals with severe mental illness; 2) Treatment, support and rehabilitation services provided directly by the ACT team; 3) Sharing of responsibility between team members and individuals served by the team; 4) Small staff (all team staff including case managers) to individual ratios (approx. 1 to 10); 5) Comprehensive and flexible range of treatment and services; 6) Interventions occurring in community settings rather than in hospitals or clinic settings; 7) No arbitrary time limit on receiving services; 8) Individualized treatment, support and rehabilitation services; 9) Twenty-four (24) hour a day availability of services; and 10) Engagement of individuals in treatment and monitoring. Continuous Treatment Team (CTT) CTT is a coordinated team of staff (to include physicians, nurses, case managers, and other therapists as needed) who provide a range of intensive, integrated mental heal th case management, treatment, and rehabilitation services Amendment Number 20 (cont.) 161to adults and children and youth. The intent is to provide intensive treatment to families of children and youth with acute psychiatric problems in an effort to prevent removal from the home to a more restrictive level of care. An array of services are delivered in the home or in natural settings in the community, and are provided through a strong partnership with the family and other community support systems. The program provides services including crisis intervention and stabilization, counselin g, skills building, therap eutic intervention, advocacy , educational services, medication management as indicated, sc hool based counseling and consultation with teachers, and other specialized services deemed necessa ry and appropriate. Comprehensive Child and Family Treatment (CCFT) CCFT services are high intensity, time-limited services designed for children and youth to provide stabilization and deter the \"imminent\" risk of State custody for the individual. There is usually family instability and high-risk behaviors exhibited by the child/adolescent. CCFT services are concentrated on child, family, and parental/guardian behaviors and interaction. CCFT servi ces are more treatment oriented and s ituation specific with a focus on short- term stabilization goals. The primary goal of CCFT is to reach an appropriate point of stabilization so the individual can be transitioned to a less intense outpatient service. Program of Assertive and Community Treatment (PACT) PACT is a service delivery model for providing comprehens ive community-based treatment to adults with severe and persistent mental illness. It involves the use of a mult i-disciplinary team of mental health staff organized as an accountable, mobile mental health agency or group of providers who function as a team interchangeably to provide the treatment, rehabilitation and support services persons with severe and/or persistent mental illnesses need to live successfully in the community. Level 2 Level 2 mental health case management is a less intensive level of service than Level 1 and is focused on resilience and recovery. The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that leve l 2 mental health case management is provided to individuals whose symptoms are at least partially stabilized or reduced in order to allow treatment and rehabilitation efforts. Amendment Number 20 (cont.) 162SERVICE COMPONENTS The CONTRACTOR shall ensure that mental health case management incorporates the following service components: Crisis Facilitation Crisis facilitation is provided in situations requiring immediate attention/resolution for a specific individual or other person(s) in relation to a specific individual. It is the pr ocess of accessing and coordinating services for an individual in a crisis situation to ensure the necessary services are re ndered during and following the crisis episode. Most crisis facilitation activities would involve face-to -face contact with the individual. Assessment of Daily Functioning Assessment of daily functioning involves the on-going monitoring of how an individual is coping with life on a day to day basis for the purposes of determining necessary se rvices to maintain community placement and improve level of functioning. Most assessments of daily functioning are achieved by face-to-face contact with the individual in his or her natural environment. Assessment/Referral/Coordination Assessment/referral/coordination involves assessing the needs of the individu al for the purposes of referral and coordination of services that will improve functioning and/or maintain stability in the individual's natural environment. Mental Health Liaison Mental health liaison services are offe red to persons who are not yet assigned to mental health case management. It is a short-term service for the purposes of service referra l and continuing care until other mental health services are initiated. Amendment Number 20 (cont.) 163 SERVICE Psychiatric Reh abilitation DEFINITION Psychiatric rehabilitation is an array of consumer-centered re covery services designed to support the individual in the attainment or maintenance of his or her optimal level of functioning. These services are designed to capitalize on personal strengths, develop coping skills and strategies to deal with deficits and develop a supportive environment in which to function as independent as possible on the individual's recovery journey. Services included under psychiatric rehabilitation are as follows. SERVICE COMPONENTS Psychosocial Rehabilitation Psychosocial rehabilitation services utilize a comprehensive approach (mind, body, and spirit) to work with the whole person for the purposes of improving an individuals' functioning, promoting management of illness(s), and facilitating recovery. The goal of psychosocial rehabilita tion is to support individua ls as active and productive members of their communities. Individuals, in partnership with staff, form goals for skills development in the areas of vocational, educational, and interpersonal growth (e .g. household management, development of social support networks) that serve to ma ximize opportunities for successful community integration. Individuals proceed toward goal attainment at their own pace and ma y continue in the program at varying levels intensity for an indefinite period of time. Supported Employment Supported employment consists of a range of services to assist individuals to choose, prepare for, obtain, and maintain gainful employment that is based on individuals' preferences, strengths, and experiences. This service also includes a variety of support services to the individual, including side-by-side support on the job. These services may be integrated into a psychosocial rehabilitation center. Peer Support Peer support services allow individuals to direct thei r own recovery and advocacy pr ocess and are provided by persons who are or have been consumers of the behavioral health system and their family members and are Certified Peer Support Specialists. These services include providing assistance with more effectively utilizing the service delivery system (e.g. assistance in de veloping plans of care, accessing services and supports, partnering with professionals) or understanding and coping with the stressors of the person's illness through support groups, coaching, role modeling, and mentoring. Activities wh ich promote socialization, recovery, self-advocacy, development of natural supports, and maintenance of community living skills are rendered so individuals can educate and support each other in the acquisition of skills needed to mana ge their illnesses and access resources within their communities. Services are often pr ovided during the evening and weekend hours. Illness Management & Recovery Illness management and recovery services refers to a series of weekly sessions with trained mental health practitioners for the purpose of assisting individuals in developing personal strategies for coping with mental illness and promoting recovery. Supported Housing Supported housing services refers to se rvices rendered at facilities that are st affed twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days a week with associated mental health staff supports for individuals who require treatment services and supports in a highly structured setting. These mental health services are for persons with serious and/or persistent mental illnesses (SPMI) and are intended to prepare individuals for more independent living in the community while providing an environment that allows individuals to live in community settings. Given this goal, every effort should be made to place individuals in facilities near th eir families and other support systems and Amendment Number 20 (cont.) 164original areas of residence. Supported housing services are mental health serv ices and do not incl ude the payment of room and board. 15.

Section 4-1.1.n shall be amended by adding new text in the last paragraph so that the amended Section 4-1.1.n shall read as follows: n. It is the intent and policy of TENNCARE that TenuCare-eligible newborn children and their TennCare eligible mothers, be enrolled in the same MCO. This policy is only applicable to Group 6 enrollees. Enrollment of the newborn child in the same plan as its Mother facilitates coverage and payment of the costs associated with delivery, facilitates coverage and payment of the newborn services provided after birth of the child but prior to establishment of individual TenuCare eligibility for the child and provides a financial incentive to the CONTRACTOR to promote prenatal care as a means to reduce the risks of a complicated and more costly pregnancy andlor delivery. It is recognized by TENNCARE and the CONTRACTOR that despite the best efforts of TENNCARE to assure enrollment of a newborn in the same plan as its Mother, due to the various means of enrollment in \" ' . . ' , , Amendment 17 (cont.) the TennCare program, a newborn child may be inadvertently enrolled in a plan different than its Mother. When such cases are identified by the CONTRACTOR, the CONTRACTQR shall immediately report to TENNCARE, in accordance with written procedures provided by TENNCARE, that a newborn child has been incorrectly enrolled in a plan different than its Mother. Upon receipt of such notice from a CONTRACTOR or discovery by TENNCARE that a newborn has been incolTectly enrolled in a plan different than its Mother, TENNCARE shall immediately: (1) Disenroll the newborn from the incolTect plan; (2) Recoup any payments made to the CONTRACTOR for the newborn; (3) Enroll the newborn in the same plan as its Mother with the same effective date as when the newborn child was enrolled in the incolTect plan; and (4) Make payments to the COlTect plan for the period of coverage. The plan in which the newborn child is correctly enrolled shall be responsible for the coverage and payment ofTennCare-covered services provided to the newborn child for the full period of eligibility. The plan in which the newborn child was incolTectly enrolled shall have no liability for the coverage or payment of any TennCare-covered services provided, except as described below, during the period of incorrect plan assignment and TENNCARE shall have no liability for payments to the CONTRACTOR in these cases. There are circumstances in which a newborn child's Mother may not be eligible for participation in the TennCare program. The CONTRACTOR shall be required to process claims received for services provided to newborn children within the time frames specified in Section 2-9.7 of this Agreement. The CONTRACTOR shall not utilize any blanket policy which results in the automatic denial of claims for services provided to a TennCare-eligible newborn child, during any period of enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's plan, because the child's Mother is not a member of the CONTRACTOR's plan. However, it is recognized that in complying with the claims processing time frames specified in Section 2- 9.7 of this Agreement, the CONTRACTOR may make payment for services provided to a TennCare\u00ad eligible newborn child enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's plan at the time of payment but the child's eligibility may subsequently be moved to another contractor's plan. In such event, the CONTRACTOR in which the newborn child is first enrolled (first plan) may submit supporting documentation to the contractor's plan in which the newborn child is moved (second plan) and the second plan shall reimburse the first plan within thirty (30) days of receipt of such properly documented request for reimbursement, for the amount expended on behalf of the child prior to the child's eligibility having been moved to the second plan. Such reimbursement shall be the actual amount expended by the CONTRACTOR and shall be used to reduce the amount of funds requested from the State in the weekly remittance request. In the event the CONTRACTOR is the second plan (i.e. the plan to which the newborn child is moved), should the CONTRACTOR fail to reimburse the first plan the actual amount expended on behalf of the newborn child within thirty (30) days of receipt of a properly documented request for payment, TENNCARE is authorized to reimburse the first plan. In the event that the CONTRACTOR fails to reimburse the first MCO the actual amount expended on behalf of the newborn within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of a properly documented request for payment, TENNCARE may assess liquidated damages as specified in Section 6- S.b.2. 27. Section 5-1.i andj. shall be deleted and replaced as follows: i. Effective July 1,2005 through August 31, 2006, VSHP shall provide all services required to maintain the CHR, EPSDT documentation and reporting analytics as related to said CHR as defined above, at no additional charge to the TennCare Bureau. Effective July 1,2006 through June 30, 2007, VSHP shall be reimbursed an administration fee for maintaining and providing the CHR of $1.20 PMPM for enrollees participating in the CHR .. TENNCARE shall not reimburse the additional $1.20 PMPM for enrollees who opt out and are omitted from the CHR. Upon sixty (60) calendar days prior written notice, the State may terminate the services to be provided under this section of this agreement with or without cause, and/or for convenience. Upon provision of said notice and at the conclusion of the sixty (60) calendar day notice period VSHP's obligation to provide necessary services to maintain the CHR will end and the State shall have no finiher obligation to reimburse the $1.20 PMPM administration fee. Effective July 1, 2007, the .' , , Amendment 17 (cont.) administration fee for providing the CHR shall be set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the State, VSHP and Shared Health. j.

The provider is required to inform the enrollee of the non-covered service and have the enrollee acknowledge the information. If the enrollee still requests the service, the provider shall obtain such acknowledgment in writing prior to rendering the service.

If the services are not covered because they are in excess of an enrollee's benefit limit and one of the following circumstances applies: (a) The provider determines effective on the date of service that the enrollee has reached his/her benefit limit for the particular service being requested and, prior to providing the service, informs the enrollee that the service is not covered and the service will not be paid for by TennCare. The source of the provider's information must be a database listed on the TennCare website as approved by TennCare on the date of the provider's inquiry; (b) The provider has information in his/her own records to support the fact that the enrollee has reached hislher benefit limit for the particular service being requested, and, prior to providing the service, informs the enrollee that the service is not covered and will not be paid for by TennCare. This information may include: 17 Amendment 12 (cont.) (i) A previous written denial of a claim on the basis that the service was in excess of the enrollee's benefit limit for a service within the same benefit category as the service being requested, if the time period applicable to that benefit limit is still in effect; (ii) That the provider had previously examined the database referenced in part I. above and determined that the enrollee had reached hislher benefit limit for the particular service being requested, if the time period applicable to that benefit limit is still in effect; (iii) That the provider had personally provided services to the enrollee in excess of hislher benefit limit within the same benefit category as the service being requested, if the time period applicable to that benefit limit is still in effect. (c) The provider submits a claim for service to the' appropriate managed care contractor (MCC) and receives a written denial of that claim on the basis that the service exceeds the enrollee's benefit limit. Then and thereafter, within the remainder of the period applicable to that benefit limit, the provider may continue to bill the enrollee for services within that same exhausted benefit category without having to submit, for repeated MCC denial, claims for those subsequent services. (d) The provider had previously taken the steps in parts 1., 2., or 3. above and determined that the enrollee had reached hislher benefit limit for the particular service being requested, if the time period applicable to that benefit limit is still in effect, and informs the enrollee, prior to providing the service, that the service is not covered and will not be paid for by TennCare. The CON1RACTOR shall require, as a condition of payment, that the service provider accept the amount paid by the CONTRACTOR or appropriate denial made by the CON1RACTOR (or, if applicable, payment by the CONTRACTOR that is supplementary to the enrollee's third party payor) plus any applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing responsibilities due from the enrollee as payment in full for the service. Should a provider, or a collection agency acting on the provider'S behalf, bill an enrollee for amounts other than the applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing responsibilities due from the enrollee, once a CON1RACTOR becomes aware the CON1RACTOR shall notify the provider and demand that the provider and/or collection agency cease such action against the enrollee immediately.

Prenatal Care The CONTRACTOR shall have policies and procedures to facilitate and take reasonable steps to assist pregnant thembers in accessing prenatal care. This provision shall apply to enrollees in the plan who become pregnant as well as enrollees who are pregnant on the beginning date of enrollment in the plan. This provision does not intend to require all of the CONTRACTOR's network providers to accept new enrollees. However, the CONTRACTOR shall maintain a provider network consisting of providers who accept new enrollees in accordance with TennCare access standards and shall inform TENNCARE, as required, of network providers who do not accept new enrollees. Inthe event an enrollee entering the CONTRACTOR's plan is receiving medically necessary prenatal care services the day before enrollment, the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the costs of continuation of such medically necessary services, without any form of prior approval and without regard to whether such services are being provided within or outside the CONTRACTOR's provider network. In the event an enrollee entering the CONTRACTOR's plan is in her second or third trimester of pregnancy and is receiving medically necessary prenatal care services the day before enrollment, the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for providing continued access to the provider (regardless of network affiliation) through the postpartum period. The CONTRACTOR shall require, as a condition of payment, that the service provider accept the amount paid by the CONTRACTOR or appropriate denial made by the CONTRACTOR (or, if applicable, payment by the CONTRACTOR that is supplementary to the enrollee's third party payor) plus any applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing responsibilities due from the enrollee as payment in full for the service. MCOs participating in TennCare are required to provide or arrange for the provlSlon of medically necessary medical care to their enrollees beginning on the date of their enrollment in the MCO's plan. This requirement includes not only TennCare enrollees whose eligibility is established through SSI, Medicaid or uninsured/uninsurable applications for TennCare, but also those pregnant women who establish \"presumptive eligibility\" for TennCare. Effective with the first day of a presumptive eligibility period, the State makes fixed administrative fee payments on behalf of these women to the selected MCO and the MCO is required to provide or arrange for the provision of medical care for their enrollee during this period. Women who are presumptively eligible are entitled to all TennCare benefits. There shall be a sufficient number of providers in the MCO's n.etwork who accept enrollees within each geographical location in which the plan is marketed so that prenatal or other medically necessary medical care is not delayed or denied to these women during their presumptive eligibility period. Additionally, the MCO must make services available out-of-plan, if necessary, to meet the medical needs of a woman enrolled in the MCO's plan as a presumptive eligible. The CONTRACTOR shall notify all network providers that any unreasonable delay in providing care to a pregnant member seeking prenatal care will be considered a material breach of the network provider's contract with the CONTRACTOR Delay in care for pregnant enrollees shall mean: 1. Failure of the MCO to respond to an enrollee's request for prenatal care by identifying a maternity care provider to honor a request from an enrollee, including a presumptive eligible enrollee, (or from a primary care provider or patient advocate acting on behalf on an enrollee) for a prenatal care appointment. Accessibility shall be in accordance with the Terms and Conditions for Access to the TennCare Waiver and contained herein as Attachment III unless TENNCARE shall specify more stringent access criteria. Regardless of whether prenatal care is provided by a primary_care physician, physician extender or an obstetrician who is not the enrollee's primary care physician, the access standards for primary care physician or extender services shall apply when determining access to prenatal care except for cases of a first prenatal care appointment for women who are past their first trimester of pregnancy on the day they are determined to be eligible. For women who are past their 16 Amendment 11 '( cont.) , fIrst trimester of pregnancy on the day they are determined to be eligible, a fIrst prenatal care appointment shall occur within fIfteen (15) days of the day they are determined to be eligible; or 2. Failure of a pharmacist within the MCO's provider network to fIll a prescription written by a maternity care provider for an enrollee, including an approved presumptive eligible, within the specifIed time frames for all medically necessary requests as described elsewhere in this Agreement andlor the TennCare rules and regulations. Effective July I, 2003, pharmacy services, as described in 2-3.1 shall be provided by the Pharmacy BenefIts Manager (PBM) contracted by the TENNCARE Bureau. Failure to provide prenatal care in accordance with the provisions described herein shall result in the CONTRACTOR being required to implement a corrective action plan as described in Section 2- 16, and shall result in the application of liquidated damages and/or intermediate sanctions as described in Section 6.8 of this Agreement. II. The fIrst paragraph of Section 2-3.16 shall be amended by adding a new sentence so that the amended fIrst paragraph shall read as follows: The CONTRACTOR must have written policies and procedures for an EPSDT program that includes coordinating services with other TennCare providers, providing all medically necessary Title XIX EPSDT services to all eligible individuals under the age of twenty-one (21) regardless of whether the service is included in the Medicaid State Plan, as well as outreach and education. The CONTRACTOR must assure the availability and accessibility of required health care resources and help enrollees and their parents or guardi~ms use these resources effectively. The State EPSDT program shall be referred to as \"TENNderCare\". The CONTRACTOR shall use \"TENNderCare\" in describing or naming an EPSDT program or services. This shall include, but not be limited to, all policies, procedures andlor marketing material, regardless of the format or media. No other names or labels shall be utilized. CONTRACTORS may, however, use existing EPSDT materials through December 31, 2004. Any new or reprinted EPSDT materials shall use TENNderCare as of July I, 2004. 12. Section 2-3.16.1.2.2 through 5 shall be deleted and replaced in their entirety so that the amended Sections 2- 3.16.1.2.2 through 5 shall read as follows: 2. a comprehensive unclothed physical exam (the child's growth shall be compared against that considered normal for the child's age and gender); 3. appropriate immunizations schedule. according to the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) schedule according to age and health history.

The CONTRACTOR shall use this report as a basis to contact, by telephone one-hundred percent (100%) of its network prescribers (or a provider practicing with the prescribing physician), who wrote prescriptions within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the report is received, for the purpose of educating the physician about a prescription drug that is on the PDL that the physician may prescribe as an alternative and to encourage the physician to contact the pharmacy and change the prescription accordingly; any prescriber who cannot be identified through a unique DEA number shall be excluded from this requirement. (e) CONTRACTOR shall utilize pharmacy lock-in data provided by TENNCARE PBM to identify members for case management services. (f) Appeals and member service inquiries related to pharmacy services, provided by the TennCare PBM, shall be the responsibility ofTENNCARE and/or the TennCare PBM. 14. Section 2-3.19 shall be deleted and replaced in its entirety so that the amended Section 2-3.19 shall read as follows: 2-3_19 Coordination with the Department of Education The State has implemented a program to provide federal reimbursement to local education agencies (LEAs) for medical services provided to Medicaid-eligible students in a school setting. These services must be medically necessary and included in the student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The purpose of this program is to assist LEAs to provide quality medical services to Medicaid students with special needs. This program does not replace the MCOs obligation to pay for medical services for these enrollees, but allows the school districts the option to receive fee-for-service Medicaid payment directly from TENNCARE where providers are direct employees of the school district or are cOll)Illunity providers. MCOs should continue to reimburse qualified providers for services provided in the school setting, such as services coordinated through Department of Health's Project Teach. MCOs should also continue dialogue with providers and Project Teach Coordinators to establish school-based services for students with special needs. 15. Section 2-4.1.1 shall be deleted and replaced in its entirety so that the amended Section 2-4.1.1 shaH read as follows: 2-4_1.1.

The purpose of these visits is to identify physical, mental, or deVelopmental problems and risks as early as possible and to link children to needed diagnostic and treatment services. To comply with these rules and provide the highest quality of care, surveillance and screening procedures should be incorporated into the ongoing health care of the child and family as part of the provision of the medical home, as defined by the AAP (RE0062 -Developmental Surveillance and Screening of Infants and Young Children). AAP Periodicity Guidelines (American Academy of Pediatrics Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care) call for a developmentallbehavioral assessment by history and appropriate physical examination at each visit interval. If fmdings identify concerns, specific objective developmental testing is needed. Developmental surveillance and developmental screening are the recommended methods for early detection of problems. Developmental surveillance has been defined as \"a flexible, continuous process whereby knowledgeable professionals perform skilled observations of children during the provision of health care. The components of developmental surveillance include eliciting and attending to parental concerns, obtaining a relevant developmental history, making accurate and informative observations of children, and sharing opinions and concerns with other relevant professionals.\" Pediatricians and other health care providers often use age-appropriate developmental checklists to record milestones during preventive care visits as part of developmental surveillance. Developmental screening is a brief procedure, using a standardized tool, to determine whether a child requires further and more comprehensive evaluation. All infants and young children should be assessed for developmental delays. School-age children and adolescents should receive additional evaluation for emotionallbehavioral problems. The use of standardized screening instruments improve the accuracy of developmental assessments, and such tools exist that are both efficient and effective in the pediatric office and other settings such as primary health and public health centers. Tools listed below are recommended tools and are listed by the focus of the tool and the target age range. Providers need to develop a strategy to provide periodic assessments in the context of ongoing office based primary care. It is recognized that practice setting will influence the type and frequency of assessments provided. 59 Amendment 11 (cont.) Practices should maintain and update knowledge of developmental issues, risk factors, screening techniques, and community resources for consultation, referral, and intervention. This should include acquiring skills in the administration and interpretation of reliable and valid developmental screening techniques appropriate for the population served. Besides developmentalJemotiona1!behavioral surveillance and screening, the listing includes a specialized screen for maternal post-partum _ depression. Assessment for this condition should be made in the first weeks after birth, and appropriate referral initiated as needed. The listing also includes specific screens for autistic spectrum disorders. Early detection and referral for early intervention has been shown to _ improve long t= outcomes in this group of disorders In addition, the prevalence of these disorders continue to increase. Documentation of developmentalJemotionalfbehavioral surveillance and screening should include a description of the method used, [mdings, and referral or treatment plans. DevelopmentallBehavioral Screening Tools/Tests and Documentation Guidelines Documentation Guidelines Documentation should include a description of the developmental behavioral screening method. The following items should be documented in the medical record when developmental\u00b7' behavioral screening is done during an EPSDT encounter:. Any parental concerns about the child's development I behavior. A review of major age appropriate areas of development I behavior (e.g. motor, language, social, adapiive). An overall assessment of development I behavior for age (e.g. normal, abnormal, needs further evaluation). A plan for referral and lor further evaluation when indicated. When validated developmental screening tests are performed in addition to the preventive medicine service or other services providers can report CPT code 96110 in addition to the Preventive Medicine Service. Examples listed in CPT include the Denver II and the Early Language Milestones Survey. This service is reported in addition to Preventive Medicine and other evaluation and management or screening services (hearing, vision, and laboratory) performed during the same visit. Informal developmental checklists are considered part of the history of the preventive medicine visit, and not reported and billed separately. Developmental Screening Instruments The following are list includes examples of developmenta1/behavioral screening tests approved by the EPSDT Screening Guidelines Committee for use in the EPSDT program. They have been approved and validated and used nationally. Providers who use alternative instruments should make a selection based On a similar standard of practice. These guidelines are subject to update and revision as needed. 60 *Focus of Targeted Age Name of Screen Age Range Scoring Accuracy* I Time Frame Screen Range for Screen Description Parental 6 - 8 Weeks post- Edinburg Postnatal 6-8 Weeks Developed to assist Response Source article I Less than Post-Partum natal Depression Scale postnatal primary care health categories are indicates that nunutes Depression (EPDS) professionals to detect scored 0, 1, 2 with mothers, JL Cox, JM Holden, R mothers suffering from and 3 who scored Sagovsky, from British postnatal depression. according to above Journal of Psychiatry, Scale consists of ten increased threshold, June 1987, Vol. 150. items and indicates how severity of the 92.3% were User may reproduce the the mother has been symptoms. likely to be scale without further feeling during the Items marked suffering from permission providing previous week; it may with an asterisk a depressive they respect the copyright be usefully repeated are reversed illness of by quoting the names of after two weeks. scores.

Newborns in alternative birthing facilities, including home births, have access to and are referred for screening before 1 month of age. All newborns or infants who require neonatal intensive care receive hearing screening before discharge from the hospital. The components constitute UNHS. The goal of newborn screening is to also have all infants screened prior to discharge from hospital after birth or prior to one month; prior to 3 months refer all infants that did not pass the screen for diagnostic assessment (medical and audiological, if indicated); implement early intervention services prior to six months. Infants who did not pass screening should be referred for diagnostic assessment of hearing. A prompt re-screening might be substituted for immediate referral for diagnostic assessment if the clinician believes the initial screening result is likely to be false positive. Re-screening should be done within 2-4 weeks rather than waiting until the next scheduled well-child visit. Newborn hearing screenings are most likely to occur in hospital with results reported to the primary care provider. Acceptable methods of screening include physiologic audiological screening such as auditory brainstem response (OAE) with thresholds of 30 dB Acceptable methods of objective hearing screening include: physiologic audiological screening for newborns, conventional audiometry, hand-held audiometry, conditioned (with a screening level of 20 dB HL at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz). Positive screening results should lead to referral for diagnostic assessment of hearing. A prompt re-screening may be substituted for immediate referral for diagnostic assessment if the clinician believes the initial screening result is likely to be a false positive. Re-screening should be done within 2-4 weeks rather than waiting until the next scheduled well child visit. If there are parental concerns about hearing, at any age, then an objective screening test or diagnostic should be performed. Children newly entering the program (i.e. new to a practice, without medical documentation) should be brought up to date on all screening criteria. Physiological screening may be acceptable for older children and children who are not cooperative with conventional means (i.e. hand-held audiometry, conventional audiometry). Interperiodic screenings may also be conducted between recommended testing intervals. Progressive hearing loss may be associated with different risk factors. Please refer to references after guidelines for articles, resources that enumerate the risk indicators for progressive or late -onset hearing loss. 69 , )' Amendment 11 (cont.

Recommendations of the EPSDT Screening Guidelines Committee April,2004 Vision Screenings Screening of visual problems is important during critical age interval to detect several potential problems. These include: 1) Screening of extremely prematurely born infants for Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), especially those who have received oxygen therapy. 2) Screening for congenital cataracts and retinoblastoma at birth and through age 18 months of age. 3) Screening as early as possible time for amblyopia and refractive errors. Please refer to the chart (below) for screening intervals Acceptable methods for screening ocular alignment include: photoscreening (preferred), unilateral cover test at 10 feet or 3 M, Random Dot E Stereotest at 40 cm (630 secs of arc). Photoscreening is not a substitute for accurate visual acuity measurement but can provide significant information about the presence of sight-threatening conditions such as strabismus, anisometropia, high hyperopia, media opacities (cataract),. . Photoscreening results are accurate only with proper interpretation. Simultaneous Red Reflex Test (Bruckner Test) can detect amblyogenic conditions, such as unequal refractive errors (unilateral high myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism), but require skilled examiners. Acceptable methods for screening visual acuity include: Snellen Letters, Snellen Numbers, Tumbling E, HOTV, Picture Tests, Allen Figures, LH Symbols (LEA Symbols). Assessments of visual acuity should be performed with an eye patch or eye taped shut, or similar procedure, in order to ensure results, Eye eXams should entail an anterior segment inspection. The AAP/AAO Policy Statement in Pediatrics, April, 2003, should serve as the standard. If there are parental concern about vision, at any age, then an objective screening test or diagnostic should be performed Positive screening results should lead to referral for diagnostic assessment of Vision. A prompt re-screening may be substituted for immediate referral for diagnostic assessment if the clinician believes his initial screening result is likely to be a false positive. Re-screening should, be done within 2-4 weeks rather than waiting until the next scheduled well child visit. Interperiodic screenings may also be conducted between recommended testing intervals. 74 Amendment 11 (cont.) ..

The purpose of this program is to assist LEAs to provide quality medical 4 .' fun~ndment 7 (cont.) services to students with special needs. This program does not replace the MCOs obligation to pay for medical services for these enrollees, but allows the school districts the option to receive fee-for-service payment directly from TENNCARE where providers are direct employees of the school district or are community providers. MCOs should continue to reimburse qualified providers for services provided in the school setting, such as services coordinated through Dep~rtrnent of Health's Project Teach. MCOs should also continue dialogue with providers and Project Teach Coordinators to establish school\u00ad based services for students with special needs. 14.

The CONTRACTOR shall require, as a condition of payment, that the service provider accept the amount paid by the CONTRACTOR or appropriate denial made by the CONTRACTOR (or, if applicable, payment by the CONTRACTOR that is supplementary to the enrollee's third party payer) plus any applicable amount of TennCare cost sharing due from the enrollee as payment in full for the service. If the CONTRACTOR's payment to a non-contract provider is less than it would have been for a contract provider and the provider contests the payment amount, the CONTRACTOR shall notifY the non-contract provider that the provider may initiate the independent review procedures in accordance with T.C.A.

For purposes of Sections 2-4.3(1) and (m), enrollees with special health care needs shall refer to enrollees identified through the Department of Children's Services (DCS), as described in Section 1-3 of this Agreement. m. The CONTRACTOR shall implement procedures to share, with other MCOs, BHOs, DBMs and PBMs (as necessary) serving the enrollee, the results of its identification and assessment of any enrollee with special health care needs so that those activities need not be duplicated. 16.

The parties to this Agreement recognize that in accordance with TennCare policies and procedures, if an enrollee requests enrollment in a specified MCO, the enrollee may be assigned to an MCO other than the one that he/she requested. An example a of circumstances when an enrollee would not be , enrolled in the requested MCO includes, there is not sufficient capacity in the MCO in which the enrollee requested enrollment. If an enrollee did not request enrollment in a specified MCO, the enrollee will be assigned to an MCO in accordance with TennCare policies and procedures. In either case, the effective date of enrollment may occur prior to the MCO being notified of the enrollee becoming a member of the plan. When this situation arises, the MCO shall not deny medically necessary services provided during this period of eligibility for lack of prior authorization or lack of referral; likewise, an MCO shall not deny a claim on the basis of the provider's failure to file a claim within a specified time period after the date of service when the provider could not have reasonably known which MCO the enrollee was in during the timely filing period. However, in such cases the MCO may impose timely filing requirements beginning on the date of notification of the individual's enrollment.

TENNCARE shall aggregate cost-sharing information submitted by TennCare MCOs, BROs and the PBM to identify enrollees that have met or exceeded their annual out-of\u00ad pocket expenditure maximum. The CONTRACTOR agrees to coordinate reimbursement to enrollees, either directly or through its network providers, that have exceeded the applicable out-of-pocket maximum, upon receipt of notification by TENNCARE. Should the CONTRACTOR elect to reimburse enrollees through its network providers, the CONTRACTOR shall conduct an audit of the providers that have been reimbursed in order to assure that enrollees received appropriate credit and/or reimbursement and are held harmless for amounts that exceed their out-of-pocket maximum. The CONTRACTOR shall be expressly prohibited from waiving or using any alternative TennCare cost sharing schedules, unless required by TENNCARE. If, and at such time that TENNCARE amends any TennCare rules or regulations, including but not limited to the TennCare cost sharing rules, the rules shall automatically be incorporated into this Agreement and become binding on the CONTRACTOR and its providers.

Each determination shall be based on individualized circumstances for each case by the CONTRACTOR and/or the transportation vendor. Each request for transportation services is to be reviewed individually and documented by the CONTRACTOR and/or the transportation vendor. The requirement to provide the cost of meals shall not be interpreted to mean that an enrollee and/or an attendant can request meals while in transport to and from care. Rather, this provision is intended for use when an enrollee has to be transported to a major health facility for services and care cannot be completed in one day thereby requiring an overnight stay. The CONTRACTOR shall offer transportation and scheduling assistance to all children under age 21 referred for an assessment who do not have access to transportation. This may be accomplished through various means of communication to enrollees, including but not limited to, member handbooks, EPSDT outreach notifications, etc. An EPSDT enrollee may be considered for transportation if such enrollee has written permission from the treating physician and custodial parent(s). Circumstances that may permit the CONTRACTOR and/or its transportation vendor to refuse the transportation request would be as follows: (i) The EPSDT enrollee is under the age of eighteen (18) and does not have an attendant. (ii) The EPSDT enrollee has an attendant, but the attendant is not a parent or legal guardian and cannot legally sign for the enrollee to receive medical care, i.e., the EPSDT enrollee may be a foster or stepchild. Some foster or stepparents do not have legal authority to sign for medical care for foster 01' step children. The CONTRACTOR and transportation vendors must be aware of this and must ask these questions when scheduling transpOlt. (iii) The enrollee 01' attendant according to a reasonable person's standards has to be noticeably indisposed [disorderly conduct, intoxicated, armed (firearms), possession of illegal drugs, knives 36 Amendment 1 (continued) and/or other weapons], and in any other condition that may affect the safety of the driver or persons being transpOlted, 10, Follow up for elevated blood lead levels in children must be carried out in accordance with the State Medicaid Manual, Part 5 (http://www.hcfa.gov/pubforms/pub45/pub_45.htm). The Manual currently says that children with blood lead levels equal to or greater than lOug/dL should be followed according to CDC guidelines, These guidelines include follow up blood tests and investigations to determine the source of lead, when indicated, In accordance with the State Medicaid Directors' letter issued by CMS (formerly HCFA) on October 22, 1999, MCOs are responsible for \"any follow up service within the scope of the federal Medicaid statute, including diagnostic or treatment services determined to be medically necessary\" when elevated blood lead levels are identified in children, \"Such services would include both case management services and the one-time investigation to determine the source of lead,\" The MCO is responsible for the primary environmental lead investigation for children when elevated blood levels suggest a need for such an investigation. This investigation, which is commonly called a \"lead inspection,\" involves the use of x-ray fluorescence (XRF) machines in the home which have the ability to identify lead-based paint. If the lead inspection does not reveal the presence of lead paint in the home, there may be a need for other testing, such as \"risk assessments\" involving water and soil sampling or inspections of sites other than the primary residence if the child spends a substantial amount of time in another location, The MCO is not responsible for either the \"risk assessments\" or the lead inspection at the secondary site, The Department of Health should be contacted when these services are indicated. TDH has a federal grant which can be used to purchase such services when either or both are deemed necessary by health department staff, as long as funds are available. The assessments are done by certified inspectors in the Department of Environment and COIlservation, MCO reimbursement for the primary environmental investigations is limited to the items specified in Part 5 of the State Medicaid ManuaL These items include the health professional's time and activities during the on-site investigation of the child's primary residence, They do not include testing of environmental substances such as water, paint, or soiL II, Such other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described in 42 USC 1396d(a) to correct, ameliorate or prevent from worsening defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the State plan, 2-3,16.2 42 CFR 441.56(b) defines \"screening\" as \"periodic comprehensive child health assessments\" meaning \"regularly scheduled examinations and evaluations of the general physical and mental health, growth, development, and nutritional status of 37 Amendment 1 (continued) infants, children, and youth.\" At a minimum, screenings must include, but are not limited to: 1. Comprehensive health and developmental history; 2. Comprehensive unclothed physical examination; 3. Appropriate Immunizations; 4. Appropriate vision and hearing testing; 5. Appropriate laboratory tests; and 6. Dental screening services fumished by direct referral to a dentist for children no later than 3 years of age and should be referred earlier as needed (as early as 6 to 12 months in accordance with the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) guidelines) and as otherwise appropriate; and 7.

The purpose of these requirements is to ensure access and availability to specialists for non-dual Medicare/Medicaid eligibles while recognizing the actual disbursement and number of specialty resources available within the state. A provider is considered a \"specialist\" if he/she has a provider agreement with the MCO to provide specialty services to enrollees. Access to Specialty Care Contractors shall ensure access to specialists for the provision of covered services. This requirement shall be satisfied through the execution and maintenance of at least one provider agreement for the provision of each of the following types of specialist services in the area specified. This requirement ensures that TennCare enrollees in all MCOs will be able to access specialists within the community in which they reside or as close to it as feasible, while recognizing the constraints introduced by the limited availability of specialists in some areas. The geographic areas, or \"focal points\" where contracts are required include Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Madison, Maury, Putnam and Cumberland (Either one), Shelby, and Sullivan and Washington (Either one) counties, either because these are population centers or there is a major medical center located in the area. If MCOs establish contracts for the provision of specialty services in each of these eight focal points all TennCare enrollees will have access to specialists within a maximum travel distance of 90 miles, and the majority will have access to specialists within 60-miles. Contracts are required in these specific areas in recognition oftraditional specialty referral patterns. The areas in which MCOs are required to establish contracts are indicated in the chart below by Grand Region. Based on these requirements, an MCO serving the East Grand Region would be required to have at least three Cardiologists in its network (one in Hamilton, One in Knox, and one in Sullivan or Washington counties). Shelby Putnam/Cumberland Knox Maury Sullivan/Washington Otolaryngology Madison Davidson Hamilton Shelby Madison Davidson Hamilton Shelby Putnam/Cumberland' 96 Amendment I (continued) Neurosurgery Shelby Davidson Hamilton Knox Not Applicable to Not Applicable to Madison Putnam/Cumberland and Not Applicable to OncologylHemato Madison Davidson Hamilton logy Shelby Putnam/Cumberland* Hamilton Shelby Putnam/Cumberland Hamilton Shelby Putnam/Cumberland Knox Maury* Sullivan/Washington Availability of Specialty Care Contractors shall provide adequate numbers of specialists for the provision of covered services to ensure adequate provider availability. To account for variances in MCO enrollment size, the guidelines described in this section have been established for determining how many of each type of specialist an MCO must have. These are aggregate guidelines and are not age specific. To determine these guidelines the number of providers within each of the focal points in each Grand Region was compared to the size of the population in each Grand Region. The \"area\" being served includes the population of surrounding counties. The chart below provides the mapping of counties to focal points. MCOs must comply with the following guidelines: MCOs must have at least one provider agreement with each specialist in each required area; and, MCOs must have a sufficient number of provider agreements to ensure that the number of enrollees per provider does not exceed the following: 97 Amendment 1 (continued) Maximum Number of Non-Dual Enrollees per Provider by Specialty and Focal Point g Ol ~ g ~ .... .. 2 a ~ :::l :::l E '0 (f) (f) Q) g ~ .... ;;!;>. :::l ~ ;:; \" .... ~ Q) .... c5 Region 0 z 0 0 EAST 19,000 45.000 29,500 40,000 53,500 21,500 14,500 75,500 43,500 22,000 17,500 108,500 33,500 WEST 18,800 26,000 29,500 27,000 27,000 15,500 12,000 85,000 23,000 Monitoring TennCare will monitor MCO compliance with specialist network standards on an on-going basis. Data from the monthly provider file will be used to verify compliance with the specialty network requirements. This file will serve as the source for confirming the MCO has a sufficient number and distribution of specialists and for calculating enrollee to provider ratios. TennCare will also phone providers listed on this file periodically to confirm that the provider is under contract to provide specialty services as reported by the MCO. Appeals data will also be monitored for indications that problems exist with access to specialists, and corrective action plans will be required when appropriate. 98 Amendment 1 (continued) ATTACHMENT IX -THIS ATTACHMENT LEFT BLANK INTENTIONALLY 99 Amendment 1 (continued) ATTACHMENTXI -COSTSHARINGSCHEDULES 100 Amendment I (continued) ATTACHMENT XI Cost-Sharing Schednles 1.

The CONTRACTOR shall not cover transplants or procedures, which are not medically necessary or performed for a purpose inconsistent with acceptable modes of treatment. Besides the minimally required transplants, the CONTRACTOR may cover other transplants that are not considered investigational or experimental by the National Institutes of Health and the Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration, if approved by TennCare. For purposes of this Section, investigational or experimental shall mean those transplants and/or procedures which are not considered medically necessary and which have not been approved by the Heal~h Care Financing Administration and published in the Federal Register. Questions as to whether a particular transplant and/or procedure is to be covered shall be directed to the Office of the Medical Director, Bureau of TENNCARE. -22-Exceptions to the above list of transplants must be made for other non-investigationaVnon-experimental transplants if the transplant and/or procedure is found to be medically necessary, performed within the accepted mode of treatment for which it is intended, and is found to be cost effective as determined by the CONTRACTOR. The CONTRACTOR shall establish administrative procedures regarding the necessity of prior approval before a transplant procedure is performed. The CONTRACTOR shall also establish its own administrative procedures regarding the coverage of transplant procedures performed outside the CONTRACTOR's service area as well as transplant procedures performed out-of-state. These administrative procedures shall be submitted to TennCare for review and approval prior to use. Section 1862 of the Social Security Act requires Medicare beneficiaries to have transplants performed in Medicare certified centers. In accordance with this policy, the CONTRACTOR and MedicarefTennCare dually eligible enrollees shall be required to adhere to these requirements. 2-3.13 Use of a Drug Formulary The CONTRACTOR shall be required to cover pharmacy services as a benefit pursuant to this Agreement and the TennCare rules and regulations for those eligible populations as described by TENNCARE. This coverage may be accomplished by the use of an open formulary (whereby all drugs are covered) or by use of a closed formulary (whereby only designated drugs are covered). If coverage is pursuant to a closed formulary, the formulary and any subsequent additions or deletions to the formulary must be prior approved by the TennCare Pharmacy Director. Approval of a closed formulary will not be granted if it is determined that the formulary is too restrictive or fails to provide for medically necessary drugs. Formularies, whether open or closed, shall not include DESI, LTE or IRS drugs. Approval or disapproval of formularies and subsequent additions and deletions thereto shaU be made in accordance with TennCare policy and procedures. The CONTRACTOR shaU adhere to the foUowing provisions: a. When medically necessary TennCare covered pharmacy benefits have been received during a period that an enrollee or provider could not have reasonably known what MCO the enrollee was in, the MCO shall not deny medically necessary pharmacy benefits for lack of prior authorization or as non-covered benefits when the medicaUy necessary pharmacy benefits would be considered TennCare covered benefits except for the fact that they are not included on the CONTRACTOR's closed drug formulary. b. If coverage is pursuant to a closed formulary, an up-to-date copy of the complete formulary and a complete description of prior authorization criteria for each drug requiring prior authorization must be submitted via an electronic file to the TennCare Pharmacy Director in a format specified by the TennCare Pharmacy Director by January I of each year. TENNCARE shall provide the format for this file no later than November I of each year. c. Authorization of drugs, including prior approvals of formulary drugs and medical necessity reviews of non\u00ad formulary drugs, or denial of authorization of drugs shall be rendered by the CONTRACTOR or its subcontractor on the day of the formal request for authorization. If a CONTRACTOR or its subcontractor is unable to respond to a prior approval or medical necessity review request on the day of the request or if the prescriber is unavailable, the CONTRACTOR must provide a two (2) week supply of the prescribed medication, provided that: (I) The medication is not classified by the Food and Drug Administration as Less Than Effective (Le., a DESI, LTE or IRS drug), or (2) The medication is not a drug in a non-covered TENNCARE therapeutic category (e.g., appetite suppressants, drugs to treat infertility), or (3) Use of the medication is not contraindicated because of the patient's medical condition or possible adverse drug interaction, or (4) If the patient is not already taking the medication, use of the medication for a two (2) week period possibly foUowed by abrupt discontinuance of the drug would not be medicaUy contraindicated, or -23 -(5) The prescriber did not prescribe a total quantity less than a two (2) week supply, in which case the phannacist must provide a supply up to the amount prescribed, or (6) Provision of the two (2) week supply would not violate state or federal Controlled Substances laws. In some circumstances it is not feasible for the phannacist to dispense a two (2) week supply because the drug is packaged by the manufacturer to be sold as the original unit or because the usual and customary phannacy practice would be to dispense the drug in the original packaging. Examples would include but not be limited to inhalers, eye drops, ear drops, injections, topicals (creams, ointments, sprays), drugs packaged in special dispensers (birth control pills; steroid dose packs), and drugs that require reconstitution before dispensing (antibiotic powder for oral suspension). When a coverage of a two (2) week supply of a prescription would otherwise be required and when, as described above, it is not feasible for the phannacist to dispense a two (2) week supply, it shall be the responsibility of the MCO to provide coverage for the amount prescribed. Failure to provide a two (2) week supply of the prescribed medication as described above shall result in liquidated damages as described in Section 6-8 of this Agreement. d. Comply with the requirements of the TennCare Drug Fonnulary Accountability Act. e. MCOs shall not deny or withhold payment to any phannacy for duplicate prescription refills, or prescriptions that are filled early in relation to the prior day's supply dispensed, where such refills are for the purpose of replacing an enrollee's lost or destroyed medication or providing an enrollee with the quantity of medication necessary for extended travel away from the community in which the enrollee resides, or for any other bona fide reason that causes the enrollee to be without a medication, when the discontinuation of the medicine would, in the phannacist's professional judgment, place the enrollee at risk of hann. Provision of such duplicate prescription refills or early refills shall comply with applicable state and federal Controlled Substances laws and other state phannacy laws and regulations. f. MCOs that impose a limit on the number of units of a medication that an enrollee can obtain per month without a medical necessity override shall have policies and procedures that pennit the prescribing physician to request a medical necessity override upon submission of medical justification and that also pennit a phannacist to request an override to allow early dispensing, when in the phannacist's professional judgment, the enrollee is not abusing the medication and needs early dispensing of the medication due to lack of readily accessible transportation. 2-3.14 Emergency Medical Services The CONTRACTOR must review and approve or disapprove claims for emergency medical services based on the definition of emergency medical services specified in Section 1-3 of this Agreement. The CONTRACTOR shall provide coverage for inpatient and outpatient services, furnished by a qualified provider, regardless of whether the enrollee obtains the services from a network provider, that are needed to evaluate or stabilize an emergency medical condition that is found to exist using the prudent layperson standard without prior authorization in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.113. Once the individual's condition is stabilized, the CONTRACTOR shall require notification or apply applicable utilization management processes specified in Section 2-7.1 for hospital admission or follow-up care. The CONTRACTOR shall base coverage decisions for emergency medical services on the severity of the symptoms at the time of presentation and shall cover emergency medical services where the presenting symptoms are of sufficient severity to constitute an emergency medical condition in the judgment ofa prudent layperson. The CONTRACTOR shall impose no restrictions on coverage of emergency medical services more restrictive than those permitted by the prudent layperson standard. If an emergency screening examination leads to a clinical determination by the examining physician that an actual emergency medical condition exists, the CONTRACTOR shall pay for both the services involved in the screening examination and the services required to stabilize the patient. The CONTRACTOR shall be required to pay for all emergency medical services. which are medically necessary until the clinical emergency is stabilized. This includes all medical services that may be necessary to assure, within reasonable medical probability, that no material deterioration of the patient's condition is likely to result from, or occur during, discharge of the patient or transfer of -24 -the patient to another facility. If there is a disagreement between the hospital and the CONTRACTOR concerning whether the patient is stable enough for discharge or transfer, or whether the medical benefits of an unstabilized transfer outweigh the' risks, the judgment of the attending physician(s) actually caring for the patient at the treating facility prevails and is binding on the CONTRACTOR. The CONTRACTOR, however, may establish arrangements with a hospital whereby the CONTRACTOR may send one of its own physicians with appropriate emergency room privileges to assume the attending physician's responsibilities to stabilize, treat, and transfer the patient, provided that such arrangement does not delay the provision of emergency medical services. The CONTRACTOR shall not retroactively deny a claim for an emergency screening examination because the condition, which appeared to be an emergency medical condition under the prudent layperson standard, turned out to be non-emergency in nature. If an emergency screening examination leads to a clinical determination by the examining physician that an actual emergency medical condition does not exist, then the determining factor for payment liability shall be whether the patient had acute symptoms of sufficient severity at the time of presentation. In such cases, the CONTRACTOR shall review the presenting symptoms of the patient and shall pay for all services involved in the screening examination where the presenting symptoms (including severe pain) were of sufficient severity to have warranted emergency attention under the prudent layperson standard regardless of final diagnosis. When the patient's primary care provider instructs the patient to seek emergency care, the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for payment for the medical screening examination and for other medically necessary emergency medical services, without regard to whether the patient meets the prudent layperson standard. 2-3.15 Prenatal Care The CONTRACTOR shall have policies and procedures to facilitate and take reasonable steps to assist pregnant members in accessing prenatal care. This provision shall apply to enrollees in the plan who become pregnant as well as enrollees who are pregnant on the beginning date of enrollment in the plan. This provision does not intend to require all of the CONTRACTOR's networkprbviders to accept new enrollees. However,the CONTRACTOR shall maintain a provider network consisting of providers who accept new enrollees in accordance with TennCare access standards and shall inform TENNCARE, as required, of network providers who do not accept new enrollees. In the event an enrollee entering the CONTRACTOR's plan is receiving medically necessary prenatal care, services the day before enrollment, the CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the costs of continuation of such medically necessary services, without any form of prior approval and without regard to whether such services are being provided within or outside the CONTRACTOR's provider network until such time as the CONTRACTOR can reasonably transfer the enrollee to a service and/or network provider without impeding service delivery that might be harmful to the enrollee's health. The CONTRACTOR shall require, as a condition of payment, that the service provider accept the amount paid by the CONTRACTOR or appropriate denial made by the CONTRACTOR (or, if applicable, payment by the CONTRACTOR that is supplementary to the enrollee's third party payor) plus any applicable amount of cost sharing responsibilities due from the enrollee as payment in full for the service The CONTRACTOR shall provide medically necessary medical care to their enrollees beginning on the date of their enrollment in the MCO's plan. This requirement includes not only TennCare enrollees whose eligibility is established through SSI, Medicaid or uninsured/uninsurable applications for TennCare, but also those pregnant women who establish \"presumptive eligibility\" for TennCare. Effective. with the first day of a presumptive eligibility period, the State makes payments on behalf of these women to the selected MCO and the MCO is required to provide medical care for their enrollee during this period. Women who are presumptively eligible are entitled to all TennCare benefits. There shall be a sufficient number of providers in the MCO's network who accept enrollees within each geographical location in which the plan is marketed so that prenatal or other medically necessary medical care is not delayed or denied to these women during their presumptive eligibility period. Additionally, the MCO must make services available out-of-plan, if necessary, to meet the medical needs of a woman enrolled in the MCO's plan as a presumptive eligible. The CONTRACTOR shall notify all network providers that any unreasonable delay in providing care to a pregnant member seeking prenatal care will be considered a material breach of the network provider's contract with the CONTRACTOR. Delay in care for pregnant enrollees shall mean: -25 -\u00b7 I. Failure of the MCO to respond to an enrollee's request for prenatal care by identifying a maternity care provider to honor a request from an enrollee, including a presumptive eligible enrollee, (or from a primary care provider or patient advocate acting on behalf of an enrollee) for a prenatal care appointment. Accessibility shall be in accordance with the Terms and Conditions for Access to the TennCare Waiver and contained herein as Attachment III unless TENNCARE shall specify more stringent access criteria. Regardless of whether prenatal care is provided by a primary care physician, physician extender or an obstetrician who is not the enrollee's primary care physician, the access standards for primary care physician or extender services shall apply when determining access to prenatal care except for cases of a first prenatal care appointment for women who are past their first trimester of pregnancy on the day they are determined to be eligible. For women who are past their flfSt trimester of pregnancy on the day they are determined to be eligible, a flfSt prenatal care appointment shall occur within fifteen (15) days of the day they are determined to be eligible; or 2. Failure of a pharmacist within the MCO's provider network to fill a prescription written by a maternity care provider for an enrollee, including an approved presumptive eligible, within the specified time frames for all medically necessary requests as described elsewhere in this Agreement and/or the TennCare rules and regulations. The CONTRACTOR shall maintain a prenatal care program for high risk maternity cases designed to increase the likelihood of positive birth outcomes. Failure to provide prenatal care in accordance with the provisions described herein shall result in the CONTRACTOR being required to implement a corrective action plan as described in Section 2-16, and shall result in the application of liquidated damages and/or intermediate sanctions as described in Section 6.8 of this Agreement. 2-4 Service Delivery Requirements The CONTRACTOR shall administer the benefits specified in this Agreement in accordance with the provisions specified below. 2-4.1 Availability and Accessibility of Services The CONTRACTOR must provide or arrange for the provision of all of the services described as covered in this Agreement.

The CONTRACTOR shall maintain under contract, a provider network including but not limited to primary care physicians, specialist physicians, nurse practitioners/physician assistants, hospitals (all levels primary, secondary and tertiary), centers of excellence, nursing homes, laboratories, pharmacies and all other health care facilities necessary to provide TennCare covered benefits. 2-4.1.1 Primary Care Services The CONTRACTOR shall assure that there are primary care providers, willing and able to provide the level of care and range of services necessary to meet the medical needs of the enrollees including those with chronic and acute diseases. There shall be a sufficient number of primary care providers who accept new TennCare enrollees within each geographical location in which the plan is marketed so that each primary care provider has a reasonable case load. Primary care providers shall be strategically located so that no enrollee shall be required to travel more than thirty (30) miles or thirty (30) minutes one-way, whichever is less, to a primary care provider. If an enrollee requests assignment to a primary care provider located outside the distance/time requirements and the CONTRACTOR has primary care providers available within the distance/time requirements who accept new enrollees, it shall not be considered a violation of the access -26 -requirements for the CONTRACTOR to grant the enrollee's request. However, in such cases the CONTRACTOR shall have no responsibility for providing transportation for the enrollee to access care from this selected provider and the CONTRACTOR shall so notifY the enrollee in writing as to whether or not the CONTRACTOR will provide transportation for the enrollee to seek care from the requested provider. In these cases of out-of-area assignment, the CONTRACTOR must allow the enrollee to change assignment to a primary care provider within the distance/time requirements if the enrollee requests such a change. 2-4.1.2 Specialty Services The CONTRACTOR shall demonstrate sufficient availability and accessibility to Specialty Services for TennCare enrollees (Specialty Services includes Essential Hospital Services, services provided by Centers of Excellence, and specialty physician services). Sufficient availability and accessibility will be defined as meeting or exceeding the Terms and Conditions of the TennCare waiver as described in Attachment III. The CONTRACTOR shall also comply with the standards and measures specified in this section to demonstrate sufficient availability and accessibility of Specialty Services for TennCare enrollees. TENNCARE shall take geography, the usual and customary practices, and timely access to quality care into account when reviewing the CONTRACTOR's Specialty Services network. If TENNCARE or the CONTRACTOR identifies a deficiency in the Specialty Services network, the CONTRACTOR shall develop a corrective action plan to address the deficiency and an explanation of how TennCare members will receive access to such services while the network deficiency exists. If the CONTRACTOR fails to correct the deficiency in a timely manner, TENNCARE may impose intermediate sanctions as described in Section 6.S. a. Essential Hospital Services. The CONTRACTOR shall demonstrate sufficient access to Essential Hospital Services, including but not limited to: (I) neonatal services (2) perinatal services (3) pediatric (4) trauma (5) bum b.

To demonstrate sufficient availability and accessibility of Specialty Physician services, the CONTRACTOR shall submit the monthly provider file of contracted providers as required by Attachment XII, Exhibit C and, within sixty (60) days of Agreement execution, and by September 1 thereafter each year submit the \"Specialty Physician Services Chart\" as required by Attachment XII, Exhibit E for each of the CSAs in which it operates for TennCare. This Specialty Physician Services chart should indicate all non-contractual arrangements that the CONTRACTOR has with Specialty Physicians in each CSA. TENNCARE expects that the CONTRACTOR will make best efforts to contract with providers to whom the CONTRACTOR routinely refers enrollees. In order to satisfy time/distance travel requirements and support community referral patterns, the CONTRACTOR shall establish provider agreements with each of the nine physician specialists identified in (3) above in each area designated by TennCare as a focal point for specialist services in the CONTRACTOR's service area within ninety (90) days of Agreement execution, as specified in Attachment IV. A sufficient number of provider agreements shall be established in each focal point to ensure that non\u00ad dual MedicarelMedicaid enrollee to provider ratios remain below the maximum allowable ratios for each area as defined ill Attachment IV. In addition to establishing provider agreements in each of the required focal points, the CONTRACTOR agrees to pursue network development efforts in each priority area identified in Attachment IV with the understanding that twelve (12) months after the effective date of this Agreement, TennCare may designate priority areas as additional required contract areas. TENNCARE will review the \"Specialty Physician Services Chart\" in conjunction with the monthly provider files submitted by the CONTRACTOR and other information regarding complaints or appeals for specialty services to determine whether or not the CONTRACTOR's Specialty Services network and out\u00ad of-network arrangements are sufficient to demonstrate timely availability and accessibility of quality care. If TENNCARE or the CONTRACTOR identifies a deficiency in the Specialty Services network, the CONTRACTOR shall develop a corrective action plan to address the deficiency and an explanation of how TennCare members will receive access to such services while the network deficiency exists. If the CONTRACTOR fails to correct the deficiency in a timely manner, TENNCARE may impose intermediate sanctions as described in Section 6-8, unless the CONTRACTOR provides sufficient documentation to demonstrate that the deficiency is attributable to a lack of specialty physician supply in the area. TENNCARE shall not request that the CONTRACTOR submit the \"Specialty Physician Services Chart\" more frequently than annually unless TENNCARE has reason to believe that the CONTRACTOR's physician specialty network has significantly changed or that the CONTRACTOR does not have sufficient availability or accessibility of such specialty service in such CSA(s). 2-4.1.3 Emergency Medical Sel1'ices Emergency medical services shall be available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. -28 -2-4.2 Primary Care Providers The CONTRACTOR shall provide or arrange for the provision of primary care case management services to TennCare eligible enrollees.

TennCare eligible enrollees in groups 1 through 5 will be enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's plan, independent of other TennCare eligible enrollees .in the same household. c. To the extent possible, TENNCARE shall enroll all enrollees in Group 6 in the same household in the CONTRACTOR's plan. . d. The CONTRACTOR agrees to accept TennCare eligibles other than those identified above upon receipt of notification from TENNCARE. The CONTRACTOR agrees to accept an administrative fee of$I3.84 per member per month for the period July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2002 and $14.39 per member per month for the period July 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 for these enrollees. However, should the State elect to carve out a high\u00b7risk TennCare eligible group(s), the administrative fee(s) associated with the group(s) will be mutually agreed upon between the CONTRACTOR and the State prior to enrollment of this population in the CONTRACTOR's plan. e. The CONTRACTOR shall accept daily eligibility data from the State. f. The CONTRACTOR agrees to accept a reasonable number of enrollees who have been selected by the State for enrollment, from any failed health plan in the CONTRACTOR's service area as well as any plan which is terminated in whole or in part, may become insolvent or discontinues service, or who reside in an area in which there is insufficient capacity in risk MCOs to enroll the population. To the extent possible and practical, TENNCARE shall provide advance notice to the CONTRACTOR of the impending failure of one of the plans serving the area; however, failure by TENNCARE to provide advance notice shall not limit in any manner the responsibility of the CONTRACTOR to accept enrollees from failed risk MCOs. In the event the number of re\u00b7 assigned enrollees exceeds 100,000 and TENNCARE was unable to provide ninety (90) days advance notice to the CONTRACTOR, TENNCARE will afford the CONTRACTOR a 90\u00b7day period of time to adjust operational processes in order to meet the contractual performance requirements prior to assessing any penalties against the CONTRACTOR. TennCare and the \u00b784\u00b7 Contractor recognize that large increases and decreases in enrollment may be required by program needs. TENNCARE shall provide 120 days advance notice of any planned transfer of enrollees out of the Contractor's plan that would result in a decrease of 100,000 members or more. The preceding statement is not intended to provide advance notice of changes that occur during the course of an open enrollment period or that are due to an enrollee's choice. g. No enrollee from another health plan shall be transferred retroactively to the CONTRACTOR's plan, except as specified at 4-1.1.n. h. The CONTRACTOR shall accept the enrollee in the health condition the enrollee is in at the time of enrollment. i. With the exception of enrollees in Group 4, TENNCARE shall enroll only persons who reside within the community service area(s) in which the CONTRACTOR is authorized to serve. j. The CONTRACTOR shall continue to be responsible for the care of any enrollee enrolled in TennCare Select until such time as the enrollee selects or is assigned to a TENNCARE plan in the area where the enrollee has moved, or assigned to another TENNCARE product administered by the CONTRACTOR, or has been disenrolled from the MCO by TENNCARE and re-enrolled in a new MCO. TENNCARE shall continue administrative fee payments and medical service payments, in accordance with Section 5, to the CONTRACTOR on behalf of the enrollee until such time as the enrollee is enrolled in another MCO plan. The CONTRACTOR shall remain responsible for arranging for the provision of services and payment of medical services for the enrollee until such time as the enrollee is enrolled in another plan. TENNCARE shall notify the CONTRACTOR promptly upon enrollment of the enrollee in another plan. k. Enrollment shall begin at 12:01 a.m. on the effective date that the enrollee is enrolled in the CONTRACTOR's plan and shall end at 12:00 midnight on the slate that the enrollee is disenrolled pursuant to the criteria in TennCare policy and/or TennCare rules and regulations. Women who . are determined presumptively eligible are given immediate TennCare eligibility and a temporary identification form to confmn eligibility pending the issuance of a regular identification card by their selected MCO. The purpose of this temporary identification/eligibility confmnation form is to enable the women to access prenatal care at the earliest possible time. The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for arranging for the provision of services and payment of all covered services during the period of enrollment. 1. Enrollees selected for enrollment in the CONTRACTOR's plan by the State in Groups 1,2,3,5 and 6 shall have one (I) opportunity, anytime during the ninety (90) day period immediately following enrollment, to request to change MCO plans. Enrollees in Group 6 shall only be able to request to changeMCO plans during this period to the extent capacity is available in another MCO serving the region. Once the initial ninety-day change period has expired, the enrollee shall remain a member of the CONTRACTOR's plan until the following change period, or until the enrollee loses eligibility for TennCare. m. TennCare shall provide an opportunity for enrollees to choose a new MCO during an annual choice period that shall be determined by TENNCARE. The effective date of any changes resulting from said choice period shall be January 1 of the following year, unless otherwise specified by TENNCARE. TENNCARE shall notify the CONTRACTOR of timeframes for authorized choice periods. n. It is the intent and policy of TENNCARE that TennCare-eligible newborn children and their TennCare eligible mothers, be enrolled in the same MCO. This policy is only applicable to Group 6 enrollees. Enrollment of the newborn child in the same plan as its Mother facilitates coverage and payment of the costs associated with delivery, facilitates coverage and payment of the newborn services provided after birth of the child but prior to establishment of individual TennCare eligibility for the child and provides a financial incentive to the CONTRACTOR to -85 -promote prenatal care as a means to reduce the risks of a complicated and more costly pregnancy andlor delivery. It is recognized by TENNCARE and the CONTRACTOR that despite the best efforts of TENNCARE to assure emollment of a newborn in the same plan as its Mother, due to the various means of emollment in the TennCare program, a newborn child may be inadvertently emolled in a plan different than its Mother. When such cases are identified by the CONTRACTOR, the CONTRACTOR shall immediately report to TENNCARE, in accordance with written procedures provided by TENNCARE, that a newborn child has been incorrectly emolled in a plan different than its Mother. Upon receipt of such notice from a CONTRACTOR or discovery by TENNCARE that a newboll} has been incorrectly emolled in a plan different than its Mother, TENNCARE shall immediately: (I) Disemoll the newborn from the incorrect plan; (2) Recoup any payments made to the CONTRACTOR for the newborn; (3) Emoll the newborn in the same plan as its Mother with the same effective date as when the newborn child was emolled in the incorrect plan; and (4) Make payments to the correct plan for the period of coverage. The plan in which the newborn child is correctly emolled shall be responsible for the coverage and payment of TennCare-covered services provided to the newborn child for the full period of eligibility. The plan in which the newborn child was incorrectly emolled shall have no liability for the coverage or payment of any TennCare-covered services provided, except as described below, during the period of incorrect plan assignment and TENNCARE shall have no liability for payments to the CONTRACTOR in these cases.

The CONTRACTOR shall be required to process claims received for services provided to newborn children within the time frames specified in Section 2-9.7 of this Agreement. The CONTRACTOR shall not utilize any blanket policy which results in the automatic denial of claims for services provided to a TennCare-eligible newborn child; during any period of emollment in the CONTRACTOR's plan, because the child's Mother is not a member of the CONTRACTOR's plan. However, it is recognized that in complying with the claims processing time frames specified in Section 2-9.7 of this Agreement, the CONTRACTOR may make payment for services provided to a TennCare-eligible newborn child emolled in the CONTRACTOR's plan at the time of payment but the child's eligibility may subsequently be moved to another contractor's plan. In such event, the CONTRACTOR in which the newborn child is first emolled (first plan) may submit supporting documentation to the contractor's plan in which the newborn child is moved (second plan) and the second plan shall reimburse the first plan within thirty (30) days of receipt of such properly documented request for reimbursement, for the amount expended on behalf of the child prior to the child's eligibility having been moved to the second plan. Such reimbursement shall be the actual amount expended by the CONTRACTOR and shall be used to reduce the amount of funds requested from the State in the weekly remittance request. In the event the CONTRACTOR is the second plan (Le. the plan to which the newborn child is moved), should the CONTRACTOR fail to reimburse the first plan the actual amount expended on behalf of the newborn child within thirty (30) days of receipt of a properly documented request for payment, TENNCARE is authorized to reimburse the first plan. o.

QCM-16 SECTION II CLINICAL AND HEALTH SERVICES DELIVERY AREAS OF CONCERN, QUALITY INDICATORS, AND CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IN TENNCARE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS I. INTRODUCTION The section entitled \"GUIDELINES FOR INTERNAL QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAMS OF MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS CONTRACTING WITH THE TENNESSEE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN\" (the Guidelines) describes the activities which TennCare requires as standards for internal quality assurance programs (QMPs). The Guidelines, in part, call for coordinated care organizations to implement a systematic process of quality assessment and improvement by which the care delivered to enrollees is monitored, evaluated, and continually improved. The Guidelines further require that coordinated care organizations conduct quality of care studies which: A. target specific clinical conditions (e.g., pregnancy), andlor specific health services delivery issues (e.g., access to care) for focused monitoring and evaluation; B. use clinical care standards/practice guidelines to objectively evaluate the care the organization delivers (or fails to deliver) for the targeted clinical conditions and health services delivery issues; and C. use quality indicators derived from the clinical care standards/practice guidelines to screen and monitor care and services delivered. This section provides further clarification as to how these three activities shall be implemented by managed care organizations in order to comply. with the Guidelines for internal QMPs. II. QUALITY OF CARE STUDIES A managed care organi~ation cannot monitor the care delivered to every enrollee each time he or she requires health care. Such an attempt would be beyond the organization's and State and Federal resources. As an alternative, the managed care organization shall select certain aspects of care to monitor over a specified time period. Over subsequent time periods, monitoring will be repeated in that area to detect patterns of care over time, and new areas will be selected for initial study. Such monitoring takes place through focused quality of care studies. Focused quality of care studies are detailed investigations of certain aspects of health care services which are designed to answer defmed questions about the quality and appropriateness of care and point the way to how that care can be improved. Such focused studies are superior to random or unfocused record reviews because they provide information about care in the aggregate as opposed to information about the care received by a limited number of enrollees. A focused study may be cOI1ducted by reviewing medical records, by reviewing claims or other administrative data, by conducting special surveys, or other mechanisms. Whatever the source of information, all well designed studies have the following components: A. A clearly defined study question which focuses on relevant areas of concern in health care. Quality of care studies may be small and narrowly focused (e.g., \"When are pregnant enrollees receiving their first prenatal care visits?\"), or large and more complex (e.g., \"What prenatal care factors are associated with enrollees delivering low birth weight babies?\"). The clinical areas selected for study should reflect the coordinated care organization's enrollment in ierms of demographic characteristics and the prevalence or risk of disease, and reflect the potential consequence of the (risk of) disease. QCM-17 B. Well defmed items (clinical indicators) to be monitored and evaluated to help answer the question. C. A standard or standards against which the organizatioll compares itself. D. A method for analyzing the results to indicate ways in which the organization can improve the care it delivers to enrollees. III. CLINICAL AND HEALTH SERVICES DELIVERY AREAS OF CONCERN: Item II. A. in the \"Guidelines for Internal Quality Monitoring Programs of Managed Care Organizations Contracting with TennCare\", states in part: \"The QMP has written guidelines for its quality of care studies ... which shall include: I. Specification of clinical or health services delivery area to be monitored - a. The monitoring and evaluation of care reflects the population served by the managed care organization in terms of age groups, disease categories, and special risk status. b. For the TennCare population, the QMP monitors and evaluates, at a minimum, care and services in certain priority areas of concern selected by the State. These may be taken from among those identified by HCFA's Medicaid Bureau, or other sources as deemed necessary by TelUlCare.\" A review of the literature and discussion with health authorities pertammg to the prevalence and significance of health concerns has lead to the identification of the following priority clinical and health services delivery areas of concern. With the exception of the identification of pregnancy, childhood immunizations, and continuity of care, as required for continuous monitoring and evaluation by managed care plans, the areas listed below are not listed in any order of priority. Clinical areas of concern: 1. Childhood Inununizations (Required continual monitoring with yearly reported) 2. Pregnancy (Required continual monitoring with yearly reporting) 3. Breast CancerlMammography 4. Cervical CanceriPap Smears 5. Lead Toxicity 6. Comprehensive Well Child Periodic Health Assessment 7. HIV Status S. Asthma 9. Hysterectomies 10. Diabetes II. ETOH and Other Substance Abuse 12. Hypertension QCM-IS .. i 13. Sexually Transmitted Diseases 14. Heritable Diseases (Newborn screens) 15. Coronary Artery Disease 16. Motor Vehicle Accidents 17. Pregnancy prevention 18. Tuberculosis 19. Sickle Cell Anemia 20. Failure to Thrive 21. Hepatitis B 22. Otitis Media 23. Mental Health 24. Prescription Drug Abuse 25. Hip Fractures 26. Cholesterol Screening and Management 27. Treatment of Myocardial Infarctions 28. Prevention ofInfluenza 29. Smoking Prevention and Cessation 30. Medical Problems of the Frail Elderly; e.g., incontinence and confusion 31. Hearing and Vision Screening and Services for Individuals less than 21 Years of Age 32. Dental Screening and Services for Individuals less than 21 Years of Age and over 21 Years of Age Health Services Delivery Areas of Concern: 1. Continuity/Coordination of Care (Required continual monitoring with quarterly reporting) 2. Access to Care 3. Utilization of Services 4. Health Education 5. Em.ergency Services Two of the clinical areas of concern (childhood immunizations and pregnancy) and one of the health services delivery areas of concern (continuity/coordination of care) are required for continuous evaluation and study if applicable to the patient population. (enrollee Groups 3, 4, and 5 will not be considered applicable populations for the purpose of these studies). In addition, it is required that plans select on a QCM-19 quarterly basis, at least one additional area of concern to study. This may be a follow-up of a previously performed evaluation or a new study. Areas of concern may come from the above noted list, or at the discretion of the organization, from another source. In addition, the organization will perform such studies as the State may direct. Effective July I, 200 I, all MCOs are required to begin a continuous evaluation and study of access to EPSDT services for individuals less than twenty-one (21) years of age. A copy of the study design shall be submitted to TENNCARE for review and approval within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Agreement. IV. CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES/STANDARDS: The identification of areas needing improvement and the creation of a baseline for future assessment necessitates specifying goals or standards for health services to which care actually delivered can be compared. Item 11. C. in the Guidelines states, in part, that: a. The QMP studies and other activities monitor quality of care against clinical care or health services delivery standards or practice guidelines specified for each clinical Or health services delivery area identified in II. A., above ... \". Clinical care standards, practice guidelines, practice options and practice advisories are all types of Itpractice parameters\". Practice parameters are recommendations or an agreed upon set of principles for the delivery of certain types or aspects of health care. They are promulgated by authoritative bodies such as professional associations or ad-hoc lIexpert committees!!, Because professional judgement may often vary, there can frequently be more than one set of practice parameters addressing the same topic. However, the vast majority of medical professional organizations endorse the use of practice parameters in improving the quality of medical care. For this reason, the Guidelines recommend monitoring quality of care using clinical care standards or practice guidelines for each clinical or health services delivery area selected by the organization or State for study. For the Federally recommended clinical areas of pregnancy and childhood immunizations, commonly accepted sources of guidelines are: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Public Health Service (PHS), and The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) For other clinical or health services delivery areas to be studied by the managed care organization as part of its agreement with TennCare, the coordinated care organization andTennCare shall agree upon the clinical practice standards or practice guidelines which are to be utilized by the organization in its evaluation of care. If TennCare wishes a coordinated care organization to evaluate care in an area in which the organization has not already adopted a set of practice guidelines, the organization and TennCare will agree upon usage of existing clinical practice standards/practice guidelines based upon those already developed by authoritative bodies. V. QUALITY INDICATORS: In conducting quality of care studies, the organization assesses care through the use of objective indicators. Quality indicators are measurable variables relating to a specified clinical or health services delivery area, which are reviewed over a period of time to screen delivered health care and/or to monitor the process or outcome of care delivered in that clinical area. Item II. B. of the Guidelines states: a. The organization identifies and uses quality indicators that are objective, measurable, and based on current knowledge and clinical experience. QCM-20 b. For the priority areas selected by the State from HCFA Medicaid Bureau's list of priority clinical and health services delivery areas of concern, or other sources as deemed necessary by the State, the organization shall monitor and evaluate quality of care through studies which include, but are not limited to, the quality indicators also specified by HCFA's Medicaid Bureau or the State.\" TennCare and the managed care organization shall mutually determine clinical indicators to be monitored for each clinical or health services delivery area of concern. Because of their importance, childhood immunization indicators, pregnancy indicators, and continuity/coordination of care indicators shall be monitored by the organization on a continuous basis (as opposed to on a one time basis) and periodically (annually for immunization and pregnancy and quarterly for continuity/coordination of care) reported to TennCare. At its own discretion or as directed by TennCare, the organization should identify, based on clinical practice guidelines described above, additional clinical indicators to be monitored for the additionally selected clinical conditions. In addition, TennCare shall use individual encounter\u00b7 data and other required reports to monitor performance on an on-going basis. Examples of the types of indicators TennCare will review related to the priority areas selected by the State (childhood immunizations, pregnancy and continuity of care) are noted below. A. CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS Clinical Indicators: For TennC.re enrollees aged two, the annual immunization rates for polio (OPV), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DPT), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), haemophilus influenza B (HIB), and hepatitis B (HBV). The Methodology for Monitoring and Reporting Indicators: I. Identify all TennCare enrollees who were or attained two years of age in the twelve month review period and who were enrolled in the plan for at least six consecutive months of the 12 month review period. Report this number: ___ and the dates of the 12 month review period: from ___ to 2. Randomly sample and review the medical records or other immunization data source of the organization for at least one hundred of the above enrollees. For each enrollee, record the presence or absence of the full complement of required doses for each of the above immunizations according to the American Academy of Pediatrics or U.S. Center for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' standards for immunizations prior to age two. 3. For each of the above immunizations, calculate the organization's rate of immunization as follows: Polio immunizations: Number of enrollees receiving all three doses: Number From plan: By out-of-plan provider: QCM-21 cause: __ _ Two attempts to contact: Other; i.e., lack of any or all immuniza- indications, failure to document; et.al.,: __ _ TOTAL n % * If an enrollee receives the three doses of the immunization from both Plan and out-of-plan provider(s)record it under the category which was most frequently used. Immunization rate for polio = xln where x equals the number of TennCare children in the sample immunized, either by plan or out-of-plan provider(s)and n equals sample size. Adjusted polio immunization rate = yIn where y equals the sum ofTennCare children in the sample immunized (i.e., the variable x above), plus TennCare children for whom there were two documented attempts to notify parents of need, documented refusal, or medical contraindications to immunizations. 4. Repeat the above steps for the required four OPT, one MMR, three or four HIB immunization doses, and three HBV immunizations. B. PREGNANCY Indicators and Methodology for Measuring Indicators: l. Identify all TennCare enrollees who delivered single or multiple live or stillborn fetus(es) of greater than or equal to 20 weeks gestation for the most recent 12 month reporting period. Report: a. The number of such enrollees: __ _ b. The number of fetuses of at least 20 weeks gestation delivered: __ _ c. The dates of the reporting period: from ___ to __ _ 2. Report the following infonnation for all such enrollees or a randomly selected sample of one hundred of these enrollees: a. The timing of the enrollee's enrollment in the organization with respect to each pregnancy: preconception first trimester second trimester third trimester QCM-22 b. The weeks of gestation on the date of the frrst prenatal care visit: . If date of delivery is date of frrst contact related to pregnancy, indicate as \"no prenatal care. II c. Number of prenatal care visits from and including the frrst prenatal care visit to and including the last visit prior to delivery: ___ . d. Pregnancy outcome: fetal loss (greater than or equal to 20 weeks) live birth e. Birth weight for each live birth: less than 500 Gms. 500 -1499 Gms. 1500 -2499 Gms. greater than or equal to 2500 Gms. C. CONTINUITY/COORDINATION OF CARE The organization shall report the total number of enrollees and the percentage of enrollees in each Grand Region enrolled more than 30 days that have not identified a primary care provider (PCP) on a quarterly basis to the Office of the Medical Director. Primary care providers shall include licensed physicians as well as registered professional nurses and physician assistants practicing in accordance with state law. Each patient should have an identified primary care provider. QCM-23 SECTION III GUIDELINES FOR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW OF RISK REIMBURSEMENT TENNCARE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS I. INTRODUCTION: Federal law (Section 1902(a)(30)(c) of the Social Security Act), requires entities which are external to and independent of the S tate and the coordinated care organization to perform, on an annual basis, a review of the quality of services furnished by each coordinated care contractor. Although this law specifies the types of entities which are allowed to perform this annual quality review, it does not prescribe how this quality review is to be conducted. This section specifies the scope of work for external quality review organization (EQRO) review of health care and services provided by managed care organizations to their TennCare enrollees. II. PURPOSE: The purpose of the external review function should be twofold: TO PROVIDE THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE DELIVERED TO TennCare RECIPIENTS ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE ORGANZIATIONS. TO RESOLVE IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS IN HEALTH CARE AND CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING THE CARE OF ALL TennCare RECIPIENTS ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. In order to accomplish these objectives, the information produced by the EQRO review should meet the following criteria: A. Information should accurately and reliably describe the care delivered to TennCare recipients. Information on quality of care obtained from the independent e.xternal review is a critical component of the TennCare Quality Improvement System (QIS) for coordinated care. If the QIS is to be effective in improving care, it must have accurate and reliable information upon which the State may take action to improve care. Therefore, reviews of care should be conducted in accordance with generally accepted principles of research design and statistical analysis in order to produce valid, reliable, and generalizable information. B. Information should have the largest possible impact on care. Because resources are finite, it is not possible to e.xamine every episode of illness or every encounter with a provider for every TennCare enrollee. Therefore, the external quality review should give priority attention to clinical conditions or health services delivery issues: which have highest prevalence or incidence; and for which appropriate care has the greatest potential for improving health outcomes. C. Information should clearly identify instances in which care can be improved and provide a baseline for future assessment to see if care has actually been improved. The identification of areas needing improvement and the creation of a baseline for future assessment requires the advance specification of goals or standards for health services to which care actually delivered can be compared. The external quality review should measure c,are delivered against objective measures of health care which have been agreed upon by the TennCare, the EQRO, and, to the extent possible. the managed care organizations. QCM-24 III. CONCEPTUAL APPROACH: External Quality Review should include three types of activities: I. focused studies of patterns of care; 2. individual case review in specific situations; and 3. follow-up activities on previous pattern of care study findings and individual case review findings. Each of these activities is described below. The appropriate roles of TennCare agencies, EQROs and coordinated care organizations in carrying out these activities are discussed in Section IV, !!Implementation\" . A. Focused Pattern of Care Studies Focused pattern of care studies are detailed investigations of certain aspects of care for specific clinical areas of interest <e.g., pregnancy, asthma, or immunizations), or\" for defmed aspects of health services delivery which cut across clinical areas (e.g., access to care, utilization of services, continuity/coordination of care, health education or emergency services). Focusedpattern of care studies contrast with random reviews of unrelated episodes or aspects of care. An example of a random review of unrelated episodes of care is: reviewing a subset or sample of the medical records of all enrollees to detect !!ill' problems in quality. Focused pattern of care studies are superior to random reviews, because they provide information about care in the aggregate as opposed to information on a limited number of cases. Information about care in the aggregate can be generalized to the care delivered at-large and thus can point the way to large scale change in care, as opposed to addressing quality on a case-by-case basis <as is done in random quality reviews). Effective focused studies should meet the following criteria: I. Selection of Study Topics -The clinical or health service delivery areas selected for study should reflect the distribution of health concerns within the TennCare population and should be of significant prevalence or incidence. Additionally, study topics should meet the following criteria: . a. There are objective criteria for assessing care in the clinical or health service delivery area to be monitored. These criteria should be derived from clinical practice/treatment guidelines which meet standards for practice guidelines contained in \"Guidelines for Internal Quality Monitoring Programs of Managed Care Organizations Contracting with the Tennessee Comprehensive Health Insurance Program\". b. The study topic should be one in which\" there is likely to be opportunity to improve health status; for example, immunizations offer great opportunities to improve health status. c. Study topics should not be restricted to care delivered in one type of setting; e.g., inpatient or ambulatory. 2. Study Design -Once the issues to be addressed through focused studies have been identified, the studies should be carefully designed if they are to produce information which is accurate, reliable, generalizable, and generally useful. To accomplish this, studies should be designed in accordance with generally accepted principles of scientific research and statistical analysis. The essential steps in study design are summarized here: QCM-25 a. Framing the Study Question -It is rarely possible to evaluate every aspect of care related to a specific clinical condition or health. service delivery issue. Therefore, after each study topic involving a clinical condition or health service concern has been identified, the question each study is to answer must be refined. For example, if a plan has identified pregnancy as a clinical condition for study, there are numerous questions about quality of care that could be included in a full study. For example: 1. Did pregnant women receive prenatal care in accordance with certain specified clinical practice guidelines? What are the clinical practice guidelines against which care will be compared? 2. Does the plan have a method for identifying \"high-risk\" pregnancies, and does it have established procedures for \"high-risk\" deliveries? Were these procedures appropriately used? What is the pattern of utilization of tertiary care facilities for childbirth? 3. What are the characteristics of pregnant enrollees who delivered low birth weight babies, and how could the plan improve its service to these women? 4. What are the nutritional and substance abuse characteristics of enrolled pregnant women? How could the plan improve its service to pregnant women based on the information obtained? Infonnation from enrollee satisfaction surveys, complaints, grievances, client disenrollments and State monitoring of plans may be utilized to assist in framing study questions. In addition, TennCare recipients or advocates can also playa role in determining issues to be studied as part of a particular study. b. Specifying Practice Guidelines for use in Assessing Care -When the EQRO monitors and evaluates care, it should compare the plan's perfonnance against some concept of IIgood\" care. What constitutes \"good earell should be identified before data is obtained from plans about the health care it delivers. The TennCare document \"Guidelines for Internal Quality Monitoring Programs of Managed Care Organizations Contracting with TennCare\" calls for coordinated care organizations themselves to monitor and evaluate the care they deliver through the use of clinical practice guidelines acceptable to the State. Practice guidelines. practice standards, practice advisories, or practice parameters are all tenus used to refer to recommended !Ibest practice\" strategies for clinical decision making and patient care. Although the terminology may vary, all can serve as sources of quality indicators against which care delivered by the managed care organization can be assessed. This document uses the term \"practice guidelines\" although, for purposes of this document, any of these terms may be used interchangeably. Sources of practice guidelines may be found in the American Medical Association publication, IIDirectory of Practice Parameters\", which is published annually, or may be identified from several other sources, including government and public health publications, recommendations from medical leadership and plan providers, as well as from published practice parameters. Ideally, the practice guidelines which the managed care organization uses to assess care, and the guidelines used by the external review organization, should be identical. However, this may not always be the case. Regardless, the EQRO QCM-26 shall review care in accordance with explicit guidelines approved by the State. If these guidelines are in conflict with those utilized for other purchasers of managed care services, this should be noted in the EQRO's analysis of findings and appropriately addressed. c. Defining and Quality Indicators that will be Monitored and Evaluated to Assess Care -From the practice g~idelines, specific variables are derived to serve as indicators of the quality of care. These \"quality indicators\" are objective pieces of information that will be collected and analyzed to provide information to answer the study questions. For pregnancy, for example, selected quality indicators could include: birth weight, weeks of gestation at first prenatal visit, number of prenatal visits prior to delivery, or birth outcome (fetal loss of live birth). Most quality indicators to be utilized will be \"process of care\" measures as opposed to outcome measures. If outcome indicators are\u00b7 considered, the difficulty of attributing outcome to health care received. must be addressed, as well as the problem of the infrequent occurrence of some outcomes and the resulting problems of obtaining statistically significant results. d. Determining the Methodology which the EQRO will Utilize to Assess Care Delivered -The methodology to. be utilized to compare care recommended in accordance with the identified practice guidelines should address the following: I. What will be the sources of the data to be collected? Data can be obtained from many sources; e.g., medical records, administrative data, claims data, and survey data. Although the sources of data may vary by plan, the EQRO should attempt to use consistent data definitions and a consistent data collection methodology to promote comparability of data across plans. Abstraction instruments should be employed by the external review entity to aid in consistency of data collection, and data abstractors should be experienced in their use. This will promote internal validity and comparability across plans within a State. 2. Will sampling be utilized or will all incidents which meet study question criteria be included in the study? The methodology should estimate the prevalence of the issues under study within the plan. In plans with few TennCare enrollees or a small universe, it may be advisable to obtain data on all Medicaid enrollees instead of sampling. Where the universe is large, the external study should sample the condition under review. 3. If sampling is to be utilized, the sample should be derived in accordance with generally accepted principles of research design and statistical analysis in order to be appropriate to the purposes and hypotheses of the study. The sampling methodology and statistical analysis to be utilized should consider: a. the intended uses of the data (e.g., does the State wish to make comparisons across plans or comparisons to regional or national data? Will it be used to sanction plans? Will it be released to the public at large?); b. the nature of the data to be collected; QCM-27 c. the expected prevalence of compliance/noncompliance with certain guidelines; d. the total number of studies to be conducted by the EQRO for each particular plan. Fewer studies with larger sample sizes and more numerous studies with smaller sample sizes may pose similar administrative burdens on plans. There are trade-offs to be made between the number of studies the State desires and the sample sizes that can reasonably be pursued for each study; e. the degree of confidence required for the data. 4. Will there be continuous monitoring or one time collection of data? Is there a need for the State to have certain plan performance information more frequently than annually? 5. Detennining the Methodology for Analysis of Results -The study methodology should specify: a. How the raw dat~ collected from the study is to be verified. b. What statistical analytical tests are to be performed on the data. c. Whether the data analysis will be able to adjust for such influences as age, severity of illness, or other variables which may affect the findings for the study questions. If no adjustments are possible, this should be discussed in the report of external review study findings. d. The performance measures to be used by the State to define \"acceptable\" performance by plans. For example, the State may choose to measure plan perfonnance against national performance data, against the performance of other plans in the State, or through established \"benchmarks\" against which the plan will be expected to show continuous improvement. If the State desires to utilize external quality review to make comparisons of the care'given by different plans in the State, the external quality review analysis should contain descriptions of the varying sources and definitions of data collected across plans. If information is able to be collected from all plans in an identical manner and using identical definitions, plan comparisons should be more feasible. Where data collection and definitions are not identica\\, an explanation and discussion of the limitation on cross plan comparison based upon the different data sources and data definitions utilized by plans should be included in the external quality review report. Until there is national or State standardization of data definitions and data collection across plans, the ability to compare information across plans will be limited. 3. Analysis and Interpretation of Study Findings -Analysis of results is not limited to the performance of statistical tests upon the raw data. \"Analysis\" examines data in light of other knowledge about the study population, plans, and the enviromnent in which plans and enrollees exist. Analysis attempts to produce \"infonnationlt from 1'data\", For example, when there is variation of plans from national norms, or variation between plans, what are likely explanations? Analysis of data should be conducted with input QCM-28 from the plans and the State. It should produce recommendations for concrete actions which can be undertaken by plans, enrollees and the State to improve the health care received from coordinated care organizations. B. Individual Case Reviews -As discussed above, population-based quality of care studies are more capable of providing generalizable quality of care information than are case-by-case reviews of care rendered to individuals. However, on occasion, there will also be a need for review of the quality of care delivered at the level of the individual. Such individual case review is necessary for individual incidents in which: 1. the occurrence is too infrequent to make judgements about \"patterns\" of care, or it is not possible to perfonn an analysis to detect \"statisticarr significance; or 2. the effect on an individual or individuals is so serious as to warrant individual attention. Examples of clinical incidents which may warrant individual case review are: matemal death, childhood death (non-neonatal, trauma, immunologic .or oncologic related), and ambulatory surgery deaths. Individual case review may also be appropriate in instances when questions are identified about a certain type of care provided by a particular provider. The State may further wish to reserve the right to refer a certain number of cases to the EQRO for individual case review on an ad-hoc basis when cases arise which do not fit into anticipated individual case review categories. In individual case review, peer health care professionals from the EQRO should review the medical records and any other accessory information sources to determine: the anatomy of the incident; remedial action, if possible; steps which may be taken to prevent such an occurrence in the future; and the implications of this occurrence for the coordinated care organizations' quality assurance program and the State's quality improvement system. This information should be included in the EQRO's report to the State on plan performance in quality of health care and health care delivery. C. Follow-up Activities on Study and Case Review Findings - 1. Both focused pattern of care studies and individual case review activities should result in formal written recommendations by the EQRO for actions to be undertaken by the plan, the State, or other parties (including the EQRO), as appropriate, to: a. improve the care provided by the plan to TennC're recipients, and b. resolve detected problems. 2. At the end of each review cycle, the EQRO should submit to the State a written report which contains: a description of its activities, pattern of care study findings, individual case review findings, and a Follow-Up Work Plan recommending activities to be conducted and the entities which are to conduct them to resolve identified problems and improve care overall. The work plan should include measurable goals so that problem resolution and care improvement can be objectively assessed. The work plan should be jointly developed by the EQRO and the organizations under review. (See Section IV, \"Implementation\", for greater discussion of this.) In the subsequent review cycle the EQRO should conduct verification activities to determine two things: a. Were problem resolution and quality improvement activities implemented as recommended in the Follow-Up Work Plan? QCM-29 b. Have work plan activities achieved their stated goals? Areas in which work plan goals have been reached would require no further follow-up (although the State may wish to continue to address these areas through focused studies or case review). \u00b7Areas in which problem resolution or quality improvement goals were not reached will require both ongoing quality review and further follow-up activities. The EQRO should document organization compliance/non-compliance with recommendations. IV. IMPLEMENTATION There are a number of ways in which the working relationships between the State, the EQRO, and managed care organizations can be structured to implement the above approach to external quality review. The external quality review activity is more likely to be a successful Quality Improvement mechanism if the organizations under review are proactively involved in this quality improvement process. TennCare is committed to actively working with all of the involved entities to develop collaborative relationships for quality improvement. In designing the external quality review function and determining how it is to operate as part of the TennCare Quality Improvement System (QIS), the following issues shall be addressed: A. Delineating the Role of the EQRO - The EQRO is the contractor to the State. At a minimum, the EQRO is fully responsible for implementing quality review activities in accordance with certain specifications determined by the State. The EQRO may also have responsibilities for designing focused studies, individual case reviews and Follow-Up Work Plans. The State will determine and specify the degree to EQRO involvement in the design of external quality review. The following design function will be explicitly addressed: 1. Selection of clinical conditions andlor health service delivery issues to be addressed through external quality review. . 2. Study design features as described in the previous section, including: refining study questions. identification of practice guidelines to he used to assess care, identification of quality indicators, and detennination of study methodology. 3. Analysis and Interpretation of study findings. 4. Determination of characteristics of cases to receive individual review. 5. Structuring of Follow-Up Work Plans. B. Length of EQRO Contract with the State -The State will deternline the length of the contract with EQRO. C. Participation of Managed Care Organizations in Designing EQRO Review Activities - Quality improvement and problem resolution activities will be most effective if the coordinated care organizations participate in their design. Participation by the organizations under review can contribute to improved quality review activities and quality of care in two ways: 1. Participation in quality review design will likely make implementation of the reviews easier for both the EQRO and the organization, and may increase the likelihood of being able to implement the review methodology as designed. QCM-30 2. Advance knowledge of the scope of an intended review of care may encourage an organization to improve care in those areas prior to the review, thus improving care sooner rather than later. To the extent possible, managed care organizations should participate in the following quality review design activities: I. selection of clinical conditions andlor health service delivery issues to be addressed through external quality review; 2. study design features as described in the previous section, including: refining study questions, identification of practice guid~lines to be used to assess care, identification of quality indicators, and determination or study methodology; 3. analysis and interpretation of study findings; 4. determination of characteristics of cases to receive individual review; and 5. structuring of Follow-Up Work Plans. The above mentioned plan is not intended to prevent unannounced reviews either by the State or the EQRO of the managed care organizations. At a minimum, however, each plan shall be informed in advance, of the clinical practice guidelines which will be utilized in assessing care, and the quality indicators which will be reviewed by the State or the EQRO. Establishment of clinical practice guidelines should be done as far in advance of the review as possible. D. Potential Variation in the Type of Clinical ConditionslHealth Services Delivery Issues to be Studied at Each Plan -In certain situations, the State may wish to vary the clinical conditions to be studied between plans. For example, the State may have different concerns for its inner city enrollees than for its rural enrollees. E. Detennining the Number of Focused Pattern of Care Studies to be Conducted for Each Plan - The number of studies to be conducted for each plan is, in part, a function of the methodology(ies) to be employed in conducting the quality of care studies. Complex studies need more resources than smaller studies; e.g., more data may need to be collected de novo from medical records rather than accessed from existing administrative data sets; data may need to be collected for consecutive years in order to obtain adequate sample sizes or detect trends in care; or the character of a certain condition may necessitate larger rather than smaller sample sizes. The State may: I. Require the same number of studies to be conducted by or for all plans. In this option the State has the option of requiring the EQRO to review different study issues for certain plans. 2. Require fewer studies from plans which have a strong hIstory of producing information of high reliability and accuracy, and which have consistently shown compliance with agreed upon performance measures. The State would then direct the EQRO to perform or oversee a greater number of clinical studies in plans which have poorer quality of care performance in comparison to their counterparts. Determination of the number and complexity of studies will be made by the State in consultation with the external quality review organization and the coordinated care plans. F. Methods for Implementing Focused Studies - QCM-31 Because of the varying capabilities of plans to provide quality of care data and to conduct pattern of care studies, the TennCare may elect, at its discretion, any of three different approaches to utilizing the EQRO to obtain accurate pattern of care information from plans. The variation in these approaches is intended to provide flexibility to the State and plans in obtaining and providing external quality review information. The State may utilize different approaches for different managed care organizations depending upon the State's knowledge about each organization's past performance in the provision of health care and in the implementation of quality of care studies. Option 1. EQRO Review of an Organization-Designed and Conducted Internal Study -THIS OPTION ASSUMES THE INDEPENDENT CAPABILITY OF THE COORDINATED CARE ORGANIZATION TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A STUDY WHICH MEETS STATE SPECIFIED PARAMETERS. Under this option, the role of the EQRO is to review the coordinated care organizations' study to detennine if the study methodology is valid and to perform an independent validity check of the internal study findings. If the external review organization's review supports the plan's methods and findings, then the external review organization can utilize the coordinated care organization's study findings in its report of plan performance to the State. If the external review organization finds that either than plan has not conducted a validly designed study which can answer the study questions, or that the study findings are not supported by an external validity check, then the external review organization can either impose a study methodology on the plan in accordance with Option 2, below, or conduct its own study (Option 3). At a minimum, EQRO review of a managed care organization's internal study, should assess the following issues: Was the study questions of the plan the same as that specified by the State? If not, did the study generate the proscribed study variables defined according to the same specifications to be used for the EQRO's study? Was the collection of the same defined performance measures performed in a manner that preserves internal and external validity; e.g., Was the sampling methodology? Were reliable data collection mechanisms employed? Was it designed in accordance with generally accepted research principles? Does a verification subsample confirm the findings of the plan? Based upon the EQRO's evaluation of the piau's internal study, it the plan has conducted its internal study in an acceptable manner, then the State may exempt the organization from a full external study of this question and utilize data provided by the plan through its internal QMP. Option 2. EQRO Design of Study/Implementation by Coordinated Care Organization -IN ADDITION TO SECURING THE QUALITY OF CARE INFORMATION SOUGHT BY THE STATE, THIS APPROACH HAS A SECONDARY DESIRABLE EFFECT OF IMPROVING THE INTERNAL QUALITY MONITORING CAP ABILITY OF THE PLAN. A coordinated care organization may not have sufficient resources or expertise to independently and competently design a focused pattern of care study which meets the criteria determined by the State. In such a situation, if the organization is 'willing to implement a quality assurance study in accordance with study design specifications established by the EQRO and the State, the EQRO may provide the organization with study design specifications to enable the organization to conduct its own internal study to meet State specifications. In this option, the EQRO and the organization would work collaboratively to develop study design specifications for the plan which meet study specifications established by the EQRO and State for the external quality reviews. The organization is then responsible for implementing the study in accordance with these QCM-32 specifications. At the conclusion of the implementation of the study, the EQRO would perfonn the same evaluation of the plan's focused pattern of care study as it does for studies independently designed and conducted by managed care organizations as in Option 1, ahove. If the study meets all requirements, the EQRO may utilize this data in its plan perfonnance report to the State. If the plan is not willing to accept such guidance, or if the plan's study fails to meet criteria for acceptable perfonnance, then the EQRO will both design and implement quality of care studies as in Option 3, below. Option 3. Design and Implementation of Focused Studies Solely by the EQRO. If the State detennines, with input from the EQRO', that a review of the plan's internal studies is not feasible, or that an effort at having a coordinated care organization implement a study in accordance with StatelEQRO specifications is not likely to be successful, the external quality review organization shall implement quality of care studies to answer the State's areas of concern in accordance with the conceptual model discussed in Part III above. In this option the role of the coordinated care organization shall be to provide or allow access to clinical or health services data required by the EQRO. This data may be in the fonn of medical records or data from administrative or other data sets. If infonnation is obtained from sources other than medical records, the EQRO shall also perfonn a verification of the accuracy of the data base. G. Individual Case Review -Since focused pattern of care studies generate infonnation of greatest utility for quality improvement, and case-by-case review consumer more resources on a per-case basis, individual case review should be reserved for unique clinical care situations which meet either of the two criteria described in Part III: 1. the occurrence is too infrequent to make judgements about \"patterns\" of care or perfonn analyses to detect IIstatisticalli significance; or 2. the effect on an individual or individuals is so serious as to warrant individual attention. The State is responsible for identifying the criteria for selecting individual cases which will receive individual quality review. Because individual case review should be undertaken in very few cases, it is appropriate that it be well targeted. As with the process for external review overall, the effectiveness of targeting cases for individual case review process is likely to be most effective if designed jointly by the EQRO and the State, with input from the managed care organizations. EQRO statisticians may be helpful in identifying clinical conditions or events which happen so rarely that pattern of care studies are not feasible. Managed care organizations may be helpful in identifying clinical or health services delivery incidents which warrant individual attention. The State may also utilize infonnation from grievances and State monitoring plans to identify incidents which require individual case review. The State may also, at its discretion, direct that a particular case or cases be referred to the EQRO for individual case review. H. Follow-Up Activities After the EQRO has completed its focused studies and individual case reviews for each plan, it will produce a set of preliminary findings and recommendation for: problem resolution, quality improvement, and follow-up activities. These should be reviewed and commented upon jointly by plans and the State before being finalized. The State has the discretion to detennine how and when this review is to take place. The State may choose to take any degree of involvement it desires in this process. The examples listed below should be considered as a continuum of involvement. Example I: High Level of TennCare Involvement -TennCare could require the EQRO to submit its preliminary findings directly to TennCare. TennCare would then take total responsibility for QCM-33 reviewing the findings with coordinated care plans and developing a final report and follow-up work plan to be implemented by the EQRO. Example 2: Low Level ofTennCare Involvement -TennCare could direct the EQRO to meet with each plan it reviewed to present its findings to the plan and develop a mutually agreed upon problem resolution, quality improvement, and follow-up work plan. The EQRO would then submit a final report to the State. Example 3: Midlevel TennCare Involvement -TennCare may direct the EQRO to implement a process for organization review and comment prior to finalizing the EQRO's annual report to the State. The process could be jointly developed and implemented by TennCare and the EQRO. It is necessary to have the review of preliminary findings by the plans in order to assist in: the interpretation of the quantitative findings of the EQRO; and the development of follow-up plans for problem resolution and quality improvement. Regardless of the degree of involvement of the TennCare in finalizing the preliminary findings of the EQRO, TennCare will be highly involved in the follow-up of the final findings of the annual EQRO quality review. TennCare will meet its responsibility to remain aware of: the quality of care provided by its coordinated care contractors; and necessary follow-up activities to be taken by the EQRO; or the status of the EQRO's implementation of follow-up activities. The EQRO will submit status reports every four to six months to TennCare on its follow-up activities on the preceding year's findings. In instances where a coordinated care organization's quality of care has shown significant deficiencies, TennCare will consider the appropriateness and applicability of intennediate sanctions. V. CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TennCare will make clear to both the EQRO and coordinated care organizations how the TennCare will utilize information obtained from the reviews in any planned release of data, report of quality review findings, or requests for information from other public or private entities. TennCare will delineate what, if any, authority the EQRO has to release any plan specific or aggregate data other than information specific to a coordinated care organization to that same organization. If TennCare contracts with a Medicare Peer Review Organization (PRO) to conduct external quality reviews, the disclosure of external review information is governed by Section 1160 of the Social Security Act, \"Protection Against Disclosure of Information.\" IfTennCare uses an entity other than a PRO, disclosure of information is governed by State law and the confidentiality and data requirements ofTennCare. VI. SPECIFICATIONS FOR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATIONS The external quality review process is based on a reliance on scientific principles governing research design and statistical analysis. In addition, the focus of the reviews is on health care services and on the delivery of these services. Because of this, the 'organization which conducts the reviews shall have personnel who are educated and experienced in the conduct of health services research and the provision of medical services. Further, the EQRO shall provide these individuals with appropriate supervision in the conduct of their work. At a minimum, EQROs shall have personnel with the following competencies: A. Clinical Expertise - The EQRO may utilize staff level personnel with varying clinical experience; e.g., medical, nursing, dental or other allied health professions. However, because the EQRO will be making measurements and assessments of the delivery of medical and related health services, clinical assessment activities undertaken by the EQRO shall be under the supervision of an individual with the appropriate educa\"tion and experience in: QCM-34 I. Assessing broad-based medical and other health care services, through the use of quality assurance technology such as: practice guidelines, quality indicators, and performance measures. 2. Utilizing practice guidelines -their development, evaluation and implementation. 3. Designing, implementing and assessing the effectiveness of corrective action plans/quality improvement activities. In addition, the EQRO shall demonstrate that it has access to medical and health care experts in specific health care areas; e.g., specialty care, on an ad-hoc basis. B. Health Services Research Expertise - Because the primary activities to be undertaken by EQROs are designing, assessing and implementing focused quality of care studies, the EQRO shall have sufficient expertise in research methodology and statistical analytical methods to know how to undertake these activities and to instruct coordinated care organizations, as necessary, where a coordinated care organization wishes to undertake studies itself. EQROs shall have sufficient persolUlel resources in research and statistical analytical methods in order to provide assistance to coordinated care organizations and assess the soundness of focused quality of care studies on a timely basis. QCM-35 SECTION IV MONITORING MANAGED CARE I. INTRODUCTION Managed Care is intended to mean the proper utilization of available resources to achieve and maintain the highest degree of health and functional capability practically obtainable by an individual. This entails the provision of health care in such a way as to prevent those illnesses and conditions for which recognized preventive strategies have been shown to be possible and cost effective. In the achievement of these goals however, the temptation to compromise the quality, availability and accessibility of services must be avoided. Especially important is the aspect of under-utilization in MCOs that are at fmancial risk of medically necessary services in order to reduce cost and increase the profitability of the provider and over\u00ad utilization of MCOs that are not at financial risk. There are a number of parameters which can and should be continually monitored to assure the provision of quality health care to every enrollee. Some of these examples follow this introduction. II. ACCESS TO CARE I. Managed Care organizations will be required to assure that the TennCare enrollee has access to care which meets the requirements of this Agreement. 2. TennCare will monitor access to primary care by reviewing the MCO provider network in the following primary care areas: Family Practice, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology. TennCare will review the data from the MCO's monthly provider file that is electronically submitted to TennCare and compare this data with the MCO's membership to determine the numbers and distribution of providers compared to enrollees and to calculate travel distances between contracted providers and enrollees. 3. TennCare will monitor access to essential hospital services and Centers of Excellence by reviewing the \"Essential Hospital Service Chart\" and comparing this data with the MCO's membership to determine the geographic distribution of providers compared to enrollees calculating travel distances between contracted providers and enrollees. 4. TennCare will monitor access to care for Physician Specialty Services by reviewing the MCO's provider network, including non-contractual relationships, for physician specialties indicated in Section 2-4.1. TennCare will review the data from the MCO's monthly provider file that is electronically submitted to TennCare along with the CONTRACTOR's Physician Specialty charts for each specialty in each CRA. TennCare will assess this network in conjunction with the MCO's membership to determine the numbers and distribution of providers compared to enrollees and to calculate travel distances between providers and enrollees. TennCare will also compare physician specialty networks across MCOs serving the same regions to assist in identifying usual and customary referral patterns. TennCare will not necessarily require a CONTRACTOR to contract for all physician specialties within the same CSA that the enrollee resides, but will require the CONTRACTOR to establish provider agreements with each of the eleven physician specialists identified in Section 2-4.1 in each area designated by TennCare as a focal point for specialist services in the CONTRACTOR's service area. A sufficient number of provider agreements shall be established in each focal point to ensure that non-dual enrollee to provider ratios remain below the maximum allowable ratios for each area as defined in Attaclnnent IV. TennCare will also review complaints and appeals to identify potential deficiencies in the CONTRACTOR's physician specialty services arrangements. 5. Member satisfaction surveys will be conducted by TennCare, independent of the CONTRACTOR. These surveys may include, availability of appointments, length of waiting times, office hours, ease of obtaining preventive medicine services, prescription medication coverage, the ability to obtain emergency services; the ability to obtain specialty services and any other services or conditions TennCare chooses to evaluate. QCM-36 6. Provider surveys will be conducted by TennCare, independent of the CONTRACTOR. These surveys may include ease of requesting prior authorization, ease of obtaining specialty services referrals, and timeliness of claims payment processes. III. STANDARDS OF CARE I. Standards of care shall be taken from published recommendations of nationally recognized authorities such as; The American Medical Association; The American Dental Association, The American Academy of Pediatrics and the many other specialty and non-specialty groups. The standard of care for the community will also be recognized. Two examples of the types of standards which might be applied are listed here. Information on the monitoring of these standards may be found under Quality of Care Monitors. 2. Prenatal Care will be delivered according to standards of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). 3. Child Health Care will be delivered according to the standards of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and in compliance with the EPSDT policies now in effect.. IV. QUALITY OF CARE MONITORS I. Quality of Care will be monitored in an on-going manner by TennCare staff. 2. Managed Care organizations will be required to establish a Quality Improvement Unit to review inpatient and outpatient care provided by the organization. 3. Managed Care organizations will be required to establish a PEER review committee to monitor Quality of Care issues. This committee will have a clear and concise chain of command. 4. The PEER review committee will be responsible for directly addressing issues of concern by letter and face-to-face with the responsible provider. 5. The Managed Care organization shall immediately report to TennCare all cases of suspected provider or recipient fraud or abuse. 6. TennCare and/or it's agent shall be provided immediate access to medical and other patient related records by the Managed Care organization or it's employee providers of service, or it's contract providers of service. '7. TennCare and/or it's agent shall make unannounced visits either on a random basis or for a specific reason, to review medical and other patient related records. 8. The Managed Care organization shall immediately notify Medicaid of any malpractice actions brought against any of it's providers. 9. TennCare shall monitor M~O progress toward obtaining the benchmark level of performance for each of the measures specified below. The CONTRACTOR shall demonstrate meaningful improvement each year. Meaningful improvement is defined as ten (10) percentage point improvement over the prior years rate or satisfaction of the benchmark. The CONTRACTOR shall not be required to develop and analyze performance indicators for enrollees in Groups 3, 4, or 5 as defined in Section 4 of this Agreement. The performance indicators are: QCM-37 Perfonnance Data SOIll'CCS l\\Ieasurc Target Benchmark Indicator Childhood MCO percentage of 100% of To be detennined.

TennCare may use individual encounter data, monthly provider files and other required reports to measure the Managed Care Organization's compliance with Provider Network, Claims Processing, FinanciaVActuarial Stability, ClinicaVQuality and MemberlProvider Service standards. QCM-39 ATTACHMENT III -TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS 162 ATTACHMENT III Terms and Conditions for Access In general, contractors shall provide available, accessible, and adequate numbers of institutional facilities, service locations, service sites, professional, allied, and paramedical personnel for the provisionof covered services, including all emergency services, on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis. At a minimum, this shall include: Primary Care Physician or Extender: (a) Distancerrime Rural: 30 miles or 30 minutes (b) Distancerrime Urban: 20 miles or 30 minutes (c) Patient Load: 2,500 or less for physician; one-half this for a physician extender.

Recipient access to care will be monitored through the following State activities: periodic comparison of the number and types of providers before and after the waiver, periodic surveys which contain questions concerning recipient access to services, measurement of waiting periods to obtain health care services, and measurement of referral rates to specialists. , Guidelines for Plan Monitoring of Providers Plans will require, by contract, that providers meet specified standards as required by the State contract. ,Plans will monitor, on a periodic or continuous basis, providers' adherence to these standards, and recipient access to care. 164 ATTACHMENT IV -SPECIALTY NETWORK STANDARDS 165 ATTACHMENT IV Specialty Network Standards For the purpose of assessing specialty provider network adequacy, TennCare MCO networks will be evaluated relative to the'requirements described below, The purpose of these requirements is to ensure access and availability to specialists for non-dual MedicarelMedicaid eligibles while recognizing the actual disbursement and number of specialty resources available within the state. A provider is considered a \"specialist\" if helshe has a provider agreement with the MCO to provide specialty services to enrollees. Access to Specialty Care Contractors shall ensure access to specialists for the' provision of covered services. This requirement shall be satisfied through the execution and maintenance of at least one provider agreement for the provision of each of the following types of specialist services in the area specified. This requirement ensures that TennCare enrollees in all MCOs will be able to access specialists within the community in which they reside or as close to it as feasible, while recognizing the constraints introduced by the limited availability of specialists in some areas. The geographic areas, or \"focal points\" where contracts are required include Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Madison, Maury, Putnam and Cumberland (Either one), Shelby, and Sullivan and Washington (Either one) counties, either because these are population centers or there is 'a major medical center located in the area. If MCOs establish co!).!racts for the provision of specialty services in each of these eight focal points all TennCare enrollees will have access to speCialists within a maximum travel distance of 90 miles, and the majority will have access to specialists within 60-miles. Contracts are required in these specific areas in recognition of traditional specialty referral patterns. The areas in which MCOs are required to establish contracts are indicated in the chart below by Grand Region. Based on these requirements, an MCO serving the East Grand'Region would be required to have at least three Cardiologists in its network (one in Hamilton, One in Knox, and one in Sullivan or Washington counties). Cardiology 0 Madison 0 Davidson 0 Hamilton 0 Shelby 0 Putnam/Cumberland 0 Knox 0 Maury 0 SullivanlWashington ENT 0 Madison 0 Davidson 0 Hamilton 0 Shelby 0 Putnam/Cumberland 0 Knox 0 Maury 0 SullivanlWashington Gastroenterology 0 0 0 0 Shelby 0 Putnam/Cumberland' 0 Knox 0 Maury' 0 SullivanlWashington Neurology 0 0 0 Hamilton 0 Shelby 0 Putnam/Cumberland' 0 Knox 0 Maury' 0 SullivanlWashington Neurosurgery 0 Shelby 0 Davidson 0 Hamilton 0 Knox Not Applicable to Not Applicable to Madison Putnam/Cumberland and Not Applicable to Oncology 0 0 0 0 Shelby 0 Putnam/Cumberland' 0 Knox 0 Maury' 0 SullivanlWashington 166 Davidson Davidson attempts to contract how selVices will Availability o/Specialty Care Contractors shall provide adequate numbers of specialists for the provision of covered services to ensure adequate provider availability. To account for variances in MCO enrollment size, the guidelines described in this section have been established for determining how many of each type of specialist an MCO must have. These are aggregate guidelines and are not age specific. To determine these guidelines the number of providers within each of the focal points in each Grand Region was compared to the size of the population in each Grand Region. The \"area\" being served includes the population of surrounding counties. The chart below provides the mapping of counties to focal points. MCOs must comply with the following guidelines: MCOs must have at least one provider agreement with each specialist in each required area; and, MCOs must have a sufficient number of provider agreements to ensure that the number of enrollees per provider does not exceed the following: Maximum Number of Non-Dual Enrollees per ProvIder by Specialty and Focal Point ~ g E g 2 .. \"5 g :::I :::I. g 0 tJ) tJ) ~ () 0 () II) I-CI) E .. -0 .~ ;; 0 > Z c: .. e 0 w CI) ~ 0 g () ;; e :::I e 0 0 EAST 19,000 27,000 27,000 15,500 12,000 85,000 23,000 Monitoring TennCare will monitor MCO compliance with specialist network standards on an on-going basis. Data from the monthly provider file will be used to verify compliance with the specialty network requirements. This file will serve as the source for confirming the MCO has a sufficient number and distribution of specialists an.d for calculating enrollee to provider ratios. TennCare will also phone providers listed on this file periodically to confirm that the provider is under contract to provide specialty services as reported by the MCO. Appeals data will also be monitored for indications that problems exist with access to specialists, and corrective action plans will be required when appropriate. 167 ATTACHMENT V \" INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE STERILIZATION CONSENT FORM 168 INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE STERILIZATION CONSENT FORM 1.

Acceptable methods of screening include auditory brainstem response dB HL. Newborn hearing screening is recommended for all newborn infants. As of January 1999, not all hospitals in the State have the capability of conducting newborn hearing screeuing. Newborn hearing screenings should be provided for all newborns by the year 2003. Recommended testing intervals: The committee recommends an objective hearing screening test once in each of the following age ranges: 3-6,10- 13,14-18. Screening should be conducted at the first visit during the above listed intervals at which the patient is cooperative. Acceptable methods of objective hearing screening include: conventional audiometty, hand-held audiometty, conditioned play audiometty (with a screening level of 20 dB HL at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz). Positive screening results should lead to referral for diaguostic assessment of hearing. A prompt re-screening may be substituted for immediate referral for diaguostic assessment if the clinician believes the initial screening result is likely to be a false positive. Re-screening should be done within 2-4 weeks rather than waiting until the next scheduled well child visit. . VISION SCREEN]NG Recommended testing intervals: The committee recommends testing ocular aligument and visual acuity once in the 3-6 year old age range. These procedures should be conducted at the frrst visit during which the patient is cooperative. The committee recommends testing visual acuity once in each of the following age ranges: 10-13,14-18. methods for screeuing ocular aligument include: photoscreening (preferred), uuilateral cover test at 10 feet or 3 M, Random Dot E Stereotest at 40 em (630 secs of arc). i I ~ ~ == ~ ~ S -00 -.) Acceptable methods for screening visual acuity include: Snellen Letters, Snellen Numbers, Tumbling F, HOTV, Picture Tests, Allen Figures, LH' Tests, Positive screening results should lead to referral for diagnostic assessment of vision. A prompt re-screening may be substituted for immediate referral for diagnostic assessment if the clinician believes his initial screening result is likely to be a false positive, Re-screening should be done within 2-4 weeks rather than waiting until the next scheduled well child visit: ATTACHMENT IX -SCOPE OF COVERED BENEFITS UNDER EPSDT 188 ATTACHMENT IX Scope Of Covered Benefits Under EPSDT Note 1: All services other than EPSDT screenings must be medically necessary.
