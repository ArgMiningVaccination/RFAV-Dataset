Bringing a dash of comic-book superhero to the science world, the American blogger named SciBabe karate chops her way through pseudoscience and the \"Dr Google syndrome\" by drawing on her degrees in forensic science, chemistry and theatre. Especially the theatre. It's unbelievable that she doesn't have a comedy degree, though she has done stand up, because as a guest at [Science Week](http://re-science.org.au/science-event/scibabe-comes-victoria-3146) from August 15-23, she departs from the image of the geek in a white coat with a performance combining one-liners and swear words. That's no shock when her website is headed: \"Come for the science. Stay for the dirty jokes.\" Sceptical SciBabe is no introverted boffin but an extroverted entertainer. In her decimation of homeopathy or \"medicine with no medicine in it\", she swallowed 50 homeopathic sleeping pills with Diet Coke, saying: \"There is more actual drug in the form of caffeine in the Diet Coke that I'm drinking than there is in this bottle [of pills].\" Given there was \"no f--cking medicine\" in the sugary tablets, she didn't collapse into a stupor and sleep for weeks. In the YouTube video that has amassed 294,100 hits, she added a sensible disclaimer: \"Don't try this at home.\" Gleefully provocative, the 32-year-old Californian has a \"I love vaccines\" T-shirt and when navigating through one of her pet subjects that riles the anti-vaccination brigade, she has this advice: \"Trust the right expert.\" The same applies to the anti-GMO movement and if you are worrying that macaroni and cheese can give you cancer. In the battle of the \"Babes\" in the health arena, Ms d'Entremont ascended to the top of the online opinion factory that is the blogosphere when she took on anti-toxins crusader Vani Hari, known as Food Babe, by writing in [Gawker](http://gawker.com/the-food-babe-blogger-is-full-of-shit-1694902226) that she's \"utterly full of shit\". Ms Hari, who's fond of posing with a magnifying glass, responded to the \"very unprofessional and overly profane\" attack by saying the only thing she was full of was \"heart, love and hope for a better future\". Swapping jargon with expletives, SciBabe is proud of her profanity and has won fans in Australia for being an antidote to the nonsense on the internet. She says the six most important words in science are: \"I don't know, let's find out.\" For school students who moan about their boring science homework, SciBabe suggests they view the field as a creative one that exists outside the classroom. \"It's not a way to close off your brain, it's a new way to expand it.\" Before coming to Melbourne, the caffeine chaser researched our coffee culture and used the daily ritual to illustrate how science is all around us. \"If you are sipping a latte or espresso, it took steam. There was thermodynamics that we can study for this. It took roasted coffee beans. This is physics and there was so much that went into this.\" For critics who denounce her use of the word \"Babe\" as detrimental to the cause of women, she feels the opposite and wants to make the profession relatable and sexy. \"I'm going to bust through the image of being nerdy and not having social skills,\" she said. When you read her lips, her preferred lipstick colour is red. For all Science Week events go "}
