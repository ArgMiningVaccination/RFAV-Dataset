There have been some theoretical links discussed about using Saxenda and thyroid lumps and cancer. These are based on studies in rodents, but have not been seen in primate or human studies. A thyroid goitre is a swelling in the thyroid gland. About 15% of the UK population have thyroid goitres or nodules, and the lifetime risk of developing a thyroid nodule is around 5 to 10%. Saxenda clinical studies showed an increased risk of developing thyroid swellings, like goitres, particularly in patients with pre-existing thyroid disease. If you have thyroid disease and develop a swelling in your neck or thyroid whilst using Saxenda, you must tell your doctor. Thyroid cancer is the 20th most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 1% of all new cancer cases. 8% of thyroid cancers are caused by being overweight or obese. [Find out more on the Cancer Research UK website.](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/thyroid-cancer) Saxenda clinical trials carried out on rats and mice showed an increase in thyroid cancer. In particular, this was medullary cancer of the thyroid. This increase was not seen in studies carried out on primates, and importantly has not been seen in human studies of almost 6000 patients. Pancreatic cancer is the 10th most common cancer in the UK. Almost half of all new cases are diagnosed in people aged 75 and over. A person's risk of developing cancer depends on many factors. To put this into context, 22% of pancreatic cancers are caused by smoking, and 12% by being overweight or obese. [Find out more on the Cancer Research UK website.](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/pancreatic-cancer) Saxenda clinical studies have not shown a link with pancreatic cancer.
