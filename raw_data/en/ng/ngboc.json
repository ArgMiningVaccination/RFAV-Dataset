Diabetes mellitus (DM), the world s most com- mon metabolic disorder, results from a defect ininsulin secretion, insulin action, or both [1]. It isprojected that the global prevalence of diabetesis escalating. At least 250 million individualsworldwide suffer from diabetes, and this numberwill double by 2030. Increases in complicationswill undoubtedly follow increasing pervasivenessof diabetes [2].The regional prevalence of diabetes in MENA(Middle Eastern and North Africa) countries is7.7% [3]. Standing at 10.1%, Jordan has the ninthhighest incidence of diabetes. Several nationalsurveys indicated that the prevalence of type 2diabetes and impaired fasting glycemia is in anunprecedented increase with an epidemiologicaltransition in Jordan [4 -6]. More than 80% of dia- betes deaths occur low- and middle-incomecountries. Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolicdiseases represent 7.9% of deaths in Jordan [7 -8]. Located in the Middle East, Jordan covers92300 km 2with high geographical and ecological diversity. Its varied topography and climate resultin the junction of four biogeographical regionsFig. 1S , and these crossroads engender the coun-try with substantial biodiversity that is at large understudied or, even worse, left unexplored [9].The Mediterranean region provides the vast ma-jority of the recorded 2500 wild plant species, in-cluding medicinal, poisonous, edible, and orna-mental ones. There are more than 140 wild edibleplants listed such as . Some of these edible and culinary plants are used by localcommunities for generations for their medicinalvalue [10 -12]. In Jordan, where traditional medicine plays a par-tial role in imparting the primary health care,vegetables, culinary herbs, and medicinal plantsare among the main choices in the managementof diabetes [13,14]. However, it is officially nei-ther integrated in the health care system nor rec-ognized in national policies of the country. Theobjective of this mini review is to underline theethnopharmacological practices related to 30 se-lected ethnobotanicals with claimed antidiabeticproperties in light of their comprehensive scien-tific evaluation.Abstract ! Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolicdisorder affecting millions worldwide. It is recog-nized as a global major health problem. As alter-natives to the available orthodox medicines,plants are considered a potential source for thetreatment of diabetes within traditional ethno-medicine practices. In the Jordanian traditionalmedicine a significant selection of ethnobotani-cals is promoted for their antidiabetic activity. Lit-erature surveys demonstrate the benefit of sev-eral ethnobotanicals as antidiabetic agents eval-uated in in vitro and in vivo systems in the form of their crude extracts and/or isolated pure com-pounds with varying degrees of hypoglycemic orantihyperglycemic bioactivities. This mini reviewdiscusses the preparatory forms in which theseplants are consumed, their reported phytocon-stituents, and the results of their reported anti-diabetic bioactivity.

Surveys based on interviews with herbalists and search engines indicated that in the Jordanian traditional medicine almost 70plant species belonging to 38 families were consumed by diabeticpatients. The majority of the used plants are native to Jordanwhile others like Zingiber officinalis, Terminalia chebula ,o rEmbli- plants of nonindigenous origin [13,15 -17]. Reports on the concomitant use of plants accompanying the or-thodox therapy are limited. Primarily, interviews with diabetespatients in specialized health centers of Jordan further signifieda more diversified list of selected Locally, a preliminary screening of the critical pharmacologicalappraisal of the traditionally utilized botanicals was performed.It demonstrated that reports on diabetes interventional phyto-therapies are scarce. Gharaibeh et al. [19] investigated the hypo-glycemic effects of Teucrium et al. [21], and Kasabri et al.[22,23] undertook a comprehensive and complementary in vitro and in vivo testing for a vast array of indigenously recruited herbs, partially consumed as integral to the diet been identified as antidiabetic phytomedicines. This line ofresearch findings could link and rationalize the ethnopharmaco-logical use with new approaches in the prevention/modulation ofpostprandial hyperglycemia emerging from the therapeutic useof-amylase and Al-Mustafa and Al-Thunibat [24] investigated of Jordanian antidiabetic phytomedicines. More-over, pancreatic mechanistic were diabetes pharmacotherapeutics, thesignificant efficacy of hypoglycemic herbs is achieved by increas-ing insulin secretion, enhancing glucose uptake by adipose andmuscle tissues, inhibiting glucose absorption from intestine andinhibiting glucose production from hepatocytes [29 -31]. Certain herbs may ameliorate overt hyperglycemia substantially in clini-cal trials with well characterized action mechanisms [32,33];their test results, however, are subject to several factors. Firstly,each herb contains multiple compounds, only a few of whichmay be therapeutically effective either alone or synergistically[34]. Secondly, different parts of an herb have different ingre-dient profiles. Thirdly, different extraction methods may yielddifferent active ingredients [35]. Most recently, the antidiabeticactivity of several flavonoids, polyphenols, and -39]. The re- ported secondary metabolites of the selected 30 plants are listedinl \"Table 1 . Especially important in the present review, flavo- noids are the major class of secondary metabolites detected inmost of the plants. Moreover, terpenoids have been reported inthe discussed plant species with hypoglycemic activities [29,30].Locally, one of the common practices is to assign certain species of a given genus a single common Arabic name with the expecta-tion that all of them will perform ethnopharmacologicallyequally. This unjustifiable practice is based on species availability.In application, and despite scientific invalidity, the three Artemi- sia,both Cichorium spp., and the two Crataegus species have been the subject of such inappropriate convenience of designation.Plants compiled in l \"Table 1 , demonstrating num, C. spinosa ). Spices do not only improve the taste of the foods but do also contribute to the well-being of humans. Influ-ence of the spices on the body metabolism and on the endo-crine system has gained importance in the recent years. Nu-merous spices have been evaluated in animal experiments aswell as clinical studies, and evidence has been obtained fortheir antidiabetic potential [40 appropriate diet, ex- ercise, and weight reduction are essential in controlling theblood sugar, antidiabetic activities of many edible fruits andvegetables -in the form of aqueous and alcohol extracts -have been tested in diabetes animal models. Furthermore, clinicalevidence for the antidiabetic activity is reported intybus andA. cepa.A. cepa exhibitedhypogly- cemic effects in 1 type 2 diabetic patients ( l \"Table 1 ). Exceptionally, C. intybus , possessing multiple action mecha- nisms in controlling the blood glucose level such as alpha amy-lase inhibitory activity, appetite regulation, and increasinginsulin secretion ( 1 ), has hypoglycemic activity in dif- ferent animal models and clinically evidenced benefits in thereduction of diabetes risk ( l \"Table 1 ). 3. and preventive effects have been illustrated in vari-ous animal models of diabetes. Nevertheless, A. judaca exhib- ited antidiabetic effects in STZ-diabetic rats, but A. vulgaris used locally for its antidiabetic activity has not been appraisedpharmacologically. The remaining medicinal herbs, with theexception of R. chalepensis , have established antidiabetic ac- tivities. Richness in flavonoids, such as rutin, may plausi-ble for R. chalepensis antidiabetic potentiality (l \"Table 1 ). Several studies indicated fits flavonoids as common fruit trees siliqua, regia ,a n d M. nigra -and the peels of C. sinensis are praised throughout the country for their antidiabetic activities. These substantial efficacies have beenclearly verified. Moreover, the antidiabetic efficiency of C. sili- qua leaf extracts has been confirmed in type 2 diabetic pa- tients ( l \"Table 1 ). Conclusion ! Based on hundreds of years of belief and observation, a marked number of plant species are used by the inhabitants of Jordanfor the treatment of diabetes.

Pharmacologic and therapeutic evaluation of theselected plants in this review explicitly substantiates the ethno-pharmacological practices in Jordan.
