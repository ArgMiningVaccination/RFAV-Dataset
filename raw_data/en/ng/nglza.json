We currently reported that herbal remedy TL001, ameliorated the Parkinsonian motor deficit and protected the nigrostriatal tract from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson disease nigra (SNc) the monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor, Selegiline, as positive control drug for both neuroprotection and correction of motor deficits. Animals were sacrificed and the brain and muscle slices were stained for dopaminergic 1, 5 receptors. Muscle mitochondria biogenesis parameter norepinephrine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate) also evaluations. the MPTP-induced animal model of Parkinson's disease, TL001 time-dependently improved motor functions and increased both of 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive immunoreactive cells in the SNc and ST areas and the abatement of proinflammatory cytokines compared to the MPTP mice. In addition, TL001 interventions also have produced positive results in PD patients from behavioral assessment. These findings suggest that LT001 may be used as an adjunct therapy to enhance the efficacy of L-dopa and alleviate its adverse effects in patients with PD. Thus, TL001 has potential to improve the benefits of dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease.
