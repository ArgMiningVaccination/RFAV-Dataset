Water samples are analyzed by the CT Department of Public Health Laboratory for the presence of indicator bacteria (E.Coli). Indicator bacteria do not cause illness in humans but may be a sign that disease-causing organisms are present. Swimming areas may temporarily be closed if an elevated level of bacteria is detected. SAMPLING SITES AND STATUS Water quality monitoring has ended for the season Tick-borne Diseases Tick-borne diseases are those spread by the bite of an infected tick. These diseases can be caused by bacteria, parasites, or viruses, although the diseases caused by bacteria are most common. Several tick species found in Connecticut can spread types of bacteria that can cause illness in humans, and infection with more than one is possible through one tick bite. The most effective way to avoid getting sick from tick-borne diseases is to [prevent tick bites](https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html). In Connecticut, surveillance is conducted to identify tick-borne diseases spread by ticks in the state and those that might be travel-related. The Connecticut Department of Health conducts surveillance for the following tick-borne diseases: - Anaplasmosis - Babesiosis - Borrelia miyamotoi disease - Ehrlichiosis - Lyme disease - Powassan virus disease - Rocky Mountain spotted fever - Tularemia Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station offers tick testing to Connecticut's health departments and districts for engorged ticks that have been removed from people. If you or a family member finds an attached tick, after removal, you may bring the tick in a plastic bag or container to the health department. The health department will then review the required paperwork and send it to the Ag Station for definitive identification. You can also visit [The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station](https://portal.ct.gov/caes) website for more information on ticks and tick management and prevention.
