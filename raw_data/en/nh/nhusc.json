I'm a Board-certified naturopathic doctor and coach based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where I've been helping people since 2004.

As we age, these little moments of forgetfulness become more worrying... B vitamins are sometimes called the energy vitamins, since they help put a spring in your step and play an important role in maintaining your energy levels. In fact, they play such a key role that perhaps they should also be called the \"Brisk, Bouncy, and Bright\" vitamins... Water, the lifeblood of Mother Earth. That free-flowing H20 is crucial for the survival of every organic species on the planet. Our earth is made up of 71% water - just a little more than the human brain which floats at 70%. In fact, water comprises up to 55-60% of our entire bodies... "}
