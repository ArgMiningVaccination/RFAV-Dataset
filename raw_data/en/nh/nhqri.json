We propose that tradeoffs also influence the prevalence and forms of human mal adaptation manifest in disease. By this logic, increased risk for one set of diseases commonly engenders decreased risk for another, diametric,set of diseases. We describe evidence for such diametric sets of diseases from epidemiolo-gical, genetic and molecular studies in four clinical domains: (i) psychiatry (autism vs psychotic-affective conditions), (ii) rheumatology (osteoarthritis vs osteoporosis), (iii) oncology and neurology(cancer vs neurodegenerative disorders) and (iv) immunology (autoimmunity vs infectious disease). Diametric disorders are important to rec ognize because genotypes or environmental fac- tors that increase risk for one set of disorders protect from opposite disorders, thereby providing novel and direct insights into disease causes, prevention and therapy. Ascertaining themechanisms that underlie disease-related tradeoffs should also indicate means of circumventing oralleviating them, and thus reducing the incidence and impacts of human disease in a more Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Foundation for Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health.

Tradeoffs are caused by physical laws andbiological constraints that limit ability to respondoptimally to each of multiple tness-related chal-lenges [ 1]. As such, tradeoffs necessarily cause devi- from adaptations, considered as phenotypesthat represent fully optimal ts to the environment that would lead to maximization of tness. For humans, deviations from adaptation can be conceptualized in terms of departures from good health, which manifest in risks and symptoms ofdisease. Tradeoffs are indeed, by this simple logic,fundamental evolutionary causes of human disease risks [ 2]. But what are the opposing selective pres- sures, and what is trading off with what to mediate liabilities to human disease? We suggest that human disease risks influenced by tradeoffs are commonly diametric, i.e. opposite toone another, such that sets of diseases often come in inversely associated pairs. Diametric diseases, dened here as sets of diseases that show oppositepatterns in their causation, phenotypes and preva-lence patterns, contrast sharply with diseases thatare comorbid (positively associated) or independentof one another, in that under the diametric modelincreased risk of one set of diseases, in an individualor population, necessitates decreases in another(Fig. 1 ). Diametric patterns follow, in part, from the simple observation that biological systems may vary, and be perturbed, in two opposite direc- tions, toward more activity versus less activity,higher expression versus less expression, larger ver-sus smaller or earlier versus later. Relative extremesof such variation, due to effects of genetic and envir-onmental variation, may then manifest in increasedrisks of diametric diseases. Natural selection is expected to play important roles in the evolution of diametric disease risks, infour main ways. First, long-term selective, evolution-ary trajectories generate the potential for diseasesthat involve alterations in the phenotypes and geno-types under selection. For example, the evolution oflarge human brain size has generated liability tomicrocephaly (much-reduced brain size) throughlosses of function in the evolved brain-growth sys-tem; gains of function are also possible in this evolved developmental-genetic system, leading to macrocephaly (enlarged brain size). Second, posi-tive selection for benecial phenotypes andgenotypes may pleiotropically generate deleterious, disease-related effects, in phenotypes that trade off with them. Pleiotropy is indeed regarded as a univer- sal mode of gene action [ 3], and it commonly mani- fests in tradeoffs [ 4]. Third, two selectively benecial traits, such as strength and flexibility, or social and non-social skills, may trade off with one another, with consequences that are mediated by the form and strength of selection and the genetic bases of the traits. Fourth, disease itself represents a cause ofselection, whose strength depends on its frequency and effects on survival and reproduction. In this con- text, 'diseases' can be regarded as disorders of func- tion or structure involving particular bodily locations or cell types that grade more or less continuously from severe to mild in their effects. These roles of selection, though important for the evolution of dis- ease risks, have seldom been analysed directly or quantied in this framework, so often remain largely conjectural. By the diametric model, genetically or environ- mentally mediated increases in one function, or per-turbations in one direction, should, given tradeoffs, increase risk of one set and form of diseases, whereas a diametric set and form of diseases should ensue from the opposite direction of variation (Fig. 2 ). What is especially interesting about diamet- ric disorders is that, for each set of opposing condi-tions, higher risk for one set of diseases involves lower risk for the other [ 5]. As a result, determining the genetic and environmental causes of one class ofdiseases directly informs us about factors that pro- tect against another class of diseases. Such protec- tion should provide novel insights into preventativesand therapies. In this article, we describe evidence salient to the diametric disease hypothesis from four major do- mains of human disease, (i) psychiatry (autism spectrum vs psychotic-affective spectrum dis- orders), (ii) rheumatology (osteoarthritis (OA) vs osteoporosis (OP)), (iii) oncology and neurology (cancer vs neurodegenerative disorders) and (iv) im- munology (autoimmunity vs infectious disease). For each example, we describe the relevant diseases and their associations with human-evolved adaptation, provide a narrative review of empirical research ndings salient to the diametric disease hypothesis,describe hypotheses and evidence regarding roles of selection in risks and effects of the diseases, and make predictions for future studies that follow from the evidence available to date.

AUTISM VERSUS PSYCHOTIC-AFFECTIVE DISORDERS Autism, which refers here to autism spectrum dis- orders, is dened by decits in social behaviorcombined with the presence of restricted non-social interests and repetitive behavior, with usual diagno-sis in early childhood. Psychotic-affective spectrum conditions include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, dis-sociative disorders and related conditions, all ofwhich partially share a suite of symptoms includingdysregulated and overly negative emotionality, hal-lucinations, delusions and other reality distortions, Figure 1. Three conceptual models for the relationship between two sets of diseases. Risks of diseases A and B are represented by the heights of the horizontally oriented lines, at the beginnings and ends of the arrows. Under the diametric model, sets of diseases are inversely related to one another due to tradeoffs between them, such that increases in risk of one disease result indecreases in risk of the other (as shown by the opposing vertical arrows). Under the comorbid model, diseases are positivelyassociated due to common causes, such that increases in one set are linked with increases in the other. Under the independentmodel, sets of diseases are uncorrelated in risk and prevalence, because they lack shared causes; one example of possible independent responses to perturbation is shown218 | Crespi and Go Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from overly developed and arbitrary salience of percep- tions, overly mentalistic (socially focused) cogni-tion, mania and dissociation of normally integratedthoughts, memories and sense of identity [ 6-9]. Both autism and psychotic-affective conditions(with most study focused on schizophrenia) showsubstantial heritability, with effects from both com-mon single-nucleotide polymorphisms of small ef-fect and rare variants (such as copy-numbervariants) of large effect [ 10], and both sets of condi- tions grade in symptom and phenotype expressionsmoothly from normalcy to severe. Autism was originally dened by Eugen Bleuler, /C24100 years ago, as a symptom of schizophrenia thatinvolves social withdrawal [ 5]. In the 1940s, Kanner and Asperger adopted the term to refer to what theyconceptualized as a separate disorder, with early-childhood onset. Kanner struggled to convincepsychiatrists that autism was fundamentally differ-ent from schizophrenia, and for many years autism was considered by most practitioners as a form of schizophrenia with childhood onset. Kolvin [ 11] demonstrated that autism exhibited early-childhoodonset, distinct from the usual adolescent or young-adult onset of schizophrenia, and subsequentstudies have clearly differentiated the conditions(including a clause excluding dual diagnosis in the DSM). Figure 2. Depiction of the causes of diametric diseases and their mediation by tradeoffs. Genetic and environmental variation or perturbations cause variation in phenotypes with pleiotropic functions that tradeoff with one another, and variation in such functions affects risks of disease. For example, a genetically based lower threshold for apoptosis (programmed cell death) after DNA damage would shift the tradeoff between the benets of cell retention and the costs of retaining damaged cells, which couldincrease risks of neurodegenerative diseases but decrease risks of cancerDiametrical diseases reflect evolutionary-genetic tradeoffs Crespi and Go | 219 by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Epidemiological studies on overlap of autism and schizophrenia diagnoses within individuals, over time, or within families, have produced highly vari-able results, ranging from 0% to /C2450% overlap [ 12], which have been attributed to false-positive child-hood diagnoses of premorbidity to schizophrenia(symptoms expressed prior to diagnosis) as autismspectrum disorders, as well as diagnostic errorsmore generally [ 13-17 ]. The topic of overlap between autism and schizophrenia thus remainscontroversial. Crespi and Badcock [ 18] hypothesized that autism and psychotic-affective conditions represent dia- metric disorders, with mechanistic and non-social cognition (cognition focused on non-social, rule-based systems and asocial sensory perceptions)increased in autism and reduced in psychotic-affective conditions, and mentalistic, social cognition (cognition focused on sociality, relations and empathicconnections) increased in psychotic-affective condi-tions but decreased in autism (reviews in [ 19,20]). By this hypothesis, risk and symptoms of psychotic- affective conditions derive from dysregulated overdevelopment of phenotypes that are unique orhighly elaborated on the human lineage, includinglanguage, complex social relationships, sense ofself, social-causal thinking, social striving and em- pathy. In contrast, autism spectrum condition phenotypes are mediated by underdevelopment ofsuch traits and associated overdevelopment of non-social, mechanistic, abstract and perceptual foci,interests and abilities. Tradeoffs between social and non-social inter- ests and abilities, and between risks and pheno-types of autism and psychotic-affective conditions,are indicated by three main lines of evidence:social-nonsocial tradeoffs, diametric risk and pro-tection and diametric phenotypes. Evidence for social-nonsocial tradeoffs Among individuals with autism, and amongneurotypical individuals, social skills tend to tradeoffwith non-social skills, such as visual-spatial abilities,such that individuals with reduced social skills tendto exhibit increased non-social abilities ( Table 1 ). By contrast, higher pedigree-based genetic liability toschizophrenia shows a strong correlation with betterverbal skills relative to visual-spatial skills [ 33]. These ndings suggest that tradeoffs exist between socialand non-social abilities, and, more importantly, thatautism and schizophrenia are associated with ex-tremes of tradeoffs between social and non-socialphenotypes. This conceptualization of sive ndings that the expression autism isincreased by a combination of low empathizing (so-cial-emotional interest, motivation and abilities)with high systemizing (non-social, physical-worldand rule-based interest, motivation and abilities),especially among males, and that individuals withautism, especially males, commonly show enhance-ments in visual-spatial abilities compared withneurotypical individuals [ 36-38 ]. Conversely, high empathizing combined with low systemizing has been linked with dimensional expression of paranoia and mania among neurotypical females [ 39], and cognitive-empathic skills, such as reading emotionsfrom eyes, are increased over normal amongfemales with borderline personality disorder or milddepression [ 19,40]. Empathizing and systemizing are indeed negatively correlated with one anotherin some studies [ 22-24 ], though not in others Table 1. Evidence regarding diametric correlates between social and non-social skills Task performance associations References Verbal skills negatively correlated with visual-spatial skills after adjustment for general intelligence [21] Empathizing Quotient test scores negatively associated with Systemizing Quotient test scores [22-24 ] Empathizing Quotent scores negatively correlated with Mental Rotation test scores [25] Measure of social interest and abilities negatively correlated with Mental Rotation test scores [26] False-belief task (theory of mind (ToM)) performance negatively correlated with Embedded Figures test performance[27] Social abilities negatively correlated with Embedded Figures test performance [28,29] Social abilities negatively correlated with Raven's Matrices test performance [30] 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test performance negatively correlated with Embedded Figures test performance [ 31,32]220 | Crespi and Go Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from [41-43 ]. Further evidence of tradeoffs comes from studies that compare individuals in technical compared with non-technical training or profes-sions; these studies demonstrate lower empathizing and higher systemizing, and higher levels of autism in close relatives, associated with technical interestsand skills, but higher empathizing and lower systemizing, as well as higher levels of psychotic-af- fective conditions in close relatives, associated with non-technical interests and skills [ 44-46 ]. Considered together, these data suggest that tradeoffs between non-social and social cognition can mediate the expression of autistic comparedwith psychotic-affective phenotypes, with notable differences between the sexes. However, few studies have tested directly for cognitive tradeoffs, and theexpression of such tradeoffs may depend on levels of overall cognitive resources: for example, Johnson and Bouchard [ 21] showed that verbal and visual- spatial intelligence are negatively correlated onlyafter statistical adjustment for general intelligence.Additional studies that evaluate social and non- social abilities, in relation to both autistic and psychotic-affective psychological phenotypes anddiagnoses, are required to evaluate the degree to which these psychiatric conditions reflect, in part, extremes of tradeoffs. Evidence for diametric risk and protection If autism and psychotic-affective conditions repre-sent diametric disorders, then they should exhibit diametric patterns of risk and protection, with fac- tors that increase risk for one disorder protectingagainst the other. One of the most-penetrant risk factors for schizophrenia is a deletion of /C2450 genes (leading to haploidy) at chromosomal region22q11.2; by contrast, duplications of this same re- gion (leading to triploidy) both protect againstschizophrenia and increase risk of autism [ 47] (Table 2 ). Comparable opposite risk patterns (where deletions are associated with one disorder, and du-plications are associated with the other disorder) exist for the copy-number variant loci 1q21.1, 15q11.2 and 16p11.2 [ 16-19 ](Table 2 ), protective effects have not been tested. Similarly tothis copy-number data, high birth size (weight orlength) has been associated with higher risk of aut- ism but lower risk of schizophrenia spectrum dis- orders, and low birth size has been associated withlower risk of autism but higher risk of schizophrenia spectrum disorders [ 53]. Finally, congenitalblindness appears to provide complete protectionagainst schizophrenia [ 59,60], and it also represents a clear risk factor for autism spectrum phenotypes [57], both for reasons that require additional inves- tigation. These diverse but convergent ndingsstrongly support the diametric model, and theyshould motivate further studies that jointly evaluate risk and protection for causal factors underlying aut- ism and psychotic-affective conditions. Evidence for diametric phenotypes from neurological, psychological, epidemiological and genetic data If autism and psychotic-affective conditions repre- sent diametric disorders, they should exhibit oppos-ite phenotypes for correlates of the two sets of conditions, with neurotypical phenotypes being intermediate and 'normal'. Table 2 presents a large set of variables for which such opposite patternshave been described. These ndings support the dia-metric hypothesis, most notably with regard to underexpression versus overexpression of neuro- logical, cognitive and behavioral traits that have ap-parently undergone evolutionary changes along the human lineage. The primary limitation of such ndings is that few of the studies have collected data from individuals with autism, psychotic-affective conditions and controls using the same protocols,in the same paper; moreover, considerable hetero- geneity exists in the consistency of results, especially for autism. As noted earlier, some authors have claimed that autism and schizophrenia are similar, overlappingdisorders, an alternative hypothesis that is in direct opposition to the hypothesis of diametric disorders described here [ 202]. These claims are, we believe, based on a small set of misconceptions, including (i)considering 'social decits' as central to both autismand schizophrenia, without noting that such decits can be due to extremely different, and opposite, cog- nitive alterations; (ii) considering overlaps in riskgenes or copy-number variant loci as evidence of similarity, when the linkages may be due to alterna- tive alleles or genotypes at a locus (or different loci entirely), or deletions versus duplications of the same copy-number region and (iii) not consideringthe expectation that some proportion of autism spectrum disorder diagnoses will represent false- positive diagnoses of premorbidity to schizophrenia(psychological and psychiatric problems in children who will later develop schizophrenia), especiallyDiametrical diseases reflect evolutionary-genetic tradeoffs Crespi and Go | 221 by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Table 2.

Evolutionary considerations and clinical implications The diametric hypothesis for autism and psychotic- affective conditions can provide insights into human cognitive evolution because it is evolutionary changes along the human lineage that provide scope and structure for psychiatric symptoms. As such, human brain evolution has involved enhancementand elaboration of social-cognitive phenotypes, and cognitive traits that show clear diametric pheno- types, such as human language [ 204], and imagin- ation and creative cognition (B. Crespi et al., submitted for publication), are expected to haveevolved along a trajectory toward the cognitive phenotypes that are overdeveloped in psychotic- affective conditions. Schizophrenia 'risk genes' are,by this hypothesis, expected to include genes that mediate social cognition, imagination and lan- guage, with 'risk alleles' commonly mediatingenhanced performance [ 205] or tradeoffs [ 20]; these considerations are generally concordant with the'social brain' hypothesis for human brain enlarge- ment and elaboration [ 206], and connect it with risks for psychiatric disorders involving social cognition and behavior [ 207]. In contrast, autism 'risk genes' may, at least in part, mediate enhanced performancein non-social tasks [ 208] that trade off with social abilities. A primary clinical usefulness of the diametric model, with regard to autism and psychotic-affective conditions, is that it generates reciprocal illumin- ation between the two sets of conditions, such thatndings for one set of disorders immediately gener- ates insights and novel research questions with re- gard to the others. Such insights extend directly to pharmacological and behavioral therapies; for ex- ample, antagonists for the GRM5 glutamate recep-tor have been developed to treat individuals with autism spectrum disorders [ 209,210], whereas agonists for the same receptor are being developed and tested for schizophrenia [ 211]. Similarly, behav- ioral therapies for autism in young children com-monly target enhancement of imaginative cognition [ 212] but therapy for psychotic-affective conditions focuses on reducing overly expressed and dysregulated social-imaginative cognition [213]. Systematic application of insights from thediametric model has the potential to guide research along novel and promising paths, with implications for both psychiatry and how human behavior has evolved. OA VERSUS OP OA is classically dened as the breakdown of articu-lar cartilage in highly mobile joints [ 214]. However, the disease also involves changes to bone. In par-ticular, OA-afflicted joints undergo subchondralbone sclerosis (increased bone density under cartil- age) and develop marginal osteophytic growths (bone spurs) [ 215] that represent major causes of morbidity. OP, by contrast, is characterized by the loss of bone and deterioration of internal bone microstructure and trabecular networks [ 216]. This loss of bone occurs through imbalance in bonehomeostasis, whereby the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of deposition. OP increases the risk of fractures, especially at load-bearing sites such as thelower spine and hip. Although not fully understood, the etiologies of both diseases are widely accepted as multifactorial, with both environmental and gen-etic components playing important roles in patho- physiology [ 217,218]. OA and OP have been hypothesized as inversely related for many years, originally based on clinical and epidemiological observations of patients withOA rarely being afflicted with OP, and vice versa [219-221 ]. Since these initial observations, consid- erable evidence salient to the diametric hypothesis has accumulated from clinical, epidemiological, mo-lecular and genetic data (summarized in Table 3 ). We discuss this evidence in detail as it has not beencomprehensively reviewed elsewhere. Clinical and epidemiological evidence Bone mineral density (BMD), which represents a keyaspect of both OP and OA, shows clear contrasting patterns between these two diseases. Thus, whereas OP is fundamentally characterized on the basis ofreduced BMD [ 257], signicant increases in BMD have been associated with OA [ 247]. Similarly, higher BMD measures have also been found in women withOA affecting the hands, knees and lumbar vertebrae [249]; the same association was also found in two other studies of postmenopausal women [ 250,252]. In a comparison between women with OA and women with OP, the OA group has also been shown to exhibit signicantly higher BMD scores at fourDiametrical diseases reflect evolutionary-genetic tradeoffs Crespi and Go | 227 by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Table 3.

Additionally, daughters of mothers with OA have increasedpeak bone mass at the hip.[225,226] Risk factors, correlatesApparent inverse relationship between risk factors of OA and OP, such as obesity and mechanical overloading for OA and low BMI or body weight and immobility for OP.[227] Risk factors, correlatesInverse anthropometric phenotypes were observed between women with OA (more obese, had more fat, muscle mass and strength) and women with OP (more slender, had less fat, muscle mass and strength).[228] TGF-/C121locus C-allele of TGF-/C121is more prevalent in Japanese women with spinal osteophytosis (bone spurs, indicative of OA) and much lower in those with OP.[229] LRP5 locus Point mutation in the LRP5 gene causes autosomal dominant high bone mass, a trait of OA, while loss of function of the gene causes OP-pseudoglioma, lower BMD andincreased incidence of bone fractures.[230-232 ] FRZB Lories et al.[233] found cleotide polymorphism in FRZB gene between patients with hip OA compared with patients with OP. Partial replication, for OA, reported byRodriguez-Lopez et al.[234] but other studies did not demonstrate signicant effects.[233-236 ] WNT pathway activationCanonical WNT pathway activation leads to increased bone mass and strength, a char- acteristic of OA, while inhibition of the pathway leads to decreased bone mass and strength, a characteristic of OP.[237] WNT pathway expres- sion and allelesWNT activity increased and WNT pathway genes upregulated in OA patients compared with OP patients. However, no signicant allelic differences were found between OAand OP patients, for 24 SNPs in genes that showed differential expression between OA and OP.[238-240 ] WNT pathway expres- sion and allelesMicroarray suggests in the WNT and TGF- bpath- ways of OA patients versus OP patients and controls. Furthermore, deregulation of WNT and TGF- bsignaling pathways was demonstrated in bone and osteoblasts from patients with hip OA. Samples from patients with OP were not studied.[241-242 ] Gene expression Several genes involved in apoptosis and osteogenesis show higher expression in OA patients versus OP patients, suggesting less transcriptional activity in OP.[243] Gene expression Genome-wide analysis of trabecular bone samples from OA and OP patients revealed inversely methylated and expressed genes between the two groups, especially for genes involved in cell differentiation and skeletal embryogenesis.[244] Bone characteristics Increased bone turnover and reduced trabecular bone quality were observed in patients with OP, compared with retarded bone turnover and increased trabecular bone qual- ity in patients with OA.[245,246] Bone characteristics Signicant bone microstructural differences including bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness and mean roundness were found between postmenopausal women with OA compared with postmenopausal women with OP. Control group not used due to difculty in nding women fully unaffected by either condition. The results 'convin- cingly support the hypothesis that there might be an inverse relationship betweenOP and OA'.[246] (continued)228 | Crespi and Go Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from anatomical sites [ 251]. In a comparable study of eld- erly men, signicantly higher BMD values at the hip and lumbar joints were found in men with OAcompared with controls [ 248]. These ndings convergently support the hypothesis that highBMD is associated with OA and low BMD with OP. Bone turnover, or the rate at which new bone is made and old bone is destroyed, is a crucial deter-minant of the processes that cause OA and OP.Newly deposited bone requires time to strengthenand mineralize. However, in OP, bone turnover ratesare increased, and higher production and activity ofosteoclasts (which remove bone) relative to osteo-blasts (which generate bone) result in the net loss ofbone characteristic of OP [ 258]. OP can thereby re- sult from either the overproduction of osteoclasts,the underproduction of osteoblasts, or some com-bination of the two processes [ 219,259]. The net result is a decrease in both bone quality and quan-tity, with such imbalances in bone homeostasisincreasing the risk of fractures in OP [ 260]. Inversely, bone remodeling is reduced in OA pa- tients [ 219,251], leading to bone overproduction. For example, in measuring bone turnover markers from serum and micro-CT imaging, Montoya et al. [245] found increased bone turnover and poorer trabeculae quality in OP patients compared withOA patients; they concluded that 'bone microstruc-tural changes in OA are opposite to those of OP'[245:304]. Similar signicant and diametric differ-ences between patients with OP OA have beenfound using high-resolution magnetic resonanceimaging [ 246]. Considered together, these ndings support the diametric hypothesis with respect toBMD and its correlates, which represent keymanifestations of bone function and physiology.Anthropometric phenotypes between OA and OP also show evidence of diametric patterns [ 228,251]. Thus, on one hand, women with OP tend to be ofshorter stature with less fat, muscle and strength.On the other hand, women with OA tend to be moreobese with more fat, muscle and strength evenwhen controlling for age and skeletal size. Thesepatterns apparently derive, at least in part, fromthe fact that mesenchymal stem cells within bonemarrow can develop into either bone forming osteo-blasts or fat storing adipocytes [ 261], such that stem cell up- or down-regulation should affect bothtissues. The runt-related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2 ), together with its downstream target genes osterixand osteocalcin, is mainly responsible for regulatingthe patterns of osteoblast differentiation that giverise to these anthropometric patterns. In turn, theperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPAR /C13) controls adipocyte differentiation together with its downstream target genes adiponectin,perilipin 2, angiopoietin-like 4 and fatty acid bindingprotein 4. Dragojevic PPAR/C132 (aPPAR/C13isoform) and adiponectin in OA patients, all of which suggeststhat osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis arehigher in OA. These results observed increases in BMD andobesity phenotypes in OA and provide clearevidence of tradeoffs the cell-differentiation path-way level. The diametric hypothesis for OA and OP also pre- dicts that the development of OA within a patientmay protect against the development of OP. In sup-port of this hypothesis, one study showed that theTable 3. Continued Phenotype orgenotypePatterns in OA and OP References Bone characteristics BMD signicantly higher in OA and signicantly lower in OP versus controls in both men and women from epidemiological studies.[247-252 ] Bone characteristics Levels of osteocalcin were higher in OA groups versus OP groups, suggesting higher osteoblastogenesis (growth of cells from which bone develops) in OA.[253-255 ] Bone characteristics Adiponectin, lipoprotein lipase and hormone sensitive lipase, which are associated with higher osteoblastogenesis and lower osteoclastogenesis, are higher in OA patientsversus OP patients. Authors 'conclude that OP bone tissue exhibits lower osteoblas- togenesis, higher osteoclastogenesis and lower troglyceride metabolism compared or healthy controls'.[256] BMD, bone mineral density; BMI, body mass indexDiametrical diseases reflect evolutionary-genetic tradeoffs Crespi and Go | 229 by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from risk for femoral neck fractures was signicantly reduced in both men and women with OA compared with controls and patients who had suffered hip frac-tures [ 222]. Moreover, elderly women who had pre- viously suffered from fractures due to OP alsoexhibited lower OA-indicator measurements thanthose who had not suffered fractures [ 223]. Family-based studies have shown further evi- dence of diametric effects in OA compared with OP [219,262]. For instance, the risk of hip fractures is signicantly reduced in daughters of mothers with OA [225]. Additionally, peak bone mass in the hip of daughters with OA mothers is increased [ 226]. Twin studies have shown higher BMD in the femoral neck of individuals with hip joint osteophytes (bone spurs) versus their unaffected twins [ 263]. Considered together, and in the context of the sub- stantial heritabilities of OA [ 264] and OP ndings provide evidence of diametric risk effects. Molecular evidence: signaling pathways mediating OA and OP As described earlier, OA and OP can be understood as resulting from imbalances in bone homeostasis, where the rates of bone production, maintenance and resorption are disturbed in either direction. These rates are regulated in large part by the wing-less-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (WNT)/ b-catenin or 'canonical' WNT signaling pathway, which modulates physiological processes in bones and cartilage and has been the focus of several research efforts into the diametric OA-OP hypothesis [ 237,240,241,265,266]. Altered regulation of the WNT pathway, or muta- tions of the genes involved, have been associated in several studies with OA and OP pathology. First, WNT activity is increased in bone samples andosteoblast cultures retrieved from patients with OA compared with those with OP-related hip fractures [240], with WNT activity in patients with OP hip fractures in comparison with OA pa-tients, although allelic differences were not foundfor SNPs in a set of genes that were differentially expressed in OA versus OP. Papathanasiou et al. afrming the dual involvement of bone andcartilage in the disease pathology. Baron andKneissel [ 237] attributed increased bone mass and strength to WNT activation, while the opposite wastrue for inhibition of this pathway. WNT/ b-catenin signaling is essential for both osteoblast prolifer-ation, and in some cases the downregulation of apoptosis. Additionally, osteoblasts (and their terminally differentiated forms as osteocytes) are signaled by the WNT pathway to produce which suppresses produc-tion of osteoclasts [ 237,267]. Osteoclast is also regulated, in part, by RANKL-RANK (receptor activator of nuclear fac- torkB ligand) signaling downstream of the WNT pathway [ 268]. The RANK receptor (receptor activa- tor of NF- kB) located on hematopoietic osteoclast progenitor and is ligand RANKL. Successful RANKL- RANK binding initiates a signaling process that is necessary for the transformation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and in the activation of matureosteoclasts [ 269]. OPG, a decoy receptor of RANKL, binding, and thusdiscourages osteoclastic bone turnover [ 269]. Several studies have identied higher levels ofOPG, and higher RANKL/OPG ratios, from serum, bone specimens and osteoblasts in OP patients compared with OA patients [ 251,255,270,271]. RANKL knockout mice also exhibit severe osteopetrosis (extremely dense bone) [ 272], due to greatly reduced osteoclastic function. Indeed, boneremodeling rates and sites are increased in OP, and the RANKL-RANK pathway has been considered as an important target in pharmaceutical interventionsof the disease [ 268,269]. A third important pathway identied in bone homeostasis is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- b) signaling. Member molecules of the rela- tively large TGF- bfamily play essential and multiple roles in embryonic and postnatal development, cell proliferations, differentiation, apoptosis and other processes. In bone, TGF- bsignaling promotes the deposition of the extracellular matrix componentsCol1 and osteocalcin, which allows osteoblasts to complete their maturation [ 273]; in this context, osteocalcin levels have been used as a measure ofosteoblastogenic activity [ 253]. Low serum levels of osteocalcin have been found in OP patients compared with OA patients [ 251,254], while higher concentrations have been found in serum and mes-enchymal cells of OA individuals compared with OP patients [ 251,253,255]. Such ndings suggest230 | Crespi and Go Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from increased bone formation in OA, which has been veried in clinical observations of the disease. The TGF- bpathway is also involved in cartilage and synovial tissue and has been implicated in sev- eral symptoms of OA such as cartilage degradation, osteophyte formation and low-grade synovitis [ 274]. Data from bone samples of the iliac crest in OA pa- tients found increased concentrations of TGF- band suggest reduced bone remodeling compared withOP [242,275]. An important caveat regarding these results is that few studies have compared molecular or physio-logical phenotypes between OA patients, controls, and OP patients in the same analysis, in part be- cause ethical considerations reduce availability of bone tissue samples from healthy individuals.Despite such limitations, Papathanasiou et al . [239] were able to obtain cartilage samples from pa- tients without disease to use as controls; they foundincreased WNT activation through enhanced LRP5 gene activity in OA versus controls. Similarly,Dragojevic et al.[256] obtained healthy control sam- ples from autopsies, and found differences inosteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis be-tween groups (i.e. OA patients, OP patients and aut- opsy control samples) that were consistent with the diametric model. Further studies that compare bothOA patients and OP patients with controls are clearly needed to provide the most direct tests of the mo- lecular underpinnings of the diametric model in this context. Considered together, these ndings lend strong molecular support to the clinical and anthropomet- ric observations of OP and OA phenotypes,indicating that decreased WNT activity (and com- parable effects from the RANK and TGF- bpathways) engender decreased bone density and strength, whereas increased activity results in stronger bone but adverse effects on articular cartilage [ 265]. This tradeoff is thus mediated in large part by diametricpatterns of pathway activity, such that higher activa- tion leads to greater bone strength, which decreasesrisk of OP and fractures, but increases risk of OA, which causes pain and impairs mobility of joints. Genetic evidence for diametric risk for OA and OP Studies of signaling pathways provide useful evi- dence regarding the diametric hypothesis for OAand OP in that they link the expression of clinical symptoms with sets of genes and proteins. Genesof research interest for these disorders have typicallybeen those involved in bone homeostasis signaling pathways, especially the WNT and RANKL-RANK,and WNT-pathway associated genes have indeed been identied from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of osteroporosis [ 276]. Loss of function experiments on the LRP5 gene, a component of the WNT pathway, have shownincreased cartilage degradation in instability- induced OA models in mice [ 277]. In humans, loss of function of the LRP5 gene causes the recessive disorder Osteoporosis Pseudoglioma Syndrome,which involves severe juvenile OP and frequent frac- tures [ 231,278]. By contrast, a non-synonymous point mutation (Gly171Val) in the LRP5 gene results in autosomal dominant high bone density [ 230,232], which may be caused by the product of the dickkopf gene DKK-1 ineffectively inhibiting LRP5 receptors within the canonical WNT pathway [ 230]. This gene thus shows notable evidence of diametric effects onbone density from loss versus apparent gain of function. The frizzle related protein B ( FRZB ) gene likewise shows evidence of an inverse, genetically based ef- fect in OA compared with OP, in that for the Arg200Trp polymorphism in this gene, individualswith OA showed a higher frequency of the T allele than did individuals with OP, with controls inter- mediate in allele frequency between the two [ 233]. Experiments with mice knockouts for the FRZB gene also show increased WNT activity, resulting in symp-toms of OA including cartilage damage, and bone thickening and stiffness ([ 279]; but see also [ 280]). By contrast, genetic association studies with other markers in this gene, focused on OA, have yielded mainly negative results [ 234-236 ,281]. Conducting direct genetic tests of the diametric model for OA and OP necessitates a larger set of well-established risk loci, or comparisons of GWAS results. Evolutionary considerations and clinical implications How do these considerations relate to trajectories of human evolution, with regard to bone density and associated phenotypes? Increased rates of OA and OP in humans, compared with other great apes,have been attributed to the evolution of bipedal loco- motion, which changes range of motion for some joints, and increased stresses that can lead to spinaland other fractures [ 282-284 ]. Current industrialized and agricultural human populations, however,Diametrical diseases reflect evolutionary-genetic tradeoffs Crespi and Go | 231 by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from exhibit lower BMD than do great apes, fossil hominins and foraging human populations [ 284- 286]. These differences can apparently be attributed to the recent adoption of more sedentary lifestyles inmost human populations [ 286,287], given that bone density peaks in early adulthood in direct relation tolevels of biomechanical loading during the rst partof the lifespan [ 288]. Risk for OP thus appears to now depend strongly on gene-by-environment inter-actions mediated by environmental novelty (seden- tary behavior), which may also be expected, under the diametric disease model, to decrease risks ofOA. Alexander [ 282] likewise describes observational evidence that joint ranges of motion are generallyhigher in two species of apes than in humans, whichmay be ascribed, in part, to upright posture and re- cent changes in human behavior that reduce joint motion. These ndings suggest that risk of OA canbe reduced through increased range of joint motion activity throughout the lifespan [ 282]. Recent human-evolutionary changes in BMD have been inferred by Medina-Go \u00b4mez et al.[289], who used a set of 63 independent SNPs associated with this phenotype to test for recent positive selection, and to infer evolutionary trajectories from the ances- tral versus derived status of high BMD associated alleles. These authors found statistically higher frequencies of high BMD alleles among individuals from sub-Saharan Africa, an excess of derived, low BMD alleles among Europeans and East Asians, and evidence of non-neutral evolution for BMD- associated loci by ve of six tests. These ndings are suggestive of selection for reduced BMD in as- sociation with human movement out of Africa, al- though the selective pressures remain unknown. These studies, though limited in scope, suggest that BMD has been subject to selection in human evolution, and that tradeoffs involved in OA and OP could both be alleviated by reducing the deleterious effects of recent changes in human behavior on de- veloping bone strength and joint flexibility. The suc- cess of such preventatives should depend on thenature of gene-by-environment interactions underlying risks of both OA and OP, and possible genetically based tradeoffs between bone strengthand joint flexibility, both of which will require further study. Moreover, the degree to which novel environ- ments actually influence the presence and strengthof tradeoffs between OA and OP risk remains un- clear, given the strong and diverse evidence for in- verse comorbidity described earlier.CANCER VERSUS NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES Cancer represents a large set of diseases, affecting most tissues in the body, that are unied by the pres- ence of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Among adults, cancer risks increase sharply with age, espe-cially after about age 50, in association with the ac-cumulation of the multiple mutations andepimutations, within specic cell lineages, that rep-resent its primary cause [ 290]. In contrast to the increased cell proliferation that typies carcinogen- esis, neurodegeneration represents increased rates of cell death within a specic, terminallydifferentiated cell type, neurons [ 291,292]. For each neurodegenerative disease, neuronal cell death isrestricted to, or concentrated in, specic regions ofthe brain or peripheral nervous system. A large, robust body of epidemiological evidence demonstrates inverse associations betweencancer rates and thus exhibit substantially ( /C2420-50%) lower neurodegenerative disease risk, and individuals withprobable AD, or diagnosed PD or HD, have compar-ably reduced risks of cancer, by recent meta-analyses[293-296 ]. Such reduced risks apply to a broad range of cancers, with one notable and well-documentedexception: risk of melanoma is substantially higher among PD patients, and individuals with melanoma have a higher risk of developing PD (reviews in[339,340]). This positive association of PD with mel- anoma has been explained by the fact that both dis-eases involve pigmented cells (melanin-producingskin cells, and neuromelanin-producing nigra), such that effects from alterations to melanin-related biochemical pathways; this hypothesis is also sup-ported by lower PD risk among individuals withdarker color of the hair or skin (see [ 340]). Some evidence also suggests that rates of brain cancer(which is mainly due to transformation of non-neur- onal cells, or metastases) are higher among patients with PD and multiple sclerosis than in controls [ 294], which may be mediated by variation among individ-uals in brain-specic upregulation of oxidative phos-phorylation pathways with increased age [ 341]. Additional data on brain cancers in relation toneurodegenerative diseases are required to evaluate the generality, strength and causes of these associations.232 | Crespi and Go Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Table 4.

Increased cancer risk was observed for malignant melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancer and female breast cancer; these effects may be due to risk factors shared with PD and/or to ascertainment biases (increased medical care among PD patients).[297-300 ] Overall cancer risk was non-signicantly decreased in men with PD both before diagnosis (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.57-1.21 in [ 301]) and after diagnosis (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.59-1.22 in [ 302]) versus the reference population. Risk of death from cancer was also non-signicantly decreased in PD patients versus the reference populationeven after age at onset and smoking status adjustments (HR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.43-1.23 in [ 303]).[301-303 ] Overall cancer risk was signicantly lower in patients with PD versus those without the disease (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.59-0.87 in [ 304]; Rate ratio = CI in [ HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.99 in [ 306]).[304-306 ] Relative risk of cancer was higher among PD patients versus age- and sex-matched controls in a Minnesotan cohort (RR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.15-2.35), even when adjusted for smoking.[307] Cancer risk did not differ between a cohort of PD patients and disease-free controls (RR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.70- 1.30).[308] Cancer risk was decreased in PD patients compared with the general population in both men (SIR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.34-1.55) and women (SIR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.35-1.81), although not signicantly so.

TP53 upregulation promotes cell apoptosis, and elevated levels of p53 have been found in mice models and in the brains of patients with AD, PD and HD.[326-330 ] WNT signaling pathway is upregulated in cancer cells, and loss of WNT function is associated with AD.

Cellular and genetic evidence on causes of cancer-neurodegeneration tradeoffs The main causes of inverse associations between cancer and neurodegeneration trace to two charac- teristic features of neurons, compared with other types of cell. First, almost all neurons are long-livedand post-mitotic. Other cell types commonly enter a state of so-called cellular senescence after sufcient DNA damage or upon reaching their replicative Hayflick limit set by telomere length; such cells re- tain benecial functions, but, at least in the shortterm, exhibit a reduced likelihood of contributing to carcinogenetic transformation [ 342,343]. By con- trast, neurons either repair oxidative damage more or less completely, or, if the damage is relatively se- vere, they undergo apoptosis, leading to cell loss. The irrevokable and deleterious nature of cell loss in otherwise long-lived neurons may thus tip cellular pathways away from apoptosis, which pleiotropicallyincreases cancer risk in other tissues [ 344]. Conversely, a genetically based higher tendency to-ward apoptosis in neurons would reduce cancerrisks but promote neurodegeneration. Such effects appear to be mediated, in part, by pleiotropic effects of variation in thresholds for apoptosis or cellular senescence, relative to retention of physiologically active cells [ 345]. Second, neurons exhibit high energy require- ments compared with other cells, and rely primarilyon oxidative phosphorylation, rather than glycolysis, to meet their elevated energetic demands. This en- ergy-related specialization can exacerbate the accu-mulation of oxidative damage with age, which leads to impaired mitochondrial energy production, upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (sinceglycolysis is weak), further DNA damage, and accelerating rates of neuronal apoptosis [ 344]. This process has been recognized as an inverse of the'Warburg effect' that characterizes most cancers, which rely for energy predominantly on glycolysis[346-348 ]. Genetically based tradeoffs between en- ergetic reliance on glycolysis compared withoxidative phosphorylation, and variation in thresh- olds for their use in the energy metabolism of cells, may therefore mediate inverse associations between cancer and neurodegeneration. This energy-based hypothesis is further supported by observations that the two populations of neurons especially highly af- fected by neurodegeneration, hippocampal and de- fault-mode network neurons in AD, and within the substantia nigra in PD, demonstrate rela- tively high energy requirements compared withother neurons [ 349,350]. Several specic genes and molecular pathways have been identied exhibiting diametric associ- ations between cancer and neurodegenerative dis- eases, some of which link directly with the considerations described earlier. The gene PIN1, for example, codes for a protein that mediates cellproliferation and cell survival through effects on pro- tein folding. A functional promoter polymorphism in this gene shows an inverse genotypic association with risk of AD compared with cancer [ 320,321], with increased gene expression in cancer and decreases in AD. Similarly, the APOE4 allele, which represents a strong risk factor for AD, shows evidence of nega-tive association with risk of cancer [ 324]. The tumor- suppressor gene TP53 , which directly controls tradeoffs between apoptosis, cellular senescence and cancer [ 329,351], is deleted or downregulated in most cancers, but demonstrates increased ex-pression in brains of subjects with AD [ 328,352]. Two signaling pathways, the WNT pathway and theubiquitin-proteasome pathway, also show opposite alterations to activation in cancer compared with neurodegenerative disease [ 331,353,354]. Finally, a meta-analysis of transcriptomic data for AD, PD and schizophrenia, in relation to lung, prostate and colorectal cancer, showed clear evidence of opposite gene-expression changes between these two sets of diseases [ 338]. These opposite alterations provide evidence that molecular tradeoffs mediate the in-verse epidemiological links between cancer and neurodegeneration, in the context of the unique cel- lular phenotypes of neurons as well as pleiotropic effects from genes and signaling pathways that are fundamentally important in all types of cell. Despite the clear tradeoffs underlying diametric risks of cancer and neurodegeneration, both setsof diseases are strongly age-related and driven, ul- timately, by accumulation of damage to DNA and other cellular components [ 347,355]. Most import- antly for disease etiologies, what differs betweenneurons and cancer cells is the opposite nature of234 | Crespi and Go Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from responses to such damage: in neural regions subject to neurodegenerative diseases, the response is apoptosis; by contrast, among incipient cancer cells,it is genetically based abrogation of apoptotic ma- chinery combined with uncontrolled replication [344]. Such divergent effects are seen from some large-effect germline mutations in genes regulating cell proliferation: for example, losses of function in the gene PARK2 lead to dysregulated cell cycle entry that in neurons (which are post-mitotic andincapable of replication) causes cell death but innon-neuronal cells promotes uncontrolled cell repli- cation and carcinogenesis [ 356]. The common causes of aging, neurodegeneration and cancer are also seen clearly in syndromes of premature aging, which are caused by losses ofDNA-repair function [ 357], and in the reduced cancer incidence and severity found among healthy centen-arians, who presumably exhibit reductions in accu-mulation of damage to DNA [ 358]. DNA repair deciencies in neurons have indeed been linked witha broad suite of neurodegenerative diseases [ 359, 360], and represent an additional causal factor mediating risks of cancer and neurodegeneration.Such positive influences on risks for both sets of diseases, from variation in overall levels of DNA damage, must however be considerably less import-ant than diametric molecular and physiological ef- fects, to account for the strongly inverse epidemiological patterns between cancer and neurodegeneration found across many studies. Evolutionary considerations and clinical implications Alzheimer's and Parkinson's appear to both repre- sent human-specic diseases [ 350,361], such that evolutionary changes specic to the human lineage have potentiated their risks. The anatomical coinci- dence of primary Alzheimer's-related neurological effects with the human default mode brain network [362,363], which subserves stimulus-independent thought [ 89], suggests that a human-specic high metabolic rate within this region may thus underlieliability to AD [ 364]. Similarly, human brain evolution has been characterized by expansion in size and importance of the dopaminergic system [ 365], which is expected to have generated risk forneurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons, such as those in the substantia nigra, that are especiallyhighly active and therefore more prone to damage from oxidative stress [ 350]. These hypothesesprovide potential explanations for why humans ex-hibit neurodegeneration in these two principal mani- festations, and they suggest that genes andpathways modulating risks for AD and PD have been subject to positive selection in human evolutionary history [ 366]. The primary clinical and research-related implications of inverse associations betweenneurodegeneration and cancer derive from applica- tion of research ndings across these two domains of disease, such that causes of one set of diseasescan be considered as possible protective or thera- peutic agents for the other [ 311,367,368]. Of par- ticular importance would be situations wheretherapies for one disorder may be expected to in- crease risk for the other; for example, cancer chemo-therapy has been demonstrated to increase risk of AD and other forms of neurocognitive impairment, by increasing rates of neuronal loss through apop-tosis or other mechanisms [ 359,369,370]. Similarly, treatments or preventatives for neurodegenerativedisorders might be expected to increase risks of can- cer, unless they focused on reducing rates of the DNA damage that mediates risks of both sets ofdiseases. Dovetailing of results from GWAS ana- lyses of neurogenerative diseases with those from relatively common cancers would be an especiallyeffective means to identify shared primary causes, and diametric genetic mechanisms and pathways, that underlie risk. INFECTIOUS DISEASE VERSUS AUTOIMMUNITY Autoimmunity represents the mounting of an im- mune reaction against one's own cells and tissues. Such reactions are mediated by several causes,including dysregulated development of self- tolerance and self-foreign antigen recognition dur- ing early development, and excessive and overly prolonged inflammatory responses [ 371]. The pre- cise mechanisms instigating autoimmunity are largely unknown, although most autoimmune dis- orders show high to moderate heritability and many risk alleles have been well validated [ 372]. With re- gard to elevated inflammation in autoimmunity, it is important to recognize that inflammatory responses to pathogens normally result in 'collateral damage' to one's own tissues, as part of the immune re- sponse [ 373]. As such, levels of inflammation, and self-foreign recognition thresholds, should be sub- ject to tradeoffs between (i) efcacy in recognitionDiametrical diseases reflect evolutionary-genetic tradeoffs Crespi and Go | 235 by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from and clearance of pathogens and (ii) degrees of dam- age to one's own tissues [ 374,375]. Indeed, some level of autoimmune (autoantibody) response ap- pears to provide protection against malaria [ 376, 377]. Infectious disease represents one of the most powerful and pervasive selective pressures impact-ing the human genome [ 378,379]. Haldane [ 380] rst suggested that such strong selection from dis-ease could maintain resistance alleles even if suchalleles exert deleterious effects in other contexts, such as sickle cell anemia in the classic case. By this general reasoning, strong selection from infectious disease risks may exert deleterious secondary effects largely through increasing risks of autoimmune dis-eases, if the effectiveness of pathogen defense trades off with risk of immune reactions against one's own cells. Evidence for risk of autoimmune disorders trading off with risk from infectious disease comes from three interconnected lines of research. First, anotable number of immune-system locus alleles areknown that increase risks of one or more autoim-mune diseases as well as protecting against one ormore infectious diseases; inversely, some allelesthat are protective against autoimmunity mediate increased risk of infectious disease ( Table 5 ). In some cases, such tradeoffs are known to be driven by the effects of the alleles on expression levels ofproinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines[388]. Second, many risk alleles for autoimmune dis- eases have been demonstrated, with molecular-genetic data, to be subject to strong positive selec-tion in humans [ 375,379,384,395-397 ]. In such cases, the 'autoimmunity risk' alleles have appar- ently been favored over evolutionary time scales be- cause they confer protection from infectiousdisease. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region8.1 haplotype, a 4.7 Mb region found in /C2415% of Caucasians, represents an important example ofsuch pleiotropy involving protection from infectiousdiseases and increased risk of a suite of autoim-mune disorders, for a locus that appears tohave been subject to strong positive selection [390-393 ]. Third, several studies have shown geo- graphic associations of autoimmune risk alleles with higher pathogen diversity [ 382,395,398], or higher frequencies of proinflammatory (and other defense-related immune-system) alleles among individualsof tropical, compared with temperate, ancestry [ 399, 400].Considered together, these three lines of evidence convergently support a hypothesis of strong, genet- ically based tradeoffs between protection from infec- tious disease and risks for autoimmune disorders, leading to diametric risks. An important caveat with regard to such tradeoffs, however, is that risk for expression of autoimmune diseases also depends notably upon whether an individual develops in the ecological environment to which their ancestors were adapted, or, by contrast, in an evolutionarilynovel, more hygienic ecology [ 401,402]. Thus, by hypothesis', immunesystem development of early-life ex- posure to parasites, commensals and mutualists; development in evolutionarily novel environments that lack such exposures may result in an 'overactive' immune system with the infectious-autoimmune tradeoff skewed toward autoimmunity [ 375,402]. For example, risks of the autoimmune disorder sys-temic lupus erythematosis are on the order of 6-8 times greater for women of African descent living in the developed world than for women in Africa [ 403], and risks for multiple sclerosis are likewise substan-tially increased among individuals of African or Asian descent who were born in UK [ 404]. These ndings indicate that infectious-autoimmunetradeoffs are exacerbated by genetically based im- mune-system mismatches to novel, more-hygienic environments (notably, for individuals from regions whose microbial ecologies are most similar to those of human ancestral environments), such that gene by environment interactions play important roles in tradeoff expression and effects. A primary implica- tion of such ndings is a strong case for preventa- tives and treatments for autoimmune diseases, and research designs to study autoimmunity, that take careful account of gene by environment interactions,environmental novelty and genetic ancestry. A nal dimension of the interface between auto- immunity and infection risk is sex differences: al- most all autoimmune diseases show strong femalebiases in prevalence [ 405], which may be due, at least in part, to more robust and reactive immune sys-tems among females than males [ 406]. By contrast, infectious diseases tend to be male-biased in inci- dence and severity [ 407,408]. Determining the de- gree to which such sex differences are indeed due to by immune-system tradeoffs should also providenew insights into the prevention and treatment of autoimmune and infectious diseases.236 | Crespi and Go Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from DISCUSSION We have described epidemiological, genetic and molecular evidence, from four disparate medical do- mains as summarized in Fig. 3 , that suites of major human diseases exhibit diametric causes. As such,these diseases can usefully be considered in twocontexts: as manifestations of relative extremes as well as failures of adaptations and as reflecting, in part, maladaptive consequences of tradeoffs be-tween opposing optimal functions and selectivepressures. The primary importance of these resultsis that they demonstrate substantial roles fortradeoffs and diametric effects in human polygenic disease risks, and they may direct research andclinical efforts along novel, productive paths thatwould not otherwise be recognized as such. Each of the four areas of inverse disease associ- ations described here has been postulated or dis-cussed previously, but the conceptualcommonalities between them, and their broadly ap-plicable nature, are described here for the rst time.Diametrical disorders have at their core the intrin-sically bidirectional nature of biological processes,whereby expression or activation can be increased ordecreased from some contextually dependent opti-mal value. Such processes include variation in geneexpression modulated by alternative alleles at alocus, variation up or down in overall pathway acti-vation due to single-locus, epistatic or pleiotropicTable 5.

Overview of major diametric phenotypes, across the four domains of disease analysed here. See text and other tables for details. For psychiatry, this table focuses mainly on psychological phenotypes238 | Crespi and Go Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from effects, variation in developmentally regulated sizes of tissues or organs that develop from more or less shared precursors, and variation in development or function of major body systems, such as the im- mune system, hematopoetic system or brain, along major axes of discrete, microscopic or macroscopic function. In this general context, the presence, nature and strength of tradeoffs may often depend upon bothindividual condition, and the degree to which in- creases in one phenotype necessitate decreases in another, due to pleiotropy, functional dependencies, other constraints on global optimization or degrees of homeostatic control. For example, high risks of OP or OA may only obtain at the low or high ex- tremes of WNT signaling in bone tissue, due to some combination of genetic variation, gene by en- vironment interactions and reduced homeostatic control. By contrast, risks for neurodegeneration compared with cancer may depend on factors that influence overall DNA damage (individual 'condi-tion') as well as on how sharply an individual's en- ergy production and cellular-apoptotic pathways are tilted toward one set of diseases versus the other. Similarly, tradeoffs between verbal and visual-spatial skills only appear after controlling for overall IQ [ 21]. Tradeoffs in disease risks may thus resembletradeoffs in evolutionary ecology, in that their ex- pression and strength depend at least in part on overall condition and available resources [ 409], which are determined by both genetic and environ-mental contingencies. On one hand, some tradeoffs could thus be entirely precluded by ideal rearing con- ditions; on the other, some genetically or hormonallymediated tradeoffs may be inescapable, such that truly optimal health can never be achieved. Recent cultural change represents an important environmental condition influencing risks of human disease, given that humans are more or less adapted to ancestral conditions [ 410]. Mismatches between ancestral and current conditions thus appear to bedirectly involved in the recent increased expression in human populations of autoimmune disorders, mediated by increases in hygiene [ 402], and OP, mediated by more-sedentary lifestyles [ 286]; longer lifespans may also increase risks of both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, intensifying thestrength of selection from both, and sharpening tradeoffs between them. Deleterious gene by envir- onment interactions due to evolutionary mismatches may thus increase the strength of dis- ease-related tradeoffs, to the extent that they resultin diametric diseases being expressed to anincreasing, and more balanced, degree, and to the extent that the diseases impact upon tness despite their usual ages of onsets relatively late in the lifespan. What are the expected roles of natural selection in generating and maintaining tradeoffs in disease risks? The tradeoff between infectious disease riskand risk of autoimmune diseases is clearly driven by strong positive selection for resistance to pathogens and parasites [ 374,375,384,395-397 ,411], which increases the frequency of alleles with net benetsunder joint selection from infections and autoim- mune diseases. The importance of selection for the other three sets of diametric diseases remains more conjectural, but in each case, human-evolutionary trajectories, or ancestral selective pressures, can be plausibly inferred and empirically evaluated. Thus, human social-cognitive and affective adapta- tions have evolved to be much more complex than in great ape ancestors, which has apparently generatedrisk of psychotic-affective disorders such as schizo- phrenia [ 207] that, under the diametric model, mani- fest in extremes of elaborated social-brainphenotypes such as paranoia, auditory hallucin- ations and megalomania. Selection in this case has presumably favored 'schizophrenia risk' alleles, many of which also represent alleles 'for' complex and imaginative social cognition in neurotypical populations (B. Crespi et al., submitted for publica- tion) [ 412]. Risks for neurodegenerative diseases may likewise have been driven by selection for increased energetically demanding neuronal activity in particular regions of the evolving, expandinghuman brain, especially the default mode network and dopaminergic regions, as described earlier. Finally, the presence of healed and unhealed bone fractures in hominin fossil remains (e.g. [ 413-415 ] suggests that fractures are likely to have representednon-trivial causes of morbidity and mortality across human evolutionary history; by this reasoning, on- going selection for strong bones would generate and increase risk of OA. Osteoarthritic damage has been commonly described from the hominin fossil record [416-419 ], although its quantitative incidence re- mains unclear. More broadly, Jurmain [ 283] reported signicantly lower incidence of OA andosteophytosis (bone spur formation, which is associated with OA) in chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos compared with humans, which he attributed, in part, to the obligate bipedalism of humans.Diametrical diseases reflect evolutionary-genetic tradeoffs Crespi and Go | 239 by guest on October 12, 2015 http://emph.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from These hypotheses regarding selection pressures and evolutionary polarities, although largely specu- lative, can be subject to robust tests through gen- omic analyses that combine GWA tests for disease risk alleles with analyses of positive and balancing selection. Indeed, to the extent that one disease be- comes less common over time due to selection and genetic response, its opposite would be expected to increase in frequency, a process that may tend to maintain genetic variation for disease risks in nat-ural populations. Such studies may also be useful in evaluating the degree to which disease risks other than infectious disease, and effects of antagonistic pleiotropy, represent causes of selection in recent human evolution. The relative degree to which major sets of human diseases exhibit inverse associations, compared with patterns of positive association in comorbidity, remains unknown, but comorbidities have been much more widely studied and appear to be more common [ 420]. Why should this be so? First, most diseases involve losses of function in adaptive sys- tems, which are expected to be more likely responses to genetic or environmental perturbations than gains of function; effects of increased activation or expression may also often be prevented or ameliorated by negative feedbacks. Such losses may often affect overlapping disease-related tissues and organs. Comorbidities may also be generated when reduced function of one system increases probabilities for dysfunctions or failures of others. Second, diagnostic uncertainties, overlaps and falsely categorical diagnoses can generate comorbidities that are more apparent than real; forexample, the psychotic-affective condition border- line personality disorder exhibits high comorbidity with depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse [ 421], mainly because its diverse diagnostic phenotypes, causesand symptoms overlap broadly with those of many other psychiatric disorders. For such conditions, di- mensional classications along quantitative symp- tom axes may provide more biologically justiable and useful frameworks for diagnostics and treat- ment than ones that are categorical [ 9]. Additional analyses of the conditions under which diseases exhibit diametric, compared with positivelyassociated, patterns and causes, should guide fur- ther study of the roles of tradeoffs and pleiotropy in human disease. A primary benet of focusing on the diametric nature of disease risks is that it jointly il- luminates the causes of two sets of diseases as wellas providing direct insights into factors that protect from risk and may serve as novel agents of therapy. For example, single loci that exhibit diametric gen-etic effects on risk, such as LRP5 in OP and OA, and PIN1 in cancer and AD, demonstrate dosage- sensitive effects on disease-relevant pathways,which typically represent good indicators of enzyme or ligand-receptor systems that are especially amen- able to pharmacological intervention. funding The authors thank the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Grant Number 611201) for nan-cial support. acknowledgements The authors thank Jon Wilkins and two anonymous reviewersfor their insightful comments on the original draft of thisarticle.
