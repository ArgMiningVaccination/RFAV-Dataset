Is the increasingdeath rate from heart disease caused by a change in America's / .eating habits? In anattempt-to answer these questions an importan.0stUdy hasebaen made. Let us ,examin.e'some of the findings which haveresulted from this' gtudy.- 2-3The. Is cholesterol associated with coronary heart disease?A studyofapproximately pOG men and women began in 1949 andis dtill in progress. tMlese people lived in Framingham, Massachusetts,'a light \"ihdustrial and residential tbwn, west of'Boston.; When. the -?study began, the subjeqts ranged in agja from 30 to 62Oars.None 4Ay had arecord of heart diqpase .or disease of BiomediM1 Social Science in Unit I. The purpose of the Framingham Study is to determine what factors- 11444are associated with the'aevelopment'of (called vascular for evidence of the development of thesediseases.'The Feamingham Study is the largest, longest and most tcareful study of the occvrence of heart digease yet made in thelinited States. 'RAcords have been kept of each person's weight,'amount 9f physical activity, andcigarette smoking habits. The amount_af substance called cholester91.in'the blood is determined duringthe examthations.. *I41 a mome4.6 we will examine a graph that presents sdme of the.results of toheVramingham .Study,But first it is nebessary tew ter4.The coronary arteries are the vessels thae to the heart muscle itself.Coronary heartdiseaieis As a.result, theheart muscle does not receiveSufficient blood or oxygen to function properly.

It is trarisgorted to other parts of the body via the-blOodstream.Although it has useful functions inthe body4 excesscholeiterol, has been suspected fbr some time to be a contributor toCoronary heartdiseasesFor this reason the concentration of,Oholesterol in the bloied has been measured in the Framingham Study.The results are shown in Figure 2 on the following page.'The cholesterol concentration is given in-milligrams of choles-terol, per. 100milliliters.of blood.'Notice that the vertical axis of the graph is labeled \"relativeA.ncidence.\"Relativeincidence.comparestthe incidence of a diseaseamong a certain grop of people to the incidence of the disease amongall of the people being studied. It is 100 times the ratio of therisk for some part of a group to the risk for thp entire group. Thusa relativeincidende of 200 for the'group of men-are twide aslikely to have covonary heart disease as all of the men in the studyoombinee. .bn the other hand, the graph shows%that those men with,acholesterol concentration below 180 get coronary heart disease only41 per cent as pften as the Framingham ben in Oneral.A..The,gragh shows an increase 'in the incidence of coronary heartAdsease withincreasing cholesterol concentration. Men at thd high1 4.. 'aind of the \u00b1ange are five times as likely. to have coronary. heart.disease.as men.at the-low end. The study therefore *supports the.idea that high cholesterol level's contribute to CONCENTRATION, rn3 of coronary heart disease and cholesterol. .-10This finding suggests that 'nutrition plays an impOrtant role in.heart disease. It is the kindof information that made Fred St\u00f4ne'sdoctor 'put him on a cholesterol-lowering diet. 2-4Fatty Foods and the 1.Iart why.is North Kyrelia known as \"the land of young widows?\"While heart disease is a leading cause of death. in the UnitedStates, the highest death rate from this disease in theworld occursin a village in Northern Finland. Based on the Framingham Study -'and on other studies you May have read about, you may associate heartattacks with fat, middle-aged men who have high blood pressure, smokeheavily, and live a highly pressured life. Recall that Fted Stonewas a little on the heavyside, middle-aged and smoked. Hisjbloodpressure wasnormal and wereally don't know from the story hether 44.cf.. he was highly 'pressured. He had ,some of the traits, indicating thathe was a candidate fOr Ilkheart attack:In the'heartattack capital of the world, the rustic town-of'North Kyrelia, Finland most of:the victims are lean and musculai.Their occupations are hot particularly,stressful eMotionally or,psychologically; they're mainly dairy farmers and licberjaCks.'MeseFinnish people not only have a rep4ation,for being asygoing andfriendly, but they live in' a natural setting that's relaxing.Yet, 175'per.cent of all nd'think.the loCel diet; Which is rich in .dairy fats, and low in v getables, is the chief cause'of the high,incidence of heart att ks.The blood cholesterol level armmig thesepeople is extremely hi h.,In Finland, many en drink twoquareS of milk a day aril alsodrink fresh cream.

Unfortunately. we can't answer this. question.Statisticals,studies of the kind we:have discussed indifcate a correla-tion between many different factori aria heart disease. But, as youmay recallfrbm Unit lof both Sp4ence and Social Science, suchstudies do not prove.a cause-and-effect relationship. What can be,stated in a pbsitive way is that several factors increase the riskthat a person will have a heart attack. These factors include nutri-tion (especial,ly cholesterol, fats, salt), excessweight, high blood pressure, smbkin lack of exercise, family history (genes) and '4.t.personality./ We will return to a consideration of*the risk faidtorsin heart-disease,in Unit III-when we One final' uestion to coAsider is: .Why have all thistime on 4edk.t disease?

List four factors in addition to cholesterol that are associated withcoronary heartdiseases What is the dlet like inilorthKyrelia, the \"heart attack capitalof theworld?What do dieticians consider to nutritional problem inthat,community? SECTION 3:THE DIGESTIVEPROCESS 3-1The Divestion of Food What Must happen to food before it can enter the body? As you\"may know, diriestion.is the process by which the large,complex molecules of our.food are broken dbwn'into,small, relativelysimple molecules: The cells of our bodies must receive nourishment, :andthe.digestion of ,foodld is the first'sep in the process that make:thi,s possible.,\\The nutrientsneeded by our cells are carried to them by the,bloodstream.For this to-happen, the nutrients nmst besoluble:inthe blood.In addition, th y must be in a form which permitsthemtO be absorbed into ithe bloctdstream tfirough the walls of theintestines.fo Digestion accomplishes both of thesethings.The food moleculesare brokendown into molecules tMat are both soluble in blood'addsmall enough to pass ipto the blood. At the end oftheir journey,the small molecules pasObvtut of the blood and into the cells wherethey are needed. Simcg you willsbe dealing with carbohydrate's, proteins andfats ,in the mathematics course, this is a good place to define them.They will be considered in more detail a little later in the unit.Carbohydrates are sugar molecules or combinations of sugarmolecules.AmcIng other functions, they provide energy. Table sugaris made up oaf two simprer sugar molecules attached to ther.Otherfoods rich in sugar are'honey, maple syrup, candies a jellies. Sometimes sugar molecules are combined in long chains as instarch.-A few examples of starchy foods are bread. pizza, spaghettiand breakfast cereals. In the sections to follows wa will see thatlong-chain caibohydrates stich as starch are.broken down in the diges-tion process into sugars. These, in turn, \"are broken down' into stillsmaller molecules within Our cells.Proteins are long chains of amino acid molecule's. They vary inmoleciiraight from several thousand to hundreds of thousands (amu)*Some h*gh-proteIn foods are meat, fish, eggs and soybeans.Proteins,like sjlarch, are broken down in the digestion process. The productsof pr tein digestion are amino acids.These substances can entercells where they may be restructured into proteins needed by'the body.Proteins are an important part of our body structure fhair,bones,skin and so on).Fat molecules are large in comparison to such molecules as NaC1,acetic acid, and amino acids.However, they are much smaller thanprotein and starch molecules:A few examplesof fatty foods aresalad 'dressings, butter, walnuts'and'sausagel. Fats are similar toproteins and starch in that they, are broken down in the digestiveprocess intosmaller'mOlecules. Gram for gram,fats provide the mostcalories of any class of nutrients.Calories are not nutrients, but they are important in any con-sideration of the diet. They are a measure of_the energy content oEfopd.It is important that. the-caloric value%of the food we eat beneither too high nor too low.In this Country, too many calories in ,the diet 1.6 often a concern.Such dietsr can-result in obesity. ExampleV ofhigh-calorie foods include ,faty and starchy foods.by contrast, green leafy ,vegetables and many fresh fruits are, low*in calories.1-2Anatoml;)of the Digestive SystemWhat are the organs that compose the digest4ve system?, .In Unit I, it was necessary to .examine thestructur'e and partsof the respiratory 'system in order td, dhderstand the proCess of res7piration.It is equally necessary to examine tbedigestive systemin oxider tounderstand digestion and nutrition. , 0The simplest way to pAct re the digestive system is as a tubeof varying size running throu h the body. Food enters One end of; 10 the tube,'the mouth. the food travels along, part of it isdigested and absorbed 'through the walls of the tube% What is left.over passes out through the other end, the anus. *IAs can be seen from the figure on the next ii.age, the digestivetract is folied back on itself many times and would be about eightmeters long if stretched Mit.. It consists ofseveral distinct patts,each having a different function.4'the entrance to the digestivs system is the mduth, Which includesthe teeth, tongue and salivary glands. Digestion begins in the mouth.Food passes from the mouth down a tube called the esophagus to thestomach.Food is temporaril)/ stored in the stomach, and furtherdigestion takes place there. .From the stomach, partially digeste food enters the small in- .testine.The first 25 to 30 cm of the small intestine are called theduodenum.Three glands, the 'pancreas, the liver and the gall bladdererelease materials into the duodenum to aid digestion. Digested foodis absorbed through the surface of the small dntestine into the body.What has not been absorbed in the small intestine pasSes into thelarge intestine, where further absorption takes place. The undigestedresidue leaves the body at the opening of the large intestine, calledthe anus.In this section, we have barely touched On the organs of digest-tion and their functions. Our purpose was simply to provide an ove-all picture of what happens to ths food we eat. . Inthe sections tofollow, we will return to each of the organs of digestion andexaminethe processes that occur within them in more depth. .3-3Anatomy andAdaptation 7How is the gastrointestinal tract adapted to its function?The folding of the digestive tract permits a great length ofeubing to be housed in a relatively small,volume. If it werelimited to a straight tube from the mouth tothe anus, the lengthwould be less than a meter instead of eight.meters% ,This increasein length has a real advantage.It increases the surface area avail-able for absorption of food.As you read the text, you will findcouhtless examples of anatomrical structures (organs, cells, even -molecules) that.have an \"architecture\" 'beautif4ly suited to theirfUnctions.We speak of these structures as being adapted. Mostbioloaists believe that adaptation (the process of becomin7 -adapted) '.is the result of millions of rears of evolution. The theort of,evo-.lution will be considered in a:iater unit% In the'meantime,. At willbe very helpful to raise questions about the relation of anatothicalstructure to function. In most ,cases., you will find that our struc-0ture is consistent with function.

This chemical process is of fundamental importancbecaugea gelitiquous supply_a_molecules is needed for our cells tosustain life.tet the chemical reactions by themselves would be oplow to prevent starvation if there were not more tO the story.

In others, gastric secretion maycontinue at a high level when food is not present in the stomach;There is also evidence that-in some cas,es psychological or emotionalstress may lead to such an imbalance, although the mechanism by whichthis happe s is unclear. When a condition is caused by psychologi-)1cal facto s, it is said to be psychosomatic (psycho = mind, soma =body)..tWhateverthe cause of the imbalance between secretion and theprotective mechanisms in the stomach, the result-is often a lesionot sore in the lining of the digestive tract. This lesionii-WiEwe call a peptic ulcer.The pain 'and burning associated.with an.ulcev may be partly due to the acid_acting on nerves fexposed by the lesion.fi peptic ulcer may occur in the stomach, in which case it iscalled a gastric ulcer, or in the duodenum, in which case it is aduodenal ulcer. About 90 per cent ofiTrulcers occur in the uppersection of the duodenum. Gastric ulcers occur most frequently inthe inner curve of the stomach and in the area of the pyloric valve.Their occurrence in the outer curve of'the stomach and in the loweresophagus is less toomuch acid can be pisleading. Such commer ials are about acid indi-gestion, not ulcers. Stomach acid, in no al amounts, is ess ntialto .the well-being of the stomach.Recall that acid is xequi an acidic pH.How did Dr. Miller determine that Maria was suffering from a ,peptic ulcer?He found twoinitiallclues in the history,that shegave him.The first of these was the fact that she obtained tem- ..potary relief from pain by eating. 'this 'Pain-fo9d-relief sequence:is much more common in duodenal ulcer than in gastric ulcer.Thisis understandable because, not only does food 'decrease the effectof the,acid on the stomach lining, but its presence in the lower endof the stomach and the duodenum also stiMulates the release of fluidswhich neutralize the acid passing into the duodeium from the stomach.Because Otients who have a duodenal uller obtai relief by ,eating,they may eat more frequently han normal.A consequence of this isthat patients with duodenal u cer Cases the patientmay lose weight because eating-makes.himuncomfortable.Another difference'between the symptoms presented by:duodenal.'atid.gaStric Ulbers.has, to do with the amount of acid and Oepsinogen.'that'.the.patientsecreteS.. In most:of the-Casea of. dAodenal These findings reinforcethe ulcet iq not aS simple. ae .secretion,\" but .is 'more complex and clue in:Maria's'history'that temporary 'telief to both duodenal and ,gastriculcers. -An antacid tends to neutralize the acid of the stomach.Ant',aCids that.can ee ob ained without carbon dioxide andwater, and theoverall effect is to reduce the acidity. Althoughsuch antacids do relieve\\symptoms, their prolonged use is not recom-mended.Bicarbonates the hydrogen-ion concentration(pH) of the blood in controlling breathing. Excess bicarbonate inthe blood lowers the hydrogen. ion concentration and raises the pH.The condition of high blood pH is alkalosis. (RespirOory Alkalosiswas caused by Tom's hyperventilation.) Because lead to alkalosis, doctors usually presdribean antacid that remains in the digestive tract and is not absorbedinto.the blood.The other symptoms exhibited by Maria when she was admitted tothe hospital, low bloOd.pressure, sweatiness and cold hands and feet,ndicate mild shock, a condition often caused by loss of blood. .Thedoctorllready Suspected an ulcer from the temporary relief providedby eating and antacids. The symptoms of shock suggested to him thatblood ws being lost. That the loss originated in the digestivetract was confirmed by the analysis of Maria's feces, which weredarker than normal because of the presence of digested blosd.. Mariarlot only had an ulcer, she had a bleeding ulcer. Bleeding'occurswhen the ulcer lining of\"a blood vessel.The of%a peptic ulcer was confirmed by an X-ray. Be-cause the digestive tract itself does not normally show up on anX-ray the patient)it given a drink of barium sulfate appears theX-ray, it is possible to visualize the digestive tract by using thismethod.Defects in the stomach wall or duodenum can sometimes bedemonstrated by this process.Once an ulcer has been diagposed, treatment is begun. The ob-ject of this treatment is to relieve pain and to heaA.the ulcer.Antacids are usually the primary medication used. Antacids relievepain quickly and neutralize the excess acid that sometimes causes, ulcers.Asmentioned.before, antacids that do not rely on bicarbon-ate ionsarepreferable.Also because the stomach is constantlyemptyingitscontents into the duodenum, antacids must be given atshort intervals (about one hour) to insUre their continued effective- .ness._ In the case-dik an ulcer in which hypersecretion is present,a drug may also be giNien to suppress gastric secretion. If emotionalfactors are thought to be qignificantly involved, tranquilizers mayalso be prescribed.Caffeine and alcohol are generally prohibited for ulcer patients,because both of these .drugs are known to increase gastric secretion.'In addition,, cigarette smoking is banned. For some tinkpown reason,smoking retards the healing of ulcers.The effectiveness of special diets in the treatment of ulcersis questionable: Holvver, when employed, dietary treatment is in-tended to neutralizebxcess acid and to_endourage healing by avoid-ing foods that irritate the ulcerated area. Several small mealsare preferable to a few large meals. Large meals stretch the stom-,ach and cause greater secretion Of gastric\"juices. Many small meals,however, result in food being in'the stomach,a greater percentageof the time.This is particularly helpful in the case. of duodenal 3 25 ulcer 'far reasons stated previously, . .Smaller meals also reduce theirritating effect that food may have on gastric ulcers. ,Peptic ulcprwas.tradit:ionally treated with a diet that empha-/sized drinking millk And cream many, times a day.These foods arerich id fat, and the presence of-fat in the stomach causes food.tobe yetained longer beformlit is released to the duodenum.'Despite the possible benefits of a diet including the frequentconsumption of milk and cream, this practice is no longer recoMmendedfor ulcers.Excessive milk and cream result in a diet that is toohigh in calcium and fats* Such diets may lead to other medicalproblems.It was assumed for many years that a diet of mild foods (abland diet) was preferable to a more,normal diet., itbwever, recentinvestigAions discount this theory.. It has been shown that the',rate of recovery of peptic ulcer patients with normal diets is not.significantly different from the recovery rate of patients withblandp diets.The current attitude toward dietary treatment of peptic ulcer . 1is to suit the diet to the individual patient. Specific foods that 'irritate a patient's digestive tract are excluded.Surgery is mquired in only a small fraction of 'peptic ulcercases.It is used only if thd patient has suffered fre ent recur- :1 rpces or complications. The preferred surgical treatm t is re-,mal of part of the stomach. This not only rids the pa ient of 'the gland cells secreting acidand pepsinogert- which may decrease the chance of a recurrence. Ifthe doctor feels that. emotional factors are the predominant. cause, .he may recommend that the vagus nerve be cut.The reason for thisis that emotions/such as anxiety, etc., can cause secretion of gas-tric juice.The( vagus nerve is the pathway by which the nervesignals are transmitted to the stomach.Pepti-6,ulcer is one of the more common disorders of modernAmerica.Liretween 10-and 15 per cent of our population at one time*or another'suffer from, ulcers.Duodenal uiper is most common betweenthe ages of 20 and 501' while gastric ulcer may occur at any age.Peptic ulcer is the fourteenth most frequent cause of death in theUnited States, being responsipld for 0.5 per, cent of all fatalities.If an ulcer remains untreated,it may.eventually penetrate pbrf9rat1on (opening)?

The rateat 'Which toad moves out of the stomach is determined by the strengthof these Contractions. When the.contractions are strohg, the,foodenters the duodenum more .rapidly;, of the contractions?One factqrthe amoullt Of chyme in the stomach. But the most important factorthe chemicalcomposition and the amount of chyme in the duodenum. 43527' * Protein, igt.t, acid and even the pressure exerted by the chyme stimurlate gbands located in the walls of the duodenum to secrete hormones.Hormones are a speCial class of secretions that are releasedinto the bloodstream and are carried by theiblood to other organswhere they haire an effect on the functions(of those organs. (Thesecretions of the salivary glInds, for example, are not ho nes;because they are released directly into the'mouth, rather tifan thebloodstream.)--Thus'the duodenal hormones are released not into the duodenum,but into the blood. Some. df them are carried to the stomach, wherethey act on-the nerves that control the 'contractions of the stomach,causing the contractions to become weaker.We will see shortly thatthese hormones have other effects, as well. 4Fats in the duodenum are especially effective in slowing downthe emptying of the stomach.For exatple, a high-fat meal, such aseggs and. milk, may take more than six,hours to pass out of the,stom-ach, while a. meal of protein and carbohydvate may take less-thawfourrs. This is a useful adaptation, since fats are digestedand absorbed more slowly than most other components of food. 7-2How is pH Regulated in the Duodenum?One of the enzymes active in the duodenum is amylase, which youmay recall.breaks down starch into sugar. Amylase is active in themouth, but becomes inactsive in the stomach because it functions onlyat pH values near neutral.The chyme entering the duodenum fromthestomach is acidic. How then can starch digestion occur in theduodenum?,The answer, once again, lies with the duodenal hormones. 'Theyare cart ed in the blood not only to the stomach, but also-IO the ,pandreas.The pancreas is an extremely active gland. In responseto the ddenal hormones, it secretes .up to about 2.5 liters .ofpancreat c juice each day into the duodenum. One of the functionsof this jilikce is a react with the the bicarbonate helps to neutralize the.4inating in the stomach.

Moreover, cholesterol is convprted in the body to many otherneeded compounds.Another importhnt function'Of the liver is to convert Somepoisons in food into less harmful compounds that are easy to excreteThis is calleddetoxication. .One of the most significant contributions of the, liver, to thedigestion process is the production ofa'substance called bile.Bile is needed for the breakdown of fe4 in the duodenum., 29 7-'4Bile and the Solubility of FatsHow does bile help to digest fats?Once the pH in the duodenum has..been adjusted, a whole seriesof digestive enzymes released in the pancreatic juice can begin tocatalyze the kreakdown of proteins, cvbohydrates and fats.The fat is called a lipas4 becausechemists fats with a group of substandes called 14ids.'Lipids are.not grouped together because of chemical similarity, butrather because of similar solubility properties--they art insolublein water ,and soluble in many organic solvents. This solubilityproperty of fats creates a problem in digestion.Since fats are insoluble in water, thei separate from .water asoil separates from vinegar.' On the other hande-lipase is solublein Nater but not in fats. The problem confronting the body iswtoalge a large area of contact between lipase\u00b0and fat; if they are not'in contact, llpase cannot catalyze the breakdown of fat. .Oil andIvinegarNian be mixed by shaking; however, the movementof food in the duodenum is notvigorous enough to mix the water lay-and the fat layer.Two insoluble liquids can be cat ed to mix by forming ap emul-sion.An emulsion is a systet in whione liquid issuspended iniiiaher.A that cuases one quid to form an is emulsifying agent.

SECTION 9:DISORDERS OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.0.9-1Hepatitis .40,What are the two forms pf viral hepatitis?There are many important medical problems related to the di-gestive system. We have already referred to heart disease and pep-tic 'ulcers.In this section, three major illnesses related to gae4digestive organs will be discussed, along with a number of minoicomplaints.Hepatitis is,becomihg increasingly common in the United. Statesand is conside;ed first. \"Hepatic\" means \"related to the liver.\"The suffix \"-itis\" means \"inflammation\" so hepatitis iS an am-mation of the 14.ver. Incidentally, mlny seemingly difficult mdicalterms become easy to define if you take the words apart.Forxam-,ple, what is\"laryngitis?\"Hepatitis may be cause4 by certain chemicals, drugs, bacteriaor viruses.. We will direot our attentiOn to inflammations causedby viruses; or viral hepatitis.There are actually two differentkinds of vlral hepatitis., ,One is called\"infectious hepatitis\"and the other \"serum hepatitis.\"Both types areincreasinglyimpor,tant health prOblems in this'country., 4u. In a sense, the term \"infectious\" may be a little misleading.*41.both ace infectious--they can be passed from one individual toanother.But they/are caused by different viruses and the vbrusthat causes infectious hepatitis Spreads more easily, explainingits name.On the other hand, serum hepatitis can be spread onlyvia serum, explai ing its rAme. (Serum is that'canbe extracted from clotted blAbd )Infectious iepaitis is transmitted when the food or waterconsumed by a p rson has been contaminated by even tiny amounts ofthe virus from previous victim. This virus id found in feces,'urine and blood It is most likely -CO spread as a result of unsan-itary food hand ing. Infectious hepatitis may also be transmittedthrough,contacti with contaminated blood. For example, you couldget jelfectious 04atitis from a blood transfusion. Because .of its ptransmiSsion tilrough food'and water, infectious hepatitis may occuras an epidemicInfectiouhepatitis is probably more common than thought be-cause most cases aTe mild and usually go unrecognized. However, amildly i4Nperson can give\" someone elde a severe case of hepatitis.In contra#t with the infectious hepatitis virus, the serumhepatitis viruS can be transmitted from one person to another onlythrough blood. For this reason, epidemics of serum hephtitis areunlikely to oc6ur. Cases can often be traced to a transfusion froman infected person via a blooll bank. One'outbreak was caused by adoctor who did not sterilize a syriiwe and infected 40 patients,but this sort of occurrence is very rare.More often, serum hepa-titis is passed to only one person at a time.For example, a druguser who shares a needle with a friendmay also share hepatitis.At one time, tattoo parlors were a frequent source of serum hepa-titis.' However, with better sterilizing techniques and with lawsregulating, these 'parlors, tattooing has become much safer.1People infected with infectious hepa4tisdevelop symptomstwo to six weeks after the virus enters their bo&y. Serum hepa-titis takes longer to be noticed--from six weeksirto six months. HQW-ever, the symptoms of the two types of viral\\hegatitis are almost*identical.In 80 pet cent of infectious hepatitis cases end 20 percent of-serum hepatitis cases the first signe,are symptoms such asfever, fatigue and loss of appetite that cannot be attributed to aspecificidisease. \\Hpadaches and disorders of ttib gastrointestinaltract, ?rich as diarrhea and vomiting,'may also occur. It is alsoof interest that many smokers develop a distaste for.cigarettesat this stage.The symptomscOuld indicate many disorders, However, as thedisease progresses, symptoms develop which are more specific forhesatitis.The first of these id that the person's urine tqrnsdark yellow.Tfie second symptom is the condition known asjaundice.Jaundice i4 characterized by a yellow color in theskin an^d of\\the eyes. P! 38 Jaundige and dark yellow urine'are both caused by an excess inthe blood of a pigment called bil'irubin. Red blood ceils are con-tinually breaking down and being replaced.

Immunityresults from manufacturing,blood proteins known as antibodies. Anti-bodies are very specific for a given disease. Thup, 'a;victim ot in-fectious hepatitis is not immune to serum hepatitibr nor is a per-son who has had serum hepatitis immune to infectious hepatitis. ,A person suspected of having recently been exposed to a hepl-titis virus can sometimes be protected by receiving ail injectionof a milcture of blood proteins from a large number ofrdifferentdonois.Such mixtures of \"pooled\" blood are maintained at blood\\ tanks.Pooled blood may include samples of blood proteins from10,000 or more.donors.f The assumption is that some of the donorswill have recuperated from infectOus hepatitis and.will have anti-bodies in their blood. In actual prevent it,is neces-sary to review, the anatomy of the digestive trAct in the area ofthe duodenum.The parts of the anatomy that are relevant are theduodenum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and particdlarly the ductsconnecting them. The are illustrated in the following diagram.(This is a schematic diagram;.the Gallstones are masses of solid matter that form in the gall-bladder.As you mayorecall from the laboratory, they are'most com-monly composed of cholesterol, bilirubin, bild salts and calciumsalts.It is not knoWn why gallstones form, but it is known that.women have a greater tendency than men to develop gallstones, andthat theY'develop more frequently in'individuals over 40 and inindividuals with diets high in fats arkd calories.

These juices contain proteinases, the enzymes thatbreak down proteins, but in an inactiVe form so that they do notattack the pancreas itself. .A gallstone can blOck the pancreatic duct or any of .the smallerducts branching from the pancreatic duct. If this happens, pan-creatic juice is trapped in the pancrees.Proteinases may becomeectivated in the pancreas and inflame the lining.Gallstones can also block the common bile duct in such.a way.-Olat bile enters-the whether bile ir-.-.ritates the panc eas directly or activates enzymes which then at-tack the pencreas. Whichever is the case, bile is associated withpencreatitis.'Treatment forpancreadtis often involVes a modified diet.Thefoods are generall bland and the use of alcohol is discouraged.

The electron structure ofwater is represented as.H:orH:: H104pH (Remember that the electrorfLdot formula does not represent the shape'of the mOlecule.) 4The- unusual propeties of water cain be-traced'to the bonding.,,ffetween the oxygen and hydrogen, The boncling electrons are shared byoxygen and hydrogen 'atoms, but they are not shared equally.' They aremore attracted to the oxygen atom, and these electrons being near theoxygen give this atom a slightly negative charge. Since the electronshave been pulled away from the hydrogen, these atoms have-a slightpositive charge. H+The situation is somewhere between (1) even sharing of a pair ofelectrons by oxygen and hydrogen, and (2) donation of an electron byhydrogen to\"oxygen. In other words, the nature of the bond is betweena covalent'and an ionic bond.A molecule that is positively chargedin one part and negatively charged in anothec part is said to loepolar.Our study of electrostatics reimaled that opposi.X.e chargesattract one another. Negatively charged oxygen atoms attract posi-tively charged hydrogen atoms of other molecules, so water moleculesare drawn together.H+\\11+-4-04-11+This,attraction between H atoms of one molecule and 0 atoms of othermolecules is called hydrogen bonding.

Hydrogen bondingt also occurs in other biologi-cal substances; for instance it is important in the structure ofprcAins.10-3 Hydrogen 5onding and the Properties pf Water How does the structure of water explain its unusual properties?Let's consider how hydrogen bonding'affects the properties ofwater.First of all, why isn't_water a gas. at room temperature? 6A substance exists as acliquid cl)ra solid rather than as a gasWhen,the attraction be en molecules (or ions) overcomes the parti-cies' tendency to boun ff one another and move about rapidly. Hy-drogen bonding between water molecules increases the attractionbe-tween molecules. For this reason H20 is a liquid when we would'ex-pec't it to be a gas, based on its molet.ular weight.-Why does it take so. much heat (calories)*to raise the temperature 'of water?You may recall (Unit T, Section 15-6) that when a 5as is'heated, the molecules move more repiday. Temperature is a measure ofthis motion..Themolecules of liquids ana'solids also move faster -when heated, but since the molecules are held together and cannot movevery far, they, vibrate more 'rapidly 4n a restricted space. Tempera- .ture is a measure of the speed With which they vibrate,..Hydrogen bonding makes it more difficult for water moledules to-vibratethey may be thought of as \"stickier.\" ,Therefore, moreenergy isreqUired to increase'their speed of vibration. This ex-plains'why more calories,are needed to raise the temperature of waterthan the other liquids Ve considered:,Another property of water that is important o living thingsis its ability to dissolve ionic substandes. These substances musthe dissolved in order to be absorbed and transported by the blood.This ability to 'dissolve substances can be explained by the polerityOf '14bater molecufes. When sodium chloride is placed in water, thesodium ions, being positively charged, are atthcted to the oxygenatoms of water, while negatively and Cl- ions.''How do these unusual properties of water affect life on thisplanet?Let's consider first the relatively large amount of energysrequired to heat water. 48 One calorie'of energy from the sun falling, on the ocean canraise the temperature of one gram of'water by one Celsius degree.4.ut the same calorie of energy dan raise the temperature of one gramof other common liquids by about two degrees.If the oceans werefilled*with alcohol or ether,\\temperatures relatively.little the temperature of the.ocean does not fluctuate asgreatly as the temperature of the land:(One calorie can heat one'gram of rock about five Celsius degrees.) This is important to ourclimate and it Fhy coastal areas do not experience 'the temperatureextremes, that ailo common inland.Water serve6 the saMe function of moderating the temperaturewithin our bodies. The heat generated during exercise tends to causean increage in body temperature.But for lany biological processesit is critical that the temperature be within a narrow ranqe. Farexample, many enzymes do not function attemperatures slightly abovebody temperature. Also, heat is generated in many reactions in cells.If this heat were ,not absorbed by the large percentage of,our bodiesthat is water, important enzymes would be inactivated and( importantbody reactions would nearly stop. But water absorbs the heat, withan increase in temperature only about half`the increase that wouldoccur with most other liquids.Waterdontributesito the control ofbOdy temperature.The functioning of our nervous system d9pends on the presenceof potassium ions within the cells and sodium ions outside the cells(in the blood, for instance,. If water were ,not acsolvent for'ionicsubstances, Na+ and K+ ions could not exist within our cells and bodyfluids.These and other important ions are available for variousbody funcAons because of the unusual properties of water.Such ionsare available-to us because, despite its relatively low molecularweight, water is a liquid; and water is so polar that it can dissolveionic substances.10-4 Water as a NutrientWhy is water such an important nutrient? ,Some people think they are'\"solid citizens,\" but they are mostly. .water.Everybody, is.If you are a male in your late teens, sixtypfr cent of your body is water; if you are a female of/the same age,the percentage is about 5ti(since a larger proportion\\of your bodyis fat).Water is an essential component of all cells. It is the mediumin which most of the cheMical reactions of the Body occer.Water isrequired for regulation of the bcdy'stemberature, and it is alsoessential in lubricati.ng the joints.Wateris obtained by the body not only fom the water we drink,but from other liquids and soli'd foods as well.

Water leaves the lungs thrdugh the nose and mouth'as a vapor.(You have seen this vapor condensing on a cold morning.)A thirdroute is through thelcidneys, as urine, and the fourth is throughthe intestines, Where water passes out the feces:The table below gives typical quantitiesclf water which enterand leave a person's body dUring a coffed, soup,-etc.). 1100Solid foods. ....... - 2400 Mote that the amount of water taken in by the. body is equalto the amount of water lost by the body.

However, mos* nutrients have similar properties toOther nutrients. We take advantage of these similarities by.placingnutrients into five-groups, as we did when discussing digestion inthe first sequence of this unit. The five groups are carboffydrates,fats, proteins, vitamins and. minerals. The division into groups ismadevaccording to the ways in which pdtrients are digested/and theways in which they are \"Used in body; 1Digestion takes place by a sittesof chemicaLreactioAs, andthe body uses, the products of digpstion in further chemical reactions.The products 6kthe digestion of carbohydrates, fats and proteinstake part in chemicAl reactions that provide energy to\\the body.Bone and tissue are,built from proteins and minerals by cheMicalactions.Vitamins and certain minerals must be present for many cfthese and 'other reaCtions to occur. Therefore, a'knowledge of chem-ical properties of nutrients is'essentiarto an understanding ofnutrition.The chemical propqrties of a'subttance reflect the arrang9mentof atoms within the molecules of the substance. Thus we find thatall carbohydrates have similarities in theiemolecular structures,as do all fats and all_proteins.,, AOVitamins differ from minerals in that vitamins contain theelement carbon, while minerals'do nqt. ,Carbohydrates, fats and pro-teins also contain carbon. The chemistry,of cOmpounds containidgcarbon is so importarit, especially to biology, that it is consideredto be a separate braach of the subject, called organic chemistry..Compounds, such as vitamins, carbphydrates, fats and proteinse thatcontain carbon are said to be organic, while substances that do notcontain carbon, minerals for example, are called inorganic.Since chemisfry is so fundamental to an understanding of nutri-tion, and since so many nutrients are compounds containing carbon,or/anic chemistry is introduced in the next section.

This means that a neutralcarbon atom 8ontains six elections, two in ilhe first shell and fourin the second ,shell. It is the four electrons in the second shell-that are'involved in the chemical reactions of-ea-rbon. We mayrepresent the carbon atom by,its electrondot withother atoms; carbon can share four electrons and thus form four bonds.A hydrogen atom has one electron.

Thus many compounds contain long chains of carbonatoms.These carbon chains ae the backbone of organic chemistryand the reason why over a million differeht organic compounds exist.The carbon atoms may be in a chain, or they may form moleculesof other shapes. ,Five carbon atoms, for instance, may pentane thetrue shape of the mOlecule.The straight, but zig-zag shaped.) .Five carb ' are called structures.* and neopentaneall have formula C 5-12,but their structures afe nthe same.When we say that their structures are different, we m anthat atoms are riot bonded to each other in the same arrangement.Thus, two,.of the five carb'ons in normal-pentane are bonded to onlyone other carbon. These two carbons are also surrounded by threehydrogens.Each of the otheA three carbons of normal-pentane cacbQns,are bonded another carbon an4 three,hydrogens.One is bonded to two carbons and two hydrogen, and the_fifth carbon is joined to three carbons and just one hydrogen.Inneopentane, one carbon is bonded to all of the other four carbons.Be sure you do not confuse this situation with the fact that thesame strUcture may be drawn in different ways..

The products of the gestionof both sugars and starches are monosaccharides, but the rat s ofdigestion'are different. Hydrolyzing a stakch chain into monosac-charides requires more time than aplitting a disaccharide. Ancl.monosaccharides do not have to'be'chemically changed at all.Inother words, sugars are digested much more rapidly tpap starches. Because sugars are digested.more rapidly than starches, they4re absorbed into the blood in a shorter period of time.This rapidAbsorption temporarily results in a high concentratiori of glucose blood.To understandwhy this highconcentratioll of glucose maycause a problemp we must consider what happens to it after it.entersthe,rblood.Glucose is used by the body for energy, but if more glucose isavailable than the 'body immediately*needs, it is converted in theliver to glycogen, which is stored for future use.

Of these 90,over 20 are needed by some type of living,thing or anotier. About -20. are known to be needed by man. They are neededfor\\rowth and.for the maintenance of good health... Carbohydrates, fats and proteins contain the'elementS carbon, 'hydrogen and oxygen. In addition, all proteins contaih nitrogen apdmost contain sulfur. .But our bodies need other elements as well.These-other essential elements are called minerals,The word \"mineral\" is used invarious ways, so we Willexplainhow we will be using it. In geology, a mineral is a specific sub-stance with aTcharacteristic crystal structure.For example,Apatite,which has the/lormula Ca5F(PO4)3, is a mineral to a geologist. Hop-ever, in nutrition we say that calcium and phosphorus are minerals!\".This does not mean that you should include uncombined phosphorus inyour diet; the white form of phosphorus ignites in the air at roomteMperature and is otherwise very toxic.In fact, your body is ablet ;to digest, .Absorb and use phosphorus only if it occurs in certainf/,compounds, such as phosphates. We use the word \"mineral\" to mean an,i element that is required by our andfthat includelphosphorus-containing that our bodies can use to obtain' 0 ./.phosphorus for their needs.Many 'of theprocesses'of the body involve electrical charges andi'_depend on the presence of positively or negatively'charged ions. he .fluids of.our bodies, including blood,.are in many ways like sea water;in sea water, the most abundant cations are sodium (Na+),' Magnesium'(Mg+2),- calcium ourbody fluidS.'

For imetance,studies of the effects of die'i\u00b0on health led to new diScover\u00b1es.about the roles played by ma4y nutrients in the functioning of thebody.The ways rn which the body uses protein, fat and carbohydfa el,as well asmineralsf-came to be petter understood.'Anothei set of ideas originated in the.studies of Louis Pasteurand others, who identified microorganisms, such as bacteria, as thecausesorfmany diseases. The theotly that-microorganisms cause dis-ease was found to be so useful that scientists tended to use thetheory to explain any puzzling disease. 41107 However, certain dis ases could not be ,explained by the micro-organism theory. t was foun1 that many of these.diseases are re-lated to diet: Thocqir when a diet is deficient in some type offood, but they can Je revented by including even a small amount ofthat food in the d e .One disease that was found to be related to diet is a disordercalled beriberi. Beriberi involves nervb-dmmage, which can result inImuscular weakness and loss of the sense of touch. _It was discoveredthat individuals with a diet of refined (polished, or white) ,ricewere Ausceptible to beriberi, but that a small amount of unrefined\":(brown) ricein the diet prevented beriberi. Some ingredient re-moved from rice by refining was assumed (correctly) to prevent 'the.disease.The first known association of diet with beriberi occurred in1885. ,A medical officer of the Japanese navy-named Takaki determinedthat beriberi could be avoided'by including in the rations of thesailors more vegetablesfmeat and fish, and fess rice.In 1890 a Dutch physiciarrnamed Eijkman, working in a prisonhospital in Java, recognized a connection between a diet of polishedrice and the occurrence of beriberi in the prisoners--and also inchickens that wtre fed on the prisoners' leftovers. It happened thatthe chickens were switched from polished rice to brown rice, andEijkman noticed that symptoms of beriberi disappeared from the chick-ens.However, Eijkman concluded that.the prisoners'and the chickenswere getting beriberi because of some poison added to the' rice in therefining process. #,Later, in 1901; a physicianknamed Grijns, who worked at the same .hospfital,, correctly identified the cause of beriberi as the absenceof a beneficial substance rath r than the,presence of a- harmful one.He concluded that a substarib-e- present in the shell of rice, the brown 0shell that is removed,in refi ing, prevents beriberi.4By 1911 it was apparegt that other substances, in addition tothe nutrient that prevents AuSt be Polis essential substances (The prefix \"vit-\" isfrom the Latin word for \"life\"; at the time it was thought that thesubstances were-amines.- Thus'the,name meant /vital amines.\" It isnow known that only a few are aMines, but the name, without thefinal \"e\" has lasted:) The substance in brown itice that preventsberiberi was given the name vitamin B.A vitamin is an organic compound that is required in small quan-'tities for the proper functioning of the body. The vitamins thatinterest us in our study of nutrition cannot be made,in sufficientquantity by Vie body and must be 'supplied by-the bodyrequires very small:quahtities ol vitamins--less than 50 grams peryear of all ofthem combined.

The authorities inLonaon failed to appreciate Lind's dtscoVery and it was soon forgot-ten, but a generation_later the fact that scurvy is related to dietwas rediscovered by the British captain, James Cook, during his ex-ploration_of the Pacific.\"... Cook attributed-the _fact that none of his ...*diet.Sdon lime s and other citrus fruits were included in th diet't .crew suffered from scurvy to the inclusion of saudtkraut in t eir - ,of British sailors--thus the name \"Limeys.\".Dr. Lind and Captain Cook did not identify the substance thatprevents scurvy; they only determined that it'was an ingredient .of acertain foods. . (This was enough, because it enabled Cook to far 'outrange rival exOlorers, who were forced-to turn back because ofthe-illness of their,crews.) When the term \"vitamih\" was coinedearly in this century, the name \"vitamin C\" was given to the sub-stance'that prevents, scurvy. The molecular structure of the sub- ,stance' was later determined and it was named \"ascorbic acid.\"Vitamin C and ascorbic a4d are the same substance. .The B vitamins and vJ,tamin C are solublefin water.

It is important to remembei that most pro-cessed food, frdin soups to'nuts)- includes added sodium chloride. The hypothesis has been made that a. chronic excess .of sodiumin a'diee may contribute to the development of hltertension.

It has been sug-gested that excessive salt in the diets of infants may cause them todelfelop high blood pressure as adults. lob much salt in an infant'sfood. is-commonAn. the United States. A quart of bow's milk contains'about 600 milligramS of sodium.. An infant cobsuming a quart of milkdaily obtains .600 milligrams of sodium per day from thiS-sourcealone.Most babies in the United States receive, in addition to milk,supplemental foods consisting of strained meats, eggs, vegetables .and fruits.Although strained fruits contain almost no sodium,100 grams of strained meat may contain up to 360 milligrams of so-1dium, while 100 grams of s ained vegeltables contain an average of250 milligrams of sodium. Thus an infant consuming k quart of milkplus 100 grams of straine meat or vegetables obtains about onegram of sodium. This is a common diet for a five-month-old babywho meighs about 15 pounds. This one gram of sodium for a 15-poundbaby is equivalent to tsn grams of sodium for a 150-pound adult.Another diet that includes a large quantity of sexlium is the so-called \"soul food\" diet. \"Soul food\" owes its characteristic tasteto huge amounts of salt and the way it\\is cooked. Much of the foodis salty when purchased: pickles, pig's feet? salt pork and sau-sages, to list soMe examples.Other foods, such as gritsy greensand okra, etre not naturally salty, but are prepared with salt orsalt pork to give them the \"soul\" taste.A blacg American is More likely to suffer froM high blood pres-.stxre than a white American. This may 'be caused by a genetic predis-Position to ehe di.sorder, or by the particular stresses that blackPeople experience. However, it seems likely thac the athount of .116 .sodium is at least a contributing factor in this disease-among'people who eat \"soul food.\"4(' 21-3 Vitamins in the DietHowcan me obtain suffIcient vitaminsin our diets?. ..If the purpose of eating were simply to obtain enough protein,fat,and calories, we could live on four quarts of ice cream everyday.Although this might seem \"like fun, there are reasons for eat-ing what dieticians call-a \"balanced\" diet--a diet that contains'meat, dairy products, graI.ns (either as bread or as cereal), vege-tables and fruits. A balanced diet is recommended not only because,it provi'des variety, but because different minerals and vitaminsare obtained from different foods. By eating a wide variety offoods we obtain'a broad spectrum of nutrients.Very little vitamin C occurs in dairy products or grains andalmost mine in meat. However, many fruits and vegetables are richin vitamin C.The following table indicates the milligrams of vita-min C per 100 grams of a few foods'. (The RDA tor vitamin C is 45 mgfor teenagers foods is indicative of the presenceof vitamin A.This vitamin is found in various vegetables andfiuits, and also in liver, egg yolks and' buttgr. Margarine and milkare commonlyfortified with vitamin A. Quantities of vitamin A-aremeasured in International Unilts (IU),-rather than the usual massunits.The next table gives the amounts of vitamin A in a few goodsourhes.[The RDA for vitamin A is 4000 IU forfemalesind 5000 -20700 ,rMany of the B- vitamins occur-in grains, such as rice and wheat.It was stated that beriberi was ,caused by a ack of thiamin. Pro-cessing rice and emoving the shell indirect y brought about beriberi,in people who depended), heavily upon this staple. 1'Rib0flavin oprs in a wide variety of \"foods.Good sources arebrewer's yeast, m lkr cheese, leafy vegetables, eggs, lean meats,grains, beans, and chili pepper. Only pure sugars and fats are en-tirely Iacking in thiamin other B vitamins. Ribo-flavin *is destroyed by light, so that bread stored An a clear wrap-per and milk stored in. 4transparent bottle can lose a significantamount of riboflavin if eViosed to sunlight. Codking a 'vegetablefor 'too long a time can de*stroy syitamins. And since B vitamins are6,so1uble in water, if a foockis cooked intoo much wqter and the water.rthen poured Lpff, most of that B vitamins are poured 4ff witii the water.4'The B vitamin, niacin, oOcurs in most of the foods th t are good isources of thiamin and riboflavin, such as whole or enrIchagrains p the e,ssential\\amino acid' tryptophan. Thus if a and niacin is that ourodies canroduce niacin is low in tryptowhan,, more niacin is needed. 9ItA balanced diet should contain Sufficient* amounts of all theB vitamins.Yet nutritional problems 'can still occur if vitaminsare lost in food processing by the manufacturer or the cook. Inview of this problem, you may wonder why grains are refined.. Per-haps the white color of refined grains and flour is associated withhigher quality', because in the past, only rich people .could afford'the more expensive, highly milled grain products.. Another reasonis that refiried grain is easier to store , because rodents and. in-sects generally do not eat it; they prefer unprocessed grains andcoarsely milled flours. Maybe the rats know more than we do:It should be pointed ,out that products made from refined grain.,such as white bread and flour, are enrfched.But of the various .vitamins and minerals lost thiring refinement, only a few are re-turned by the kocess of enrichment.Vitamin pills are'manufactured that are intended to supply thedaily allowance of all vitamins. These pills may provide a personwith all the vitamins he needs, but we can't be sure of this. Thepossibility exists ..that foods contain some vitamins that we do notyet know about. A persoli should supply his daily vitamin needs'with food rather than vitamin peillS.Information on vitamins is sumrna in the , accompanyingtable. 1181?s SI VITAMIN years of age.

Hypervitaminobis A causes drowsiness, headacheand vomiting.Recent studies have indicated that symptoms of mentaldisease can be produced by excess vitamin A. ,The RDA of vitamin A is 4000 to 5000 IU for adults.this amount taken over a period of time can kill infants;over 100,000 /U for a period of time have killed adults.Eskimos have long avoided eating polar bear livers.Early ex..plorers in the Arctic were warned not to eat polatThear livers by.thetEskimos.Some explorers did not listen. Unfortunately these,explorers died from vitamin A poisoning. While.the E\u00e1kimos couldnot have known that polar bear liver contains an extremely largequantity of vitamin A, they recognized that people who ate thes\u00e9elivers died.Ten timesAaily doses Isar4e quantities of'vitamin D also have bad effects.Twenty-(lave times the required amount taken for several weeks causes vom-iting and diarrhea, and also causes calcium to be withdrawn fromthe bones. .Hypervitaminosis dges not often occur.' It sometimes occurswith infants or adults taking vitamin supplements, but is notlikely when vitaMins are obtained only from foods. ,.A current controversy in science concerns large doses of vita-min C, ascprbic acid, Vitamin C has been Claimed to prevent thatdisease whidh has so successfully resisted medical science, the com-mon cold.The man who first made the claim is Dr. Linus Pauling . .Dr. Pauling is a chemist who received the Nobel Prize'in 1954 foris work in theoretical_chemistry and .again in 1962 for his effortit o achieve world peace! His chemical work acted as's catalyst tothe research of scientists studying the structure of proteins andother recommended daily allOkaance oi,ascorbic by taking 1 toriTimspef day, colds may be prevented.Pauling, his wife and several --friends have been taking 3-to 10 grams of vitamin C daily for,up tothirty years.During that time they have had very fiw colds.Pauling has conducted further studies himself and refers to otherresearch which has been done.that supports his position. , .Other scientists, however, have disputed Paulg's Claims.Although there is_no evidence to prove that ascorbi acid does mt.131 prevent,colds, Palliing'S work has been attacked on two grounds.,One is that he has not studied enough cases to obtain meaningfulresults--scientists are-more willing to accept conclusions fromcliniCal studies When the number of cases is large,The'otherobjection is that' the long-range effects on our bodies of.such \"\u00b0,large doses of the vitamin are not known.For example, the effgcton pregnant women of taking large doses of vitamin C' is not kno*h.'Do the systems of the infant adjust to the high level cd the vita:-min?Will the newborn child immediately develop a vitamin C de-.ficiency?These and many related questions are yet to be answered.Is such.controversy harmful to science?Woeld there would little scientific progress.* New,scientificdistoyeries often contradict old beliefs.Constructive disagreementis the base on which .much ofsscience has grown.

Sections 25through 26 are devoted to this topic.In our discussions of chemical reactions, We have assumed that 4they occur, without asking why they occur, howrapidly theyoccur and.whether allreactants are converted to products. These questions'may be approached through the.idea of equilibrium, which is intro-duced in Section 27./ By that time you will have learned enough about how nutrientsserve the body's needs to enable you to examine your own 'diet tosee whether it is adequate for your needs,. -A few of the f.ctivitiesthat you will be doing are (1) determining your energy requirementsby calculating your energy expenditure for a typical day, (2)cal-culating the ealOrie content of your diet and comparing this 'to yourenergy output and (3) determining the quantities of some essential,nutrients in your diet and comparing these amounts to your dailyrequ4rements. 4These comparisons will allow you to design the best possible .diet that fits your needs (and your tastes).', We will call this an'sOptimal diet.If your optimal diet and y9ur present diet are not-'the lope, which one will you follow?'22-2 Energy, .What ate.some of the lams that energy- teke$?In everyday language, \"energy\" means the capacity for doing -something, in the sense that we say, \"He lacks the energy to do thejob.\"However, scientists haVe given the word a more specific defi-nition.The definition may not be very helpful understandingenergy, so we will also try to describe the concebt and give exam-.ples of variouf.forms that energy mayopake.Energy ja usually defined in terms of work,Out'scientistsalso use the word \"work\" differently than you do. A physicist saysthat youtare doing more work when you throw a ball than while youread this book. He does not say this because he prefers readingthis book to playing ball, but because he defin\u00e8s doing work asgiving energy to an object.Recall that in the Respiration Unit you determined your physi-cal fitness by the aerobic step test._ You stepped repeatedly onto)a platform and calculated your work rate.:The work done in each er114step up was the product of your weight and the distance you liftedit against the force of gravit Y (the height of the platform). Thework wasexpended in raising your body to a new height.Your body,acquired potential enervyand potential energy eas the potentialto.recome energy bf motion..Energy of motion is called kinetic energy. When you throw aball, you give the bail kinetic energy. Therefore you do work onthe ball.When you lift a box onto a table, a task you and the4 physicist would agree upon as work, you are giving the box poten- 'tial energy, or stored energy.:What do we mean lox stored energy? Suppose you carelessly placed'the box osier the edge of the table so that when you'let the box go,it fell back to the floor. Whn you 'lifted the box you did workonthe box; you gave energy which was.stored as the potential .energy ofthe bog.-When you let the box go, the stored dhergy wab converted ..to kinetic _energy, the.energy of motion of the bog as it fell (seeFigure 1, opposite).When the box is on the table it owes its.potential energy totIr gravitational attraction of the earth. Gravitational potentialenergy is one form,of potential energy. Anbther form is elastic,potential energy. You do work when you stretch a rubber band orcompress.a spring. Before you release the rubber. band, its energS.,is stored aelastic petential energy. When 4you do releas-e it,jibe potential enlrgy is converted to kinetic enqegy.F. potential .energy. Wor k, potential energy tind kinetiF energy.Another type pf poential energy is electric energy. When a negatively cha.rged object is brought near a positively charged ob-ject, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy; theobjects move towa,rd each other. Nuclear energy, the energy stored in the nuclei o'f.:atoms, is yet another form of potential* erfeirgy.What is this stored energy converted to when an atomic bomb explodes?While we tare discussing forms of energy, weishould mentionradiant energy.Radiant energy is exemplified by light and otherorins of radiation, such as infrared, ultraviolet and X-rays. The earth obtains, enekrgy from the sun in the foim qf radiant energy.A less obvious form of ener,4y is heat. From your study -of gases, you know that when a gas is heated, its, molecules move morerapidly.Heating a gas inci.eases 'the kinetic 'energy of the mole-cules.Hegliting* a liquid or .golid also increases the motJonof atoms;the atoms of a solicl and. lisuid vibrate 'nor rapidly abo t their pOsitions.Heat-is kiAtict energy of individual par icles:5,molecules, athms or, ions.However, heat differs prom the kinetic energy,of a moving bodyin one important respect.The particles of a Moving body all movein the same direction with the -Same speed. Heat, by contrast, is f.andom motion ot partialespartigles moving in .different ciiirectionsatifferent .speeds. Vntil. the -1800,'s heat was thought to be, a form of matter, asubsta ce like air arid witer. Heat was measured in units of calories, while e ergy was measured in other units. But a variety bf experi- ments sh wed 'that the amount of kinetic energy lost because offriction is proportional tO the amount of heat generated by 'friction.'the development of the steam engine demonstratOd thatheat can bconverted to kineti6 enerly. Thus heat took its plape as a ,form. of energY, as one 'kind of kinetic energy.$ r Confusion sometimes exists about the difference between heatand temperature.The confusion exists' because when heat is added tOa substance, its temperature increases. 0Your experience is that temperature is a geasure of \"hotness.\"This is true, ,because what you sense as' \"hotneirs\" is molecules.'\\ 4 striking your skin, and temperature is a measure of the averagekiheti\u00e4 energy of individual molecules'. 'Vie greater the aineticenergy.Of molecules, the faster they move and the hotter they feel.When we say \"average kinetic energy of individual molecules,\"we mean the total kinetic energy (the heat energy) divided by thenumber of molecules. Thus heit is closely related to temperature,although at the same temPerature two unequal masses of the samesubstance contain diffetent amounbs of heat energy. The averageidnetic energy of the molecules in the two samples is the same,but since thelarger sample has more molecules, it has more heat'energy.One way to think of temperature is as an indicator of heatflow.If two objects at diffdrent temperatures are brought into'.contact, heat energy flows frOm the one at higher temperature tothe one at lower temperature. If the two objects are at the sametemperature, no heat flows between them.Heat energy is measured-in units that are defined in terms.ofthe.amount of heatsrequired to raise the temperature.'of a givenamount of water by a certain athount.The unit called the calorie is defined-as the amount of heat'required to raise the temperature of a gram 'of water.by one Celsius.degree.For example, ten calories can raise the.temperature of tengrams of water by,one Celsius degree, or they can.raise the tempera-ture of 'one gram of water by-ten Celsius degrees.Another-unit, the kilocal6rie, is the amount of heat required.to raise the temperature'of-a kilogram of water by one Celsiusdegree.- Thus one kilocalorie is equal to .1000 calories.,-EXAMPLE:How much heat energy in calories is required to raise thetemperature of 200 g of.water from 60 \u00b0C to 80 \u00b0C?, How manykilocalories?.\"3-SOLUTION:We use the 'notation AT for the temperature change.'AT = 80 - 60- = 20 4\u00b0COne calorie is required to raise the temper ure of 1 g of'water by'l \u00b0C. Therefore, the heat energy (H) r uiied to raise,khe temperature of x g by AT degrees is given byH = xAT,= (200) (20)= 4000 calories' ,'s 1 kilOcalorie 4 1000 calories Phits of caloriea and-kilocalories, originally intended to,measure quantities of heat, alp often used to measure other. formspf energy as well.22-3 Chemical EnergyAmong the products of digestion are monOsaccharisiles fatty_acids and amino acids. When these substances'react with oxygen,energy is released.. 4here does thiSlenergy Come-from? , .The energy comes from Chemical bonds, where it is stored in aform called chemical energy. Whenever a chemical reaction occurs,bonds are fokmed and broken; and either another form of energy isconverted to and stored as chemical energy, or chemical energy isreleased as another kind of energy. .Gasoline is a mixtuke of hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon mdle-cules haVe energy stored as chemical energy. When a mixture of.gasoline and air is ignited in an autoTobile engine by.a spark, achemical reaction occurs. Chemical energy is converted to otherforms of energy.. Ohe form is heat; another is kinetic energy--as in the motion of the automobile.Food likewise contains energy stored as chemical potentialenergy.The use of fd by the ,body-as a.source of energy is inmany ways analogous t the use ofgasoline by an automOb le. Inboth cases fuel is oxi ized, more vigorously in the auto obile,more gently in the body. And the body uses ,the energy 0 tainedmore efficiently; more is converted to k4.netic energy and lessto heat. . 0You may now appreciate that the caloAe isnot a unit of mass.;The misconception arises because energy is stored'in the body in ,the molecules of fat, protein and carbohydrate. And fat is', measured-as hAss, not as energy.Since the energy that interests us in'the study of riutrition ischemical, we will .discuss hoW potrntial energy is stored in chemicalbondat,Chemical energy may be thought of'as a type Of electric ipten-tial Snergy.Recall that an afom consiits of a positively charged \"0 nucleus surrounded by negatively, charged electrons which occupyorbitals.An electron_is attracted to an oppositely charged nucleusjust as a book is attracted tO the earth. The book has gravitation-al Totential energy because oft this 4attraction, but as it falls, itspotential energy decreases., Likewise an electron has electric poten-tial energy because of its attraCtitin to the nucleus, and if itmoves closer to the nucleui, its potential-energy diminisheS.- (See'Figure 2 on the differenV orbitals have different amounts ofpotential energ118 when an electron moves from one orbital to another,1 I 2 131 its potential ener y changes.

'What is important about this arrangement isithat the poten-tial energy of the electrons in a bond between hydrogen atoms islower than the potential energy of the el,:ectronsvhen they areattached to isolated hydrogen atoms. lfherefore, wten two hydrogenatoms have the oppottunity, they go to a situation of lower poten-tilal energy by'combi ing to form a hydro\u00a7en-molecule. The situa-tion is like that of a ball on a hillside; the ball rolls to thebottom of thp hill, W ere potential energy is lowest. (SeeFigure 4, Potential energy II :if The potential, energy-of a rolling ball is conV,ertedo thekinetic energy of its motion; the pOential energy of co a. ininghydrogen atoms may 'be released,in a nunber of ways, such asradiant energy or. heat. \\1The releas4 of energy by tile formation of a bohd b tween hy-drogen atoms is typical of chemical reactions in whichonds arefformed.Whenca bond is formed, energy is feleased.But in chemical-readtions bonds are not only crea ed; they arealso broken.XhIen a bond is proken, energy must be ob ained,by themolecule.When a ball is carried to the top of a hill work'isdone on the ball; the ball is given gravitational pote tial energy.When a chemical :bond is broken, work is done on the e ectrons; theelectrons aresdiven energy which they store in the fo m of chemicalpotential energy.

Energy is \"stored\"--in 4,al1s on slopes,in chemical bonds--as money is stored in banks. It i\u00a7 \"converted\"-- kfrom potential to kinetic, for instance-4nd it is \"expended.\" We.Amay discuss energy in these terms becauseit is conserved. Indeed,the Law of Conservation of Energy is one of the fundamental lawsof.physics.We will illustrate the idea of,conservation by anexample. A Imagine a ball placed at the top of a slope. Because of itsposition the ball has gravitational potential energy. We will sayit has 20 units of energy, all potential.

ToYind the energy provided by one gram of glucose we must calculateite gram,molecular weight. 1 5 4 1431.. ;Ile atomic wght of carbon is.12 amu, and a glucose moleculecontains 6 carbon Itoms, Therefore, carbon.contributes 12 x 6 =72 grams.to the gi m molecular weight.

How-.ever, the digestion of starch is not complbtely efficieht.Aboutfive 2er ce-nt of starch consumed is ,undigested and paSses throughthe Ody without providing energy.

(This is not meant toendotse building energy storage depots of fat--we will treat the .health problems associated with obesity soon.)4. .The chemical, reactions for the combustion of proteins are morecomplicated than the reactions of fats and carbohydrates. Vis isbecause there are many different kinds ofproteins and they Irecomposed of many different kinds of amino acids and each amipo acidis oxidized in a different ray.

This chemical energy is conVerted into otherforms of energy by' the reactions of products of digestion-withoxygen. . . .#Energy is needed by- our bodies not only to lift balls i!,o the )1tops of slopes and perform other muscular activities; it also isrequired, while we are at rest. Energy is required .for breathing,circulating blood, maintaining our body temperature, and keeping ourI....brains 'active. So we even expend Anergy'while we sleep.. \\he term metabolism refers to two majoi` classes of chemical andphysi al#processes that occur within the cells of our bodies. Oneof th se processes Is the building of large molecules from simplerones (for example, proteins trom amino acids). The other processis the release of energy for use in the body by, the conversion oflarge molecules to simpler ones. :'The term metabolic, rate is. used to describe the rate at whichwe expend energy. The metabolic rate' differs depending upon whatkind of activity, we are engaged in. It is greater, for strenuousactivities, such aS swimming, than it is for sedeetary ones$ such .as watching television.i. .The amoukt of energy required for a specific activity is notmeasured directly. We cannot feed a person 10 grams of glucose andtell him to- run around until the energy is used up.However, a method dos exist for est-imatin-g----thp -energy we ex-pend.Lidk. is based upon the equation/ for the combus(tion of a food.-Consider h. gain the reaction of glucose. 6H12 6+0+ 6 CO2+ 620 + 673 Cal summarizes the molecula process of respiration.

It is common to use an average value of4.8 calories per liter of oxygen for a normal'diet. 11,One medical test involves measurement of the basal metabolic ,rate oriBMR.For this test, the patient is asked not to eat any-EEIFig f r at least 12 hours preceding the measurement.The testjnvolvemeasuring oxygen contumption while the patient is lyingdown and as relaxed as possible. Although the word \"basal!' impliesthat the test Igives the lowest possible rate of energy expenditure,this is actually not the case. .The metabolic rate is lowesf whenwe are asleep.- Since it is not possible to get patiente to sleep .on command, the BMR is defO.ned as the lowest possible rate of energyexpenditure while.the individual is awake.The metabolic rateAuring..sleep cent of the BMR.od 9,The BMR varies among individuals.

(Remember the/equivalence qf ProcessHowdo cells get energy from,food?As indicated in Unit I, there are two different ways to 'con-sider \"respiration.\" We may view it as the processes involved inbreathing gases in and out of the body as we did in Unit I. On thecther hand, we may define respiration as those metabolic (chemical)processes involved.in the production of energy frOm foods--morespecifically, the bftakdown of'sugars and other nutrients o CO2,water and energy.The first definition was stressed in Unit I. because our concernowas with the respiratory system. In this unit, we will focus on thechemical changes that occur during the breakdown of nutrients, be-cause this.is essential to understanding the digestive Systal. How-=ever, the two views of respiration are not as different as They seem..-We Will find that the 02 and CO2 which we associate with breathingare very much involved in converting the potential chemical energyof nutrients to a form that'is useful in the body.There are good reasons to study the breakdown of various nu- itrients. Most important, these processes (1) link the digestive 1and respiratory systems, and (2) provide,us with the energy neededfor life.The study of cell respiration will lead to an understand-ing of how the chemical reactions of the body release energy and howthese-reactions convert energy to a useful form. The subject iS ofgenuine medical significance. Diabetes, hyperthyroidism ani otherdisorders are all related .to cell respiration.To illustrate the importance of cell respiration to medicine,we will consider a disorderfcharacterized by diarrhea. The problemhas been traced to milk and milk products and, as you might guess,it is of special importance ir infants because of their diets.Analysis of the components of milk has revealed that,the substancein milk that accounts for the gatrointestinal sugar).The disease is.known as \"lactose intolerance\" and66curs more frequently among some ethnic groups, such as blackAmeridr, than among others. ,In order to understand how undigested lactose dan lead to 'gastrointestinal problems we need to consider how this sugar, is Lis. digested.Lactose is a disaccharide thap is hydrolyzed to themonosaccharides Lactose ittelf cannot be absorbed into the body.* But persons lacking this enzyme cannot ,break lactose down intomonosaqchirides. When dairy products such, at milk are eaten bysuch. persons, the Undigested .lactose serves as an extra food supplyfor intestinal hacteria, which convert the lactose to organic acids.The redult is 4 large increase in the bacterial population, whichin turn causes excetsive reabsoiption of'water from the body intothe. intestinal tradt.Thus the stools are watery and acidic'andthe individuals suffer from diarrhea. Once the condipion is recogrdinized as' lactose intolerance, a low71actose diet can be provided /'and .the symptoms will disappear. Since lactose is foUnd in milk,'dt'is not easy to put'infants on a low-lactose diet.It takes someplanning for a dietician to provide a d'et low in lactose and yet,adeqOate in other nutrients..

SECTION 27:CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM27-1 What is Meant by an Equilibrium?In Sections 25 and 26, we have seen that several of the nutri-ents in food are broken down thro\u00fcgh1 metabolic pathways (cellularrespiration).The most important points stressed were that(A) energy is released from nutrients by chemical reactions,(B) some of this energy is transferred to ATP and (C) ATP may be .viewed as the currency of life because when it is converted backto ADP, energy is released for biological processes. This is allsummarized in Figure 1, on the following 'page. r. Figure 1 indicates the importance of ATP.

One type ofdiabetes is caused by a shortage of a hormone that controls theabsorption of water back into the blood from the kidneys. Thewater that is not reabsorbed leaves the body ai urine.Thistype of diabetes does not concern us here, but a type calleddiabetes mellitus does.. The *wird \"mellitus\" is from the Latinword for \"honey\",and refers to one syMptom of diabetes mellitus, -\\thOsweet taste of the urine\u00b0. This disease is the most commontype of diabetes, and when the single word \"diabetes\" is used, itis'generally diabetes mellitus that is nilant.Diabetes mellitus is characterized by impaired ability of thebody'S cells to use glucose. Therefore, we will briefly reviewthe digestion of carbOhydrates. Ddring digestion, carbohyftatesare broken down to monosaccharides, principally glucose. filmy.are absorbed into the body, whereother monosaccharides are con-verted to glucose. Glucose is carriedloy the blood to.the cells,where it is used to provide energy: Excess glucose is stored bythe liver as glycogen; and when the liver's dapacity (or storing%glycogen is exceeded, glucose is cOnverted to fat, which is dlso; stored.I/ Within the pancreas is a grOup of cellswith the poetiJname of Islets of Langethans. *le function of thes( cells its tosecrete a protein hormone *a.11qd insulin iAto the blood.Insulin helps glucose to enter into cells.It,is not knownhow insulinohelps, but it is known that when insulin is in shont .supply, the body does not use glucost efficiently.

If diabetesis not treated, it may be fatal. .What causes a person to have' diabdtes is not well understood,-but it is known that diabetes tends to be inherited. Character-istically, some relatives of a diabetic Will also have diabetes.Approximately five million Americans have diabetes. It is estimatedthat perhaps another five million will develop diabetes during-their lives.Physicians reco4hize two forms of diabetes mellitus. adult-onset.ctiabetes, which,generally-appea s ,after the age.of 25. Adult-Onset diabetes is usually developed byoverweight people. The other. form!is juvenile-onset diabetes,which appears before ege 25 and' isinot related to being overweighe.,The symptoms of the two forms are essentially the same, and.the 2.two forms may have the same-cause and are certainly related, butthe symptoms characteristically become more severe when the disease--first appears'at a young age.1 ,S. ,In Japan, the incidehce of diabetes is inCreasing along with,rising prosperity. This is thowght to be related to an increasein the amount of food eaten, patticularly the amount and types ofcarbohydrates.How-is diabetes detected? Two tests are done ,when diabetesis suspectqd; urine and blood are tegted for glucose.A high -con- '.Scentration of sugar in urine is a s,ign of ,diabeteg. However,-high,sugarfconcentrattion may also be caused by other factors, so4. a. g:this test is not conclusive.f a urthe test suggests diabetes, the diagnosissis confirmedWith a series of,blood tests. A blood sample is taken at leasteight hours after the patient has digested and absorbed his previousThe concentration of-glucose in this sample is the fasting .blood glucose level. Each person has a specific fasting blood glu-cdge level.Thp level in a normal individual is less than 110 mgof glucose per 100 M1 of blood, but the level of a diabetic isgreater than 120.'mg of glucdse per 100 mr of.blood. .The patieht is then fed 15 grams'of g1ucose4 The glucose isabsorbed into the blood.

The object of this system is to .make calculations easier. It is based on the concept.of food*equivalents:Common foods are placed in categories according totheir nutrient,compOsition. Each category is called a \"foodexchange group.\" #0.Thene are seven fo d exchange groups: milk, meat, two vegetable'groups, bread, fruit an fat.Shortened versions of food exchangegroupt.are shown next.two.pages. cup:.2% butterfat milk**;:l cup .Buttermilk, from skim milk, 1 cup. .'Dried skim milk powder, 1/4 cupDried,whole at without coUnting it.j CucumberEggplantAreens, all kinds*collard,\"kale ,spinach, etc.LettuceMushrooms'Parsley,Pepper, green*+RadishSauerkrautTomatoes*Vegetable juice 2 or 1/2:cupraw. vegetable.)'OniqnsPeas, greenPuMkkinb cup juice, 1/3 cupPlums, 2 medium .Prunes, dried, 2 mediumRaisins, tablespoonsRaspberries, .1 cupStrawberries+, 1 cuPTangerine+, 1 latgeWatermelon, 1 cup.or 1 slice 6. 183 Bread Exchange Bread, of puffed, 3/4 cupCraskersa am, 2 (2-1/2 pork, 1/4-CupBeans.and peas, dried, kidney, limaCorn, Popped (plain),:l cuP.'corn-, tablespoonsMeat, poultry (no bone cooked or 3 salad dressing, ,1 tablespoonMayonnaise, 1:teaspoonNuts, ,Oils or shortening, 1 teaspoonOlives, green, 5 smallSour cream 1 tablespooncl 1 The .virtue of the food:exchange group syStem'is nob its accur7acy.As may be geen from tlle table, its numbers are very approxi-Mate.Rather its' virtue is the ease with which it may be used.Let us illustrate its use with an example.You are a dietitian, and .a physician has ref rred a patientto you.She has diabetes mellitus, and the doct r wants hercalories limited to 18$0,per day. The doctor al o prescribes atleast 9() grams of protein a day, with the remain ng caloriesdivided evenly between fat and c'arbohydrate. He 2/7, 2/7, 2/7, 1/7,. The fractionsindicate-that 2/7 of the carbohydrate is to be eaten as'breakfast,.2/7 at lunch, 2/7 at dinner, and 1/7 as an evening snack. Thepurpose of this distribution is to spread carbdhydrate conslimption..ais evenly as possible through the day. (A patient also receiving,insulin injections wouid have a large amount of carbohydratepresctibed fcir/the time of the injection, because the insulinwould help..metabolize the glucose formed in digestion.) ,, --An e*ample of a diet which would meet ttie physician's 'speci-.ficatiiip.s is shown on the following page. Many diets could fitthe preioription; the.one shown was most appealing to the patient.Nhe patient has a diet prescription that she may use every'day.She may eat any food within each group, srovided she-eatstbe amounts specified. Remember that a milk exchange is baseden skim milk.'She is free to,drink whole milk if she wishes;but if she does, she must subtract two fat exchanges from thatmeal.One drawback of the food exchange groups is that no attentionis given to vitamins amd minerals, other than noting a few foods* rich in Vitamins A.and C. For this.reason a dietitian must educatea patient to avoid his making choices such as a doughnut over.agood type of bread.You may be surprised to note that the diabetic's diet isnot so different from your own oveimal diet. -The two in fact havethe same ideals imcommon: sufficient amount of high-qualityprotein, sufficient amounts of vitamins and minerals, and minimumamounts of saturated fatty acids and sugar.

However, when herfirst child was born, Mrs. Jones quit-her job and devoted all hertime to raising her child. Even though the child kept her busyand on 4er feet all day, she found it difficult to take off theexcess. pounds that remained after her pregnancy. The two succeed-ing pregnancies also added extra pounds to Mrs. Jones' weight that:again were difficult to lose. She di)dn't keep gaining weight, atleast not while her children were young. Those entra pounds justseemed to stay. ;The bulk of Mrs. Jones' weight gain has pome since her childrengrew old enough to do things for themselves. She no longer has torunatoll a1,1 day, feeding the children, supervising their play,and pickg up after them. Heehectic, kun-around-the-house dayshave chanced to fit her children's activities. Now, most of hertime is s ent driving the car--carting the boys to many of theirdifferent activities, doing the shopping and running other errands.When asked about getting more physical exercise', she replies, \"ElutI do the housework andtI'm alwaxs carting the kids around. I ambusy-all'day and really exhausted at nicfht. There never seems tobe any time left for me to do'anything tore.\" 187 Her tee4age boys are always hungry, so Mrs. Jones keeps ple yof snack items on hand. $he believes,the boys need something tmunch on after.8chool to keep their energy up. These snackt.cludecrackers, potato chips, cookies, sodas and other sweets. MJonesalso admits to munching-on tEese items asishe does her ho ework.'just because they are there. She nibbles all day and t n eats a,big dinnei with her family. Dinners usUally consist o rich graviesand sauces, lots of bread and potatoes, some vegetab Os (but notmuch),. meat and rich desserts. 41&r family has distinct likes anddislikes when it comes td eating. Since Mrs. JoneS no longer,hasto spend time chasing the children, she can spend more ,ime in theratchen preparing Meals her family will like. MrsJones likes creative'with her-meals is'the of she likes'to eat,, too.Dieting has neVer appealed to Mks. Jones because good food isan important part of the Jones' way of life. The family has alwayseaten their morning and evening meals together. By eating differ-ent foods*han her family, she would spoil the 'feeling of together-ness.Besides, finicky eaters are not allowed at the table.Everyone eats the-same foods. The food budget is fairly. limited./MrsJones has never been active in social affairs. 'She doesnot'beloggto the school PTA, the church grouP or_the local char-ity.Thus, Mrs. Jones is not socially pressured to lose weight.Her husband's complaints are not very harsh and her children don tseem to mind.Mrs. Jones is just not motivated to lose weight.She says, \"What does it hurt to be overweight? If I had a job orsomething, then maybe.:..\"33-3 Treating ObesityWhat are same steps that an obese peron can take to lose weight?The basic reason that simeone gains weight'is that more food is.consumed (ok more calories, if you wish) .Ehan is required for bodilyneeds.The reasons why someone consumes too much food, however, aremore complex.We may'mention several factqrs in the case of Mrs..Jones'.-One factor is her Changing energy requirements. Before shehad her children she worked and 'had more exercise. She needed morefood.And raising young children requires a great deal ol energy.But as chikdren grow older they are better able to care for them-selves and require less effort from their mother. Thus firrs. Joneswas expending less energy than when she was younger. (Another factor is the change in metabolism with age,. As theygrow older, thany people's basal metabolic fuel.Mrs. Jonewas expending less energy, but her consumption ofchemical energy in the form of.food did not decrease correspondingly. 188 . 190 In fact, there is some evidence thai her food consumption had in-creased. ,When she had a job, it is unlikely that snacks wereavailable to nibble4on throughout the day. ,Mrs. Jonee' preferences in foods are also a actor. !Severalof the foods mentioned suPply-a large.number of calories: gravies,rich desserts, bread and potatoes, for instance.There are a variety of reasons why people eat too much, mostof the reasons being mental rather than, physical. Some people eatwhen they are rrervous; a person trying to stop smoking pften com-'plains of gaining weight. Others overeat when they areangry oriziepressed.But this is mot the case with Mrs. Jones; she eats toomdch because she siMply likes the taste'of food ..and because she isin the habit of eating big meals with many snacks between them.One condition that is commonly thought bo lead to obesity ishypothyrbidism. You 'may recall that the thyroid gland secretes basal metabolic!rate is lees thannormal.Less'energy is expended; so unless correspondingly less foodis eaten, or the condition is treated with suppletents of,sthyroihormone, weight gain may result. but,,since. 1hypoth.yroid peoplegenerally Ire ,poor\"appetites, they are almost never'obese.The relation betweeh.9besity and beauty ie a matter af per-sonal preference, but the wlation between obesity and health isnot.There are manywi.inditations that obesity ip detrimental to900a health.A larger percentage of obese people than normal people hypertensibn, diabetes mellitus and'arthritis. \u00b0And obesity makes surgery more,risky. For one thing, if a surgeonhas to cut through exces4 fat, it is more difficult to' find whathe is looking for.. Also, anobese person is usually not as healthyas a person who maintains an ideal weight, and during surgery it iSimportant that a person be in as good a condition as Apossible. Inthe Framingham Study, the tate of sudden 'death from coronary heartattack was found to be almost five times greater for men who vierp20 per cent or more overweight than. fot men who.were not.A.,Let us return to Mrs. Jones. What are we.going to do abouther obesitSr?(We'll ignore the fact that di*s should be.prescribedby specialists;) If she likes being obesef of course, it is noneof our business; and she is free 'to live as,she,pleas00,. But fewpeople like being obese. If she does decide to lose weight, whatis the best course for her to follow? 4*The first principle of losing weight is to expend more energythan is consumed. 3500 excess calories are-equivalent to about 4pound of excesk weight. A person loses about one pound for every,3500 cal9ries pat are expended without being restored from food.So exercise helps'one to reduce weight. Exercise increases energy \"I 189'e a. .a ., -..,expenditure, and it also improves muscle tone. This prevents tis\\-ues from becoming flabby.after weight is lost.But it takeg a lotfxercise over a long period of tiMe'tcxproduce a significant ef-fect.rt does not appear from her case h\u00b1story*that Mrs. Jones ripdoes much exercising, but iather spends her time around the house.or in her car. 4Weight is alsoklost-by reducing the number of calories inour diets., but restkicting our intake.of calories too drasticallyis not a good idea. Our bodies still need protein, vitamins andminerals.In addition,,losing weight too rapidly makes it difficultfor our bodies to adjust to the change,A person may also haye psychological difficultyladjusting toa very restricted diet. Aunger, irxitability and depression arehazards of such a program., It is betterto'lose weight slowly,to develop food habits that keep our bodies at.their ideal weightsonce we get there.For these reasons it is.generally advised.-that a calorie defi-cit be no more than 1000 calories per da.')I000 calories per dayis 7000 calori#s per week. A-deficit 9f 7000 calories results ina weight loss of about two pounds. So two pounds per week is con-sidered a safe rate at whidh to lose weight. *Let us plan A specific program for MTS. Jones, assuming th,atshe has decided to 'lose weight. Her ideal weight is determined tobe 125 pounds,'but her present weightpris 153 pounds, so she should'lose 28 pounds.Mrs. Jones writes down her diet for a typical day; it providesher with 2300 calories. She requires nearly 2300 calories per dayto inaintain her weight at 153 poup. If 'she weighed 125 pounds,her ideal weight, ishe would need., 1875 calories daily. Thisargument p6,pumes ghat Mrs. Jones wou- d be as physically 'acti,ve at153 ipoundts-is at 125 pounds.If we put Mrs. Jones on a diet of 1875 calories, she' wouldbegin to losd weight slowly. But since she should lose two pounds'a week, we reduce her energy intak, to 2300 - 1000 = 1300 caloriesperMrs. Jories should get about 0.8 gram-of protein rper.day perkilogram of ideal body weight. 125 pounds is approximately 57 kilo-grams, so her diet should include 57(0.8) = 46 grams of protein.46 grams of protein,svpplies about 46 x 4 = 184 calories.The remaining-130-0'-.-184 = 1116 calories will.be supplied byfat 446hcalories,,walA314'supplied by .fat. 'the remaining60 per cent Of-1116 calories, which is 670 calories, are supplied bycarbohydrate.446 calories are provided by 446 9= 50 grams offat.670 calories are supplied by'1670 .4-4= 168 grams of'carbohydrate. 190:1 So Mrs. Jones is restricted to a diet of about 46 grams ofprotein, sd grams, of fat-ind 168 grams of carbohydrate.This diet .will enable her to lose weight, beginning at,a rate o* two poundsper week, until after a few months'she reaches her ideal weight.When her weight becomes 125 pounds, her energy intake will be.. adjusted to1875 calories. 'This number ogscalbries will enable herto maintain her. weight at 125 polands.aA-more specific diet for Mrs. Jones would conSider'several 'factors.One is that her,diet must include sufficient amounts ofall vitamins and minerali. Another consideration is that her dietshould fit her family's eating habits as well as possible. Con- -tinuing to eat the Mime fibods as her family, even though in smaller .quantities will make dietinglpasier and avoid the trouble and costof,preparing separate foods.We ghould also teach.her some facts about nutrition:- how fOods'With fewer calories may be substituted for higher-calorie foods.Substituting lean meat .for fat meat, nonfat milk for whole milk, and .cooking oils for solid fats, are examples of changes that she may -.make without seriously upsetting the family eating habits. And.we .can' point out the advantages of salad (with low-fat dressing). witfidinner. .If Mrs. Jones still insists on snacks, they must be con-sidered in her allotment of calories.If Mrs. Jones goes to a bookstore, she is likely to find tnentire shelf devoted to books on losing weight. Each book clai3msto 'advocate the best method, but they generally contain a seriousflaw.It is well to ask several critical questions before adoptinga plan from any book on losing weight.Other weight-loss plans involve drugs that cause the body tolose not fat, but water.

In the Atudy ofrespiration you saw that certain bacteria cause croup and pneumonia,virusds cause influenza.1Mbst of the diseases carried in food and water, such as cholera,are caused by bacteria. This gives bacteria a bad name to most .people.But very few of the many types of bacteria cause disease.In fact, many-bacteria are dmportant to us. They are found whereverthere iS life--in the soil, the ocean, the air, food, water,.andeven insi;de us.Your digestive tract is loaded with harmless bacteria. When .babies are first.born they don't have any--their digestive tracts .are sterile.But in a matter of days, the harmless bacteria thatenter the gastrointestinal tract with the baby's food multiplyand remain.How many are there inside? The'stomach has few becauseits acid kill\u00a7 most of them. The large intestine, on .the,otherhand, has many--about 100 billidn bactdria in every gram of contents!In fact, feces are about 1Tto 20 per cent bacteria. Some of the'tecteria inside_ us do things, that are useful. They make at leasttwo vitamins:vitamin K and follc acid. 4Incidentally, thesevitamins are exceptions to the rule that vitamins are o4aineddirectly from the diet.)Some kinds df bacteria even make food.

Theyresult from the way the Trichinella developed inside him. TheWay-a worm develops and reproduces is called its life cycle.(This term is used to describe' the stages of development .and repr\u00f3duction of any organism, including human.)The pork Jim ate contained tiny larvae--small and immatureworma.(Figure 1A). These larvae are protected inside a case. Thecase with its larva inside is, called a cyst (Figure 1A). /(Inmedicine, the word cyst also means a swilling filled with fluid.We are not talking about this kind of cyst here.)u4IPIn Jim's gastrointestinal tract, the (Figure 1B).

LIThese sections may .&tend much!as'30 feet. They containthe worm's reproductive organs.

UnlikeTrichinella,most tapewormsdo not migrate to the perso ir's muscles; they remain in the in-testines, sometimes for years.Since tapeworms, obtain their.hourishment from their host,a person with this parasite may lose weight and vitality.The-wormts presence may also irritate the gastroiptestindl tract,causing pain and diarrhea. Diagnosis,of a tapeworm infection de-pends on examining the feces of the patient for worm.sectionsand eggs.Treatment involves drugs to kill the tapeworM. It is necessaryto remove the entire worm, because if the head is feft attachedto the intestine, the'whole worm will 4row larger again after4,two pr three months. Most drugs are directed.at killing the head..Once this is accomplished, the worth passes out with the feces. '4) 0 'Meat is regularly inspected for tapeworm cysts. Nevertheless,to be safe, beef and pork, 'and ip some areas of the'U.S., fish,must be cooked. Cboking ut at 71 \u00b0F) for minutes has been ound to destroy cysts.

Cereals are not restricteOuto packaged breakfast foods, but 'ihcude all grains used as foods.The common cereal grains are rice, wheat, corn, oats, rye andbarley.Rice is ',the raost frequently consumed grain, largely becauseof its impsrtahce in thd diet of Asi(i. Corn is the most popularcereal in Lat,in America, while wheat is the most popular in theUnited States and western Europe. 4A typical cereal grain,is between 70 and 90 per cent carbohk-,drate, of which a sMall portion is indigestible cellulose. Theprotein content varies from 7.5 per cent to almost 15 per cent,'and a grain may be as mutt' as 1 per cent minerals. Grains are notimportant sources4of vitqmihS A and C, but they can be goodsources-01'B vitaMins and iron..:The quantities of these putrients that we.actually receivefrom thesgrains in our diet depend upon how they are processed.To uriterstand the processing of cereals, it is first necessary toknow e little about the anatomy of a grain. A cross-section ofa wheat grain' is illustrated es an example, hut the parts of otherdenial gkains are similar. A grain contains three types of cells,whicqmay be sepatated during processing. The outer layer of gra.in composes.the bran. Bran cellshave thick walls of the carbohydrate cellulose; these wallsform a protective covering around thb grain. The bran containsindigestible cellulose,, but it also ccmtains protein, iron and -many B vitamins. The bran of a wheat grain contains most of thpniacin and much of the riboflavin and thiamin. It et also animportantsource of roughage or fiber in our diets, and isessential to good digestion.A A second group of cells Zomposes the germ. Germ cella arerich in polyunsaturated fatty acids andpother nutrients.. Fatsin wheat germ are unstable, so the germ is commonly removed toprevent cereal products from spoiling or becoming rancid. (Theoil from corn germ is used to make corn oil and margarine.)When the germ is' discaraed, .polyunsaturated fatty the niacin,riboflavin, iron, protein;and B vitamins pyridoxinelband pantothenicacid. 6The largest part of a grain is he endosperm. The enOospermcontains three-fourths of the 'protein in a grain and much htarch,but-only small amounts of vitamins and minerals. For example, theendosperm o&d wheat grain cont4ins cmly 12 per cent of the niacin,3; per cent of the ribolavin aind 3 per cent of the thiantm.White flour.is made by grinding the endowerm of wheat.4 White flour itself contains inadeqUate amounts of several nuilrientsbut nut4tents may be added.. The addition of nutrients to a food'is ca1ledofor4fication. A food may be fortified by.adding a 'nutrient present but removed milk.

(If a food is en-.ricbed, it is so labeled.)222 24 .Over. .90 per cent of the wheat flour and bread.consumed inthis country-is enriched. No standards have been establiShed,however, for enriching'breakfast cereals. A fey years ago 4presidential consultant on hunger studied 60 \u00f8pul\u00e0rdry break-fast cereals and stated that 40 werelso nutrients as tobe classed as \"empty calories.\" Possibly asresult of publicitystemming from this study, many cereals are now being fortifiedwith additional nutrients. Iron, niacin, riboflavin and thiaminare commonly saded.37-30Eanning, Freezing and Dehydration 5What is the effect of ouuang, freezing and dehydration on thenutritional value of foods?Before 1800 tew foods could be preserved for more than ashort period of time. During the 1790's the French governmentoffered a prize for a method of preserving food for the army.Nicolas Appert experimented from 1795 to 1809. entitled \"The Book,for All.Households; orthe Art of Preserving Animdl and ManyYears.\"The treatise won Appert 12,000'francs (equivalent thento $2250), which was a lot of money in 1810.0Appert's experiments.involved heating foods fh sealed con- tainers. .Food was placed in bottles and stoppered with corks. The bottles *ere then heated in boiling water for several hours.In this way canning originat.ed.I. . The principle behind canning was not understood, and littleim rovement was made in techniques until 60 years later whenLouis Pasteur discovered that most foodvuoilage is caused bymicroorganisms. The hi h temperatures ifffolved in canning destroyor make inactive the mid\u00e7oorganisrns that cause food to spoil.Canning also denatutds any enzymes present in the food. Thisstops thpse enzymes from catalyzing reactions and prevdnts someundesirable changes in food. Sealing a container before heatingprevents organisms from entering the food after it is sterilized., Unfortunately, air-tight canning dods not prevent growth.of a bacterium called C.Zostriidium.ClostridituhiSot kind of bacteriumthat lives best in the absence of oxygen. This organism causesa rare form of food-poiiEFIEThnown as botulism. The toxinproduced by.tilois one of the deadly poisonspknown.It hase been estimatedthat as little as 10-7 g of this subpancecan kill an adult. Botulism occurred more frequently before itwas fotsd that this bacterium can be destroyed,during the canningprocess by heating to temperatures near 100 \u00b0C f4r a certainperiod of time. But, thif $Y f\" 0,The obvious changes that occur when food is Canned are changesin texture, color and flavor, Changes may also occur in nutrientcontent.Some proteins and vitamins can be destroyed by the heat-ing needed to sterilize the food. Many foods must be scalded with%.. hot water or steam before being canned; scalding serves a number-of purposes-tuch as enhancing the color of gr en vegetables and'softening tissue to make packing easier. Wher scalding causescell walls to break (for exampleothe tkin of fruit) water-solubleg.vitamins may be lost. Many fodds are packed i water or juice.If the water is poured c?ff before the food is eaten, water-poluble\"vitamins and minerals are rost.,.The table below includes a comparison of the nutrient contentof fresh' peas and canned peas, fresh peaches and canned peaches.The numbers include the nutrients contained in the water 6r jilicein which the foods are packed, so if the /juice is drained, the , values are less. .A. . . .FOOD ..

Cdmpare the amount of sodiumin fresh peas and canned peas. Salt is added to many canned foodsto improve taste and act as a preservative.Foods may also be preserved by freezing: Freezing kills onlya small percentage of bacteria, but surviving bacteria are unableto grow, and their enzymes are inactive, at freezing temperatures.Frozen foods aret.generally closer to fresh foods in texture,appearance and taste than tanned foods are (although certain foodscannot be frozen becausejo 'changes in texture, for example let-tuce).In addition, frozen foods' are often closer to fresh foods*n'nutrient content than canned foodt ate. The values for frozenpeas And peaches are .also included in the preceding table.Vegotablas are commonly tcalded before freezing. this can cause denaturation ofproteins and loss of water-soluble vitamins.Frozen peas contain less protein and less of each vitamin thanfresh peas, but more than canned peas. Frozen peaches are com-parable to cannel& peaches in every nutrient listed but vitamin C;224 appaTently the frozen peaches referred to in the food table were',fortified with vitamin C. Less salt i5 usually added to frozenfoods than to canned, foods. ,Freezing a food does not kill most bacteria but only inactivatestheM.When the food is thawed, the bacteria become active againand are able to grow, For this reason frozen foods.should'becooked' or eaten soon after they are thawed.Dehydration 'is another nethod of preserving food. Dehydrationis the removal of all, or at least most, ot the water from a food.The apsence of water,does not kill all the bacteria but causesthe remainder to be inactive'until the food is.reconstituted.with water.We cannot provide extensive nutritional information on freeze-.dried foods, t'ut to compare a dehydrated food to a food beforebeing dehydrated, the following table gives the nutrient contentof one cup of nonfat milk and oneucup 105.*298. .259 from nonfat,dry solids contains almost the same quantitiesof nutrients listed as nonfat milk does.Dehydration is one of the oldest methods of preserving foods4consider raisins 4jerked medt, ana smoked fish.)

Would you eat it?Chances are that you consume gum arabic frequently, althoughyou may not know 'what it as or what it does to your. body. Gumarabic, also known as gum acacia, is added to many of*the easilyprepared food products, such as cereals, prepared dinners, andpowdered beverage mixes. Gum arabic ,pis'obtainea from an acaciatree of Africa and Arabia; it is odorless arid Soluble\\in water.Cellulpse gum, guar gum and agar-agar are also added tomany of these foods. Why?That is one of the subjectsiof this .vection, in which we will discuss the various uses of food addi-tives.. We will akso be concerned about possible health problemslinked to food additives. While the term \"foodborne disease\" isgenerally used to refer only to those diseases caused by micro=organism's, we must not overlook the possibility that many foodadditives may also affect our health. ,Air additive is a substance added to a food durlIng'processingor preparation. The substance_may not have been present in thefood as' it occurs naturally, or it may have been present in alesser amount than in the product. Thus, whenailk is fortifiedwith vitamin D, we consider the vitamin to be an additive, becauseit is not naturally present in milk. Similarly, when vitamin C(ascorbic acid) is added to processed orange juice, this vitaminis hlso considered an additive even tliough vitamin C was in the-original juice. .When we consider an artificially created food product, however, ,there is nd exact distinction between a food and an additive. Take,for example, a list of ingredients in ice cream. A typical list mayinclude milk, cream, sucrose, nonfat solids, corn syrup, artificialcolor, artificial flavor, stabilizer and emulsifier. We would prob-ably*agree that milk and cream are foods and that artiLcial-colorand flavor are additives. But whit about sucrose? Whether sugaris an additive or not can be debated, but it does not matter. Whatdoes matter is the effect of sucrose on the,taste of ice cream andits effect on the health of those who eat ice cream.4/There are many reasons why substances are added to foods. Anail itive may make a food more nutritious. For examp1e, flour andbread may be enriched by the addition of vitamins and iron. Milkmay.b&-fortrified with vitamin D; asporbic acid may be added tosynthetic orange beverages: ' ts.-.ether addiAives are usea to preserve food. For example, sodi-um propionate and calcium propionate are commonly added to breadarid other baked foods to retard the, growth of molds (fungi). ,,Two other common preservatives are butyIated hydroxytoluene,commonly calle BHT,: and to oxidize'and becoMe rancid. BHT and BHA retard oxidationand are added to many foods that contain fats, one example beingsalad oils.Most additives are used to make a food mor9. appealing to theconsumer.Food cari be made more appealing by improving its flavor,texture Dr color, The ingredien4 of ice cream, listed previouslfhis section, illustrate the use of additives.to impro flavor,color and texture., The list includes artificial color, artificialflavor, corn syrup, stabilizer. and emulsifier. Let's examine eachof these additives.Artificiai flavor and color ekplain themselvOL. Flavors arethe largest group of fodd additives; over 1000 are available. *Spiceswere among the earliest additives used to improve th6 flavor of food;spices are naturally occurring substances. New synthetic flavorsare developed each yeaf, to imitate natural fruit flayors, forexample.Corn syrup is added to ice cream as a sweetener and also toprevent sugr from crystallizing; it tlius improVes emulsifiers,tas welt\"as.4thickening agents,are added to food,to improve its texture. A stabilizer in ice,cream helps to keep Ole rest of the ingredients mixed and preventslarge ice crystalsom forming when ice cream is frozen.Gum arabic and other vegetable gums are used as stabilizersand thickeners. They may be added to ice cream, and thdy also arecommonly added to 'such foodseas powdered beverage mixes and hotbreakfast cereals to obtain the proper texture when these foodsare mixed with water.When you analyzed a food for its nutrient content, you found-that fat is no 'soluble in water. In many foods such as ice cream,1fat would sepa te from water and water-sbluble ingredients wereit not for the resence of an emulsifier. An emulsifier causesfat to be dispersed in small droplets throughout the water-solubleportion.4You may recall that bile served as an emulsifier, forfats being digested t'n the intestines.) . qThere are still other reasons that manufacturers add substancesto food.For example, certain additives change the pH of a food-Others controliphe moisture content.. How do all these additives we-consume affectibur health?ManIlaslived with many of his foods for thousands bf years.Centuries of use have indicated that these foods are not harmful,or at least not immediately harmful. Consumption of a food by100 generations of people is a very good test, but there remainproblems and uncertainties. Foods long considered harmless Olay beharmfur-indire-otily_end over a long period of time, or when excessive 'quantities are eateli.;--For-example, both salt and sugar 'Ikenot as harmless as had Long been suppos)ed. The other problem is \\,r. I additives developed recently--ones that have not been tested forlong periods of time. How are these additives determined to besafe? rIn the United States the Food and Drug Administration is re-onsible for seeing that the approximately 2006 food additives arenot harmful.The-FDA's task is not easy for reasons we will discuss. ,The FDA derives its authoritx to control the use of additive'sfrom the Food Additives Amendment tO the Federal Food, Drug andCosmetic Act of 1958. Before 1958, if the FDA wished to remove aparticulari,additive from the market, it. had to demonstrate thatthe additive was harmful. Since the pas age of the act, a manufac-turer has to satisfy the FDA that a new dditive is not harmful be-fore it may be Used. .The Food Additives Amendment,contain a list of additives thatare \"Generally Recognized As Safe, (GRAS). The approximately 670substances in this list, known as the GRAS list, either have a longhistory of use or were proven to be 'harmless prior to 1953. TheGRAS list includes nutrients (for example, riboflavin)\u00b0, such flavorsas cinnaMon and vanilla, salt and pepper, and additives to improvetexture, such as gum arabis.!Me fact-that a subs ance is on the GRAS list means nothing- more than that it is \"ge erally recognized as safe.\"Many of theseadditives have never been proven to be safe, and the FDA can removea substance from the GRAS list if evidence appears asjainst it. Atpresent the FDA is testing or re-testing each additive on the.GRAS ,- list for toxicity.If a new additive is developed, it must be approved by the FDAbefore it may-be used in food. The manufacturer must test the addi-tive with'at leaa,t two species of laboratory animals, commonly miceand dogs.. The animals' are fed4varioUs quantities of the additive,and the smallest_quantity that is harmful is determined.The FDA rligtaates not only what additives may be used, but also,in what foods they may be used and how muCh may be used. The deci-sion as to how much of an additive may be used in a certain food isbased upon the tests,with-laboratory animals, and it takes into con-.sideration whether a PersOn is likely to consume the additive onlyin the one food or in other foods in his Adet. The FDA is also#guided by the principle that a food should contain no'more of anadditive thian ig needed to achieve its purpose.The FDA-also considers the purpose of an additive. Additivesare permitted for the purposes we mentioned: to improve phe nutri-tional value of a food, to aid in preservation of food and to im-*Prove calor,flavor or. texture. Additives are pot permitted, how-.ever, tO disguise inferior food or inferior processing.One clause of the Food Additives Amendment specifically banan'y: additive' that is found to be associated with cancer in 218\".2 9 94,1 laboratory animals or people. This statement, called the Delaney,clause after the congressman who,introduced it, was the cause of ,controversy. in the case of cyclamates. Cyclamates were on the GRASlist and weye used as artificial sweeteners in place of sugar.Their most popular use was in diet sodas. Cyclamates are probaLypeeferable to sugar in-terms of dental health; losing weight, andrisk of atherosclerosis; they made some foods,,suitable for diabeticsthat were not otherwise available to-them._- However, it was deter-,mined that rats fed huge quantities of cyclamates tended toidevelopcancer.Although, the quantities were much greater than are everconsumed by a person, cyclamates were(ordered off the market. Cy-'claMates are one example of the problems encountered by the FDA.Another problem is the use of nitrates and nitrites.38-2 Nitrates arid NitritesA Nitrates and nitrites are considered conditions a nitrate converts to a-nitrite, andnitrites are at the center of the .probfem. INitrates occur, naturally in many water supplies. They also oc-cur gliturally in many vegetables, notably spinach, beets, lettuceand nitrate and potassium nitrate, as well asthe nitrites, are used in-cdring meat products. Meat is cured by ,soaking in a brine (salt water) cpntaining itrates or nitrites.The primary purpose of adding nitrates and n trites to,meat is to.preserve the characteristic red theee meats as well as that of cured fish. ,These addi-tives also serve the useful function of inhibit ng the growth ofcertain kinds of bacteria, such as the one which causes botulism.Nitrates have not been found to-be harmful in themselmeS, 'hutas mentioned*earlier, nitrates can convert to nitri es. ofconditions under which nitrates can form nitrites oCurs in tract infants' stoma. s which areit,less a\u00e1i.did than the stomachs of adults.Nitrite's have been proven 'to cause one medical probl and aresuspected of causing a second.

Cases have occurred in.whi hlcattle have cpnsumLtoo much nitrate, converted it to nitrite a dhave been poisoned in this way. , More concern has been shown for the possibility that nitriteslead to cancer. Let us examine some of the evidence.16 ..a23o We have already discussed primary amines (R-NH2). *Secondary. .amines have a second \"R\" group.

What does this mean interms of man?Do nitrites and nitrosamines cause cancer in huTans?.. . ,First of all, no case of cancer in a human hasAe been provento be caused by these substances4 However, based on the' experimentsmith laboratory animals, and the biological similarity qf these ani-mals to humans, it is reaponable to expect that nitrosamines cancause cancer in humalils..CY4The next question is whether we consume nitrosamines or produce'therri -within our bodies. Analysis of foods part the question remaind(unanswered.82 (Recent reseakch,however, has indicated that cigarette--smoke contains nitrosamines..This, lof course, has caused further speculation -genic of cancer it is the combination of nitrited and seCondarv,amines that appears to be carcinogenic. It is possible for us, tgo'have secondary amines in our bodies; for example,c,maily drug4 amines. But the reaction of nitrites and amines-cantake place only under certain conditions,.

If you were asked to decide about the use of nitrates andnitrites as food additiVes, _What would be your decision? ReMember.,that nitrites alsb inhibit the growth of troxic bacteria. ni-trates and nitrites were not useVas additives, other preservative6.would have to be used, or fresh foods used to replace preserved,varieties.Some-people are advbcating a ban on niti.ates and\"nitrites,as'food additives. Some supermarkets already stock such meats as (frankfurters which do not contain either preservative. As a result,such hot dogs have to be cooked and eaten within about one week'of$manufacture.But this, is adyantageous to the consumer'who gets machfresher meat.By with nitrates ahd nitrites., meat can bepreseryed for yery.long periods. Consequently, there is no sure-wwto buch \"as hot ble?gs, salami, And Viennatsausage.Those ban on these preservatives seem closer tothe .intent of*the FDA law than those who suggest we use nitrites -and nitrate.s,until it can be proven that they cause cancer in hu-mans.Remember t4at the FDA.regulation-of 1958 requires that thefood processors prove that these chemicq.s (or,any food*additives)are harkess before they use them in ourlfoods.1 List five uses of food additives.What is the GRAS list?What.is che Delaney clause?What are nitrates and nitrites used for?

The list of unquestionably saf.eladditivesIis ifery short, while the possible danger from those which are' ques-tionable or potentially harmful remains great.tThere is no agreement among experts on the safety of ondgroup of additives: the artificial colors. While somegof thesefood dyes are \"certified\" as safe in the United States, theyare not permitted in foods in many European countries.Conversely,some dyes considered absolutely safe abroad may not be used inthis country.With so little.agreement about the relative safetyof the artificial colors the best rule of thumb may be to be extremely?wary of them.One example oftan artificial color of known danger that ispermitted ia the red color 'used to dye maraschino cherries.Many of us eat these shiny cherries_in ice cream, fruit desserts,cakeaeand pastries. 'Yet the dye that gives these cherries theircolor was outlawed for use in foods in 1964 because experimentswith dogs produced two forms of cancer. When this hrtificial colorwas added as two per cent of their diets (a large amount--far moretban any of us-would consume), 6()mer cent of the test dog*died.This dye is so harmful that the World Health Organization (WHO)gave in their lowest rating.

CTIONTHt ROLE OF TEETH IN'NdTRITIONNow do teeth prepare food,for digestion? ,S me of the most-common health problems involve the teethand gum\\--probablyall of you have experienced at least occasiohaldental ptoblems. Over 90 per cent of our'population has at leastone cavity in a life time. Over.10% of the adult population nolongerhaianynatural teeth.More than half of the adult populationsuffer frgum diseases.Beginning In this section we will Iexamine the,teeth, anatomy and ffinction, as -well as theirproblems and care.The science of Dentistry hps developed to care for the teeth.Many occupations arelconcerned kith human dentition. These occupa-tions tnclude dentist, oral surgeon, dental hygientist, dental .pssistant, dental X-ray technician and other tbchnicians who ,specialize in making denturese bridges\"and other dental apparatus. 1 ,As we have discussed, digestion begins in the mouth. Food 's broken into smalier pieces by the teeth, anil digestion of i)tarch is begun by the enzyme amylase found in saliva. The func-.ion +of teeth is important,because small particles are digestedmore rapidly than large*particles. They can come in closer contactwith eniymes.o The tongue helps mix food' and moves it to whereit can be chewed by the teeth. ,The tongue is not only involved in moving food, but it hastwo other functions, taste and speech. The palate is alio usedfor taste and speech. The palate is'the roof ofthe mouth withinthe semi-circle of the upper teeth. The forward part of the roofis the hard palate; the rear portion is the soft palate. At therear of the palate, a small flap of tissue called the uvulahangs down into'the mouth. You can see your palate and uvulawith.a mirror. During swallowing, the uvula closes off the mouthfrom the nasal passage. -The mouth of a human adult contains 32 teeth, unless somehave been removed. These teeth are not all alike; there are fourtypes, each adapted to a different function. Before ieading on,, ,you might look at your teeth in a mirror. Can you detect fourtdifferent basic shapes. Can you guess how these different shapesmight function?The four forward teeth.on top and the four on the bottom areincisors (see Figure 1). Those 'in the center are central incisors,while' those to the side are lateral incisors. Each incisor has a single root.

These defectscannot be cor-rected once they exist; this is one reason that good nutrition isespe?ially important during the first twq years ok life..Beiween the ages ofstWo years and six years, the permanentteeth continue to develop. Beginning at about the age of two)all the deciduous teeth ate in the mouth. At around five yearsof-age the deciduous teeth,become spaced. This,happens because.the jaw is growing This spading makes room for thepermanent teeth that sooni will erupt (Figure 3.) 4 5 years(-1:9rnos.) _FIGURE 3:Development of teeth from ages three through five,As the child approaches the age of gix, the roots of hisdeciduous teeth begin to disappear. Thekprocess is called iesorp-tion; the material of the roots is absorbed into.the body. This'process leads to, loss of deciduous teeth.

One type of malocclusio is overbite, sometimesreferred to a's buck teeth.\"Overbite is the condition in whichthe upper lawxteads in front of the lower jaw.

In adults it causes cerEain b nes,'the'lower .233 /jaw being one, to grow larger.. Often the first sign of acromegaly.is achange in occlusion. Malocclusion can also be due to insuffi-Cient,sspace.f9r the developing teeth.Amons primitive peoples, whose teeth are used to chew tough .foods,malformations of the jaw are rare. Our civilized diets ofsoft foods give the jaw little exercise, and the lack of exercise .may cause thelaw to fail to develop completely.The teeth may, also fail to Align themselves propbrly if anunnatural forceds\\repeatedly exerted on the jaw. The unnaturalforce may come frbm sucking the thumb or reAting the jaw in thehands over long periods of_time. Jaw development may.alsb be in-fluenced by malnutritionl,/ ,We have discussed mal6cc1usions caused by,improper positloningor development of the ja-w.'`Other types Of malocclusion are .pausednot by the jaw but by the tee'b. themselves.Deciduous\"teeth reserVe a s ace for permanent teeth. If adeciduous tooth is lost premature another deciduous tooth maymove toward its space.yle permane t*tooth is then forced toerupt in a position wh it should rtqt be. Early loss of deciduous.teeth may be hereditary, but it also m y be caused by disease.When a permanent tooth is lost, the teetrto either'side moveinto the,space, causing malocclusion. Upper and lower teeth helpto keep their counterparts in position; if one is lost, the other ,can nlove more easily. If a lower tooth ip lost, thestooth aboyeit m y tove down. The loss of permanent teeth is rarely,causelby heditary factors; it is caused by dental disease or decay, or. . ,by accident... ,vOccasionally a person will have too.many teeth, a conditionknown as supernumeracy. As a result, the teeth are crowded. An'extra tooth on top may not-be paired with a bottom tooth. Theresult is malocclusion. Supernumeracy is presumed to occur in.the development of the embryo; however, it has not been shown tobe inherited.Supernumerary teeth do not always erupt. Theymay'remain embedded in the bone and must be detected with X-rays. -Severe malocclusion makes chewi4difficult.If chewing isdiffipult, either soft food must be eaten or food must be swallowedin lafger pieces. But large pieces of food cause digestiveproblems and soft foods do not give the teeth, gums and jaws thestimulation necessary for proper blood circulation;MalOcclusion also causes increased susceptibility to dentaldisease.If teeth are not aligned properly, food is more easilycaught between them; and some stirfaces may.be impossible to reach,with a toothbrush.

Erosion is the washing awayof enamel by chemicals such as acids. Abrasion is mechanical wear.'It may come from -faulty brushing, abrasives in toothpastes or fromchewing on such objects as bobby pins and pens. Abrasion li.s'alsocaused. by grinding the teeth.rt 42-2 Prevenftion of Dental Disease'How may. dental disease be prevented?The most direct and immediate way to prevent dental disease isto keep one's mouth clean. The.objeCt Of cleaning is to remoVe two, .items:food particles and plaque. Bacteria are always in the mouth.and continually mmltiplying, but regular removal of plaque keepsthe Remdving food_particles prevents bac-teria from converting food.to acid.The teeth are cleaned by brushing ple surfaces and flossing'between the teeth with derital floss. Flossing is important because-it reaches some areas not accessible to a toothbrush.The formation of plaque.and the growth of a population ofbacteria takes about 24 hours. If you could brush your teeth atthe same time each day and cover the entire surface every time youbrushed, it would be sufficient to brush. your teeth once a day.However, since-it is likely that you miss areas of the teeth eachtime you brush, you should brush at least twice a day. The mosteffective time to brush is after meals, because.not only are bac-teria and plaque removed, buf food particles as well, before theyare used by bacteria. Brushing prevents calculus deposits fromforming as well as removing food, bacteria and plaque. It alsohelps maintain healthy gums by massaging the gums.It is especially important to include tlie use of dental flossin the care of the teeth. ,If the teeth are flossed correctly, oncea day is suf'ficient. Flossing correctly does not mean simply puttingthe floss between each pair of teeth, but wTapping the floss aroundthe edge of the tooth as well. The object is not only to removefood from between the teeth, but to scrape off plaque and bacteriaalso.Most dentists recommeria a toothbrush with soft bristles. SoftbriStles are more effective in removing particles from between teeth.and gums and are less likely to than hard 4' / ,Both the inner all4 outer surfaces of the Upper teeth should bebriished with atdownward)motion, from the gu7d toward--the bottoms ofthe teeth.The inner and'oute surfaces of the lower teetkshould2he brushed upward, also in the direction away from the gums. ,Thechewing surfaces should be br4 hed back aq0 fbrth with a scrubbingmotion (2igure 11). This is one of several acceptable methods for'brushinlithe teeth.\\, 441 FIGURE:Orie of several techniqdes for brush4ng teeth. In people over 30 the most common thause of tooth loss is notcaries but gum and bone disease. The use of dental floss-has there-fore taken on as much, if not more importance than brushing in thatage group.Flossing prevents calculus formation between the teeth,a common,causd of.gum infection. ,Toothpaste or tooth powder should be used. Some people makea paste by mixing two,' parts of baking soda with one part of tablesalt.This mixture dhould be used only occasionally because it isabrasive and may cause damage to the enamel. .The pu p se of tooth-ij paste is to clean the teeth and prevent.the formatiof caries.Many of the extravagApt claims made for toothpastessed on the -..fact that they contain special chemicals ard not warranted.A goodtoothpaste c,leans the teet and is not harmful to tele teeth.

For(example, if one uses the water pick continuously on 6 high-power set-'4ing or points it directly between the teeth, he may cause irritationand reaession of the gums. ,\\\\,Wehavathus far restricted our discussion of prevention of,tooth disease to cleaning the mouth. bental health may also be ap-proached by increa6ing the resistance of teeth tO decay. Intake ofthe proper vitam\u00e9ns and minerals while teeth are deNibloping results .in more resistat teeth. The use of fluorides creates stronger teeth,but we will defet discussion of this controversial topic to.Section 43.A neW 'procedure that has been developed to increase the teeth'sresistance'to decay involves coating the teeth with a polymer. Theteeth .are cleaned and dried, and a'solution-of the polymer,is applied.It is exposed briefly to ultraviolet light, and the surface'd-of theteeth are sealed, protecting them against caries. This adhesivepolymer should be, applied soon after a tooth erupts.Our own saliva may also help.protect our teeth from Lay,byacting as a buffer. A buffer solution is defined as a solution-thatwill maintain a nearly constant pH (concentration IV 114\" ions) evenwhen small to.it.If our.saliva is indee& capable of acting as a buffer, then it may be ableto prevent some of the acid produced by bActeria from eroding theenamel of the teeth by neutralizing the 114- ionS.,Diet is also .important in dental health. Decreasing the amountOf sugar in the,diet decreases the amount of food available for bac-teria to cgiavert to acid. sticky candies are especially bad, sincethey remain' stuck to the teeth and are available to the bacteria fora longer period of time. .Antibiotics may eliminate bacteria from the mouth. Individualsusing penicillin for Aher medical purposes have been found to de-velop fewer caries. However, the intake of antibiotics can causeother problems and this is not a recommended method of preventing .dental disease.42 3,Treatment of Dental DiseaseHow do dentists treat dentel disease?Despite the various means used 'to prevent dental disease, al-most all of us develop caries in our teeth. A toothbrush or flosscannot fit into a cavity to remove food or bacteria, and,the bac-teria remain to cause further decay. If decay is not too extensive,a tooth is filled.Youlprobably know about the filling Of teeth from personal ex-perience.A dentiet drills the tooth to remove bacteria and dis-easedttissue.The drilling also forms a.pocket which holds the250 239 filling material. Af er dEilling the tooth the gentist cleans thehole andlusually \"coa it to insulate the ,Many differentmaterials are used for filling teeth. Amongthe materials are gold or a mixture of silver0 tin, copper/zinc4nd mercury, known as amalgam. Material with a plastic base isdften used in the front of incisors, because the material lookslike tooth eIamel.Plastic material was notrused until recently.in biting su faces, because it was not strong enough. However, a-plastic with.quartz fibers was recently deVeloped which can be usedon all surfaces. .dAFILLING ,If the crown is badly decayed but the pulp is intact, the den-tis-Omay replace the crown with an artificial one. To do this hefirit grinds tipe tooth down to a peg. Thd artificial crown iscemented over the peg and extends slightly under the gum. Crownsare made of either gold or porcelain. , .If decay progresses through-the enaMel and dentin to the pulp,the pulp becomes inflamed. When decay has progressed to this pointit is sometimes necessary to remove the,tooth. However, modernroot canal techniques can frequently save these teeth.tIf it becomes necessary to remove a tooth fit should be re-placed with a bridge. A bridge is'a gelse tooth set in a framewhich is connected to the,teeth on eitlher side. Bridges may beremovhle or permanent. A bridge iS fequired to prevent malocclur-sion, because without a. bridge the te th on eit4er side will moveinto the.gap left by the missing t ot N,Periodontal disease is trea d by first remoOing the source Of14 irritation.Cleaning removes ba teria and food. Scraping the teeth,a process called scaling, 'removes calculus,and stimulates the gums.This increases circulation. If malocclusion is present it is cor-rected, and improperly fitting dentures are replaced.. In addition,the diet is often chpged to improve the condition of the gums., *,Our'discugsion of dental 'hygiene cannot be Thus be the outcome of poor techniques of flossing and/orbrushing, or it May be a symatom of a dental disease. Sometimesmouth odors may be due to otlibr diseases such as uncontrolled dia-betes or, chronic nasal or. sinus infections. Certain foods lryimpart a \"bad\" odor to the breath.Evidently PP0ple have been concerned about breath/for alongltime.In fifth-dentury a mouthwash was concacted bysufpending the following in water: aShes from the head of a. rabbit #mi4d with dried powdered micejplus an equal portion of paverizedmarble.While modern mouthwashes are less obnoxious in contentsand come nicely,packaged, they havb little or no value in dentalhygiene.They temporarily camouflage the \"effect,\" but do not relateto the \"cause\" of the problem.42-4 Carbohydrates and Dental Health-How may carbohydrates affect the health of tepth?During World Wars I arid 1,1, refined sugars and other highly re-tined carbohydrates were not as available as they have been at bthdrtimes.One result was a decrease in the occutrence of dental caries.To understand the relation of \"sugar to caries, recall the role ofbacteria in the mouth.. Bacteria dOnsume sugar and convert it toacid.Acid erodes the enamel of the teeth.Sugar isavailableto bacteria for immediate consumption, butstarch must first be broken down to sugar. Starch iS brokbn downthe.enzyme amylase; whichas in saliva, but the'process takestime.Only a fraction of the starch in the mouth is converted tosugar, the'rest passing to the stomach unchanged. Consequentlycmly a fraction oflthe starch eaten is available to bacteria inthe mouth.Certain sweet-tasting alcohols called sugar alcohols,are alsodigpsted slowly and are therefore not readily available to bacteria.This fact is taken advantagwof by using these alcohols in sugarless'gum.The worst sugars fqr your teeth are those that remain in yourmouth ldngest. Candy that sticks to.the teeth is particularly bad..Sweets in solution are better, because they pass-through the mouthmost readily. .-WOuld you expect Eskimos and Indians to have more or fewercaries than other people?

This element is fluorine.'Fluorine, occurring as the F--ion, helps to prevent the formationof dental caries. lite drinking ;water of many communities cohtainsflucbrides Naturally, and the dental health records of these communi-ties first demonstrated the value of fluorides. ',-What initially called /attention to the relation between fluo-:rides WI dental health was not the lack of caries.,,;: In was mottledenamel.The teeth of people in certain communities'i mostly in the .Southwest, were found to have a tendency to become pi.gmented -tostain a dark brown. This occurred when the concentration o fluo-ride in their water exceeded two'parts per million (ppm). \u00b6llhe .positive value of fluoride was-discovered when it wasjound people with mottled enamel developed fewer caries than thezest of the population. 'This prompted a great deal of research onfluoride in relation to dental-health. ' \\N\\ In' the table on/p. 245 are listed the concentrations of fluo- ., rides in the water of 13 communities. The data are listed fromhighest to lowest fluoride content of drinking water. Concentrationsare given in parts per million. ,Also listed-are the'percentages of\u00b0children wi,th no tooth of the water and den-tal health is very strong. In towns with 0.1 part per millionfluoride in the watdt only about one to two per cent of the childre,had no tooth decay. In Colorado Springs, which has 2.6 parts permillion fluoride, and Galesburg, Illinois, with 19 parts ,per mil-lion, over a fourth of the children had no decay.On the average,a child in Colorado Springs or in Galesburg had approximately 2.5diseased teeth. Chirdren in Michigan City, Indiana, had an avkgrage10.4 diseased teeth:The statistics given aboveindicate that fluorides can help/prevent tooth decay, but they also raise a series of questions.' Isfluoride more, effective with people of certain ages? Does fluoridereach teeth through the blood. system 'or dtkectly from saliva? Howdoes fluoride The' an-sWers to some of these questions have not been coMpletely deter-mined,' but we-will state what is known. 1.A study of two similar neighboring cities on the Hudson River'inNewYork, the cities of Newburgh' and Kingston, provided valuabledata on the effectiveness of flupridation.
