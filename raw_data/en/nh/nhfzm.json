This might minimize damage of paraspinal muscles, blood loss, risk of infection, postoperative pain, functional disturbance, and prolonged hospitalization [1]. Hence, application of a MIS technique can be beneficial for the various spinal pathologies, especially in elderly or debilitated patients desired long spinal constructs. The purpose of the current case presentation was to indicate the usefulness of long thoracic and lumbar (TL) spinal stabilization by percutaneous minimally invasive instrumentation (PMII). Materials and Methods From August 2012 to May 2013, we performed long TL spinal stabilization with VIPER 2 system (Depuy Spine, Inc., MA, US) by using a MIS posterior approach in 4 patients. Causative disorders were trauma in 2 cases and metastatic spinal tumor in 2 cases. All cases were male with a mean age of 69 years old, ranged from 54 to 79 years old. These 4 patients were desirable to be done spinal surgeries less invasively because they were advanced age or debilitated by complicating disorders acceptable to undergo stabilization without bone graft. The assessment included the clinical outcome of the patients and implant imaging evaluation (Table 1). Surgical procedure The patients were placed in the prone position under general endotracheal anesthesia, and were carefully positioned on the surgical table in order to obtain the best pre-operative spinal alignment. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a stab wound approximately 2-3cm long was marked for every single pedicle that needed to be cannulated [2]. After making an incision through the skin and the muscle fascia, a muscular canal that linked all the stab wounds was created with digital dissection by splitting the muscle fibers apart. Pedicle screws were then inserted following the standard percutaneous technique. The rods were then contoured and cut as needed to adapt them to the desired curve of the spine. The rods were threaded through the uppermost extender sleeves and advanced through the muscular canal, taking care to pass through all extender sleeves. Once the rod was advanced, it was rotated to end up in the final position. Results Physical function was improved in all cases with quick pain relief. Mean operative time was 204 minutes (range, 131-301 min). Mean estimated blood loss was 62.5 ml (range, 40-90 ml) (Table 1). In radiographic evaluation, spinal alignment was successfully maintained. One pedicle screw in case 3 cut out laterally in a pedicle-rib unit, but other pedicle screws in all cases were correctly inserted. No implant related complication was observed. And there were no conversions to open surgery.Journal of Spine ISSN: 2165-7939Journal of SpineCitation: Kuroki E (2013) Long Thoracic and Lumbar Spinal Stabilization with a Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery Technique.

The type of fracture classified by Magerl [3] was A3.3.3. Fortunately, consciousness level was recovered after cranial decompressive procedure. Then, we performed long TL spinal stabilization with a MIS technique to facilitate rehabilitation for his independence. Patient- based evaluation about pain was not possible for residual impaired consciousness, however preoperative continuous dosing of opioid analgesia could be discontinued at 4 days postoperatively. Independent activity in a wheel chair was obtained at 4 months after surgery and alignment of the spine had maintained with consolidation of T12 at 6 months after surgery (Figure 1). Case 2 A 68 year old male developed incomplete paraplegia with severe back pain by metastatic renal cell carcinoma of T11 (Frankel C) (Figure 2). We performed long TL spinal stabilization with a MIS technique and partial tumor resection through another small incision to aim quick pain relief and recovery of paralysis. Two cross-links could be installed via this extra wound (Figure 3). Soon after surgery, his intolerable pain was diminished and paralysis was also partly improved (Figure 4). Although he could not sit by himself preoperatively, independent sitting in a wheel chair was obtained at 4 days after surgery. Not only opioid administration prior to surgery but also a MIS technique seemed to quite reduce surgical site pain. Case 3 A 79 year old male affected Chance fracture of T12 (Frankel E) (Figure 5). We selected long TL spinal stabilization with a MIS technique because he also had an ankylosing spinal hyperostosis that arise severe instability at the fracture lesion (Figure 6). Patient-based evaluation about pain was impossible for mild dementia, however he could walk by himself at 2 days after surgery. Bone union was confirmed at 4 months postoperatively and his activity of daily living was completely returned to pre-traumatic level. Case 4 A 75 year old male affected pathological fracture of T8 (Frankel A) and became bedridden due to an unbearable motion pain in the back (Figure 7). We selected long TL spinal stabilization with a MIS technique because he had significant unstable spine derived from not only metastatic prostatic carcinoma between T7 and T9 levels but also an ankylosing spinal hyperostosis in the whole spine (Figure 8). Soon after surgery, his intolerable back pain was markedly decreased and he could sit by himself with half dosage of preoperative opioid analgesia.Discussion Conventional open procedures have been widely used in the treatment of thoracic or lumbar spinal diseases over the years. However, they can be associated with significant approach-related morbidity [4]. Anterior approaches have been related to considerable postoperative pain, shoulder girdle dysfunction, and compromised ventilation. The standard posterior midline approach has been associated with significant muscle morbidity, including muscle denervation, increased intramuscular pressures, ischemia, and revascularization injury. Whereat, minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) was developed to decrease the rate of approach-related morbidity associated with conventional open spine surgery in an effort to improve clinical outcomes [5]. The most important advantages of MISS are the prompt recovery of the patient and the decrease in the complications by minimizing iatrogenic tissue injury typical of that encountered following open surgery [6]. Some experimental studies have proven that MIS techniques are obviously less invasive than standard open procedures for the multifidus muscles [7,8]. Consequently, intraoperative blood loss, operative time, and postoperative pain were remarkably decreased in MISS in comparison with conventional open surgery. In 1977, the technique of PMII with percutaneous pedicle screw placement was described by Magerl [9]. It was used subsequently only for temporary external stabilization, and the idea recently has been taken further to percutaneous internal stabilization [10]. At the beginning, this technique made use of single level stabilization. After that, multi-segmental stabilization has been popularly utilized by developing new devices that enable the long spinal stabilization. The spinal stabilization with PMII utilizing muscle-dilating approaches is a desirable advancement to minimize surgical incision length, surgical cavity size, and the amount of iatrogenic soft-tissue injury associated with surgical spinal exposure [11]. In contrast, a potential disadvantage of the spinal stabilization with PMII feared by spine surgeons is the inability to perform adequate arthrodesis and achieve long-term osseous fusion [5]. And further, this technique does not allow the cross-link placement [1]. Although Roldan et al. [2] introduce the surgical procedures to perform facet fusion and apply a cross-link with minimally invasive technique, they need additional incisions. Considering these drawbacks of the spinal stabilization with PMII, we performed long TL spinal stabilization with this technique for the patients with spinal trauma and malignant spinal tumor that do not always need bone graft. In consequence, all 4 patients obtained quick pain relief by the spinal stabilization and recovery due to less soft tissue damage. In case 2, we could additionally put two cross-links through another small incision for tumor resection. At present, the spinal stabilization with PMII is supposed to be * Magerl classification **estimated blood loss (ml) ***operative time (min) Table 1: Summary of cases.Case No. Age Sex Diagnosis Level Of LesionCause Co-Mobidity Instrumented LevelsEBL** OT*** Physical fracture (A3.3.3*) T12 fall brain contusion T10-L2 50 184 bedridden sitting 2 68 male metastatic tumor T11 renal cancer - T9-L1 70 310 bedridden sitting 3 79 male Chance fracture T12 fall ankylosing spinal hyperostosisT9-L2 40 191 bedridden walking 4 75 male metastatic tumor (pathological fracture)T8 prostatic cancer Inomata Hamanaka H, Chosa E (2013) Long Thoracic and Lumbar Spinal Stabilization with a Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery Technique.

The need to remove the implant once the fracture heals may be a matter of discussion in the future [6]. The application of the spinal stabilization with PMII can be broadened to long spinal constructs to assess fractures, tumor, deformity, and infection more and more hereafter. This procedure seems especially adequate and proportionate to achieve temporal internal stabilization in elderly or debilitated patients, in which approach-related morbidity needs to be reduced to a minimum. However, problems related to this technique will be anticipated with the expansion of surgical indication. Unfortunately, due to the small number of cases and short follow-up period, it was difficult to derive issues in the current report. Therefore, prospective and long-term comparative clinical studies with the conventional open procedure are required to demonstrate the true clinical benefit of this technique and the real survival of minimally implanted long constructs [2]. But we believe that our case series will contribute to some development of the spinal stabilization with a MIS technique.
