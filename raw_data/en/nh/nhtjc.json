As part of these efforts, MoH&FW is preparing a database of Health Care Workers (HCWs), defined as, health care service providers and other workers in health care settings (both government and private), who may be prioritised for Se ee eR cea for which the Central Ministries/Departments who have HCWs in Health facilities under them are expected to create a database of the HCWs working in the r\u00e9spective institutions/facilities in a prescribed excel template. 3. It is, therefore, requested that the Ministries may identify a Nodal Officer for the above-mentioned activity and immediately intimate the Health facilities to initiate the data collection of all HCWs defined above in the standard template. Every facility will fill up the details of associated HCWs in the template and submit it to the identified Nodal Officer who will collate the database of all HCWs by 31% October 2020. A detailed guideline for filling the template is enclosed herewith and the template is available for download at the following web-link: https://hmis.nhp.gov.in/#!/ 4. Subsequently, after receiving the completed datasets from the facilities, the departments will upload the templates on COVID-19 Vaccination Beneficiary Management system (CVBMS) which is under development. The guidelines for uploading the data on CVBMS will be ie shared shortly. The Covid-19 vaccination drive of HCWs will utilize this database to identify the beneficiaries, hence, completeness of this eos atabase and its timely submission is vital. aa KE _ ae \" eal? ve MM er > t _ \\ eee?

The same will be decided by the National Expert Group on COVID -19 Vaccine (NEGVAC)Introduction The response to the COVID-19 pandemic by Government of India (Gol) is characterised by a comprehensive whole of government approach to prevent and control the pandemic. Globally, the scientific community, researchers, academic institutions and pharmaceutical industries are making unprecedented efforts to rapidly develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Anticipating that COVID-19 vaccine may soon be available, Gol is preparing for its introduction in the country so that it can be expeditiously rolled out when available. One of the milestones in this direction has been the constitution of a National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC). The NEGVAC is guiding Gol on; prioritization of population groups for vaccination; vaccine inventory management and tracking: monitoring of implementation processes; identification of vaccine delivery platforms, etc. COVID-19 Vaccination Beneficiary Management system (CVBMS) is being created as an extension of existing electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) module for individualised tracking of all beneficiaries receiving COVID-19 vaccine. 'This will require creation of beneficiary databases within the CVBMS which in turn will streamline the process of tracking them for vaccination. The CVBMS is under development and details of its functionalities and utilities will be shared separately once the development is complete. Scope This document describes in the detail the mechanisms for collecting data of Health Care Workers (HCWs), defined as, health care service providers and other workers in Central Government governed hospitals/ health institutions (under various ministries like Health, Defence, WCD, Railways, Labour, Power, Steel, Atomic Energy etc.,) who will be prioritized for vaccination once the vaccine is available. Objective The objective of this document is to orient the Central Ministries and their Health facilities/Institutions regarding the processes to be followed for collection, compilation, verification and upload of the HC Ws data in CVBMS. Coordination Mechanisms 1. Central Ministries \u00ab A Nodal Officer will be nominated by the central ministry who will coordinate this exercise. The roles and responsibilities of the Nodal Officer are attached as Annexure 1. e At the ministry level a Joint Secretary (JS) level officer will be responsible for ensuring completion of all data collection activities within the specified timelines. e The nodal officer designated earlier for the purpose of collecting and uploading information of health facilities to be dedicated for COVID care, could also be considered to be designated as nodal officer for purpose of this data collection and compilation. 2. Health Facilities/Institutions * The Facility/institution In-charges of the facilities/institutions will be responsible for collecting the data of the HC Ws in their respective facilities. Data Collection Template A standard Excel based template, hereinafter referred to as the Template, has been developed for data collection. This Template can be downloaded from the link https://hmis.nhp.gov.in/#!/ and is compatible with all versions of Microsoft Office software. The Template will have the filename of COVID VACC_IMPORT BENEFICIARIES _ CENTRAL INSTITUTES.XLSX. A snapshot of the template is available in Annexure 2 for reference only. The following points need to be noted while filling data into the Template: \u00ab A separate Template needs to be filled for each health facility/institution within the Ministry. * The ministry after downloading the Template from the link above will add the ministry name at the end of the existing filename after placing an underscore (_). The rest of the filename (ie. COVID VACC_IMPORT BENEFICIARIES _ CENTRAL _INSTITUTES.XLSX) is a fixed component and should not be changed. For exaniple Ministry of Defence under MHA will save the file as COVID VACC. IMPORT BENEFICIARIES. CENTRAL INSTITUTES \u00a9 DEFENCE. XLSX * The ministry will email the downloaded sheet with the ministry name added in the filename (as above) to the facilities. e The Template will be shared by email only. e Detailed instructions table for filling data in each field of the Template are provided in Annexure 3. \u00a2 The Template has dropdowns in relevant fields to allow ease of data entry and to minimise data entry errors. e Various fields in the Template have built in validations which need to be strictly adhered to, else data compilation will be hindered. The field wise validations are listed in Annexure 4 of this document. e There should be no attempt to change the Template structure (in terms of addition, deletion of new columns, field changes etc) as this will prevent the compilation in CVBMS. e\u00ab The Template will allow a maximum of only 1000 entries of HCWs. In case a facility/institution has more than 1000 HCWs whose data needs to be filled, the 1001\u00b0 entry should be started in a new Template. Thus, for every 1000 HCWs in the facility/institution a separate Template will be required to be filled by the facility/institution. e After the data of HCWs is filled, the facility/institution should save the Template with the following filename COVID WVACC_IMPORT BENEFICIARIES _ CENTRAL INSTITUTES _MINISTRY_FACILITY.XLSXData Compilation and Template Uploading The data will be compiled at the respective Ministry level only. The Ministry is advised to create a master COVID-19 HCWs folder in the computer. This master folder should have facility/institution wise folders where all filled in Templates sent by the respective facilities will be saved. These facility wise folders will allow the Ministry to save multiple Templates sent by facilities having more than 1000 HCWs in one folder, thus preventing data loss. The Ministry will be responsible to ensure the correctness and completeness of HCWs data provided by the facilities. The data compiled by the Ministry will be uploaded in the CVBMS, the link to which will be communicated separately after its development is complete. Within the CVBMS, user ids and passwords will be created for each Ministry by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) and sent by email to the respective Nodal Officer. Once the filled Templates received from the facilities are compiled in the Ministry, the nodal officer will ensure that the data is uploaded into the CVBMS. The ministries need to ensure the following before uploading the Templates: The facility/institution in- charges will send the fi lled Template with the shee prescribed filename to the ministry by email only. The Template for each facility/institution should be uploaded separately. Please ensure that all Templates sent by a single facility/institution that has more than 1000 HC Ws are uploaded. The CVBMS will check each entry in the Template for errors. The correct entries will be uploaded in the system and wrong entries will be rejected. A separate Excel sheet listing the rejected entries along with the reasons for rejection will be generated. The Ministry will send the Excel sheet with the rejected entries back to the respective facilities for correction. The corrected sheet received from the facility/institution will be again uploaded into the CVBMS. The Ministry will upload the Template after proper verification No private hospital should be included in the Template by the ministries as the details of same is being taken separately from State/UTs In the scenario where a facility/institution requires more than one Template (for more than 1000 HC Ws), the Templates should be saved by adding numbers at the end of the filenames like, COVID VACC_JIMPORT BENEFICIARIES _ CENTRAL BENEFICIARIES_ CENTRAL INSTITUTES _ MINISTRY_FACILITY 2.XLSX, so on and so forth. For example, if RR under Ministry. of Defence has 1500 HCWs then the ! Template with the first 1000 HC Ws data will be saves as COVID VACC IMPORT BENEFICIARIES CENTRAL INSTITUTES _ DEFENCE. RnRiXLSX and the Template with the remaining 500 HCWs will be saved as COVID VACC IMPORT BENEFICIARIES | & ENTRAL_ Une u ey ee pag NG) Dee L811 8. >, Ge e Please do not email the sheets to MOH&FW \u2014 data will not be uploaded at MoH& FW and there will be chances of data loss. * Data has to be uploaded in the IT platform that is being developed, the details of which will be shared separately. e MoH&FW will not authenticate the data but in some exceptional cases will have the power to override the information.
