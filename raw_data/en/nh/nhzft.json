Our hilltop campus is a place of beauty and friendliness. It embraces a proud heritage and a bold, ambitious future. WKU is located in Bowling Green, Kentucky, a city with a population of more than 60,000 approximately 110 miles south of Louisville and 65 miles north of Nashville. As a distinctive landmark on a hill overlooking the city, the WKU campus commands an impressive view of the Barren River Valley and is acclaimed as one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation. Visit http://wku.edu/tour (http://wku.edu/tour/ ) for a virtual campus tour. In addition to main campus, WKU has locations at South Campus, the Center for Research and Development, and the University Farm. Outside of Bowling Green, there are Regional Campuses in Glasgow, Owensboro, and Elizabethtown-Fort Knox. WKU's undergraduate division provides four-year programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts, the Bachelor of Fine Arts, the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies, the Bachelor of Science, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, the Bachelor of Music, and the Bachelor of Social Work degrees. One hundred (100) academic majors that lead to the baccalaureate degree and seventy-six (76) academic minors are available. A number of professional and pre-professional advising tracks provide additional options. Six (6) associate degree programs are offered leading to the Associate of Arts degree, Associate of Science degree, Associate of Science in Nursing and Associate of Interdisciplinary Studies degree. Thirty (30) undergraduate certicate programs are also offered. The Graduate School (http://www.wku.edu/graduate/) at WKU offers graduate education in ninety (90) degree and certicate programs. The University confers the Master of Accountancy, Master of Arts, Master of Arts in Education, Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Business Administration, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Health Administration, Master of Music, Master of Public Administration, Master of Public Health, Master of Science, Master of Science in Nursing, Master of Social Work, Specialist in Education, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Nursing Practice, Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Doctor of Psychology.WKU also offers non-degree Rank I and II and certication-only teacher education programs. History On March 21, 1906 the Kentucky General Assembly approved legislation to establish two teacher training institutions, or \"normal schools,\" in the state. A locating commission chose Bowling Green to be the site of one, and the Western Kentucky State Normal School was created. The new state-supported school took over the building and student body of the privately owned Southern Normal School. The owner of the Southern Normal School, Henry Hardin Cherry, had been actively involved in the campaign to establish teacher training schools and became the institution's rst president. Classes began on January 22, 1907. On February 4, 1911 the school moved to its present site on \"the Hill,\" approximately 125 feet above downtown Bowling Green and formerly the site of the Pleasant J. Potter College. Over the next decade, the curriculum focused on teacher training and certication. In 1922, the state renamed the institution Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College and authorized it to grant four-year degrees. The rst such degrees were awarded in 1924. The campus expanded in 1927, when it merged with Ogden College, a private school for young men located on the east side of the Hill. The name was shortened to Western Kentucky State Teachers College in 1930, and the following year the rst graduate degree was offered. In the 1950s and 1960s, both the curriculum and campus underwent major reorganization and expansion. In 1963, the institution merged with the Bowling Green College of Commerce. Along with The Graduate School, the Bowling Green College of Commerce became a separate college within the academic structure. In 1965, the Board of Regents approved the formation of three more colleges: the Potter College of Liberal Arts, the College of Education, and the Ogden College of Science and Technology. On June 16, 1966, Western Kentucky State College became Western Kentucky University. More colleges and reorganization followed throughout the years as WKU continued to expand. The College of Health and Human Services was established in 2002, and the Division of Extended Learning and Outreach launched in 2003. In 2008, the WKU Board of Regents approved creation and development of a fully-independent Honors College at WKU. In 2011, the rst doctoral degrees were awarded through the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences. In 2011 and 2013 two new professional practice doctoral degrees, the Doctor of Nursing Practice and the Doctor of Physical Therapy, were established, and in 2015 the Doctor of Psychology was added. WKU's ve academic colleges are: College of Education and Behavioral Sciences College of Health and Human Services Gordon Ford College of Business Ogden College of Science and Engineering Potter College of Arts & Letters In addition, the Dixie and Peter Mahurin Honors College offers high- achieving students the environment of a small, highly selective college within the framework of the larger university.

The core values that undergird the foundations of WKU are reflected in the University's mission, and purpose statements, and in the goals of the strategic plan. The rich heritage that is WKU's has been built upon a foundation of shared values that have withstood the test of time and the challenges of many changes. These values are deeply embedded in the words of WKU's rst President, Dr. Henry Hardin Cherry, as he set forth a vision for this University\u2014 to be a live school and to impart to its students a burning zeal to do and be something... to be progressive, to use modern methods and equipment, but reject all worthless educational fads... to let the reputation of the school be sustained by real merit...to \"ring the rising bell in the human soul\" by inspiring all students who come in touch with the work of the institution... The core values are further reflected in Dr. Cherry's oft-quoted reminder that \"It's what's above the rim that counts\" and in the two University ideals expressed in the University seal: \"Life More Life\" and the University motto: \"The Spirit Makes the Master.\" Building upon these long-lasting values, the following core values represent a reafrmation of the shared purposes and beliefs upon which this strategic plan is built: Emphasis on cooperation, teamwork, and mutual respect for individual differences in scholarship, diversity, and culture. Expectation for all conduct to be characterized by integrity, honesty, and commitment to high moral and ethical values and principles. Commitment to assuring quality of programs, competence of graduates, and opportunities for lifelong learning. A view of scholarly endeavors that includes teaching, research, and creative activities as mutually supportive. Encouragement of meaningful and active partnerships among students, faculty, staff, and constituents to strengthen the learning environment. Nurturing of innovative and creative activities of faculty, staff, and students that advance University mission and goals. Dedication to the importance of achieving excellence in all programs and for adding value to the degrees and credentials of our students. Commitment to providing a collegiate experience that prepares students to be informed, engaged, and dedicated citizens. Commitment to contributing to improved quality of life and economic well-being of Kentuckians, especially those in our primary service area, as well as other constituents and stakeholders. Commitment to developing empowered, informed, and responsible learners who recognize both the personal and shared responsibility to actively participate in university life by upholding the principles of the University Creed.

Information about WKU's residency policy is available at https://www.wku.edu/admissions/ residency.php. Residency determinations are made and communicated to the student at the point of admission. It is the student's responsibility to initiate a residency reclassication review if the residency decision is thought to be incorrect. Residency determinations cannot be made retroactively. An active member of the Kentucky National Guard who enrolls as a student in a Kentucky public university as a non-Kentucky resident shall be considered a Kentucky resident for tuition purposes per KRS 164.2844(2). Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 25 Admission Appeal Procedures When further consideration of a WKU admission decision is desired, the University Admission Appeals Committee shall have the responsibility for reviewing the situation to determine if the decision was in keeping with existing policy. An appeal will only be considered by this committee after a letter of appeal written and signed by the applicant has been submitted to the Director of Admissions clearly explaining the reasons the student feels an exception should be made. The letter of appeal should include details that the applicant considers appropriate. The University Admissions Appeals Committee will convene using the letter of appeal, as well as all admission materials, as the basis for decision. The applicant will be informed in writing of the decision of the committee. For additional information concerning admission appeals, contact the Ofce of Admissions at admission@wku.edu . Departments Requiring Additional Admission Students should be aware that several academic majors require admission to the program in addition to admission to Western Kentucky University. Students should contact the specic department to determine any additional admission requirements. Baccalaureate degree programs generally accept applications for admission by the third year of study, while associate degree programs generally accept applications by the second semester of the rst year. Students interested in associate degree programs are encouraged to contact the department well in advance of initial enrollment. University admission is required before departmental admission can be considered.

Housed in the Downing Student Union, the ACDC provides academic advising, retention services, learning resources, and career development to support student success and persistence to graduation. The ACDC places a strong emphasis on undergraduate advising, including specialized services for transfer students, those exploring majors, and those in transition, while also offering free tutoring andprograms to help undergraduate students be independent and successful learners. Training is also offered for academic advisors through the center. Advising The Advising and Career Development Center (ACDC) advisors and staff are knowledgeable about every undergraduate program offered on the WKU campus. The center coordinates academic advising activities among undergraduate and academic departments for undergraduate students, and all degree-seeking undergraduate students must meet with an academic advisor prior to registering for classes each semester. The academic advisor assists the student in the selection of courses that will provide appropriate preparation for his/her career objectives and assures timely completion of degree program requirements. Academic advisors at WKU will also provide guidance regarding academic resources, internship possibilities, and key information for student success while working toward graduation. Generally, students with fewer than 60 hours of college credit, including transfer students, will be assigned an ACDC advisor who works closely with the academic colleges. Students with a declared major and 60 hours or more will be assigned an advisor from the academic department that administers their particular program of study. Students can nd their advisor's contact information on TopNet or by contacting the ACDC at (270) 745-5065. The Exploratory Program The Advising and Career Development Center (ACDC) specically serves undergraduate students that have not selected a major and are exploring their options. The Exploratory Program advisors lead students on a path of self-discovery, as they work to identify areas of interest, individual strengths, and career goals that align with one or more academic areas of study. These students explore the wide array of majors and minors WKU has to offer, and are able to make well-informed decisions regarding their academic and career options. Students who utilize this program also cultivate non-academic, executive functioning skills to support persistence to graduation. An undergraduate student who has not selected a major (an Exploratory student) is advised by the staff of the ACDC, and can continue as an Exploratory student up to 60 credit hours. A student can be general Exploratory or Exploratory within one of the academic colleges. Best Expectation Programs (BEP) The Best Expectations Programs (BEP) targets academically-at-risk students on probation with programs to increase persistence through structured support. Students on academic probation are required to attend BEP workshops. BEP works with students to identify realistic academic goals, as well as address other academic and non-academic concerns. BEP provides students with workshop opportunities and tutoring services through The Learning Center. Ultimately, the efforts of BEP will encourage student persistence and assist them in successful degree completion from WKU.

Payment of fees will not be deferred,unless the student participates in one of the approved payment plans as described below. The University expects the students to be nancially responsible and not be delinquent in nancial obligations to the University or to any department or division of the University. If a student registers and decides not to attend, the student must withdraw from all classes prior to the rst day of classes on TopNet or by notifying the Ofce of the Registrar in writing to ensure that the student will not owe tuition and late payment fees and receive \"F\" grades. The student is responsible for his or her own enrollment status. A student who fails to meet a nancial obligation by the due date of the notice from the appropriate university ofcial will be subject to regulations promulgated by the University. If the student does not settle the obligation by the date designated on the notice, the appropriate business ofce shall notify the University Registrar. After the University Registrar has been notied that a student is delinquent, the University Registrar shall not allow the student to register or to obtain an ofcial transcript or diploma until the University Registrar has been notied that the obligation has been settled. The University expects all students to register for classes and pay tuition prior to the rst day of class. A late payment charge of $100 may be assessed for failure to pay by the designated due date. Failure to receive a bill does not relieve the student of the obligation to pay tuition and fees by the due date. The University does not mail printed billing statements. All billing is electronic with students receiving notications through their university-assigned e-mail addresses. As an added service, students can also select a billing e-mail address via TopNet so they can have their account statements sent to an additional e-mail address. In the event that any tuition, fees and/or expenses are not paid when due, and the University undertakes collection of any unpaid portion, the student shall also be assessed and be responsible for any collection costs and/or fees associated with the collection of the debt including but not limited to: collection agency fees, which may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 33.3% of the debt, reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and all other charges allowed by law.

Classication of Students Beginning students are classied as freshmen; students with a minimum of 30 semester hours earned, as sophomores; 60 hours earned, as juniors; and 90 hours earned, as seniors. Course Load To be considered a full-time undergraduate student, one must carry a minimum of 12 hours each semester. Students who wish to enroll for 20-21 semester hours must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or above. Registration and Student Schedule Changes After classes begin, registration for a full-time course load and / or changes in schedules may be made only within the rst six class days of a semester or the rst three days of a bi-term or 5-week session. Courses that do not meet at least twice during the rst six class days may be added through, but not past, the day of the second class meeting. During a term (full semester, bi-term, 5-week session, or summer session, a student may withdraw from a course with a grade of \"W\" or \"F\" under the following conditions. It is recommended faculty members inform students of this \"W\" period deadline. A student is permitted to withdraw from any course with a grade of \"W\" until the 70% point of the term. Refer to the Registration Guide on the Ofce of the Registrar's website for specic dates. See the Academic Dishonesty section for exception information. After the 70% point of the term, any student dropping a course receives an automatic \"F.\" However, when there are extenuating circumstances, and at the discretion of the faculty member and the department head, the student may be permitted to withdraw with a \"W\" instead of \"F.\" Students should refer to the Registration Guide each term for specic dates affecting schedule changes. Attendance Policy It is the policy of Western Kentucky University that class attendance is an important part of a student's educational experience and is a requirement for success in courses. Registration in a course obligates the student to be regular and punctual in class attendance. Students should make certain their names are on the class roll. If an error has been made in registration, it is the student's responsibility to see the error is corrected in the Ofce of the Registrar. Students who know of necessary absences should consult with the instructor before the absence. Students who miss classes are not excused from the work associated with the course. Students who cease attending class are expected to report to the Ofce of the Registrar to initiate withdrawal procedures. Withdrawal deadlines are published each term in the Registration Guide. Non-attendance does not relieve students of the responsibility for tuition or fees. It is the responsibility of each instructor to maintain records to inform the University whether a student was present in lass until the 60% point of the term. Records may be kept in the instructor's desired format.Attendance has an effect on the receipt or repayment of nancial aid or scholarship. Instructors may create guidelines for attendance in each course. The instructor must notify students of the attendance policy in writing within one week of the start of the pertinent semester/term/summer session. it is recommended that this information be included in the course syllabus. Excessive Absenteeism Excessive absenteeism frequently contributes to poor academic achievement. An instructor who determines a student's absenteeism is inconsistent with the instructor's stated policy should either counsel with the student or request the advising ofce arrange a counseling session with the student. Excessive absenteeism may result in the instructor's dismissing the student from the class and recording a failing grade, unless the student ofcially withdraws from the class before the withdrawal deadline. If the student withdraws from the university after the end of the ofcial withdrawal period, excessive absenteeism may be one of the considerations in the instructor's deciding whether circumstances justify a \"W\" or an \"F\" in the course. The normal appeal process is available to the student who wants to appeal the decision of the instructor. Medical or Bereavement Absenteeism When a student is absent from class because of illness, death in the family, or other justiable reasons, it is the student's responsibility to consult the instructor at the earliest possible time. Contact the advising ofce for guidance (270) 745-5065. The advising ofce provides class attendance notication services as requested by students and faculty. When requested by students, notications of absences resulting from personal emergencies are relayed to faculty. In addition to this ofcial notication, it is the student's responsibility to contact each professor to make arrangements to complete missed assignments and tests. The advising ofce also noties students of excessive absences reported by faculty. 5th Week Check-in The Advising and Career Development Center (ACDC) provides a 5th week check-in to all freshmen and sophomores in classes at the 200- level and below during the 5th week of each semester to help identify areas that may need improvement. Instructors shall provide information about students' class performance regarding attendance and grades. It is recommended that instructors offer a meaningful assessment during the rst ve weeks to measure student performance in addition to keeping track of attendance. Students may be flagged or missing class too frequently and/or for having a D/F in the course. Course instructors, academic advisors, residence hall staff and/or the ACDC staff may follow up with flagged students to discuss potential issues the student may be facing in and out of the classroom. Drop for Non-Attendance Students who, without previous arrangement with the instructor or department, fail to attend the rst two class meetings of a course meeting multiple times per week or the rst meeting of a class that meets one time per week MAY be dropped from the course. Nonattendance for a web-based course shall be dened as failure to perform meaningful academically-related activity (including, but not limited to, the following: submitting an academic assignment, taking an exam, participating in an online discussion about academic matters) within one week of the course start date without previous arrangements with the instructor or department. Instructors have the right to drop non-attending students during the drop/add period specied in the Registration Guide to allow Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog38 Academic Requirements and Regulations other students to register for the course, thus cutting down on waitlists and bottlenecks. Failure for Non-Attendance (After Registration Period) Students who attended a course during the rst week but ceased attending up to and including the 60% point of a term will receive a failure for non-attendance grade (FN). This grade shows no semester hours earned and no quality points. Non-attendance may include either ceasing to attend the course or failing to complete any meaningful assignments up to and including the 60% point of the term. Instructors must enter the date the student last attended the course when entering the FN grade on the student's record. Registration Requirement No WKU student may attend a course for which he or she is not registered, either as a degree-seeking student or as a non-degree seeking student.

Military Absence Policy for Ofcial Military Duties and Veteran Administration Medical Appointments Instructors are expected to show flexibility to Military and Veteran students who have required absences due to military duties or Veteran Administration medical appointments. These absences are mandated and beyond the students' control. Instructors should not penalize absences of this type in any way. Accommodations and specic time frames to make up all missed assignments, quizzes, and tests will be given and mutually agreed upon by the instructor and student. Students are responsible for notifying faculty members of absences as far in advance as possible, when possible, and for ensuring that their absence is documented. Absences can be veried by ofcial orders, appointment notications, or through the Ofce of Military Student Services. Students called to duty for an extended amount of time should be referred to the Military Withdrawal policy. Auditing of Courses An auditor enrolls and participates in a course without expecting to receive academic credit. The same registration procedure is followed, and the same fees are charged as for courses taken for credit. An audited course is not applicable to any degree or certicate program. Regular class attendance is expected of an auditor. Other course requirements, which may be obtained in writing from the instructor, will vary depending on the nature of the course. Students interested in auditing a course should secure permission from the instructor and discuss course requirements prior to enrolling. Failure to meet course requirements may result in the auditor being withdrawn from the course at the request of the instructor. A successful audit will be recorded on the transcript with the designation AU. Any change from audit to credit must be done by the last day to add a class. Changes from credit to audit must be done by the last day to drop a class with a grade of \"W.\" Refunds for withdrawals from auditedcourses will be prorated on the same basis as refunds for withdrawals from courses taken for credit. Global Studies Designation WKU offers all students the opportunity to earn a Global Studies Designation as part of their undergraduate education. This designation may be combined with any major. Students who complete the requirements outlined below will receive the \"Emphasis in Global Studies\" designation on their ofcial transcript. Requirements include: 1.Completion of a minimum of twenty-four (24) credit hours of coursework with substantial international content. More than 200 courses are approved to meet this requirement. Any of the approved courses can also be used to meet major, minor, or Colonnade requirements, as appropriate. As part of this requirement, the following conditions must also be met: a.No more than nine (9) credit hours may be counted from any one discipline. b.At least three (3) different departments must be represented. c.Students must achieve an overall minimum GPA of 2.5 in the international content courses in order to receive the \"Emphasis in Global Studies\" designation. 2.Completion of a minimum of six (6) credit hours of modern language, either six hours in one language or three hours each from two languages. This requirement must be met in addition to the twenty-four hours of international content coursework above. 3.Completion of an approved credit-bearing international learning experience that could include study abroad, an internship abroad, service learning abroad, research abroad, or international student teaching. More information regarding the Global Studies Designation may be found at http://www.wku.edu/studyabroad/students/globalstudies.php. Students are encouraged to contact the Ofce of Study Abroad & Global Learning at study.abroad@wku.edu or (270) 745-5334 with any questions. Undergraduate Student Enrollment in Graduate Courses Undergraduate students at Western Kentucky University may request to enroll in graduate courses through the Graduate School. Conditions for approval include: at least 75 undergraduate credit hours earned; and a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 Undergraduate students may accumulate a maximum of 12 graduate credits. In addition, undergraduate students are restricted to a maximum of 15 hours enrollment per term, including graduate and undergraduate credits. All graduate coursework will be on the graduate transcript. To move the coursework to the undergraduate transcript students should contact the Ofce of the Registrar. Schedule Changes by the University The institution reserves the privilege at all times of canceling any course for which the enrollment is not sufcient to justify its continuation and to make any other adjustments in the schedule that seem necessary. Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 39 Changes in Offerings and Policies The University reserves the right to make changes as required in course offerings, academic policies, and other rules and regulations affecting students to be effective whenever determined by the University. Academic Freedom The University desires every student experience freedom in academic pursuits. Academic freedom, however, is not irresponsibility\u2014it is the opportunity to pursue truth. Grade-Related Information Grade Point Average The overall grade point average is dened as the ratio of the total number (including transfer work) of quality points to the total number of GPA hours attempted. The WKU grade point average is dened as the ratio of the total number of quality points to the total number of GPA hours attempted for courses taken only through Western Kentucky University. Grade Recording Grades are recorded by the Ofce of the Registrar as reported by the faculty at the end of each term. No grade led in that ofce may be changed except via a written statement from the instructor certifying that an error has been made. All conditions must be removed before the student will be recommended for any certicate or degree. Grade Reports It is recommended that some graded evaluation be accomplished by the end of the rst six weeks equal to at least 20% of the student's nal grade. Final grades are accessible online through TopNet. Developmental Course Grading Courses numbered 050-099 are developmental courses; grades earned in these courses will not count toward the student's GPA, but shall be considered in determining eligibility for nancial aid and academic probation status. Credit hours earned in developmental courses are not degree applicable. Note: In Fall 2019, WKU discontinued offering developmental courses. Grading and the Quality Point System Within one week of the start of the pertinent semester/term/summer session, the instructor will provide students a written statement of the factors to be considered in determining grades and the specic weight to be assigned to each of these factors. The letters A, B, C, D, F, P and X are used by the University to indicate the student's academic prociency. These letters have the following signicance: A Excellent, valued at four quality points per semester hour. B Good, valued at three quality points per semester hour. C Average, valued at two quality points per semester hour.D Below average, unsatisfactory, valued at one quality point per semester hour. (A \"D\" gives credit toward a degree. The student's overall grade point average, however, must be a 2.0 or better to meet the requirements for graduation.) F Failure, valued at no semester hours earned and no quality points. FN Failure due to nonattendance, or ceasing to attend, up to and including the 60% point of a term, valued at no semester hours earned and no quality points. Nonattendance shall be dened as failure to perform meaningful academically-related activity including, but not limited to, the following: submitting an academic assignment, taking an exam, participating in an online discussion about academic matters. P Pass, credit is awarded toward a degree, but no quality points are assigned. The \"P\" designation is restricted to specic courses approved for its use. X Incomplete, A grade of \"X\" is given only when a relatively small amount of work is not completed because of illness or other reason satisfactory to the instructor. A grade of \"X\" will automatically become an \"F\" unless removed within the rst twelve (12) weeks of the next full term (summer term excluded.) An incomplete must be removed within this twelve-week period regardless of whether the student is registered for additional work in the next term. A student should work with the instructor who assigned the incomplete on an independent basis in order to complete the necessary assignments. A grade of incomplete is not used under any circumstances as a substitute for \"F\" or \"W.\" The designations AU, W, NR, ER and NG are not included in the determination of grade point average and are used in the following cases: AU Auditor of a course, (See \"Auditing of Courses\" for additional information.) W Ofcially Withdrew Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog40 Academic Requirements and Regulations NR No report, grades for an entire class were not received by the Ofce of the Registrar in time for processing. The designation \"NR\" is not to be used as a grade for individual students. ER Error in reporting, this designation is used by the Ofce of the Registrar when a grade is not reported for an individual student. NG No grade, a grade is not appropriate to the course. The \"NG\" designation is restricted to specic courses approved for its use. IP In Progress, the IP designation is restricted to specic courses designed to span more than one term. Unless approved otherwise, an IP designation unresolved at the end of one year after its assignment will be converted to an \"F.\" Transfer work submitted will be equated to our internal scale and denoted as such on your record. Repeating Courses An undergraduate student is permitted to repeat a maximum of six courses. Only two courses in which a grade of \"C\" or above has been earned may be repeated. Credit for a course in which a grade of \"F\" has been received can be earned only by repeating the course in residence unless prior approval is given by the head of the department in which the course was taken. A course in which a grade of \"D\" has been received may be repeated at another accredited institution. A course that has been failed cannot be repeated by WKU On Demand (independent learning) without special permission from the department head. A student may not repeat by prociency testing a course that has been previously taken or failed at WKU or another accredited institution. If a course is repeated, the higher of the two grades will be counted in computing the grade point average; if the course is repeated a second time, the two higher grades combined will be used in computing the grade point average. The grade received for each attempt will continue to appear on the student's academic record. A student may attempt a single course no more than three times. WKU does not guarantee the right to repeat any course. Courses may be deactivated, discontinued, or offered on a different schedule. The Committee on Credits and Graduation has the responsibility for hearing appeals from students regarding the application of these regulations. An appeal for special permission to repeat a course in the major or minor beyond the third attempt will be considered only upon the recommendation of the head of the department involved, and then only if special consideration is needed to raise the average in that subject to the minimum required. Students seeking special consideration to repeat a course beyond the third attempt in the general education requirements and in freeelectives must rst consult with the University Registrar. If, after this conference, an appeal is deemed appropriate, the Committee on Credits and Graduation will consider the student's request. Transcripts Transcripts will be released at the written request of the student and in conformity with university policy and existing state and federal statutes pertaining to the release of student academic records. The ofcial academic record is the property of the University. Consequently, the University reserves the right to withhold the release of a transcript of that record if the student has an obligation to the University. Transcript request information is available on the Ofce of the Registrar website at http://www.wku.edu/registrar/transcript_request.php. Academic Standing, Probation, and Appeal Academic Standing To be eligible for continuous enrollment without being placed on academic probation, a student must maintain a 2.0 in both the overall grade point average (GPA) and the total institution GPA (i.e., courses taken at WKU). Note: At the end of each academic term, students may access TopNet to obtain their term GPA, their total institution grade point average, and their overall grade point average Academic Warning If a student's term GPA falls below the 2.0 requirement, but the student satises the 2.0 requirement for the institutional GPA and the overall GPA, the student's new academic standing is Academic Warning. Students whose academic standing falls to Academic Warning will be asked to attend an Academic Warning Workshop during the rst week of classes of the term following the change in academic standing. In this workshop, students will learn what it means to be on Academic Warning, what the implications are for not raising their GPA, and what resources are available on campus to help them succeed in their coursework. Academic Probation If a student's total institution GPA and/or overall GPA falls below the 2.0 requirement, the student is placed on Academic Probation. A student on Academic Probation is allowed continued enrollment on a semesterby semester probationary status as long as the student achieves a 2.0 GPA each term until returning to academic Good Standing. The Advising and Career Development Center (ACDC) uses the Best Expectation Programs (BEP) and The Learning Center (TLC) to provide students on Academic Probation with resources to achieve academic Good Standing. Students on Academic Probation, or students returning after academic dismissal or a granted academic appeal, are required to participate in the Best Expectation Programs (BEP) through the ACDC. Academic Dismissal Any student who fails to earn a term GPA of 2.0 or higher while on Academic Probation is academically dismissed and is not eligible to enroll in WKU classes for one calendar year. Students may, however, choose to appeal the academic dismissal. For additional details, please see the Academic Dismissal Appeal information below. Academic status for all students who complete a term is shown on TopNet. It is the student's responsibility to stay informed of his/her academic status and to improve academic performance until he/she has returned to academic Good Standing. Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 41 Academic Dismissal Appeal Procedure Students who are academically dismissed may le an academic appeal with the Academic Appeals Committee through the Advising and Career Development Center (ACDC). The Academic Appeals Committee may dismiss the student from the University or allow the student continued enrollment under probationary status with conditions for the following term. A student dismissed from the University by the Academic Appeals Committee may appeal the decision to the Executive Appeals Committee. If the Executive Appeals Committee approves an appeal, the student will be permitted to register for an additional semester on probationary status with conditions determined by the Executive Appeals Committee at the time of approval. Detailed operational procedures followed by the Academic Appeals Committee may be obtained from the ACDC located in the Downing Student Union 2141. Students who are either dismissed or who voluntarily withdraw due to academic deciencies are eligible to reapply for readmission after one calendar year of absence from WKU. Readmission will be determined according to WKU admission standards at the time of application for readmission. Applications for readmission are to be led with the Ofce of Admissions by published deadlines. Academic Offenses The maintenance of academic integrity is of fundamental importance to the University. Thus, it should be clearly understood that acts of plagiarism or any other form of cheating will not be tolerated and that anyone committing such acts risks punishment of a serious nature. A student who believes a faculty member has dealt unfairly with him / her in a course involving academic offenses such as plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty, may seek relief through the Student Complaint Procedure. Questions about the complaint procedure should be directed to the Student Ombuds Ofcer at (270) 745-8985 or student.ombudsman@wku.edu . Academic Dishonesty Students who commit any act of academic dishonesty may receive from the instructor a failing grade in that portion of the coursework in which the act is detected, or a failing grade in the course without the possibility of withdrawal. The faculty member may also present the case to the Ofce of Student Conduct for disciplinary sanctions. Cheating No student shall receive or give assistance not authorized by the instructor in taking an examination or in the preparation of an essay, laboratory report, problem assignment, or other project that is submitted for purposes of grade determination. Plagiarism To represent written work taken from another source as one's own is plagiarism. Plagiarism is a serious offense. The academic work of a student must be his / her own. One must give any author credit for source material borrowed from him / her. To lift content directly from a source without giving credit is a flagrant act. To present a borrowed passage without reference to the source after having changed a few words is also plagiarism. Other Types of Academic Dishonesty Other types of academic offenses, such as the theft or sale of tests, should be reported to the Ofce of Student Conduct at (270) 745-5429 for further action. http://www.wku.edu/studentconduct/process-for- academic-dishonesty.php.Academic Renewal Academic renewal allows students to void a semester of coursework or all previous coursework, if the coursework has not been used for a previous degree earned at WKU nor another accredited institution. The policy prevents voided coursework from counting toward graduation and the computation of the grade point average; however, the voided coursework will remain a part of the transcript. In order to qualify for academic renewal, students must be admitted to WKU and enrolled or previously enrolled in coursework at WKU. In addition, qualied students must fall into one of the following categories: 1.Have at least 60 earned credit hours; or 2.Have not attended any accredited college or university for at least two previous years. Qualied undergraduate students who have earned at least 60 credit hours should work with an advisor to determine if all coursework should be voided or the coursework for a single semester. If the student chooses to void all coursework, all coursework will be voided prior to the submission of the petition. Qualied undergraduate students who have not attended any accredited college or university for at least two previous years must have a cumulative grade point average, since readmission, of at least 2.0 (with no grade below a \"D\"), computed at the end of the term in which the student completes 12 semester hours or the number of hours required for degree completion if less than 12. Students who have not attended any accredited college or university for at least two previous years should work with an advisor to determine if all coursework should be voided or the coursework for a single semester. If the student chooses to void all coursework, all coursework will be voided prior to the readmission term. WKU accepts transfer credit retained through academic renewal at other institutions but will use grades from those courses for the computation of the higher education grade point average. Students requesting academic renewal are required to complete and submit the 'Petition for Academic Renewal' form to their advisor and then their department head/chair or equivalent, indicating whether one semester or all previous coursework is to be voided. The Ofce of the Registrar processes the approved form. The academic renewal decision is nal once it is approved by the academic department and processed by the Ofce of the Registrar. Students may not declare academic renewal more than once. Academic Renewal is irrevocable. Procedures The form shall be approved by the student's advisor and then their assigned Department Head/Chair. The department will send the approved form to the Ofce of the Registrar, Potter Hall 216. The petition should not be led until the student has fullled the conditions of eligibility mentioned above. The Ofce of the Registrar will notify students by email when the Petition for Academic Renewal has been processed. Students who request academic renewal for a semester(s) may not use any credit earned during that period toward degree requirements. Voided courses required for the degree must be repeated. Withdrawal from the University For various reasons it is occasionally necessary for a student to withdraw from the University. Prior to the 70% point of the semester, students may use TopNet to withdraw. After the 70% point of the semester, Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog42 Academic Requirements and Regulations the student should report to the Ofce of the Registrar to initiate withdrawal procedures. Students leaving the institution without an ofcial withdrawal will receive failing grades in all courses in which they are enrolled and endanger their future status in the institution. Students withdrawing after the 70% point of the semester, a bi-term, 5-week session, or comparable period during a summer session must consult with their instructors as to the withdrawal grade. The ofcial date of the withdrawal is the date the withdrawal is processed on TopNet or the written notice is received in the Ofce of the Registrar. Students wishing to return to WKU at a later date must submit an application for readmission prior to the deadline for submitting applications. Refer to the Registration Guide on the Ofce of the Registrar's website for deadlines. In special circumstances, as described below, a complete withdrawal from the University after the 70% point of a term will be considered. Request forms are available on the Ofce of the Registrar website at http://www.wku.edu/registrar/withdrawal.php. Administrative Withdrawal A request for an administrative withdrawal is initiated by the University because of a disciplinary situation or when, in the professional judgment of a health care provider, psychologist and/or university administrator, there is reason to believe a student is a substantial threat to him/herself or interferes with the welfare of other members of the University, the education process, or the orderly operation of the University. The Vice President for Enrollment and Student Experience or the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs, or their respective designees, will notify the student of the involuntary withdrawal, and the University Registrar will be directed to withdraw the student from all classes in which the student is currently enrolled and cancel registration that has occurred for any future terms. The Ofce of the Registrar will notify the student's instructors of the withdrawal, and \"W\" grades will be recorded for the term in progress. A student who is administratively withdrawn will have a registration hold placed by the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Experience or the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs to prevent the student from being readmitted or re-enrolled unless cleared by the appropriate administrator or the respective designee. A student may le a written appeal of an involuntary withdrawal through the ofce that administered the withdrawal. Tuition refund appeals for administrative withdrawals are handled in a separate procedure, and instructions may be obtained from the Bursar's Ofce. Medical Withdrawal A student may request and be considered for a medical withdrawal from all courses in a term when extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious physical or mental illness or injury, prevent the student from continuing his or her classes after the mid-point of a term, and incompletes or other arrangements with the instructors are not feasible or possible. A medical withdrawal must be substantiated with appropriate documentation from the attending health care provider. Once the rationale for a medical withdrawal has been validated by the Ofce of the Registrar, the student's instructors will be sent notication of the withdrawal, and \"W\" grades will be recorded for each course. A student who requests a medical withdrawal, or an individual requesting a withdrawal on behalf of the student who is physically or mentally unable to request the withdrawal, should contact the Ofce of the Registrar to obtain medical withdrawal procedures. Tuition refund appeals for medical withdrawals are handled in a separate procedure, and instructions may be obtained from the Bursar's Ofce.Military Withdrawal Students who are members of any branch of the United States Armed Services, including the National Guard, who are called to active duty while enrolled at WKU are entitled to the following options: Students may work with each individual instructor to determine if an incomplete grade is appropriate, or If an incomplete grade is not a viable option, the student will be permitted to withdraw either from individual courses or from the entire schedule of classes. A full refund of tuition and fees will be issued for those courses from which the student has withdrawn. Students who are called to active duty while enrolled should contact the Ofce of the Registrar to initiate the withdrawal process. An ofcial copy of the military orders must be presented to invoke this special withdrawal and refund process. Retroactive Withdrawal A student who leaves the University for extenuating circumstances without an ofcial withdrawal during the term of departure may apply for a retroactive withdrawal. The student must present supporting documentation that demonstrates serious and compelling reasons justifying the withdrawal and extenuating circumstances justifying its retroactive nature; poor academic performance that is not attributed to non-academic extenuating circumstances is not a consideration for retroactive withdrawal. A student may appeal for a retroactive withdrawal within two calendar years following the end of the term for which withdrawal is requested. A student need not be enrolled at WKU at the time the application for retroactive withdrawal is submitted. An appellate board will review the request for a retroactive withdrawal. The board will consider the following factors, including, but not limited to: 1.Documentation of extenuating circumstances 2.Written letter of support from an academic administrator, faculty member, advisor or other university professional who is familiar with the student's situation. If a retroactive withdrawal is approved, the Ofce of the Registrar will notify the student's instructors and department heads of the request for a retroactive withdrawal, and they will be given 14 calendar days to raise objections if the student's classroom performance was such that a withdrawal (W) would not be appropriate. If objections are raised by the instructor or department head, the Ofce of the Registrar will be informed of the objection, and the student will not receive a \"W\" in the class. A tuition refund is not granted for a retroactive withdrawal. Student Academic and Grade Complaint Procedure The student complaint procedure for resolving an academic or grade complaint: Step 1 (Faculty Member) The student must attempt to discuss the academic issue with the faculty member involved within 15 workdays after the issue has occurred or the grade within the rst 15 workdays of the rst regular semester (fall; spring) following the assignment of the grade. If the faculty member is no longer employed by the university, the student should go directly to that faculty member's department head, who will attempt to contact the former faculty member concerning the academic issue or grade assigned. If the department head is Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 43 unable to facilitate communication between the former faculty member and the student, the student may proceed to step 2. If the faculty is employed by the university and declines to discuss the academic issue or grade with the student, the student may proceed to step 2. Step 2 (Department Level) If the student and the faculty member are unable to resolve the complaint, the student may take the complaint to the faculty member's department head. Written notication of the complaint must be given to the department head within two weeks after the meeting with the faculty member. If the faculty member is also the department head, proceed to Step 3. The written notication to the department head should clearly state what the student believes are the faculty member's unreasonable and/or unfair practices or procedures, and include any available documentation. The department head may attempt to resolve the complaint by meeting with the student and faculty member separately to mediate the issue. If the department head is unable to resolve the complaint in this way, a meeting will be arranged where the student, faculty member, and the department head will be present for discussion. Neither the faculty member nor the student will be allowed representation at the meeting. The department head shall hear both sides of the complaint and attempt to resolve the matter. If the department head is unable to bring about an agreed upon resolution between the student and the faculty member, the department head will issue a recommendation. The department head shall create a written record of the meeting, including his/her recommendation. A copy of this record shall be provided to the student and the faculty member at the time the department head's recommendation is issued to them. If the faculty member is no longer with WKU or refuses to participate, the decision of the department head shall be followed. Step 3 (College Level) Should the student remain dissatised with the outcome of the academic issue or grade complaint at the departmental level, the student may continue the complaint to the college level. The student should notify the Dean of the College , or the Dean's designee , in writing, within two weeks following issuance of the department head's recommendation, that the complaint remains unresolved. The written notication to the Dean of the College should include a copy of the department head's record and recommendation, and clearly state what the student believes are the faculty member's unreasonable and/or unfair practices or procedures, and include any available documentation. The dean or dean's designee may attempt to resolve the complaint by meeting with the student, faculty member, and department head. If those meetings do not resolve the student's concern(s), the Dean or Designee shall notify the College Complaint Committee: It is expected that a meeting will be scheduled to take place within two weeks after the submission of a written notication to the Dean of the College.The committee shall be composed of at least three faculty members and two student representatives and shall not include representation from the department of the faculty member mentioned in the complaint. If the notication is submitted at the end of a semester and convening the committee is not feasible within the stipulated two weeks period, the committee must be convened within the rst two weeks of the rst regular semester (fall; spring) following the Dean's receipt of the written complaint. Neither the faculty member nor the student will be allowed representation at the conference. All material presented at the meeting is considered subject to FERPA and condential. The College Complaint Committee shall hear both sides of the complaint, and shall create a written record of the meeting. The student and faculty member may elect to remain in the meeting while the other presents his or her side of the complaint. The decision and its rationale shall be reduced to writing, with copies sent to the Dean of the College, the student, faculty member, and the faculty member's department head. If neither party has appealed the Committee's decision after two weeks, the decision will be nal. The Dean's ofce will be responsible for taking action required by the decision, if any. Step 4 (University Level) Should the student or the faculty member be dissatised with the decision of the College Complaint Committee, either may appeal the decision to the University level. The appealing party should deliver a written appeal to the Ofce of the Provost within two weeks following issuance of the College Committee's decision. The written appeal should include a copy of the College Committee's decision, and clearly state the basis for the appeal, including but not limited to, any unreasonable and/or unfair practices or procedures, and include any available documentation. Copies of the appeal should be delivered by the appellant to the party not appealing the College Committee decision. The Ofce of the Provost will coordinate and convene the University Complaint Committee. The student and faculty member will be provided with a copy of the University Complaint Committee's procedural guidelines. The University Complaint Committee will secure copies of the recommendations rendered by the department head and the College Complaint Committee. The University Complaint Committee will schedule a conference where the faculty member and the student are present and will discuss the issue. Neither the faculty member nor the student will be allowed representation at the conference. All material presented at the meeting is considered subject to FERPA and condential, and no new materials may be presented at this meeting. If new material is presented, the appeal will be referred back to the College Complaint Committee. The University Complaint Committee shall hear both sides of the complaint, and shall create a written record of the meeting. The decision and its rationale shall be reduced to writing, with copies sent to the Provost, the Dean of the College, the student, faculty member, and the faculty member's department head. Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog44 Degree Requirements The Ofce of the Provost will see that decisions of the University Complaint Committee are carried out. The University Complaint Committee's decision is nal. Out of State Distance Learners Students enrolled in distance learning courses at WKU will follow the university complaints procedure outlined in this policy and may access additional resources through WKU Online https://www.wku.edu/online/ srp/studentcomplaint.php . Students may also review information in the WKU Student Handbook. If the issue is not resolved at the institution level, distance students may le a complaint with the Kentucky Council for Postsecondary Education http://cpe.ky.gov/ campuses/consumer_complaint.html. (http://cpe.ky.gov/campuses/ consumer_complaint.html ) For out-of- state distance learning students, the next level in the complaint process is with the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA) https://nc- sara.org/student-complaints (https://nc-sara.org/student-complaints/). Additionally, students may le a complaint with WKU's accrediting body, The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS) by downloading the SACS Complaint Procedures Form (https://sacscoc.org/app/uploads/2020/01/ComplaintPolicy-1.pdf). Student complaints related to grades or student conduct may not be appealed to Kentucky Council for Postsecondary Education. Supplements Supplements to this procedure may be issued during the school year to keep the University community advised of newly adopted programs and policies. Important Complaint Exceptions: Student Disability regarding denial of accommodations, report to Student ADA Compliance Ofcer and follow WKU policy #6.1010 Discrimination and Harassment concerns, see below reporting process and follow WKU policy #0.2040 and #0.2070 Discrimination is always reported to the Ofce of Equal Opportunity Employment (EEO) Student-to-student harassment is reported to Ofce of Student Conduct or the WKU Title IX Coordinator Student-to-faculty/employee harassment is reported to the Ofce of Equal Opportunity Employment (EEO). Degree Requirements Curriculum Requirements All candidates for a degree must complete one of the academic programs offered by the University. A candidate for an associate degree must complete a minimum of 60 unduplicated undergraduate semester hours; however, some associate degree programs may require more than the minimum 60 semester hours. A candidate for the baccalaureate degree must complete a minimum of 120 unduplicated undergraduate semester hours; however, some baccalaureate degree programs may require more than the minimum 120 semester hours. Students should be aware that some academic programs may require additional scholastic regulations and standards not specied in the catalog. To obtain these regulations, students should contact the appropriate department head.Catalog Term and Student Catalog Rights The student's initial term of entry is identied as the student's \"catalog term.\" Catalog term rights include the following: A student shall be entitled to follow Colonnade and major / minor degree requirements contained in the catalog current when rst enrolled at WKU as a degree-seeking student. This does not preclude the addition of requirements arising from action of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. A student will be allowed seven consecutive years from his / her catalog term to complete degree requirements. The college dean may grant an extension to this deadline. A student who drops out and re-enrolls after an absence of seven consecutive years or more will be assigned the catalog term of the readmission term. A student's catalog term will be changed to a more recent term if the student, in consultation with the advisor and with approval by the department head, agrees to follow more recent degree requirements. Academic departments reserve the right to authorize appropriate course substitutions for earlier versions of major / minor requirements in which required courses have been discontinued. Academic Standing A candidate for an undergraduate degree must have a GPA of at least 2.0 (1) in all credits presented for graduation whether earned at WKU or elsewhere, (2) in all credits completed at WKU, (3) overall in the major subjects and in the minor subjects, and (4) in the major subjects and in the minor subjects completed at WKU. Students desiring teacher certication must fulll all GPA requirements for teacher certication in the major and minor, in addition to meeting the requirements for graduation. Students should be aware that some academic programs require a \"C\" or higher in each course applicable toward a major or minor. Refer to the departmental descriptions in this catalog or contact the department head to determine the specic grade requirements for each major. Change of Major, Minor, Concentration, and/or Advisor Changes in majors, minors, concentrations, and advisors can be made upon request. Students must submit a Major, Minor, Concentration, Advisor Change Form to the academic department that administers the student's chosen program. The form is available online for students in TopNet (Student Services, Student Records, Change of Major, Minor, Concentration, Advisor). Changes in majors, minors, concentrations, and advisors are provisional until the receiving department has reviewed and accepted the request.

The transfer credit petition can be found here: https://www.wku.edu/ transfer/transferpetition.php and more details on the here: cpe.ky.gov/policies/academicaffairs/ transferappealsprocess.pdf (https://www.google.com/url/? sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=2ahUKEwiav9zV0ajjAhUILs0KHZY1DzUQFjAAegQIBBAB&url=http %3A%2F%2Fcpe.ky.gov%2Fpolicies%2Facademicaffairs %2Ftransferappealsprocess.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0pQ3JI5Q6eMhRVe26_8H10). Credit by Examination and Prior Learning Assessment The credit hours earned through these examinations will count toward graduation, but will not apply to WKU residence credit or be used to compute grade point averages since a letter grade will not be given. Additional information about the exams may be obtained by clicking on the underlined course title in the charts below. Although students may receive credit hours through any of these seven programs, duplicate credit may not be earned. For example, a student who earns credit hours for English 100 through the AP program may not receive additional credit for English 100 on the ACT exam, on a departmental exam, or on the CLEP exams. High school seniors should take CLEP and ACT or SAT examinations by February at the latest so the results may be available for use in selecting courses during the March or June Topper Orientation Program. The Ofce of the Registrar noties students of their eligibility for credit upon receiving an application for admission and the ofcial test score report. Students will receive the credit during the rst semester of enrollment. Credit awarded for these exams will apply toward the WKU General Education categories as indicated. For detailed information refer to the General Education section of the catalog. Credit for these exams will also apply toward the Kentucky Statewide General Education categories as indicated. The categories are: Written Communications (WC) and Oral Communications (OC), Arts and Humanities (AH), Social and Behavioral Sciences (SB), Natural Sciences (NS), Natural Sciences Lab (SL) and Quantitative Reasoning (QR). Advanced Placement Program (AP) Students may earn college credit through the Advanced Placement Program of the College Board upon attaining the minimum score on the AP examination. AP credit will not count toward WKU residence credit.

A student may take a departmental comprehensive prociency assessment in any course listed as satisfying a requirement in any of the categories of general education. Departments may offer departmental comprehensive prociency assessments in other courses at their discretion. To assess student prociency, a department may adopt either a standardized examination available from outside the University or develop an appropriate comprehensive prociency examination within the department by means of a faculty committee. Departmental comprehensive prociency assessments may be written, oral or both. To be eligible to take a departmental comprehensive prociency assessment, a student must be fully matriculated, in good standing, and regularly enrolled at WKU. Credits earned in this manner will be recorded on the student's ofcial transcript as non-residence credit but will not be considered as a part of the normal semester load in the term in which the examination is taken. A student may not register for a departmental comprehensive prociency assessment for a course while he or she is enrolled in that course. A student may not take a departmental comprehensive prociency assessment in a course which has been previously taken at WKU or at another accredited institution. A student desiring to take a departmental comprehensive prociency assessment must complete an appropriate request form in the Ofce of the Registrar. A fee of $25 per credit hour must be paid at the time the form is submitted. The form must be submitted to the Registrar prior to the end of the third week of classes in either the fall or spring semesters. The Registrar will notify the appropriate department of the student's request. The department will administer the comprehensive prociency assessment during the seventh week of classes. The student must obtain the specic time and place for testing from the department head. After the assessment has been completed, the department head will notify the Registrar in writing as to whether or not the student demonstrated acceptable prociency. If the department recommends credit be granted, the semester hours earned will be recorded on the ofcial transcript. However, the credit will not be used in computing the grade point average since letter grades will not be assigned. Military Service Credit WKU strives to be a military friendly institution that will provide military personnel the ability to attend WKU and receive college credit for formal courses and primary occupations offered while in the military. WKU awards college credit based on the American Council on Education (ACE) Guide recommendation, and the credit will count as non-residence credit. Active duty soldiers or military veterans are required to submit ofcial military transcripts prior to admission. Any soldier who is retired or discharged from the military will be required to submit their ofcial military transcripts and a copy of the DD form 214 (Certicate of Releaseor Discharge from Active Duty of Service) member copy 4. The DD 214 must have characterization of service listed on the form. The DD 214 Form may be requested at http://www.archives.gov/veterans/military- service-records/. Ofcial military transcripts may be requested at https:// jst.doded.mil/. (https://jst.doded.mil/ ) Prior Learning Assessment Students who have acquired extensive college-level knowledge and skills in academic areas including but not limited to employment, military experience, civic activities, volunteer service, organizational training or workshops, or other non-traditional means may be granted credit for the knowledge and skills they have gained through nationally standardized exams (AP, CLEP, IB, ACE, etc.), departmental assessments, or portfolio development and evaluation. This policy focuses on portfolio development and evaluation. This policy focuses on portfolio development and evaluation, while referencing national and departmental assessments when appropriate. Prior learning by portfolio evaluation is considered an opportunity for students to demonstrate their knowledge and is not a guarantee of credit for experience. Students will complete a portfolio of their prior learning as a part of a portfolio development course, IDST 250, taught by an instructor who has undergone training by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL). Please note: the three credits earned in IDST 250 will count toward residence, while the prior learning credit awarded will be treated as non-residence credit. The portfolio, with varying forms of documents, will tie content learning outcomes to the knowledge and skills students have acquired through experiential learning. Credit earned will depend upon the student's ability to produce a portfolio that communicates learning outcomes consistent with the WKU mission on the level expected for the credit sought. Before registering for this course, students will consult with the instructor to evaluate the feasibility of seeking credit in a particular area. The student will identify a maximum of two content areas for which credit is being sought, and his or her portfolio will be submitted to two full- time WKU faculty members, at least one from each area for which the student is seeking credit, upon successful completion of the course. These faculty experts will review the portfolio and determine if and how much academic credit is to be granted, as well as whether the credit should be given for a specic course, or for non- course-specic credit. The consensus recommendation of the reviewers must be approved by the department head(s) and dean(s) of the college(s) concerned, and then will be forwarded to the Ofce of the Registrar to transcript recommended credit. The portfolio development course, IDST 250, may be repeated for a maximum of three credits. The total number of Prior Learning credits applied toward a WKU credential cannot exceed a quarter of the total hours in the credential. For additional information, please contact: the School of Professional Studies at (270) 745-8973 or visit www.wku.edu/ pla (http://www.wku.edu/pla/). Transfer of Credits Undergraduate students transferring to WKU are required, as a part of the admission process, to provide the Ofce of Admissions with ofcial transcripts from all previously attended institutions. Credits earned at other accredited American institutions of higher education may be transferred to WKU and applied toward a degree. The \"Transfer Credit Practices\" report published by the American Association Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 65 of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Ofcers will be the reference used for the evaluation of such credits. Students who previously earned course credit from a non-regionally accredited institution may petition for recognition of that credit. Consideration will be given to courses whose content suggests competencies at least equivalent to courses offered by WKU. For more information see: http://www.wku.edu/admissions/transfer/ transfercredit.php. Courses completed at a baccalaureate degree granting institution will be accepted for transfer credit at the level of the equivalent WKU course. Courses completed at a community or junior college will transfer to WKU as lower division credit only, even if WKU offers a comparable course at the upper division. Acceptance of transfer credits for a particular major, minor or certicate is subject to approval by the appropriate academic department. WKU accepts transfer grades, and those grades will be recorded onto the WKU transcript and computed into the student's overall GPA. Transfer work submitted will be equated to our internal scale and denoted as such on your record. Some academic departments require a minimum grade of \"C\" in each course applicable toward a major. Refer to the departmental descriptions in this catalog or contact the department head to determine the specic requirements for each major. Credit for a course in which a failing grade has been received can be earned only by repeating the course in residence unless prior written approval is granted by the head of the department in which the course is offered. When a transcript from an accredited institution records credit granted for educational experiences, the credit will generally be accepted in transfer. Approved educational experiences include: credit by exam, advanced placement, prior learning credit, and dual credit high school work. WKU does not accept developmental coursework for degree credit. The student's academic department will decide how and whether the credit applies to degree requirements for a particular major, minor, or certicate. WKU supports the CPE policy which outlines acceptable AP and CLEP scores; for the complete policy see: WKU Graduation honors (e.g., cum laude ) are based upon students earning a minimum of 45 hours in residence for baccalaureate degrees and a minimum of 27 hours in residence for associate degrees. The minimum residence requirement for the baccalaureate degree and associate degree is 25% of the minimum number of semester hours required in the student's degree program, earned through instruction at WKU. At least one-third of the hours in the major and minor must be earned at WKU. Kentucky General Education Transfer Policy The Kentucky General Education Transfer Policy (2012) provides guidelines for the transfer of general education coursework between Kentucky public postsecondary institutions. The policy guarantees that if a student completes an associate (AA or AS) degree or some general education coursework at a KCTCS college, any Kentucky public university will accept their general education credits as meeting lower-division general education requirements.The transfer of general education credits is predicated on the acquisition of competencies in broad academic areas, rather than a comparison of individual courses taken at one institution or another. The ve broad categories are: 1) Arts and Humanities (AH), 2) Communications: Written Communication (WC) and Oral Communication (OC), 3) Natural Sciences: (NS), plus Science Lab (SL), 4) Quantitative Reasoning (QR), and 5) Social and Behavioral Sciences (SB). The sending institution will indicate, either on the transcript or as an attachment to the transcript, whether the student is Fully Certied, Core Certied, or Category Certied in general education, or if they have completed any of the coded general education courses (i.e., AH, NS, OC, QR, SB, SL, and WC) at their institution. Fully Certied - All general education requirements are completed (AA and AS degrees guarantee full certication). Core Certied - The 30 hours of core general education is completed, and remaining general education requirements of the receiving institution are still required. Category Certied - One or more of the above categories is complete (e.g., AH Category Certied is interpreted as no additional courses are required in the AH category). Course Certied - The category is not complete, but a course in that category applies to that category. Questions pertaining to the Kentucky General Education Transfer Policy should be directed to the Transfer Center, 2135 Downing Student Union, (270) 745-2178 or email Transfer@wku.edu. The full CPE General Education Transfer policy can be viewed: http://cpe.ky.gov/policies (http://cpe.ky.gov/policies/). General Education Transfer Policy from States other than Kentucky Students who complete an associate degree containing 30 unduplicated semester credit hours of General Education (typically an Associate of Arts [AA] or an Associate of Science [AS]) from a regionally accredited institution outside Kentucky are considered to have fullled all WKU Colonnade General Education requirements. These credit hours are to be drawn from and include at least one course from each of the following areas: humanities/ne arts, social/behavioral sciences, and natural science/mathematics. General Education Transfer Policy for Institutions that Close Students who complete all General Education requirements containing 30 unduplicated semester credit hours toward a Bachelor's degree from a regionally accredited institution that is closing or has closed are considered to have fullled all WKU Colonnade General Education requirements. These credit hours are to be drawn from and include at least one course from each of the following area: humanities/ne arts, social/behavioral sciences, and natural science/mathematics. Transfer Student Services Upon admission and receipt of all transcripts, the student's transfer credit will be recorded into the university's student information system and will be available online at http://www.topnet.wku.edu and in iCAP, WKU's automated degree audit system. Students and academic advisors Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog66 Academic Denitions may view course articulation (or equivalency) on iCAP prior to the student's participation in the Topper Orientation Program. The iCAP report serves as the ofcial assignment of credits to WKU Colonnade General Education Requirements; however, acceptance of transfer credits for a particular major, minor or certicate is subject to approval by the appropriate academic department. Students may petition WKU departments to determine if a course should be equivalent to a WKU course. The petition form may be obtained online at http://www.wku.edu/ transfer/transfer_petition.pdf. Transfer Academic Plans To assist associate degree recipients in understanding the courses needed to complete a baccalaureate degree at WKU, a variety of Transfer Academic Pathway Plans have been established. A list of the specic degree programs and pathway plans are available at https:// www.wku.edu/transfer/plans.php. Formal Articulation Agreements Formal articulation agreements are mutually benecial partnerships with colleges and universities developed to match coursework between institutions to help students make a smooth transition from other institutions. These agreements specify how transfer credit will be applied toward general education or other degree requirements. WKU's formal articulation agreements are available at: http://www.wku.edu/ academicaffairs/pd/articulation.php. International Transfer Credit Transfer credit from foreign educational institutions may be granted after a determination of the type of institution involved, its recognition by the educational authorities of the foreign country, and an evaluation of the content and level of the courses. Extensive use is made of professional references which describe the educational systems and programs of individual countries. Students who have attended an educational institution located outside of the United States will need to request all schools attended to send the ofcial transcript(s) directly to Western Kentucky University. Some educational institutions do not issue transcripts to other schools; instead they issue transcripts or the original certicate/mark sheet to students. In this case, students must make a photocopy of the original transcript/ certicate/mark sheet and have the school attended (or a certied translation service rm) certify/attest that the photocopy is a true copy of the original document. Consulates and embassies often serve as a resource for the attestation of educational documents. Students on WKU's campus may bring the original transcript(s) or document(s) to the International Admissions Ofce for review and verication. For more information, contact iem@wku.edu . WKU Students who Study Abroad Transfer credit is awarded upon receipt of an ofcial transcript from an international institution, only if the study abroad experience was pre- approved by the Ofce of Study Abroad and Global Learning.

Academic Denitions Academic Program - is a combination of courses and related activities organized for the attainment of broad educational objectives that lead to a certicate or diploma or an associate's, bachelor's, master's, specialist, or doctoral degree (CPE, 2011). Degree - is an award conferred by a postsecondary education institution as ofcial recognition for the successful completion of an academic program (CPE, 2011). Associate's Degree - is an award that normally requires at least 60 semester credit hours or the equivalent (CPE, 2011). Bachelor's Degree - is an award that normally requires at least 120 semester credit hours or the equivalent. This includes all bachelor's degrees conferred in a ve-year cooperative (work-study) program and degrees in which the normal four years of work are completed in three years (CPE, 2011). Undergraduate (pre-baccalaureate) Certicate - is a sub-baccalaureate credential granted upon satisfactory completion of a series of courses related to a specic topic or skill. It has the primary purpose of providing marketable, entry-level skills (CPE, 2011). Major - is a primary area of study dened by a set of course and / or credit hour requirements within a specied discipline or with a clearly dened multi-disciplinary focus (CPE, 2011). Minors are only available to students seeking a baccalaureate degree. Minor - is a secondary area of study that is separate from the major and is dened by a set of course and / or credit hour requirements within a specied discipline or with a clearly dened multi-disciplinary focus (CPE, 2011). Concentration - is a set of courses designed to develop expertise within a major (CPE, 2011). The Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) dened specic terminology for a set of courses designed to develop expertise within a major, and the term varies by degree level. Track is the specied term at the undergraduate level, Concentration at the master's level, and Specialization at the doctoral level. Tracks, Concentrations, and Specializations are noted in the WKU catalog, TopNet, iCAP, and on the WKU transcript as \"Concentration.\" The Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education approves new academic programs and in 2011 developed New Academic Programs: Policy and Procedures (http://cpe.ky.gov/ policies/academicprograms.html). Within the new policy are denitions noted above. Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 67 Academic Degree Types Baccalaureate Degrees Western Kentucky University confers seven baccalaureate degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, and Bachelor of Social Work. To determine the degree awarded upon the completion of a specic program of study, consult the chart found under \"Major Programs of Study\" on the following pages. AB (Artium Baccalaureus/Bachelor of Arts) degrees typically emphasize the social sciences, arts, humanities, and foreign languages. The degree is intended to advance student understanding of human culture through examination of historical, social, religious and political contexts; analysis of ideas; appreciation of art and creative endeavors; knowledge of philosophical theories; and achievement of language competency. AB requirements typically promote broad preparation within a discipline. BS (Bachelor of Science) degrees typically emphasize the natural sciences, mathematics and technology. The degree is intended to advance student preparation in reasoning, analysis, experimentation and the application of scientic principles in problem-solving consistent with professional or technical preparation. BS requirements typically promote depth of preparation within a discipline. BIS (Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies) provides an alternative baccalaureate degree program for students who do not need or desire the academic specialization involved in traditional major or major/ minor programs. This degree program allows considerable latitude and flexibility to satisfy individual interests and needs. BFA (Bachelor of Fine Arts) is the initial professional degree in ne arts. It prepares students for a professional studio practice through an intensive artistic and academic experience. Students develop strong personal concepts along with technical prociency creating a cohesive body of work on which to base an individual, sustainable studio practice. BM (Bachelor of Music) provides intensive study in music leading to three distinct P-12 teaching certications (vocal, instrumental, integrated) or a performance degree that supports private studio teaching or graduate study. BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) is an entry-level degree for professional nursing. It prepares the graduate to be a professional nurse who can practice in a variety of settings and who has the knowledge base to pursue graduate study in nursing. BSW (Bachelor of Social Work) is the only undergraduate major that educates students to be professional social workers. BSW graduates are prepared for immediate entry into direct human service professional positions. They possess the intellectual, practical and professional skills needed to promote benecial change in the lives of their clients. A baccalaureate degree requires a minimum of 120 unduplicated semester hours, according to one of the following options: Students with a major that is 48 hours or more are not required to declare a second major or minor, unless specied by the department. Students with a major below 48 hours must select a second major or minor. Students who select a major and minor combination must have 54 hours total between the major and minor and 48 hours unduplicated.Students pursuing the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies are required to select an emphasis of study and may also select a minor. No hours may be duplicated between the emphasis and minor. A certicate of 12 or more semester credit hours may substitute for 'minor' in all the above. A baccalaureate degree candidate with a double major will receive one degree; the degree will be associated with the student's declared rst major. Students may pursue concurrent (dual) degrees, as specied in the section entitled \"Concurrent and Subsequent Degrees.\" A minor is a secondary course of study as dened by CPE (previous page). The minimum duration of a minor varies, but may not be less than 18 semester credit hours. Approved majors and minors are listed on the following pages. Any specic admission or course requirements may be found in the college or departmental section of this catalog. Undergraduate minors are only available to students pursuing a baccalaureate degree. In addition to one of the above options, each student must complete a minimum of 39 semester hours of general education courses and electives to total the minimum of 120 unduplicated semester hours. For details on general education requirements, refer to the Colonnade section of this catalog. Since some programs are non-teacher certiable, students seeking teacher certication should consult the Teacher Education Programs portion of this catalog for a list of certiable programs and the required professional education courses. Associate Degrees Western Kentucky University confers four associate degrees: Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Science in Nursing, and Associate of Interdisciplinary Studies. To determine the degree awarded upon the completion of a specic program of study, consult the program information within the undergraduate catalog. Certicate Programs Western Kentucky University offers a variety of short-term programs that lead to a certicate in a specialty area. Certicates typically comprise at least twelve semester credit hours. Exceptions to this minimum may be granted only where a circumscribed body of expertise with the potential to materially affect employability may be covered in fewer than 12 semester credit hours.

Jordan, guy.jordan@wku.edu, (270) 745-8865 The Bachelor of Arts in Art History provides WKU students with a broad and thorough understanding of the history and function of the visual arts from ancient times to the present day. Majors will critically analyze paintings, prints, sculpture, architecture, and other visual media to investigate a range of historical and philosophical issues with which the arts have been deeply involved. As such, majors will gain an understanding of how visual practices proactively articulate and motivate rather than simply illustrate, record, or reiterate history. With an emphasis on reading, writing, research, and critical analysis the AB in Art History contributes experiences useful to a broad range of possible careers, including museum, gallery, and auction house curatorial duties, art appraisal, conservator and registrar positions, docent roles, archiving, and grant writing interests. Program Requirements (36 hours) A baccalaureate degree requires a minimum of 120 unduplicated semester hours. More information can be found at www.wku.edu/ registrar/degree_certication.php. (https://www.wku.edu/registrar/ degree_certication.php) Students who began WKU in the Fall 2014 and thereafter should review the Colonnade requirements located at: https://www.wku.edu/ colonnade/colonnaderequirements.php. (https://www.wku.edu/ colonnade/colonnaderequirements.php) The major requires courses to be taken across a range of chronological periods, ensuring that graduates possess a broad understanding of the eld, yet it also allows students to focus their studies on particular historical periods or geographical regions that interest them. A minor or second major is required. No more than 6 hours in the art history major may count toward a student's minor. No grade of \"D\" or below may be counted toward the major. The program requires two introductory courses (ART 105 and ART 106) that provide foundational knowledge of the history of global art, one course ( ART 130, ART 131, or ART 140) that familiarizes students with the fundamental concepts of art making, and a course in contemporary art that ensures students have a strong grounding in current trends. The two other required courses are a theory and methodology class (ART 405), and a capstone seminar ( ART 494). To ensure signicant breadth, among the six electives required for the major, at least one must be chosen from each of the ve chronological categories. The remaining elective may be customized to accord with the research interests of the student, and allows for a signicant degree of expansion into visually oriented coursework in other disciplines.

Visual Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts (514P, 514) Program Coordinator Kristina E. Arnold, kristina.arnold@wku.edu , (270) 745-6566 The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree is the initial professional degree sought for careers in the visual arts eld. The department of art offers two concentrations. The BFA in Studio concentration prepares students for a professional studio practice through rigorous artistic and academic experience. It is also the standard requirement for entrance into Masters of Fine Arts degree programs, the most common route to teaching studio art at the college level. The BFA Graphic Design concentration prepares students for careers in the visual communications eld, including web design, print design, illustration, and new media. Both concentrations begin with a foundation of drawing, 2-D design, 3-D design, and art history surveys. Students then focus on a specic curricular sequence of interest to them: ceramics, graphic design, printmaking, painting, sculpture, or weaving. A portfolio and seminar class serve as the capstone experiences for BFA students in each concentration, where personal concepts and technical prociency typically yield a cohesive body of work or competitive professional portfolio. In either concentration, the goal for the BFA student is to forge a professional art practice. Program Requirements (73-79 hours) A baccalaureate degree requires a minimum of 120 unduplicated semester hours. More information can be found at www.wku.edu/ registrar/degree_certication.php. (https://www.wku.edu/registrar/ degree_certication.php) Students who began WKU in the Fall 2014 and thereafter should review the Colonnade requirements located at: https://www.wku.edu/ colonnade/colonnaderequirements.php. (https://www.wku.edu/ colonnade/colonnaderequirements.php) The major requires 73-79 semester hours of study. Entry into the BFA in Visual Arts program may be accomplished in one of two ways: have a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 in art and art history courses to include: ART 105 or ART 106, ART 130, ART 131, ART 140, a basic studio course at the 200-level, and an upper-level 300 studio course, or have a minimum GPA of 2.5 for these same courses and pass a department portfolio review conducted by a faculty committee. Transfer students will be required to meet the second of these two options. Any student denied entrance in their initial portfolio review and having less than 36 hours in art and art history, while maintaining a 2.5 GPA in the continuing art courses, may reapply once. Prior to meeting these standards, students pursuing the BFA will be designated as reference number 514P.

English for Secondary Teachers, Bachelor of Arts (561) Program Coordinator Peggy D. Otto, peggy.otto@wku.edu, (270) 745-5710 The English for Secondary Teachers major prepares students for certication to teach grades 8-12. The major is well rounded, featuring work in literature, writing, language study, and allied language arts. It is structured to meet specic accreditation and certication requirements while still offering students choice in course selection. Instead of a minor or second major requirement, this major includes a component of Professional Education courses, culminating in a semester of student teaching. In addition to the usual study-abroad opportunities available to students, a portion of the student teaching semester may be completed abroad. Although the major is specically aimed at preparing future secondary teachers, graduates are free to pursue other career paths appropriate for English majors, and they have the flexibility to go on to graduate study either in English or in education.

The major allows students to specialize in concentrations devoted to literature, creative writing, or professional writing, with many students opting to take courses in more than one of these areas. English students are prepared to communicate, interpret, create, and research in multiple genres and through multiple platforms, with the flexibility to apply these skills to the diverse circumstances required in today's professional environment. The nature of the material covered in this curriculum, including studying literary works by authors from highly diverse backgrounds from around the globe, ensures that our students will be engaged and socially responsible.

The curriculum includes a study of literature and emphasizes experimentation to help students nd and develop their interests, their skills, and ultimately, their own niche. Our Readers Series brings to campus several successful authors each year for public readings, classroom visits, and workshops. CW students are encouraged to pursue publication of original work both by submitting for print publication and participating in readings - and opportunities abound. Our literacy publication, Zephyrus, is produced by and for WKU students; numerous writing contests (including the English Club's Goldenrod Poetry Contest and a genre-rotating contest accompanying the annual Jim Wayne Miller Celebration of Writing) are offered each year, and the campus and larger community offer a variety of venues for readings, from coffeehouse open-mic nights to more formal occasions, like our annual Senior Reading. The CW major requires either a second major or a minor, and we invite students to use that requirement to their advantage by selecting one which will contribute directly to their aspirations, whether that may be a career plan (since almost every career eld has a place for skilled writers) or a discipline which will better equip them for a specic writing pursuit. Naturally, the CW program\u2014like all other English majors\u2014also offers opportunities to study abroad. The creative writing concentration requires a minimum of 42 hours and leads to the Bachelor of Arts degree. A minor or second major is required.

Department of Folk Studies and Anthropology Dr. Darlene Applegate, Head Email: Darlene.Applegate@wku.edu Ivan Wilson Center for Fine Arts, (270) 745-6549; Fax: (270) 745-6889 Website: https://www.wku.edu/fsa (http://www.wku.edu/fsa/) What is folklore? When you think about folklore, do you think about fairy tales, quilts, dulcimers, and log cabins? Folklore does include these things, but folklore also includes food customs, jokes, holiday customs, vernacular architecture, folk art, body art, memes, cosplay, urban legends, supernatural stories, bathroom grafti ... and so much more. Folklore is informal traditional culture. It is the art of everyday life. It is our customs, our beliefs, our stories, our worldview, and how we communicate. In fact, it's often so close to us we don't even notice it's there\u2014which is precisely why it's so important. What is anthropology? Anthropology is the holistic study of human culture and biology in any geographic place or time period. Anthropologists study topics as diverse as technology, foodways and subsistence, diet and nutrition, housing and settlement, economic systems, educational systems, kinship and social organization, political organization, gender and social identity, religion and belief systems, language, art and other forms of expressive culture, culture change and globalization, evolution and adaptation, health and disease, human genetics, growth and development, demography, and non-human primates like chimpanzees. Anthropologists conduct research in the eld and in the laboratory. Academic Programs The programs and coursework of the Department of Folk Studies and Anthropology provide WKU students and the University constituency with the training, intellectual tools, and resources to understand the cultural and biological dimensions of humankind in terms of the myriad shaping factors addressed in our respective disciplines. Although the disciplines of anthropology and folk studies are distinct, we share the University's commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and public service, recognizing that this mission continues to evolve in response to regional, national, and global change. The undergraduate and graduate programs in folk studies stress the examination of traditional expressive culture as a key to understanding human experience. The discipline of folklore has close afnities with literature, anthropology, sociology, history, geography, linguistics, philosophy, ethnomusicology, and psychology. The folk studies program integrates humanistic and social scientic perspectives on culture with pragmatic skills needed for professional involvement in research or for a variety of elds of employment such as public and applied folklore, historic preservation, cultural resource management, and museum work.The department offers an undergraduate minor in folklore in order to provide students with opportunities to enrich their general knowledge of the folk traditions and customs of specic societies and culture areas and to develop greater understanding of related forms of human thought and expression. The anthropology program at Western Kentucky University offers students a cohesive program of study that enriches their knowledge of human culture and biology, develops their cross-cultural perspectives, and prepares them for a variety of careers. In particular, the program provides opportunities for students to study the interaction of culture and biology, both in contemporary societies as well as in the archaeological and evolutionary past. The anthropology major and minor curricula prepare students for graduate studies and employment in cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, archaeology, linguistic anthropology, applied anthropology, cultural resource management, and related elds. Anthropology enriches the study of history, folklore, religion, languages, biological and physical sciences, and other social sciences. The anthropology program maintains extensive archaeological, biological, and cultural collections at the Anthropology Laboratory. The anthropology program also houses the state-of-the-art Ethnographic Visual Production Lab with digital audio and video recorders and cameras, virtual reality equipment, and editing stations. When planning programs of study in this department, students should be aware of the University's academic requirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" Specic attention should be given to the subsections in the chapter entitled (a) Academic Programs, (b) Colonnade Requirements, and (c) Academic Requirements and Regulations. Students should be aware that some academic programs may require additional scholastic regulations and standards not specied in the catalog. To obtain a copy of these regulations, students should contact the Department Head. JUMP Program The Folk Studies Joint Undergraduate-Master's Program (JUMP) offers highly qualied and motivated students the opportunity to complete a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in an accelerated time frame. Qualied students who have been admitted to the JUMP program may begin taking graduate courses in folk studies as early as their junior year and can then apply for admission to the MA Program in Folk Studies. JUMP students are NOT required to be Folklore minors. Why Study Folklore and Anthropology? The folklorist's skills in listening, collaboration, and analytical thinking are valuable skills for a wide variety of jobs. With a folklore minor, you'll develop outstanding skills for communicating across cultural groups as you conduct ethnographic eldwork. You'll learn how to do multimedia production as you curate your eldwork data for new audiences. And you'll learn how to work collaboratively with a diverse range of community partners. These are the skills 21st century employers seek. According to a survey of recent graduates, 73% of our undergraduate folklore minors were employed and 17% went on to graduate programs. Our graduates are public folklorists, museum curators, educators, preservationists, lm producers, professors, and even intelligence analysts. Training in anthropology promotes cultural awareness and enhances critical thinking, data collection and analysis, and creative problem- solving skills. Our students are actively engaged in research, extracurricular activities, public education, and community service, gaining valuable experience in preparation for careers and advanced Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 97 studies. According to a recent survey of our anthropology graduates, 74% were employed and 21% progressed on to graduate school. Our former students are working in contract archaeology, cultural resource management, museums, medical anthropology, visual media, international education, the non-prot sector, and other exciting areas. Public Outreach Programs The department is proud to house two award-winning public outreach programs. Besides serving diverse communities across the Commonwealth, the programs afford our students with opportunities to gain practical hands-on experience in public folklore and applied anthropology. For over 30 years the Kentucky Folklife Program (KFP) has been dedicated to the mission of documenting, presenting, and conserving the diverse traditional culture and heritage of the Commonwealth. Founded in 1989 as an inter-agency partnership between the Kentucky Historical Society and Kentucky Arts Council, KFP moved to its current home in the department in 2012. Physically located in the Pioneer Log Cabin on WKU's main campus, KFP remains focused on practical folklife and traditional arts projects as we continue to understand the evolving needs of local constituents throughout Kentucky, those who have a crucial stake in documenting the folk traditions of their regions. With our vantage point at WKU, KFP is always exploring exciting and innovative partnership opportunities with other organizations, universities, and folklife programs throughout the nation. Examples of KFP projects and programming since moving to WKU include the Bosnian oral history project, Folklorists in the Park program, Pioneer Log Cabin concert series and jams, and Southcentral Kentucky Musical Legacy project. Founded in 1995, the mission of the Kentucky Archaeological Survey (KAS) is to provide services to state and federal agencies, work with private landowners to protect archaeological sites, and educate the public about Kentucky's rich archaeological heritage. KAS works with local governments and non-prot organizations on diverse initiatives, including educational projects that involve grade-school children and civic groups who participate in ongoing archaeological research. KAS undertakes a variety of projects throughout Kentucky. Some are conducted in advance of construction by government agencies, while others are conducted to identify sites on public lands, so that agencies can be better stewards. Examples of projects are the Old Frankfort Cemetery relocation, survey of historic farmsteads in the Bluegrass, Building Blocks of History program at Riverside-The Farnsley-Moreman Landing, and Kentucky Archaeology video and booklet series.

Department of History Dr. Eric Reed, Head Email: Eric.Reed@wku.edu Cherry Hall, Website: http://www.wku.edu/history (http://www.wku.edu/history/) History is the record of the collective experience of humanity. It provides perspective and knowledge which helps us understand the present and it provides hope that we may avoid past mistakes. As the broadest of all academic disciplines, history appeals to the curious mind which is not content only with understanding the present. History equips students with the skills to collect, analyze, and use data and the ability to apply those skills to construct arguments and use evidence to support them. Because of its breadth, the study of history prepares students for numerous occupations and professions. Many of our majors pursue careers in education from the elementary through college level. There Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog102 Department of History are, however, a variety of other areas open to the student of history: local, state, and federal government, the Foreign Service, law, professional library work, the national park service, banking, journalism, politics, and a host of others. In addition, many businesses seek candidates with a strong background in the liberal arts because of their critical thinking, analytic, and writing abilities in all areas in which history students excel. The Department of History offers a variety of courses to students in any major, as well as courses meeting Colonnade requirements for all students. Students who complete a co-major in social studies and who complete the professional education requirements may be certied in the teacher education program. When planning a program of study in this department, each student should be aware of the university's academic requirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" Specic attention should be given to the chapter \"Academic Requirements and Regulations,\" \"Academic Programs,\" and \"Colonnade Requirements.\" Students should be aware that some academic programs may require additional scholastic regulations and standards not specied in the catalog. To obtain a copy of these regulations, students should contact the Department Head. Departmental Honors Program The Department of History offers an honors program for superior students that provides opportunities for a challenging and intensive investigation of historical topics in informal, small-group settings. Students with grade point averages of 3.4 or above are eligible to enroll in history honors courses. Those who fulll designated requirements may earn a transcript notation indicating that they have graduated with honors in history. Full details of the program may be obtained by contacting Professor Patricia Minter, Ofce 206 in Cherry Hall.

Both the American Bar Association and the American Association of Law Schools recommend a broad liberal arts program of courses for potential law students. Pre-law students will best prepare for law school by pursuing a rigorous course of study during their undergraduate years. No specic major is required for admission to law school, but students should select major and minor elds which they nd both interesting and promising for superior academic performance. Admission to law school is on a competitive basis, and the number of openings at each school is limited. The main criteria for admissionto most recognized schools are a high grade point average (GPA) in undergraduate work and a high score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). A Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree from an accredited four-year college or university is required for admission to law schools accredited by the American Bar Association. Law school admission directors and independent studies of the factors which contribute to success in the study of law conclude that undergraduates should develop a core group of skills during their programs of study. It is important that students select courses that develop strong vocabulary and reading comprehension skills, effective writing ability, analytical/logical reasoning, and an understanding of societal institutions and values. Students should pursue a challenging course of study that emphasizes reading, writing, and analytical ability. Courses which can develop the requisite skills and abilities for legal study include: ENG 100 , ENG 200 , ENG 300 , ENG 301 , and English electives; PS 110 , PS 220 , PS 326 , PS 327 , and PS 328 electives; PHIL 215 , PHIL 350 , PHIL 415 and philosophy electives. Based on individual interests, students may also pursue elective courses in accounting, economics, sociology / criminology, foreign language, and speech communication. The following courses, while not mandatory for pre-legal study, offer undergraduate students a useful introduction to various aspects of public law and legal history: PS 326 , PS 327 , and PS 328 ; HIST 445 and HIST 446 ; BCOM 301 or JOUR 301 ; MGT 200 ; ECON 390 . Please note: Recommended courses are based on WKU's assessment of specic professional school requirements. Students should, in consultation with their advisor, review the requirements at the professional school of their choice. Each student who intends to study law after graduation should make initial contact with the Pre-Law Advising program. Afterwards, students are encouraged to meet with a pre-law advisor in addition to his/her major advisor during their tenure at WKU. Pre-law advisors will provide assistance in obtaining information about law schools, the Law School Admission Test and other pertinent information. Aspiring pre-law students should plan to take the LSAT in June following their junior year. During the senior year, the pre-law advisor will also be available to assist students in the preparation and submission of applications to law schools of their choice. Applications are usually accompanied by letters of recommendation from faculty members who can comment on the student's ability and promise for the study of law. Aspiring candidates should conduct their undergraduate studies that they can, with condence, ask at least three faculty members to serve as references. Faculty Professor Anthony A.

Rosa, andrew.rosa@wku.edu, (270) 745-3841 The minor in African American Studies compresses the unique and diverse experiences of African Americans into a manageable and denable programs of study that acknowledges the interconnectedness of these experiences with the peoples of Africa and the African Diaspora. Viewed from multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary perspectives, courses in the African American studies minor provide the opportunity for students to study, analyze and develop a comprehensive understanding of the African American experience in ways that both link and differentiate past and present circumstances in the African Diaspora. A diaspora approach to the study of the African American experience is concerned with the following two issues: 1) the way in which African cultural, social, religious, and political forms influence African descended persons and communities, and how such forms changed through interaction with non-African cultures; and 2) comparisons and correspondence among communities of African descended people who are geographically separated and/or culturally distinct. A person who completes the African American Studies minor will have enlarged perspectives and increased awareness of the diversity of experience within African American cultures; these are skills well suited for advanced study at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and for jobs in governmental departments and agencies and with private organizations. In fullling the minimum requirements for a minor, the student normally should not include more than six hours of electives with any one course prex. Honors Program The African American Studies Program participates in the Dixie and Peter Mahurin Honors College. Honors courses allow students of exceptional academic abilities to investigate the African American experience in a more in-depth manner and to discuss contemporary issues in small group settings. Honors courses encourage the development of critical thinking skills and analytical writing.

Department of Modern Languages Dr. Alexander Poole, Interim Department Head Email: Alexander.Poole@wku.edu (%20Alexander.Poole@wku.edu) Honors College and abroad, community outreach activities, and other cultural encounters, the Department of Modern Languages cultivates communicative skills and cultural awareness that prepare students at Western Kentucky University to be more knowledgeable and sensitive citizens of the global community. The department's goals are to deliver high-quality language instruction based on nationally- recognized standards, to contribute actively to cross-disciplinary international initiatives on campus, and to graduate majors and minors whose language skills provide enhanced opportunities for careers at the regional, national, and international levels, and who are competitive for graduate study, should they choose that route. Language students may join any one of the department's language clubs and may also be selected for membership in chapters of national language honor societies. They may attend international lms, interact with exchange students, take part in community or regional outreach activities, and enjoy the benets of multi-media enhanced instruction. The department strongly encourages students to take advantage of study abroad opportunities. With advance approval of the department, students can earn credit toward majors and minors through participation in WKU's own direct exchanges, the programs of the Kentucky Institute for International Studies or other accredited programs. When planning programs of study in this department, students should be aware of the University's academic requirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" Specic attention should be given to the subsections in the chapter entitled 1.Academic Programs, 2.Colonnade Requirements, and 3.Academic Requirements and Regulations. Students should be aware that some academic programs may require additional scholastic regulations and standards not specied in the catalog. To obtain a copy of these regulations, students should contact the Department Head. WKU Language Requirement Colonnade Program Students enrolling as rst-time, degree-seeking college students in fall 2014 or thereafter should demonstrate language prociency at the Novice High level before completing 60 hours of college credit. Students may start a new language with a 101 course and then complete the second semester (102) course with a C or higher to demonstrate prociency; or they may take a STAMP assessment or present an adequate CLEP or AP score to demonstrate prociency based on previous knowledge, or they may place properly and complete at least a second semester (102) course or higher to demonstrate prociency. For information, go to http://www.wku.edu/modernlanguages (http:// www.wku.edu/modernlanguages/) and click on Placement. Previous Catalog Years Students who enrolled as rst-time, degree-seeking college students in summer 2004 or after must fulll the foreign language general education requirement of \"prociency at the second-semester level.\" They can do this by successfully taking a 102 (second-semester of rst year) course, by taking a department exam for 102, by gaining appropriate CLEP or Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 111 AP credit, or by placing into and successfully passing a course at the intermediate (201 or 202) level or higher that is taught in the target language. Students who wish to continue a language that they studied for 2 or more years in high school will generally begin that language at the 102 level or higher. Students who want to begin the study of a new language in order to fulll the general education requirement should enroll in the rst-semester (101) course of that language. Students who enrolled as rst-time, degree-seeking college students prior to the summer of 2004 may fulll the foreign language general education requirement of prociency at the rst-semester level. They can do this by successfully taking a 101 or rst-semester course. Credit for Students Intending to Major or Minor in a Language Students who have good language skills and those who plan to major or minor in one of these languages should take measures to gain credit for their previous knowledge. For current information on veried credit, AP credit, or CLEP credit, go to the Modern Languages website at this address: http://www.wku.edu/modernlanguages (http://www.wku.edu/ modernlanguages/ ) and click on Placement. International Study Opportunities WKU students may take part in faculty-led study abroad programs or enroll for short-term, summer, quarter, semester or year abroad programs at study centers abroad and have that coursework transferred back to WKU and credited to their Modern Language major. See the international programs section of this publication or http://www.wku.edu/studyabroad (http://www.wku.edu/studyabroad/) for more information.

Department of Music Dr. Scott Harris, Head Email: scott.harris@wku.edu Ivan Wilson Center for Fine Arts, The Department of Music promotes the study and experience of music in its broadest sense: preparing artist teachers and performers, enhancing creativity and the human spirit, and enriching the quality of life on campus, in the region, and in our global community. Western Kentucky University has been a fully accredited member of the National Association of Schools of Music since 1948. A large part of the department's mission is the preparation of music teachers and professional musicians. Students with broad musical interests may select a music major or minor within a diversied liberal arts program. Music degree programs provide for the development of basic musicianship through conceptual understanding of musical properties and their interrelationships, relevant opportunities for listening, performing, composing, and scholarship, and the acquisition of a repertory representative of various cultures and historical periods. Competencies in various areas and at varying levels appropriate to each program of music concentration are developed through a sequence of studies and assessments. General University students may elect certain music courses through the Colonnade Program Requirements. All students from all disciplines may participate in various instrumental and choral ensembles. Students wishing to pursue a music degree (including double majors) should have pre-college training in their principal or major performing instrument or voice and be able to read music fluently. Basic keyboard ability is helpful but not mandatory. Entering students must audition for admission to the music program to major or minor in music, including diagnostic examinations in theory rudiments (scales, keys, intervals, triads, general notation), music reading, and performance (principal instrument/voice). Deciencies may be removed through remedial placement except in the case of auditions for the Bachelor of Music in Performance.When planning a program of study in this department, each student should be aware of the University's academic requirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" Pay particular attention to the subsections entitled (a) Academic Programs, (b) Colonnade Requirements, and (c) Academic Requirements and Regulations. Some academic programs require additional scholastic regulations and standards not specied in the catalog. Students should contact their advisor for any recent requirement changes not reflected in this catalog. Information for prospective students about life in the Department of Music appears at http:// www.wku.edu/music (http://www.wku.edu/music/). The Department of Music offers majors and a minor as shown in the following sections. Music Fees Individual or small group instruction in applied music voice or musical instrument: Fall and Spring - $50 Per Course Applied Music Instruction Music Majors and Minors take applied lessons as part of their individual degree program. These lessons are one-on-one instruction, typically offered weekly, on the dened performance instrument. An audition demonstrating an appropriate level of skill, reading ability, and knowledge is required prior to enrollment in applied lessons and acceptance as a music major or minor. Students registering for one credit hour (secondary) receive one half- hour private lesson per week or the equivalent. Those registering for two to three credit hours (principal and major) receive one hour (or its equivalent) of private lessons per week. Placement in subsequent courses after the initial semester in both the principal and major tracks is made on the basis of faculty committee recommendations. Students are expected to practice a minimum of three hours per week for each credit hour received. Instruction is offered in piano, organ, harpsichord, voice, violin, viola, harp, cello, double bass, guitar, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, horn, trumpet, euphonium, trombone, tuba, percussion, composition, and jazz improvisation. Applied music courses include: MUS 150 , MUS 350 ; MUS 153 , MUS 353 ; MUS 357 , MUS 457 . See the course descriptions for each course in the catalog.

Department of Philosophy and Religion Llewelyn Price, Interim Head Email: philosophy-religion/) The department offers a major and a minor in philosophy, religious studies, and Asian religions and cultures. These majors prepare students for graduate work in a variety of disciplines, include philosophy and religious studies. Majors and minors in these elds also contribute to preparation for a variety of professional and vocational elds. In each case, the number of semester hours required is modest in order to encourage second majors and minors. The requirements are flexible Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 135 enough to permit students to select courses which develop and extend their interest. Philosophy The mission of the philosophy program is to use its faculty's collective expertise and experience in the various philosophical disciplines to teach philosophy with the intention of enabling its students to become effective, self-critical leaders able to empower others, to solve problems in diverse social and professional settings, and to experience the satisfaction that can only come from living the examined life. To serve this mission, the philosophy program is committed to providing courses that: foster ethical understanding, analytical reading, logical thinking, and clear expression in our students; illuminate the assumptions, methods, and foundations of other disciplines for students who also major or minor in philosophy; acquaint students with paradigms and perspectives from past philosophies that provide recurring thought patterns whose strengths and weaknesses an autonomous individual should know; prepare students to deal with problems for which there are neither simple nor obvious solutions; equip students for graduate and professional study in elds such as law, government service, management, medicine, the ministry, and philosophy. The philosophy program aids students to draw out from within themselves the assumptions and beliefs \u2014 often unconsciously but nonetheless deeply felt and held \u2014 governing their thoughts and actions, to express these inner convictions fully and clearly, and to subject them to critical analysis. This is the birth into the examined life. It is also the rst step toward awakening in students the spirit of critical inquiry, encouraging them to question readily accepted ideas, to probe for and to expose all assumptions, and to subject all claims and all issues\u2014personal or public, local or international \u2014 to close examination. Philosophy lays bare fundamental questions and instructs students in the methods for grappling with them. As students develop, they see how ideas drive the phenomena of daily life. Philosophy calls students to the responsibility of putting all ideas to the test to know their value. Religious Studies The mission of the religious studies program is to promote the academic study of religion at Western Kentucky University and in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The academic study of religion provides the student with the methodological orientation necessary to comprehend the central beliefs, ethical practices, ritual systems, symbols, and social institutions of diverse religious traditions in their historic, contemporary and global contexts. Study in this eld is multicultural and comparative, examining the life, ways, and moral worlds of societies past and present, our own as well as others. The student learns to probe for the structure, function, and meaning of religion through those rites of passage, sacred narratives, faith communities, and codes of behavior that give meaning to human existence. Asian Religions and Cultures The continent of Asia is home to some of the most ancient and formative civilizations in history. All of the world's largest religious traditions have their origins on the continent, and Asian peoples have shaped andreshaped how humanity understands the world and itself for centuries. The Asian Religions and Cultures major facilitates the understanding of the continent and its peoples, allowing students to understand not only the Asian past but to put current issues and problems into a broader historical, religious, and cultural context.

Accordingly, those who study philosophy question how to understand ourselves and our relationships to other persons, to society, to nature, to the universe, and, for some, to God. Philosophy develops our ability to challenge the obvious, trains us to analyze and synthesize ideas, and shows us both how to defend and how to criticize normative claims about actions, policies, and ways of life. By carefully examining and discussing both traditional and contemporary works, it cultivates habits of honest reflection, careful reasoning, and clear thinking.

Students who major in sociology learn to deal creatively with the most pressing problems of the day, such as the increase in our federal prison population, rising class inequality, or environmental degradation. Sociology majors thus develop into critical thinkers with a global perspective, a deep appreciation for diversity and strong problem-solving abilities. Completion of the curriculum in sociology or criminology provides a broad background for students pursuing a variety of careers. Students develop the skills most desired by today's employers including the ability to communicate effectively, frame and solve problems realistically and in teamwork situations, plan and evaluate projects and programs, prepare clear and concise reports, and speak effectively in varied group situations. Students who graduate are thus poised to enter a wide range of occupational areas, including corporations, government agencies, social service institutions, and other nonprot organizations. Furthermore, an undergraduate major is also an excellent foundation for graduate study in anticipation of a career in college teaching, law, business, or medicine.

Drummond, holli.drummond@wku.edu , (270) 745-2259 As a scientic discipline, Criminology emerged from the eld of Sociology. Core Sociological concepts inform explanations of crime and society's response to it. WKU's Bachelor's program in Criminology provides students with the opportunity to understand the theoretical principles which guide practical solutions to issues associated with offending, victimization, and interactions with the Criminal Justice System. Compared with traditional criminal justice programs, Criminology has a strong interdisciplinary focus. Our program continues this tradition by studying crime through a societal lens as we examine theoretical explanations, policy developments, and the broader implications of solutions on the health and well-being of communities and society.

We offer several different degree programs, all designed to balance theory and practice. Our AB degree in Dance and our AB degree in Theatre are each designed to provide a solid liberal arts foundation in their discipline while leaving room for study in a minor or second major. Our BFA in Performing Arts degree provides a broad study of theatre while also offering intensive pre-professional training in one of four required areas of concentration: acting, directing, music theatre, or theatre design and technology. We also offer 4 minors: a minor in Theatre, a minor in Musical Theatre, a minor in Dance, and a minor in Arts Administration. We believe that what you learn in the shops, the studios, and onstage is every bit as important as what happens in the classroom. Our intensive production season complements the curriculum by offering you ample opportunity to put theory to the test as you work side by side with your peers, faculty and guest artists on a steady variety of theatre and dance productions. Career preparation is also woven into our curriculum with courses such as Acting Audition Workshop, Dance Pedagogy, and Performing Arts Career Seminar. Whatever degree you choose as the best path for you, we'll challenge you, we'll collaborate with you, and we'll care about you. Western Kentucky University is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Theatre and the National Association of Schools of Dance. When planning a program of study in this department, each student should be aware of the University's academic requirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" Specic attention should be given to the subsections in the chapter entitled (a) Academic Programs, (b) Colonnade Program Requirements, and (c) \"Academic Requirements and Regulations.\" Students should be aware that some academic programs may require additional scholastic regulations and standards not specied in the catalog.

Undergraduate Programs The School of Media offers majors in Broadcasting, Film, Journalism, and Photojournalism. Graduate courses are in sport media and branding (see The Graduate School's Catalog for details). After having offered journalism courses for more than thirty years, Western Kentucky University created the Department of Journalism in 1977. Two years later the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC) nationally accredited the Department, designating its adherence to high standards, including emphasis on liberal arts and science education, in the attainment of a professional communication degree. In 1999, the Department merged with the Broadcasting and Mass Communication programs to form the School of Journalism & Broadcasting. In 2000, the Commonwealth of Kentucky designated the School a \"Program of Distinction,\" and in 2003 the School of Media moved into a new $18 million building with state-of-the-art classrooms and labs. ACEJMC re-accredited the School in its new conguration in 2004 and again in 2016. Between 2012 and 2018, WKU has won the Hearst Journalism Awards Intercollegiate Photojournalism Championships 5 times and the Multimedia Championships 7 times. The WKU School of Journalism & Broadcasting placed rst in the 2018 Hearst Journalism Awards - continuing a multi-decade tradition of ranking among one of the top schools nationally. In August 2019, the School of Journalism & Broadcasting changed its name to the School of Media to better reflect the school's programs and its commitment to preparing student for an ever changing professional landscape. The School fervently believes that a broad-based liberal arts and science curriculum is essential for a well-rounded understanding of society and that students and faculty should embrace a spirit of social awareness and service to diverse communities. It upholds the ideal that the American press system should be free, independent, and responsible. The School and its faculty encourage students to think critically and act ethically. The School emphasizes the ability to adapt intellectually and creatively to opportunities and challenges of an increasingly complex information society. Students are encouraged to seek practical experience through participation in student publications and broadcasting outlets as well as internships with professional organizations. They may gain experience by working on the College Heights Herald, the campus newspaper, the Talisman yearbook, WWHR , a licensed noncommercial FM station student managed and staffed, and the Newschannel12 newscast.

Latin American Studies, Minor (408) Program Coordinator Marc V. Eagle, marc.eagle@wku.edu, (270) 745-3841 Faculty Advisors: Dr. David Keeling Environmental Ofce 401B Phone: (270) (270) 745-7026 Email: Marc.Eagle@wku.edu There are many potential reasons to study Latin America, from a personal love of Latin American music and dance to the professional advantages it can provide after graduation. Latin American and Caribbean countries have historically been closely involved with the U.S. both politically and economically. With the advent of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, Mexico is an ever more important trading partner, and the U.S. continues to seek additional trade agreements throughout the region. Countries like Brazil are playing an increasingly important role in the world economy. Developments in Latin American countries also affect the U.S. directly, and understanding Latin American issues is the key to creating informed policies that can benet the entire hemisphere. Hispanics are now the largest and fastest-growing minority group in the U.S., so that Latin American culture has become a vital part of the diversesociety of this country. Finally, Latin America is an exciting place to study; your experiences with the music, lm, food, sports, and people of the region will remain with you for your entire life. Program Requirements (21 hours) The minor in Latin American studies requires a minimum of 21 semester hours. Latin American Society: Past and Present (cross-listed as GEOG 200 , HIST 200 , and SPAN 200) is required of students taking the minor. At least three departments must be represented among the remaining 18 hours. Completion of one year of college Spanish or Portuguese or its equivalent is an additional requirement. Latin American Society: Past and Present. 3 hours. (Required) (equivalent to GEOG 200 , HIST 200 , and SPAN 200). The course is a broad, interdisciplinary introduction to the study of Latin America, emphasizing its regions, peoples and cultures. (Colonnade Connections SB course - 21 hours of Foundations and Explorations Courses, or junior status required). Meets Category E General Education requirement for students enrolled with a catalog term prior to Fall 2014.

Legal Studies, Minor (409) Advisor: Dr. Patricia Minter Email: Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog178 Russian and East European Studies, Minor (451) Legal Studies The Legal Studies minor provides students an interdisciplinary perspective while fostering greater understanding of the law as it relates to history, the sciences, and ethics in the United States and around the world. While this minor will appeal to pre-law students, it can also serve as a background for a wide variety of careers, including public administration, academics, government, homeland security, non- governmental organizations and law enforcement. Why Legal Studies? Legal Studies allows students from a broad range of disciplines to focus their studies using their own majors as a launching point for exploring how the study of law cuts across disciplinary lines. It offers courses in a wide variety of subjects, including philosophy and ethics, American legal history, political process, constitutional law, sociology and criminal justice, business, journalism and broadcasting, economics and property law, and environmental law and regulations. Legal Studies prepares students for a wide variety of careers in law, business, journalism and broadcasting, public policy, and sciences.

Russian and East European Studies, Minor (451) Program Coordinator (270) 745-3841 This interdisciplinary minor is designed with two main goals in mind. The rst is to familiarize students with the most signicant political and economic issues facing both Russia and the states of Eastern Europe. The second is to provide students a foundation for effective communication in Russian. Because of Russia's dominant global role, it is essential that students become familiar with Russia and its language. With Russian being the language of approximately 250 million people, students minoring in REES will study one of the major languages of the world. Furthermore, Russian is recognized as a Critical Language by the US Departments of State and Defense. Fortunately, the language is not as hard as most people think; the alphabet takes less than a week to master. Learning Russian allows students to travel to Russia and witness rst-hand the changes taking place in religious, economic, and cultural behaviors. Russian makes an excellent language for those pursuing careers in sociology, anthropology, criminology, political science, international law, geology, journalism, and international business. Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 179 Knowledge of East European and Russian societies opens the door to many exciting opportunities. A minor in Russian and East European Studies is not just for translators, diplomats, and teachers. Knowledge of Russia and East Europe can be helpful in landing a job in many elds. Having a REES minor makes any job candidate stand out from the crowd, whatever the eld. A REES minor can careers in business, law enforcement, political analysis, work in international aid organizations, natural resource management, and computer science. For those seeking a career in research, Russia and East Europe is a massive eld for study in disciplines like Religious Studies, Economics, Sociology, Anthropology, History, Political Science, and more. Program Requirements (21 hours) The minor requires seven courses, for a total of 21 credit hours. Students minoring in Russian and East European Studies construct their programs of study around two components.

Thrasher, Associate Dean Email: Evelyn.Thrasher@wku.edu (evelyn.thrasher@wku.edu) The Gordon Ford College of Business traces its roots to the Bowling Green Business University, founded in 1884 as the Southern Normal School and Business College. In 1907, the Southern Normal School became Western Kentucky State Normal School, and the Bowling Green Business University began a long history of nationally noted programs. In June 1963, Western Kentucky University assumed the business programs of the Bowling Green Business University, and in 1964 the BowlingGreen College of Commerce became a division of the University. The name was changed in 1972 to the Bowling Green College of Business and Public Affairs; and following department realignment in 1979, it became the Bowling Green College of Business Administration. To honor the generosity of Gordon B. Ford, the college was renamed the Gordon Ford College of Business in December of 1998, becoming the second named business school in Kentucky. All business programs offered by the College are accredited by AACSB International - The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. WKU is one of only three universities in the Commonwealth of Kentucky to have 'dual accreditation,' meaning that both its business and accounting programs are AACSB accredited.

A student seeking to enroll in ACCT 301 and/or ACCT 310 must have completed ACCT 200 and ACCT 201 with grades of \"B\" or better. Except for ACCT 300, ACCT 301, and ACCT 310, students must be admitted to the Accounting Program to enroll in upper-level accounting courses. Accounting majors must earn a grade of \"C\" or better in ACCT 300, ACCT 301, ACCT 303, ACCT 310, and ACCT 312 and other courses when used as prerequisites for succeeding courses. For example, an accounting major must earn at least the grade of \"C\" in ACCT 300 before enrolling in ACCT 301. Also, accounting majors are allowed to repeat an upper-division accounting course only once, even if they received a \"W\" on the rst attempt. Exceptions to this policy will be considered only in extenuating circumstances. Pursuing a Second Degree in Accounting Individuals who have already received a college degree have the opportunity of enrolling in WKU to pursue a degree in accounting. Students with a rst degree in the area of business should be able to complete the Bachelor of Science degree in accounting with approximately 30 additional hours. Those individuals without previous courses in business tend to need a higher number of hours to complete the second degree. Admission requires the completion of certain pre-professional courses and the attainment of a grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.5 in those courses. Second baccalaureate degree candidates are exempt from the Western Kentucky University Colonnade requirements. Accounting students must, however, complete the math requirement and an approved speech course, Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog184 Department of Economics either in previous college work or as a part of the proposed course of study. Only those accounting and professional business courses completed within ve years of the time that the student enrolls for the second degree in accounting will be accepted. Because the business environment is ever changing, subject matter taken in courses completed several years ago is likely forgotten or not currently relevant. The decision to accept coursework toward the second degree rests with the Department Chair of Accounting. The prospective candidate for the second degree should contact the Department Chair of Accounting to schedule a meeting to evaluate their situation, to develop a program of study, and to obtain an estimate of the time necessary to complete the second degree in accounting. Finish in Four Students pursuing the Accounting JUMP Program will need to consult with their assigned Academic Advisor as the Finish in Four Plan will differ.

To fulll this mission, the economics faculty emphasizes excellence in teaching and research and engages in service to the university and the community. Economics Economics is the study of how humans decide how to use the limited resources they have. Economic principles are at the core of decision- making by businesses, governments, non-prot organizations, individuals, and families, because the limited resources are not just money and raw materials - they are also time, attention, computing resources, food, water, hospital beds, or seats on a crowded subway. Economics is everywhere: you can be a business economist, a sports economist, an environmental economist, a health economist, or a transportation economist. Economics as a science relies heavily on data analysis because economists use real-world data to study economic relationships and to develop a better understanding of the world. Therefore, a graduate of an economics program will not only have the knowledge of economic principles that drive the economy much like the laws of physics rule the universe but will also leave with a toolkit of quantitative skills. This combination of the economic way of thinking and data analytic skills prepares students for many different employment opportunities. Our graduates pursue careers in nance, banking, insurance, local and federal governments, public utilities, research institutions, education, and international organizations. They hold a wide variety of jobs such as economist, loan ofcer, forecast analyst, nancial analyst, business consultant, data analyst, energy analyst, bank examiner, research analyst, broker, market research analyst, policy analyst, professor, lawyer and many more. This multitude of possible career paths is what is great about choosing an economics major. Economics gives students an excellent foundation for employment in many areas of business and government service, as well as for advanced graduate studies. Economics Degrees The Economics Department offers three majors : AB in Economics, BS in Business Economics, and BS in Mathematical Economics. The AB in Economics (reference number 638) requires a minimum of 34 hours, and a minor or a second major. Students interested in combining Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 185 the Economics major with another eld of study should pursue this degree path. Students may choose any other major or minor at WKU. If students choose their second major or minor(s) from another department in the Gordon Ford College of Business, some courses may apply to both degrees. The AB in Economics offers students the most flexibility to customize their education and graduate with a potent combination of highly marketable skills. The BS in Business Economics (reference number 724) requires 73 hours. This degree does not require a second major or a minor. The Business Economics major combines the courses from AB in Economics with those in accounting, nance, management, marketing, and computer information systems. The BS in Business Economics offers students an opportunity to combine the knowledge of economics with the key business disciplines, increasing their employability in the private sector. The BS in Mathematical Economics (reference number 731) is for students wishing to pursue either a graduate degree in economics, or a highly applied, analytical occupation with heavy emphasis on quantitative skills such as an actuary. This degree does not require a second major or a minor. The BS in Mathematical Economics offers two concentrations: General concentration, and Actuarial Science concentration. International students who complete this program may qualify for the STEM OPT extension (the CIP Code of the program is 45.0603). The General concentration in the BS in Mathematical Economics requires a minimum of 49 hours. This major is strongly recommended for students considering either a PhD in Economics or highly applied, analytical occupations, especially in data analytics. Because doctoral programs in economics are highly mathematical, this degree combines the economics coursework with the mathematics courses that are necessary to succeed in an economics doctoral program. The Actuarial Science concentration in the BS in Mathematical Economics requires a minimum of 61 hours. This degree is strongly recommended for students pursuing careers as actuaries. Actuaries are professionals who specialize in modeling and managing risks. Actuaries typically work for health, life, and property insurance companies, but individuals with actuarial training may work in many other areas such as banking, investment, energy, government, employee benets, predictive analytics, and many more. Actuaries use a combination of strong analytical skills, business knowledge, and an understanding of human behavior. It takes ve to seven years on average to become an actuary after completing an undergraduate degree. To become an actuary, one must pass a series of exams to earn an actuarial designation by either the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) or the Society of Actuaries (SOA). Students in the Actuarial Science concentration will take courses that will help them prepare for the rst two actuarial exams. As a part of becoming an actuary, candidates must also earn Validation by Educational Experience (VEE) credits, which demonstrate that as students they received academic training in certain required areas. The course work in this concentration is designed for students to receive all three of the VEE credits required by the SOA: Economics, Mathematical Statistics, and Accounting and Finance. The Economics Department also offers a minor in Economics (reference code 356) which requires a total of 21 hours of coursework. Nine of those hours (ECON 202, ECON 203, and ECON 206) are a part of the College of Business Admissions Core, so to earn the minor in Economics, most business students need to complete 12 additional hours.Economics JUMP Program The Economics department offers a JUMP option - Joint Undergraduate/ Master's Program. JUMP allows students to start working toward their MA in Applied Economics while completing their bachelor's degree in economics. Undergraduate students admitted into JUMP may take graduate courses that count toward both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Up to 12 credit hours can be double-counted, and up to 18 hours of graduate courses can be taken while a student is completing the undergraduate degree. The key benet of the JUMP program is that it allows students to earn a bachelor's and a master's degree in less time by completing only 138 credit hours. For more information, see https:// www.wku.edu/mae/jump.php To be eligible for the Economics JUMP program, a student must meet the following requirements: Be an economics major (economics, business economics and mathematical economics); Have completed at least 60 hours total, with at least 24 hours at WKU; 3.0 overall GPA 15 hours of 200-level or higher economics courses with a minimum GPA of 3.25.

The rapid growth of multi-income families in the U.S. has placed more and more people in a position of need to apply sophisticated nancial planning techniques to their personal economic affairs. As a result, one of the fastest growing career paths in the nancial services industry is nancial planning, and the Certied Financial PlannerTM (CFP) \u00ae designation has become the most widely recognized nancial planning credential among consumers. The Personal Financial Planning concentration is registered with the Certied Financial Planner Board of Standards in Washington D.C. We are one of only three registered universities in the state of Kentucky! This registration confers a special advantage on our graduates. Upon completion of our CFP\u00ae board certied program, students are allowed to sit for the CFP\u00ae Certication Examination.

The Dean of the College of Education and Behavioral Sciences may grant an extension to this deadline. If the Commonwealth of Kentucky makes changes in certication requirements, students seeking certication may be required to modify their programs of study to meet the new requirements. For Undergraduate Courses Used to Satisfy Requirements in Programs Leading to Teacher Certication Consistent with CAEP Standards, approved courses for programs leading to teacher certication must be aligned with current standards. Some older courses may not be aligned with current standards, and thus it may not be appropriate to count them in a student's program. Generally speaking, professional education and \"content\" courses used to satisfy program requirements in programs leading to professional education certication should be no more than 10 years old. Decisions about whether older content courses may be used will be made on a case-by- case basis by the department head of the student's major. For students in programs leading to secondary certication (Grades P-12, 5-12, and 8-12), decisions about whether older pedagogy courses may be used willbe made by the faculty in the department in which the course is offered. However, if the pedagogy course is offered outside of the School of Teacher Education, the decision about whether the course may be used will be made in consultation with the School of Teacher Education. In all cases, documentation regarding the currency of course content and the alignment of the course with current teacher standards must be provided by the student and approved by the department that offers the course, upon recommendation from the School of Teacher Education when appropriate. Students who wish to use courses older than 10 years to satisfy program requirements may be required to demonstrate prociency related to current course content and learning outcomes. Advising for Teacher Education Programs All majors will be advised in the College of Education and Behavioral Science once they have reached junior status. Recommendation for Initial Teacher Certication To be recommended for initial certication at the baccalaureate level (including post-baccalaureate certication-only programs), an applicant must document: Completion of approved program in each desired certication area(s); Passing score(s) on the PRAXIS II exam(s) or other assessments required for each desired teaching area(s) (see http://www.ets.org/ praxis/ky (http://www.ets.org/praxis/ky/) for the most current list of required assessments); Achievement of at least a 2.75 GPA overall, in each certiable major(s) and minor(s), and in professional education courses; and Attainment of at least a \"C\" in all professional education courses, including EDU 489 and student teaching. Transfer Credit for Teacher Education If determined to be equivalent, professional education courses completed at another institution may be accepted for transfer to Western Kentucky University teacher preparation programs, provided that a minimum grade of \"C\" was earned in each course accepted for transfer and the course meets the course expiration guidelines as stated above. Field Experience Policy WKU undergraduate teacher preparation programs are designed to meet the University's standards for baccalaureate degrees, master's degrees, specialist degrees, and certication-only programs, as well as the Kentucky standards for the designated teaching certicate. All professional education programs require completion of a variety of diverse and focused eld experiences in appropriate off-campus Primary- Grade 12 school settings and school-related settings as well as student teaching or equivalent experiences. The number of required hours of eld experiences varies by program; however, a minimum of 200 hours of approved off-campus eld experience is required in professional education courses prior to the student teaching experience or equivalent. The candidate is responsible for documenting completed hours, date, and setting. In addition, all programs require one 16-week or two 8-week full- time student teaching placements, or appropriate equivalent. Every effort is made to provide teacher candidates with eld experiences in diverse settings (based on socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, language, and exceptionalities of students) in order to ensure that they are prepared to help all students learn. Prior to visiting any school, a student must have on le in the Ofce of Professional Educator Services a current TB risk assessment, a current physical exam, and a current criminal background Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 213 check.

In the fall of 2016, the Kentucky College of Optometry (Pikeville, KY) welcomed their inaugural class. Through a Memorandum of Agreement between WKU and KYCO, qualied WKU students will have preferred admission status at KYCO. The courses listed below are required as prerequisites for all optometry schools. Each science course must be accompanied by its appropriate laboratory: Code Title Hours BIOL 120 Biological Concepts: Cells Metabolism and Genetics3 BIOL 122 Biological Concepts: Evolution, Diversity, and Ecology3 BIOL 226 Microbial Biology and Diversity 3 CHEM 120 College Chemistry I 3 CHEM 222 College Chemistry II 3 CHEM 340 Organic Chemistry I 3 PHYS 231 Introduction to Physics and Biophysics I3 PHYS 332 Introduction to Physics and Biophysics II3 or PHYS 255 University Physics I PHYS 265 University Physics II 4 Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 245 MATH 116 College Algebra 3 MATH 117Trigonometry 3 MATH 136 Calculus I 4 ENG 100 Introduction to College Writing 3 ENG 300 Writing in the Disciplines 3 PSY/PSYS 100Introduction to Psychology 3 Select a statistics course Total Hours 47 There may be additional course requirements that vary with each optometry school. All students in the curriculum are strongly encouraged to work toward a bachelor's degree, even though a degree is not required for admission to most optometry schools. One year of satisfactory work in optometry school can generally then be transferred to WKU in order to receive the Bachelor of Science degree. All requirements for the Colonnade Program and the core courses for a major and minor must be completed. Courses taken in optometry school may then (at the discretion of the department head) be accepted by the major and/or minor department at WKU allowing the student to receive the bachelor's degree. Please note: Recommended courses are based on WKU's assessment of specic professional school requirements. Students should, in consultation with their advisor, review the requirements at the professional school of their choice.

It has also brought about a need for personnel to ll positions in various businesses and professions which support agriculture. Processing and marketing of agricultural products and supplying agricultural chemicals, machinery, seed, feed, and other products require research, sales, and service personnel who have met specic educational requirements. Governmental agencies that conduct research, extension, advisory, and regulatory activities are staffed by highly trained agricultural personnel. The Department of Agriculture and Food Science strives to ll the needs of both the student who requires general technical knowledge for production agriculture and the student who needs more specializedtraining to pursue one of many careers. This is accomplished by offering specic curricula with enough flexibility to allow specialization within the curriculum. Many students studying agriculture have urban backgrounds and lack farm experiences. The Department of Agriculture and Food Science uses the University Farm and the Agricultural Exposition Center as integral parts of its laboratory and classroom instructional program to provide practical experiences. Internships and cooperative work experiences are encouraged for all students. To complete the 120 semester hours required for a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture, students must complete the basic curriculum and one of the concentrations. The basic curriculum includes the Colonnade Program and specialty support requirements as well as basic professional courses in agriculture. These concentrations are agribusiness, agricultural education, agronomy (plant science or soil science), animal science, horse science, dairy science, general agriculture, turf and golf course management, horticulture, pre-veterinary medicine, and pre-forestry. These concentrations allow students to vary their course selection to better meet their particular area of interest. The student, in consultation with an assigned advisor, will choose specic courses in addition to the basic curriculum. When planning a program of study, students should be aware of the University academic requirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" Specic attention should be given to the subsections in the chapter entitled (a) Academic Programs, (b) Colonnade Requirements, and (c) Academic Requirements and Regulations. Students should be aware that some academic programs may include additional scholastic regulations and standards not specied in the catalog. To obtain a copy of these regulations, students should contact the department head. Agriculture majors who follow the listed guidelines can graduate in 4 years (8 semesters) or less. Guidelines 1.Be advised by an assigned faculty advisor in the Department of Agriculture and Food Science each semester and enroll in the courses decided upon at the advising session. 2.Excluding remedial classes, receive a passing grade for an average of 15 hours per semester for 8 semesters with a minimum 2.0 GPA and a minimum total of 120 hours, including 42 or more hours upper- division (300- and 400-level) courses. Complete the Colonnade Program requirements of the department and the university. Note specic required mathematics, biology, and chemistry courses. 3.Deviation from any of these conditions might lead to the need for additional hours/courses and/or semester in order to graduate.

Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog272 Department of Chemistry Department of Chemistry Dr. Kevin Williams, Chair Kelly Thompson Hall, Ofce 4016 Phone: 270-745-3457 Website: www.wku.edu/chemistry (http://www.wku.edu/chemistry/) Mission Statement WKU Chemistry empowers students of all backgrounds to think critically about the molecular sciences and promotes a vibrant regional economy through training, public service, and industrial collaboration. We ignite a spirit of life-long learning through engaged classroom and laboratory instruction, hands-on experience in nationally recognized research, and direct mentoring by faculty. This enables our students to dene their own career path and to make an impact both locally and globally. Chemistry is often described as \"The Central Science\" in today's technology-driven world. Chemistry plays an important role in the research, development, and quality assurance of products and materials ranging from pharmaceuticals and polymers to ceramics and nanocomposites. Knowledge and understanding of fundamental chemical concepts are crucial to success in professions such as medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, forensic science, environmental science, engineering, medical laboratory science, physical therapy, nursing, patent and environmental law, and science education. In order to best serve such a diverse audience, the chemistry curriculum at Western Kentucky University offers an integrated series of lectures and laboratory courses. Our courses provide students with grounding in theoretical models balanced with real-life applications and hands-on laboratory experiences. This allows students to achieve an understanding of chemical and physical phenomena at the molecular level and to develop the critical thinking skills necessary for chemical problem- solving. In addition to coursework, the Department of Chemistry provides our undergraduates with a wide variety of research opportunities from biochemistry to materials science. Research encourages students to continue building their laboratory skills and scientic knowledge while working one-on-one with a faculty member. Undergraduate research students often present their research at both regional and national professional meetings. The combination of lecture, laboratory, and one- on-one faculty interaction allows students to develop the skills necessary to be successful in their chosen profession. As part of the educational experience, students are routinely trained in the operation of state-of-the-art instrumentation in the academic and research laboratories. The Department has extensive holdings of instrumentation, including atomic spectrometers, calorimeters, electrochemical analyzers, system, a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, and a 90 MHz xed magnet NMR. Colonnade Program requirements for students majoring outside the sciences can be satised by CHEM 101 , CHEM 109 , or CHEM 111 , where only one semester of chemistry is needed, or by the sequences CHEM 105 /CHEM 106 , CHEM 107 /CHEM 108 or CHEM 120 /CHEM 121 , CHEM 222 /CHEM 223 , where two semesters of chemistry are desired. Biochemistry courses (CHEM 446 , CHEM 447 , CHEM 462 , and CHEM 467 ) are also offered as part of the curriculum. CHEM 446 is required for the major approved by the American Chemical Society. Biochemistry is alsostrongly recommended for pre-medicine and pre-dentistry students, and for biology majors desiring a second major in chemistry. When planning a program of study in Chemistry, each student should be aware of the University's academic requirements and regulations contained in the \"Academic Information\" chapter of this catalog. Specic attention should be given to the subsections in the chapter entitled a) Academic Programs, b) Colonnade Requirements, c) Academic Requirements and Regulations. Students should be aware that some academic programs may require additional scholastic regulations and standards not specied in the catalog.

North, leslie.north@wku.edu, (270) 745-5982 The Environmental, Sustainability, and Geographic Studies program focuses on environment related issues using scientic, technological, and humanistic approaches to understand the interactive nature and interdependence of environmental and human factors. The program is structured around foundational courses, technical course work, and Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 277 applied real-world experiences. Foundational instruction introduces students to basic principles of environmental science and related subjects, such as sustainability science, environmental planning, pollution control, natural resource management, spatial data analysis, economics, cultural geography, and the general interactions of humans and nature. The program prepares students for thinking critically about the complexities of human-environmental interactions through technical course work encompassing scientic writing, quantitative skills and data analysis, applied eld- and lab-based experiences, and effective use of geospatial technologies (e.g., GIS and cartography, GPS, radar, satellite, drone, photogrammetry, environmental quality monitors, and surveying). Since the geoenvironmental sector is very broad in scope, the major does not include pre-dened and narrow concentrations. Instead, the program allows students to complete a customized set of elective coursework that best prepares them for a graduate program or any one of the wide ranging careers in the environmental eld that they nd of most interest. The program not only prepares students with essential knowledge in the elds of environment and sustainability but also trains students with critical information processing and geospatial analysis skills to meet the demands of employers in diverse industries with information-age needs in the 21st Century.

Gani, royhan.gani@wku.edu, (270) 745-5977 Geological science is often known as the science of the 21st century, as it is ground zero for tackling global challenges like managing land, water, ocean, space, mineral, and energy resources in a sustainable way. Society's interest in the environment and climate change is growing fast. The time has never been better to become a geological scientist. The B.S. degree in Geological Sciences can provide a wide variety of career options, including jobs in the corporate (oil & gas, mining, environmental, engineering), government (surveys, agencies, park service), and academic sectors. Our program takes a holistic approach, as the traditional geology has become increasingly interdisciplinary. With two concentrations (Geology, and Environmental Earth Science), the program has a common core, providing the knowledge base for students to pursue the Professional Geologist licensure. Each concentration has different other requirements, specializing in different subjects. Our classes feature interactive learning, both in the eld exploring the earth and in the lab doing simulations and analytical works. Students also enjoy excellent opportunities to work with faculty and other students on a variety of research topics.

Lebedinsky, alex.lebedinsky@wku.edu , (270) 745-3150 The BS in Mathematical Economics is for students wishing to pursue either a graduate degree in economics or a highly applied, analytical occupation with a heavy emphasis on quantitative skills such as an actuary. This degree does not require a second major or a minor. The BS in Mathematical Economics offers two concentrations: General concentration and Actuarial Science concentration. International students who complete this program may qualify for the STEM OPT extension (the CIP Code of the program is 45.0603). The General concentration in the BS in Mathematical Economics requires a minimum of 49 hours. This major is strongly recommended for students considering either a PhD in Economics or highly applied, analytical occupations, especially in data analytics. Because doctoral programs in economics are highly mathematical, this degree combines the economics coursework with the mathematics courses that are necessary to succeed in an economics doctoral program. The Actuarial Science concentration in the BS in Mathematical Economics requires a minimum of 61 hours. This degree is strongly recommended for students pursuing careers as actuaries. Actuaries are professionals who specialize in modeling and managing risks. Actuaries typically work for health, life, and property insurance companies, but individuals with actuarial training may work in many other areas such as banking, investment, energy, government, employee benets, predictive analytics, and many more. Actuaries use a combination of strong analytical skills, business knowledge, and an understanding of human behavior. It takes ve to seven years on average to become an actuary after completing an undergraduate degree. To become an actuary, one must pass a series of exams to earn an actuarial designation by either the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) or the Society of Actuaries (SOA). Students in the Actuarial Science concentration will take courses that will help them prepare for the rst two actuarial exams. As a part of becoming an actuary, candidates must also earn Validation by Educational Experience (VEE) credits, which demonstrate that as students they received academic training in certain required areas. The course work in this concentration is designed for students to receive all three of the VEE credits required by the SOA: Economics, Mathematical Statistics, and Accounting and Finance. Admission Requirements Admission to the Mathematical Economics major requires:1.Completion of MATH 136, ECON 202 and ECON 203 , and ECON 206 or STAT 301 with a minimum GPA of 2.0 in the courses listed. 2.Completion of a minimum of 60 hours with a minimum GPA of 2.0 overall. 3.Completion of a minimum of 12 hours at Western Kentucky University with a minimum WKU GPA of 2.0.

We have pathways designed for students who chose to pursue careers as physicists in government or industrial laboratories, for careers in engineering and other professional elds, for teaching in public schools, or, for entering advanced programs at the graduate level in Physics, Astronomy or related disciplines (e.g. Medical Physics). Our world renown faculty and state of the art research facilities allow us to provide opportunities for students to engage in hands-on research experiences where they apply their classroom knowledge to real world problems. Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog292 Astronomy, Minor (318) Physics laboratories and classrooms are located on the second floor of Kelly Thompson Hall (KTH), the basement and rst floor of Ogden College Hall (OCH) and the Applied Physics Institute (API, located at the Center for Research and Development). The Hardin Planetarium, located next door to KTH, supports astronomy laboratories and demonstrations for classes, regular focused presentations of astronomy and the physical universe for school groups and the general public. The observatory on top of KTH provides students with convenient access to the department's 12.5 inch Cassegrain reflector and several smaller telescopes and also provides monthly opportunities for public viewing. Faculty make use of the latest research-based physics teaching pedagogies in all our undergraduate classes. Our physics teaching laboratories are equipped with modern laboratory equipment and data acquisition interfaces using software that is standard in the physics and engineering community. Modern laboratory facilities and equipment, rivaling those found at more research focused institutions, allow us to provide student centered research experiences for all Physics majors. The diversity of research engagement possibilities is a major strength of our undergraduate program, allowing students to benet from a breath of available interest and specializations. Undergraduate students are strongly encouraged to participate in research opportunities with faculty members. Individual student research projects may start as early as the sophomore year, supported in most cases by available assistantships and/or formal course credit. The API houses an X-ray diffractometer, neutron generator, Auger spectrometer, Beowulf Computer Cluster, and a Large Chamber Scanning Electron Microscope. The materials science lab houses a micro-Raman spectrometer and a thermal Chemical Vapor Deposition reactor for nano-carbons and other nanomaterials. The laser lab houses a nanosecond IR laser, excimer laser, spectrophotometer, gas chromatography, and ultrahigh vacuum chamber. The department also operates two research grade astronomical telescopes: the local 0.6m Bell Observatory located 12 miles southwest of WKU and the 1.3 meter Robotically Controlled Telescope (RCT) located outside Tuscon, AZ. Both facilities are available for, and in case of Bell Observatory, operated by undergraduate students. Descriptions of current research studies by faculty members and specic research opportunities available to undergraduate students are available on the department's website. The department sponsors a local chapter of the nationally afliated Society of Physics Students (SPS) for students interested in physics, as well as a section of the Sigma Pi Sigma honor society. The local SPS chapter sponsors or participates in a variety of social and service activities related to physics, including eld trips, trips to scientic meetings, tutoring, and interacting with students from area schools. The Hilltopper Astronomy Club provides support for students interested in astronomy both as a hobby and science. Regular observing sessions, informal meetings, and various projects are some of the benets available to members. When planning a program of study in physics, each student should be aware of the University's academic requirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter, \"Academic Information.\" Specic attention should be given to the sub-sections in the chapter entitled (a) Academic Programs, (b) Colonnade Requirements, and (c) Academic Requirements and Regulations. All students, from freshman to seniors, are required to meet with their department academic advisor (Dr. Richard Gelderman for freshman and sophomore level students; juniors and seniors are assigned a department advisor after completion of PHYSICS 321) each semester in order to plan their schedule for the following semester and/or to discuss and plan their career options.Degree Physics, Bachelor of Science (754) (p. 293) Minors Astronomy, Minor (318) (p. 292) Biophysics, Minor (329) (p. 293) Faculty Professor Michael T.

Studying human behavior from a scientic perspective offers numerous opportunities for students. A degree in Psychological Science can open up a wide variety of career options or serve as a foundation for graduate or professional study because, in addition to learning how to understand people, our curriculum emphasizes learning how to collect, analyze, and think critically about data. Our B.S. degree in Psychological Science was designed to meet the American Psychological Association's guidelines for a high quality undergraduate psychology program by offering both the depth and breadth that students need for additional graduate or professional study or in the workplace. One of the most unique aspects of our program is the option to specialize in one of a number of thematic concentrations. Students gain hands-on experiences in lab courses, and they also have outstanding opportunities to collaborate with faculty and other students on a wide range of research topics. Psychological science students explore clinical psychology, neuroscience, cognition, developmental science, social psychology, industrial/organizational psychology, perception, and experimental psychology.

Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog2020-2021-undergraduate.pdf 321 Mission To inspire the discovery and application of knowledge in health and human services. The College of Health and Human Services (CHHS) consists of seven academic units that represent an array of disciplines and offers degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree levels. Academic units include Applied Human Sciences; Communication Sciences and Disorders; Nursing and Allied Health; Kinesiology, Recreation, and Sport; Physical Therapy; Public Health; and Social Work. CHHS oversees the South Central Kentucky Area Health Education Center, the Center for Environmental and Workplace Health, the Center for Applied Science in Health and Aging, and the WKU Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Center. CHHS is also one of the participating institutions for the doctoral program in Rehabilitation Sciences offered through the University of Kentucky. The focus of the CHHS is to provide the highest possible quality of education to prepare our students to become leaders in careers related to health and human services. First year students have the opportunity to enroll directly in a specic major or pre-major program or to enroll in our \"exploratory\" program and investigate the many career options available to them in health and human services. Faculty are highly qualied in their respective disciplines and utilize innovative teaching strategies along with state of the art instructional technology, including IVS, web- enhanced, and web-based instruction. The disciplines in the college have their roots in outreach to the community. Disciplines in CHHS prepare students for their professions by engaging them in activities within the community that apply the theories and concepts discussed in the classroom for a more comprehensive understanding of the issues, while providing a valuable service to the communities in which we reside. To fulll degree requirements for most programs, students are required to complete clinical experiences, eld work, or internships through one of the many afliation agreements at a myriad of health and human services facilities, agencies, and organizations. Due to the nature of these experiences, students are required to meet various departmental or school academic requirements and federal and/ or state mandates. Departments and schools may require the successful completion of specic courses or maintaining a certain GPA in order to be placed in clinical or internship experiences. Some students may be required to undergo criminal background checks and drug testing and to provide proof of health insurance, liability insurance, and/or immunization records prior to participating in any required experiences at selected on or off-campus facilities/agencies. Additionally, there may be certications, training seminars, or other requirements specied by the facility/agency or program that a student must meet in order to be eligible for eld or practical experiences at a facility. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that all institutional and/or facility requirements are met as a condition of participating in the on or off-campus experiences; students may be responsible in part or in full for any costs incurred to meet such requirements. Students are also responsible for transportation to and from off-campus experiences. In some CHHS programs, the students are responsible for rental fees for clinical instruments and supplies, purchasing uniforms, equipment, and possible course and program fees above the regular tuition. At the completion of the program, students may also be responsible for fees related to national, regional, and/or state licensing exams.The CHHS is dedicated to improving the quality of life in the community through education, service, collaboration, leadership, and scholarship. This is accomplished in the various centers and programs in the college that provide for a vibrant and relevant university experience. The following is a brief description of these organizational units. South Central Kentucky Area Health Education Center (AHEC) Connecting Students to Careers - Professionals to Communities - Communities to Better Health Catherine the Kentucky AHEC is to promote healthy communities through innovative educational partnerships. This is accomplished by providing the following educational support services to health professions students and health care providers; community health education; and programs that encourage health professions as a career choice. The South Central AHEC is afliated with the University of Louisville School of Medicine in cooperation with WKU's College of Health and Human Services. Programming for WKU students includes: MCAT Prep Advantage - a program for pre-med students that combines online MCAT prep, shadowing, mock interviews, and personal statement review. Mock interviews and personal statement reviews for all health and pre-health profession students. Student Internships - Undergraduate and graduate AHEC Scholars - is a two year, advanced-learning program which prepares health profession students to be leaders in their eld. Throughout the program, students collaborate across health disciplines and geographic regions as they prepare to practice in the ever evolving healthcare eld. This is a national program conducted by all AHECs and funded by the Health Resources Services Administration. Bridging the Gap Medical Interpreter Training Program - A 40-hour course offered several times a year that prepares students to provide medical interpreting services. WKU-AHEC Student Rural Health Association (SRHA) - A student organization for students interested in rural health. Greenview Shadowing Program - A semester- long program for students interested in shadowing healthcare professionals at the hospital.

Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders Dr.Richard Dressler, Head http://www.wku.edu/communicationdisorders Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD) offers an undergraduate major in Communication Disorders, a graduate degree in Speech-Language Pathology, a minor in American Sign Language, and a Deaf Studies Certicate. Additionally, the pre-SLP program consists of a series of courses that prepare students without an undergraduate degree in Communication Disorders to apply to graduate programs in Speech- Language Pathology. The undergraduate Communication Disorders program provides broad- based instruction to prepare students for graduate study in speech- language pathology, audiology, and related elds. Students who complete the undergraduate program receive a Bachelor's of Science in Communication Disorders and must complete a master's degree to practice speech-language pathology and a Doctorate of Audiology (AuD) to practice audiology. The graduate degree program in Speech-Language Pathology prepares students for the clinical practice of speech-language pathology. A certied speech-language pathologist works with both children and adults to evaluate and diagnose disorders associated with speech, language, cognition, communication, and swallowing. The Speech- Language Pathology graduate program has two cohorts, one offered on the Bowling Green Campus and one distance-learning cohort that isprimarily offered online but with one required summer clinical experience on the Bowling Green Campus. The minor in American Sign Language provides students with communication competency in a visual language and an understanding of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing culture. A Deaf Studies Certicate will broaden a student's knowledge of Deaf and Hard of Hearing individuals, with an emphasis on Deaf Culture. The Deaf Studies Certicate will not qualify students to become licensed interpreters. Students in the pre-SLP program must have an undergraduate degree from a eld other than communication disorders at the time they begin taking courses in the pre-SLP program. The pre-SLP program is a fully online distance-learning program. Students considering a major in Communication Disorders, a graduate program in Speech-Language Pathology, a minor in American Sign Language, a Deaf Studies Certicate, or the pre-SLP program, should contact the appropriate program director for admission timelines, requirements, and advisement.

(Bachelor of Science) education program in Communication Disorders at Western Kentucky University prepares students academically for graduate study in speech-language pathology, audiology, or related areas. A master's degree is required for national certication in speech-language pathology and a clinical doctorate is required for national certication in audiology. Licensure is also necessary in Kentucky but other states have various mandates for practicing professionals. All coursework follows guidelines recommended by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN COMMUNICATION DISORDERS Speech-Language Pathology career opportunities are expected to grow faster than average through the end of calendar year 2022. This is due to several factors including an aging baby boomer population with increased possibilities of oncoming neurological disorders with accompanying speech, language, swallowing, and hearing impairments. Employment opportunities are also increasing due to improving survival rates of premature infants and trauma and stroke patients in need ofassessment and intervention. Additionally, federal legislation guarantees services to all children with disabilities. Private practice opportunities will also increase due to the increase in contracted services with schools, nursing care/rehabilitation facilities and hospitals.

The social work profession grew out of societal concerns about individual and social problems associated with the distribution of resources and opportunities. Today's social workers address social issues related to stresses on individuals, families, groups, organizations and communities. As professionals, social workers give their attention to inequities in the distribution of resources and opportunities and other factors interfering with persons' ability to reach their full potential. The undergraduate social work program depends on a strong liberal arts base and a generalist practice foundation to achieve its mission and goals. The mission of the BSW program at WKU is to prepare culturally competent social workers for practice with diverse communities and client systems. The program promotes a commitment to professional ethics, leadership, professionalism, social justice, and lifelong learning in order for graduates to practice effectively in a global community. For more information regarding the BSW program and its goals, please visit the departmental webpage: http://www.wku.edu/socialwork/bsw (http:// www.wku.edu/socialwork/bsw/).

Study Abroad & Global Learning Honors College and International Center Phone: (270) 745-5334 Email: study.abroad@wku.edu Website: http://www.wku.edu/studyabroad/ The Ofce Abroad & Global Learning (SAGL) serves the WKU community by engaging students, faculty, and staff in diverse educational and cultural experiences through faculty-led, exchange, consortia, and other study abroad opportunities. WKU encourages and supports all students seeking the opportunity to incorporate international academic, professional, and cross- cultural experiences into their education. WKU offers a wide variety of international education opportunities for a range of academic disciplines and budgets. Students can choose to study, intern, volunteer, student teach, or conduct research abroad during any academic term. Students should start planning early in their academic career to ensure the most affordable and academically enriching experience. By working closely with their academic and SAGL advisors and their academicdepartment, students can select a program that seamlessly fullls graduation requirements. When planning a study abroad experience, each student should be aware of the university's academic requirements and regulations contained in this catalog in the chapter \"Academic Information.\" It is recommended that students work closely with their academic departments and the SAGL ofce to carefully select a program that meets their academic needs, fullling specic degree requirements through courses offered on the program. WKU students who participate in a study abroad program may choose to earn an \"Emphasis in Global Studies\" designation, which can be combined with any major, as part of their undergraduate education. For details regarding the requirements, refer to the section about \"Global Studies Designation\" in this catalog or on the SAGL website. Types of Study Abroad Programs WKU students wishing to study in another country have a variety of options from which to choose. These options can be divided into ve major categories: short-term faculty-led programs, international student teaching, exchange programs, WKU partner programs, and provider programs. More detailed information on all study abroad options can be found on the SAGL website, but a brief overview of each type of program follows. WKU Faculty-Led Study Abroad Programs Many WKU students who study abroad do so by taking a course in another country on a program personally led by a WKU faculty member. These courses are typically 1-7 weeks in length and carry 3-6 credit hours, and they generally occur during the winter or summer terms. WKU International Student Teaching Education majors at WKU have the opportunity to spend the nal month of their student teaching semester in another country, teaching classes in English at a partner school. This cross-cultural teaching experience fosters global awareness and helps prepare future teachers for working with diverse student populations. WKU Exchange Programs WKU has formal agreements with more than a dozen institutions of higher education outside the United States. Exchange programs are typically for a semester or an academic year, and they offer students the opportunity to become fully integrated into a foreign university. Shorter-term opportunities exist with some exchange partners. All WKU students spending a semester or year on at an exchange partner pay the in-state tuition rate, making it a great value. WKU Partner Programs WKU has close partnerships with several programs and study abroad consortia including Harlaxton College, Semester at Sea, the Kentucky Institute for International Studies (KIIS), and the Cooperative Center for Study Abroad (CCSA). The two on-campus consortia partners (KIIS and CCSA) offer affordable program options for which students are awarded WKU credit. Several of the courses offered on WKU partner programs are taught by WKU faculty members. Provider Programs WKU has afliation agreements with a variety of study abroad program providers which offer a plethora of short-term, semester, and academic year programs in numerous countries around the world. Students who are unable to nd a program that meets their academic needs through faculty-led, international student teaching, exchange programs, or WKU partner programs can certainly nd good options through afliate providers. Western Kentucky University -- 2020-21 Undergraduate Catalog616 Information Technology Services Financing Study Abroad Scholarships and nancial aid are available for most study abroad programs. Even the most expensive program can be affordable when students use all of the resources available to them. Students who are eligible for nancial aid and/or are receiving scholarships can typically use those awards towards the cost of a study abroad program. The Ofce of Study Abroad and Global Learning, the Student Financial Assistance Ofce, and the Ofce of Scholar Development can help students plan nancially for this important investment in their college education. WKU has created several signicant study abroad scholarships to support WKU students who pursue international opportunities. These scholarships include the World Topper Scholarship and the Enhancing Diversity in Global Education (EDGE) grant. While the World Topper Scholarship is intended to support any WKU student planning to study abroad, on a domestic faculty-led program, or through the National Student Exchange, the EDGE is intended to provide signicant nancial support for diverse students. For more information about these and other scholarship opportunities available through WKU and external organizations, visit the SAGL webpage (https://www.wku.edu/ studyabroad/funding.php).

Student Conduct Policies Conduct Authority Ultimate authority to govern student conduct rests with the University's Board of Regents. The Board of Regents has delegated authority to the President. Subsequently, the University President grants authority to the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Experience to assume responsibility to oversee execution of the Code of Student Conduct. When appropriate, the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Experience may delegate conduct authority to additional University ofcials and committees in keeping with University policies, rules, and regulations. University's Scope Governing Conduct The University's scope to address student conduct extends to on-campus and off-campus settings. Additionally, jurisdiction to address student conduct extends to organizations, covers person-to-person interface, and interactions that occur electronically. Purpose of the Code of Student Conduct WKU developed the Code of Student Conduct to fulll its mission, to ensure an environment conducive to learning, to establish high standards of integrity and conduct, and to safeguard students' personal freedoms. These personal freedoms imply particular student rights andresponsibilities. For more on Student Rights and Responsibilities, please visit: https://www.wku.edu/studentconduct/ Violations of Law and the Code of Student Conduct Students who violate federal, state, or local laws may incur penalties prescribed by civil and criminal authorities. Nevertheless, the University reserves the right to review student incidents independent of action by civil and criminal authorities and to apply the University student conduct process as it serves the educational mission of WKU, a function separate and distinct from civil and criminal proceedings. Academic freedom, constructive criticism, and due process of law depend upon civility of behavior by all members of the University community towards all other persons in all circumstances. The University will not tolerate the use or threat of force, violence, coercion, intimidation, obstruction, duress or disruption by any individual or group. Members of the University community found to be participants in such activities will be subject to immediate disciplinary action. Likewise. appropriate measures will be taken to stop and correct such activities by any non- member of the University community, whatever may be the claimed basis for his/her/their presence on the campus. Following procedures of due process, if the WKU Code of Student Conduct is violated, the responsible parties will go through the University's disciplinary process, which is intended to be a fair and educational experience. Although a student accused of academic or nonacademic misconduct will be granted every consideration, if actions and behaviors of the student are duly found to be detrimental to the University mission, function, property, or wellbeing, the University will apply an appropriate disciplinary outcome. Any WKU student may be expelled, suspended, placed on probation, or given a lesser outcome for one or more violations of the Code of Student Conduct. The Code can be found at www.wku.edu/studentconduct (https://www.wku.edu/studentconduct/student-code-of-conduct.php). Academic Misconduct The University expects students to operate with the highest standards of integrity in all facets of the collegiate experience. Broadly dened, academic misconduct is any unethical self-serving action in the performance of academic work, deliberate or unintentional, that affords a student an unfair, unearned, or undeserved advantage. The maintenance of academic integrity is of fundamental importance to the University. Thus, it should be clearly understood that acts of plagiarism or any other form of cheating will not be tolerated and that anyone committing such acts will be held accountable for violation of the Code of Student Conduct. Students who commit any act of academic dishonesty may receive from the instructor a failing grade in that portion of the course work in which the act is detected or a failing grade in a course without possibility of withdrawal. The faculty member may also present the case to the Ofce of Student Conduct. For more information on Academic Misconduct, visit: www.wku.edu/ studentconduct (http://www.wku.edu/studentconduct/) Conduct Actions/Outcomes for Violations of the Code of Student Conduct Following procedures of due process, when a student is accused of academic or nonacademic misconduct, the alleged policy violator will be required to go through the University's Student Conduct process.

Outcomes may be used independently or in combination depending on the particular circumstance of the violation. Chronic and/or multiple violations during the course of an individual student's college career may increase the severity of outcomes applied. The Ofce of the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Experience, or designee, will make the determination whether allegations are sufciently egregious to warrant consideration of suspension, dismissal, or expulsion.
