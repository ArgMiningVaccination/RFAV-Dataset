On this page What is a hysterectomy? Hysterectomy is an operation to remove your uterus. If you have a hysterectomy, you will no longer have [menstrual periods](/health/conditionsandtreatments/menstrual-cycle) or be able to get [pregnant](/healthyliving/pregnancy). Types of hysterectomy There are different types of hysterectomies: - Total hysterectomy - removal of your uterus and cervix, with your ovaries and fallopian tubes remaining. - Hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy - removal of your uterus, cervix, ovaries and fallopian tubes. - Sub-total hysterectomy - removal of your uterus only, with your ovaries, fallopian tubes and cervix remaining. Your doctor may recommend removal of your fallopian tubes as it might reduce the risk of some [ovarian cancers](/health/conditionsandtreatments/ovarian-cancer) that begin in the tubes. Reasons for having a hysterectomy There are many reasons you might need to have a hysterectomy. For example, if you have: - a condition that causes heavy bleeding - such as [fibroids](/health/conditionsandtreatments/fibroids) - a condition that causes severe pain and discomfort - such as adenomyosis or [endometriosis](/health/conditionsandtreatments/endometriosis) - a [prolapse](/health/conditionsandtreatments/prolapsed-uterus)(weakness of the tissues supporting your uterus and vaginal walls) - chronic [pelvic inflammatory disease](/health/healthyliving/pelvic-inflammatory-disease-pid) - cancer or pre-cancer of your [cervix](/health/conditionsandtreatments/cervical-cancer), [uterus](/health/conditionsandtreatments/uterine-cancer), ovaries or fallopian tubes. You need a doctor's referral You will need a doctor's referral for a [gynaecologist](/health/serviceprofiles/obstetrician-gynaecologist-service) who can do the hysterectomy. Ways to perform a hysterectomy There are different ways to perform a hysterectomy, including: - Laparoscopic - keyhole surgery, performed through small cuts in your abdomen, using a tube with a camera (laparoscope) - Vaginal - the surgery is performed through your vagina - Abdominal - performed via a cut in your lower abdomen. Your doctor will advise which type of hysterectomy is right for you. Risks associated with having a hysterectomy As with any operation, there are some risks associated with having a hysterectomy including: - blood loss - infection - blood clots - a bad reaction to anaesthesia - damage to abdominal organs, such as the bladder, bowel or ureters. Your specialist will explain the risks in more detail. After your hysterectomy Recovery from a hysterectomy will depend on the type of operation you had and your general health before the operation. The average recovery time for a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy is 3 to 4 weeks. For an abdominal hysterectomy, recovery may take 5 to 6 weeks. It's important to look after yourself after your hysterectomy: - Rest as much as possible for at least 2 weeks. - Continue with the exercises you were shown in hospital. - Avoid heavy lifting and stretching. - Drink plenty of fluids and eat fresh fruits and vegetables to avoid [constipation](/health/conditionsandtreatments/constipation). After a hysterectomy, you will no longer have menstrual periods or need [contraception](/health/healthyliving/contraception-choices). If your ovaries were removed, you might start to experience menopausal symptoms within a few days of your surgery. Depending on your situation, your doctor may recommend [menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)](/health/conditionsandtreatments/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt-and-menopause) until the expected age of menopause. MHT will help with menopausal symptoms and reduce potential long-term health risks of [osteoporosis](/health/conditionsandtreatments/osteoporosis) and [cardiovascular disease](/conditionsandtreatments/heart). When to see your doctor There are many things to consider before having a hysterectomy. For example, how the operation might impact your physical and mental health or your plans to have children in the future. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. You can ask your doctor or specialist questions such as: - Why are you recommending a hysterectomy? - Do I have to have a hysterectomy? - What kind of hysterectomy would you recommend and why? - What are the risks? - Will I keep my ovaries? - Should I have my fallopian tubes removed? - How long will I be in hospital for and what should I expect? - How long will it take to recover? - How much will the surgery cost? If you are still unsure, you can see another specialist for a second opinion or more information.
