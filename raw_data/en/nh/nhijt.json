Such a principle will the archetypal stages of child development and always hold good, at least as long as Waldorf lasts. attributes so much of its practice and its success to For example, at age c.6-8 the experience of water the seriousness with which it takes this aspect of colour ('painting' in the curriculum) is best gained, education into account; while, on the other hand, it Steiner encouraged, via a colour story. This has stresses its oveniding aim ofsupporting each child been beautifully demonstrated recently in the in realising the full potential of his or her own article 'Colour Stories' by Veronica \"You can't haveEducation vol. 33 no. 2, in which she recounted your cake and eat it.\" But if we interpret the adage s t o r i e s s h e t o l d i n C l a s s e s 1 a n d 2 .

M . 2 3Did We Mean Them to Become the Jesters? by ANN SWAIN Is ihere more dyslexia nowadays, or are we just more aware ol it than we used to be?\" This is one of the most commonly asked questions I receive as a Learning Support teacher and one w h o s e a n s w e r s e e m s t o c h a n g e a s m y u n d e r s t a n d i n g of dyslexia changes. it one is dening dyslexia as a pathology, a learning disability, where those who are affected master skills of symbolic language, (writing, reading, speaking) only to a poor standard and with tremendous difculty, then there is a greater prevalence of this condition in today's classrooms than generations ago. But when we dene it thus, must we not take a great portion of responsibility for its increase? In the last hundred and fty years, and in predominately industrialised societies, edu cational expectations have changed. W e now expect ail schoolchildren to attain prociency in particular and valued, albeit highly specialised, subjects. These requirements are placed on every child regardless of their gender, individual inclinations, gifts or weaknesses. Whether their destiny calls them to be farmers, social workers, jewellers, research scientists or story tellers, we educate them all by the same means, expecting the same degree of competence in the same elds. While this value of equality has made education available to many who may not have had the privilege in the past, it has also had a deleterious effect on those children who may require other skills for their lives, or who may perceive the world in a fuller. 3-D wholeness than ilie predominantly linearand language-based methods employed in classrooms. The fact that we expect all our school leavers to be fluent in reading, writing and computer technology, compounded by the fact that wc measure this prociency by such narrow means, leaves little room for the genius of the dyslexic childto be experienced as anything other than a humiliating handicap. Many adult dyslexics report having spent their time in formal education in a constant state of shame. Without knowing why they weren'tachieving, they began to hone the skills ofavoidance\u2014evading being exposed by teachers or peers, exposure that was certain to bring nothing but humiliation. One dyslexic of fers teachers insight by sharing his experiences of school. 1 would try to compensate where possible by absorbing information in other forms, but mostly, as the pressure began to build. 1 had to tall back on evasion, cheating and deceit. Another child who had difculty leiu'nlng the material presented by her teacher nevertheless learnt a great deal in school which would stand her in good stead in later life. She learnt to cover up her struggles and her misunderstandings in a way familiar to all teachers, although few are able to read it in its truth. She learnt to overreact and play the role ofthe class clown. The same boys and girls, who the previous year had laughed at the freak, were now laughing with the jester. If we re-evaluale our denition of dyslexia to encompass a wider, less pathology-based bias, thenperhaps the opening question, as to whether there is more dyslexia today, would be answered differently. Perhaps the answer to that question is ruefully, \"There aren't enough dyslexics and we aregreatly responsible.\" Neuroanaiomic research has presented remarkable ndings regarding the brains of dyslexics. Where most skulls house two asymmetrical hemispheres (the left lobe being usually considerably larger than the right), the dyslexic subjects' brains presented two hemispheres that were approximately equal in size. A l b e r t G a l a b u r d a a n d a s s o c i a t e s a t H a r \\ ' a r d Medical School found the symmetrical brains of his dyslexic subjects failed to lose as many neurons and \"failed to prune down the number of connections between neurons and between hemispheres\". Thisdifference predisposes one to less specialised and perhaps less reliable means of carrying out tasks, but allows heightened creativity, more mobility in performing cognitive tasks, ability to perceiveholistically as well as greater innovativeness and vibrant, imaginative capabilities. The known great dyslexic personalities, such as Einstein. Faraday. T esla, Rodin. Picasso and T wain, may actually have been great because of their dyslexia, rather than in spite of it! \"We are thus brought to the apparentlyparadoxical notions that the very same anomalies...that have led to the disability of dyslexia in certain literate societies, also determine superiority in some brains. We can, thus, speak of a pnlhology of superiority' without fear of being contradictory!\" What then is a Steiner Waldorf special needs teacher and how does our work manifest within the context of the mainstream school? An essential rst step lies in correctly assessing any children who may not be thriving within the group context. By failing to recognise learning differences, teachers run the risk of continually leading certain children towards failure every moment of the school day. Their frustration with their own powerlessness to grasp what their peers seem to understand easily can build and become a hugely destructive force. A sobering research project conducted in a young men's detention centre in Scotland, found that, in contrast to the usual 10-15% incidence of dyslexia within the 'normar population, there was a53% rate within the very specic population of young male offenders. These men described their frustration ofFour-fokl syntmelry: form drawing helps to hitegnUe the child's relation to space and to himself in space.

Being intelligent, resourceful, but tragically unguided. they found challenges and respect were to be found outside the law. By identifying children with speciali.sed needs, o u r i n t e n t , a s S t e i n e r Waldorf learning support teachers, is to meet them, their genius and difculty,before they erroneously a s s e s s t h e m . s e l v e s a s stupid or unable. One fourteen-year-old arrived for his les,son with me after being assessed by aneducational psychologist the week before. In his characteristically exuberant way he entered the room and declared, \"She says I'm dyslexic, 1 always thought 1 was thick!\" What a relief that label was for him. He could begin to appreciate that he could learn. At Michael Hall children are regularly screened for possible learning differences. Towards the end of Class 2 all the children make a journey through their classroom, over mountains, across rivers, through various trials and triumphs. At this time we can assess the degree to which they have co-ordinated their movement, the strength of their balance, laterality, memory for sequences and forms, sound discrimination and any compensatory strategies which may already be in place. We recognise that the foundations of literacy are in fact the ABCs, but we translate that into, Attention, Balance, Co-ordination. Without a sounds basis in t h e s e , w e a s k t h e c h i l d r e n t o d o a l m o s t t h e impossible if we expect them to sit still, attend to seemingly abstract and meaningless sounds and symbols, and be able to remember them tomorrow. Class 4 is presented with another forrri of class- wide a.ssessment. Here, by looking at the child's performance in purely literacy tasks, we can see where those with learning differences continue to struggle and where they present as being in need of 45individual lessons. There are limes when perhaps Ihe need for a irip lo the oplonielrist is indicated; or we are fortunate to have the T oniaiis Centre nearby in Lewes, where we can refer children for a full listening assessment. A simple solution is sometimes ea.sy to bring about, but without the full class screenings a child could be struggling alone. Further class screenings are more for the sake of assessing progress than determining which children have special needs, until the pupils prepare for their GCSEs and through an assessment they may be granted special exam provisions. Once a child has been assessed it is often seen that one to one learning support lessons are recommended. Steiner Waldorf learning support is not about coaching in literacy and numeracy. Were it that we would most likely be compounding the Irustration these children experience. It is to do with nding out how these children perceive their world and tailoring the lessons to their ptulicuUu\" language of learning. Anthroposophy describes how the child spends roughly its rst 6-7 years building up and permeating its physical body. By the time the child enters Class 1 she has entered fully into her body, moved into every nook and cranny, grown acquainted and adept with movement in the physical world. If this progression, which moves from head to toe, has been complete, all that went into building capacities of movement is no longer needed for that purpose. Those forces are now liberated to be used to develop cognitive faculties of imagination, logical thinking and memory. In some cases of dyslexia, children present as not being at home in their bodies. Traits of infancy linger on and interfere with the child's ability to focus on the more cognitive tasks that are demanded of them in school. The rst four senses, namely touch (tactile), movement (proprioception/kinaesthetic sense), balance (vestibular), and life (visceral) remain poorly developed and must be tuned and integrated before we can expect these children to master the tools of symbolic language and numeracy. Alleducators know the importance of multi-sensory teaching. For children with specic learning differences it is even more essential. Tools we have, such as form drawing and movement exercises, help the child nd her place in space, between right and left, behind and before, above and below. A lesson that focuses on feeding the child's senses ofmovement, touch, seeing, hearing, and even taste, while tuning her balance will make the task of acquiring all the many skills of literacy (speech, sequential expression, articulation, handwriting, spelling, punctuation, reading etc.) something thechild can have condence in. The particular relationship that arise.s between the special needs teacher and the child is an exceptional one. and one in which the child's sen,se of self worth and sense of belonging to this, sometimes exu-emely , confusing world can grow strong and can, in turn, open new ways of beholding for the child. She can learn how she learns, and eventually lake hold of capacities herself. She can learn how to anticipate those moments of confusion; she can learn lo keep her balance. She can begin to perceive the gifts she possesses as strengths and learn to rely on her powers of creative thinking without any longer having, as her only voice, the voice of the jester.

Gloucestershire. Prior to this, however, much groundwork hud been done by the Parent Steering Group and the dedicated group of young people who showed enthusiasm tmd deteniiinalion lo become pioneers in a new Ibnii of education. Members of the steering group which fomied share a common background as teachers within the Waldorf school movement both here and abroad. They also share a common desire to look at new ways of working with the Waldorf curriculum outside the Waldorf school. There is a signicant group of Waldorf students from age 16 onwards who no longer feel comfortablewithin the Upper School selling. This is a world wide phenomenon which raises a question worth a.sking. Is it linked to the compromises which need to be made lo the Waldorf curriculum in order to meet the extemal examinations for university entrance? The young people ask that we recognise their changing needs in a changing world. They also ask for a new relationship to their tutors, one which goes furtlier in recognising A modelling .session at the La determination. The Waldorl\"College Project formed us a re.search project which has the freedom of being outside an established school structure. U hopes to research the question of the educational needs of young people between the ages of 16 and 19 in a way which can be shared and thus further the development of Waldorf education into the 2lsi century. It wa.s fell that a 'college' style of education would best suit this project. The site available was ideal in a beautiful Luid prominent building, Tlie Centre for Science and Art. which was already housing a number of initiatives for adult education. Prior lo the commencement of the College the group engaged a local facilitator to lead them in a series of Search Conference workshops in which adults and students worked creatively together developing the college idea. The process engaged them in the creation of two imaginative pictures. 1 / Our desired future\u2014how would we like to see the world in 7 years? 2/The probable future\u2014what we're likely to see in 7 years. From the desired future picture the group was then able to work backwards. The question was asked: What capacities tuid skills would one need in order to create such a future? From there it was possible for the steering group and the student group lo work together, creating an educational facility to develop llie capacities and skills the young people had themselves decided they needed. As an adult involved in this proce.ss I felt continually impressed by the insight and wisdom which shone through the young people. It conrmed for me that we had the potential for a successful and .signicant research into new ways of engaging young people in their own education. This is the key. Student^ n e e d t o ' o w n ' t h e i r e d u c a t i o n a l p r o c e s s . expressed this as having the freedom to take upresponsibility. They also realised that they needed courage to go forward into creating an education which doesn't yet exist. The truth is that in this step there is much which is already deeply educational. Their will has been red. 67They already liad a coiiviciion ihey iire capable of making a difference, lliey can lake their part in ci-eating ihe future. In fact some of the identied capacities and skills were already emerging. The students have been documenting this experience of the creation of the college, as an ongoing project. This will no doubt be invaluable research material for other educational initiatives whilst also becoming a part of the student prole, a record of the work done at College. The students work on thematic projects which take up the subject to be explored experientiaily luid practically . The thought processes are engaged during the daily reflection and the written documentation which accompanies the project work. The college is working together with the Open College Network (OCN) developing criteria to accompany each project which will provide an important accreditation route to higher education in the future. This gives the college the advantage of accrediting its own curriculum without sacricing time to an examination system. Ongoing literacy and numeracy skills lessons also take place along with a craft programme which continues as a backbone within the structure of the changing thematic projects. There is a weekly reviewsession which provides the necessary forum for communication between tutors and students. Students also conduct their own meetings to address social, domestic and management issues. Learning life skills through participatory management Another of the fundamental concepts within the college is that of a participatory management structure where students learn through rst-hand experience how to problem solve, chair a meeting, handle nances, accounting and budgeting, plan study courses and be mindful of cleaning and maintaining the space. Apart from the obvious skills gained in t h e s e a c t i v i t i e s i t c o n t r i b u t e s t o t h e s e n s e o f empowerment and ownership of learning. As co- creators of their college it immediately shifts the responsibility into a shared one. The students soon realised this places greater demands and challenges to their maturity and a level needed to be found which d i d n ' t o v e r e s t i m a t e t h e i r a b i l i t i e s . S k i l l s i n communication and human relations are highlighted.However their self esteem is strong as they work in an environment where their views are listened to and incorporated into the college. The Waldorf College FYoject has made a positive start. As in any new venture it is necessary to constantly review and adjust according to the experience of what works. The student group in thisrst year have all previously been Waldorf school students. Naturally this means there is a good foundation in developing a course which requires a high level of self determination and a creative will to work. How does the college work with the Waldorf curriculum, one might ask? Whilst it is tme that the relationship to the existing Waldorf curriculum is a freely interpreted one, it does exist. Whereas not every subject will be covered which one encounters in a school, particular themes can be identied a.s fundamental to this age (years 1 1 and 12). T ake the Parsifal theme, where it is quite possible to work this story experientiaily\u2014say through .story telling. It also can be found to be underlying the year. The students are encouraged to identify and develop their learningquest and take up an individual project which involves learning to research. The freedom to choose the topicthey wish to follow gives the opportunity for them to d e e p l y e n g a i > e t h e i r w i l l i n a s u i 5 j e c t t h e y l o v e . The college is fortunate to have a co-ordinating tutor with a strong background in teaching in the Upper School and a deep commitment to the experiential approach to education. As the only full- time staff member his role is to co-ordinate the part- time tutors and incoming project leaders, ensuring there is integration across the multi-disciplinary contributions to a project. Thematic projects The muUi-disciplimuy approach is taken in allthematic projects. For example, a project based on chemistry works with the connections between chemistry and music through the number relationship between atomic weights tmd the musical intervals. By working the scientic and the artistic together, the project topic is enlivened and the living connections between all things become apparent. Another project combined the appreciation and writing of poetry with the making of dramatic masks. The mask-making opened the way to a theme of personal identity. Our experience has shown the students are engaged with a healthy enthusiasm when the craft work, art, drama or music are integrated in a related way to thematic projects. Another important principle is developing sustainable culture which is one of the tenets in the college curriculum, Journeying In the Spring term the students will take a journey into the Sinai Desert. This is a landscape of astonishing colour and dramatic form in which remarkable .stories have taken place. It is the land of the Buming Bush, The Exodus and The Tablets of Stone.Thi.s journey provides an opportunity to study three world religions. Mohammed, Moses and Christ lived and journeyed in the wilderness in this part of the world. Prior to the actual journey, a study of comparative religion will combine with artistic work in the crafts of stained glass and mosaic. Further siudie.s will include history of the Middle East and survival skills. Here again we can link to the underlying theme of the grail which involves both outer and inner journeying. We won't need to 'teach' this link: it will arise as a natural outcome of the experiences of the journey. It will probably be more important to give space to allow their own questioning to reverberate as they u-avel with the traditionally nomadic Bedouin people, sleep on Mt. Sinai and arise before sunrise to climb down the mountain to attend a service in St Catherine's Monastery in the desert. The students have undertaken to nd paid work to raise the funds for this trip. Nehvorking the local and the global The project tutors will often be professionals who are active in their eld. Their teaching comes directly from a contemporary and practical application of a subject. The students benet from working with someone whose source of inspiration comes from years of working in a particular eld. It enables the college to network the talent in the local community. Aschool is comparatively more self-contained within its community. The college also invites visiting overseas lecturersStudents amongst the awe-inspiring landscape of the Sinai. and professionals in to conduct workshops when the opportunity arises. A visiting leading French scientist, for example, shared the story of his research into the 'memory of water'. This process involved the homeopathic imprinting of conventional drugs and showed results which were highly controversial revelations to the scientic community and the dmg companies. He spoke as an ethical scientist who stood rm against ostracizalion by those who didn't want these results known. Networking the local and the global is one of the keys which brings a dynamic, contemporary element into the work of the college. The suiicture of the college includes this flow in and out between the centre (student) and the periphery (community). The education is not in isolation from the world but has an ongoing lively flow built through the eld of work. Amanda Labron is a member ofthe steering group for the Waldoif College Project.

If so, can you remember what you were thinking about the last time you got in and drove off? \u2014what you needed f r o m t h e s u p e r m a r k e t , t h e n i s h i n g t o u c h e s t o y o u r lesson plan, some family matter? What you were not thinking about, I'd wager, was the actual mechanicsof what you were doing\u2014co-ordinating hand and foot to change gear, synchronising the feet to come to a stop, the degree of turn needed to negotiate the bend, all the minutiae of getting from A to B in a car . Now think back to your rst driving lesson. Do you recall what was uppermost in your mind? Not the bank manager , or who would win the 4 o'clock, or whether you'd remembered to pay the milkman. Your mind was one hundred percent focused on hands and feet and the new procedures of driving. On movement. Between that rst lesson and now there is a vast difference in the ratio of movement to awareness while you drive. By now you have attained a high degree of automaticity; you can drive without thinking about it. This is mastery of movement for a particular task. Put as a formula, we could say: mastery of movement = skill. This allusion to learning to drive is an example in miniature of the process involved in the mastery of all movement, or all skill. On the greater scale of full human development, movement is the basis of almost all other development. Steiner names the three great achievements of early childhood as walking, speaking and thinking. I take 'walking' here to be a kind of abbreviated term for a breathtaking array of more foundational and primary movement developments that must be mastered before walking is possible. These developments move from head to foot. At rst the infant is a sea of instinctive unskilled movement\u2014 the tight-sted little arms flailing haphazardly, the weightless legs kicking and prodding the air, facial muscles moving through a random repertoire of expressions. Gradually, this changes. The child gains control of eye muscles and directs its gaze, the neck muscles are mastered and the child can turn and then lifts its head, gradually the arms can reach out and the hands grasp things. The child sits, crawls, stands, balances, and nally walks. This process has gone in two directions: from head to foot, and from the centre to the nger- and toe-tips (the so-called cephalo-caudal and proximo-distalprinciples), and walking is the end achievement. Wec o u l d s a y t h a t ' w a l k i n g ' d e n o t e s a c e r t a i n d e g r e e o f maturation of the gross motor (or large-limb) development. This initial body of gross motor skills is further elaborated and rened. The ner movements of ngers and toes (the 'tips') are worked on. Nuances of feeling now flit expressively across the facial muscles, and the delicate and subtle movements of speech from larynx to lip are mastered. Steiner's term 'speaking' is again a kind of shorthand for this wider development of the ne lacework of movement, the so-called ne-motor control, which culminates in speech. Walking and speaking are the developmentalbasis for thinking. 'Thinking' here, from a pedagogical point of view, can be said to be learning at school. The class-one child is only ready forthinking if its 'walking' and 'speaking' phases have been fully and soundly traversed. Closely interwoven with this motor developmentis a sensory development. In the very young child this also follows a foundational progression. As one researcher puts it: \"...the motor system has developed a certain body of information before the perceptual system begins its course of development. The motor system is not complete in its development, but an initial body of information has begun to be built up.\"' As the child incarnates and takes hold of its body , it is not surprising that the rst senses to come into play here are the 'bodily' senses, the senses of touch, movement (or kinaesthetic sense) and of the well-being or otherwise of the body's physiological life processes. Later the sense of sight and sound are integrated. \"Perceptual learnings thus come to depend upon prior motor learnings as a foundation.\"' It is important to note that this perceptual and kinaesthetic development needs to come to a certain maturity before formal learning can take place healthily . Another researcher states what has always been known in Steiner education: \"Sensory-motor interaction provides the groundwork for later cognitive functions. It may look as though the childat play is not learning anything, but actually he is learning something very basic, he is learning how to^ learn.\"' It is therefore very important that this 'sensory-motor' phase be allowed to complete itself without interference\u2014interference being any kindof formal teaching. Motor development closely allied to sensory development forms and conguresthe brain and prepares it for 'thinking'. \"Asking the kindergarten child to leam reading before his brain is ready for this task will not only be unproductive, but also take the child away from sensory-motor activities that his brain needs now in order to leam reading at a later age.\"(! y The child requires at least six years to complete the sensory-motor phase, the outward sign of which is the change of teeth. At birth the child has a new body full of inherited tendencies which must be overcome to a certain extent in order to make the bodily vehicle as good an expression of the child's individuality and intentions as possible. The muscles must be mastered and the organs subtly sculpted to the individual blueprint. This is anenormous task requiring a huge input of albeit unconscious vital energy. Subjecting the child to formal teaching in this phase siphons that vital energy away from all-important 'body-work' to mental work, leaving the sensory-motor system and the intemal organs incompletely developed and weakly founded. Surely this is child abuse of the rst order! Problems in motor development can also lead to leaming difculties'of various kinds. When one looks into a situation of a child with specic leaming difculties of a dyslexic or arithmetic type, one almost invariably nds a movement problem. Parents are often surprised about this: \"But he is such a wizard on the sports eld.\" The child canindeed be very able at sports, but that is not the typeof movement in question. Ask that child, for example, to hop along a hopscotch track, or in a sequence of right foot, right foot, left foot, right, right, left etc. and they will get confused. Ask them to step and clap in a certain sequence (e.g. 1 clap, 6 steps, 2 claps, 5 steps, 3 claps, 4 steps etc.) and they can lose the sequence almost immediately. A good deal of this has to do with sequencing, but all sequence is movement in time and/or space. This serves to underline the importance of a solid kinaesthetic base for healthy leaming. Traditionally children built up their movement skills by playing games of mnning, climbing, balancing, hopping, skipping, aiming, throwing, and catching\u2014ranging from the large movement level of hopping and ball games, to ne motor skills such as marbles and cat's cradle. Also, physical work at home, indoors and out, contributed to these skills. In our civilisation where we travel on an unprecedented scale, we paradoxically move much less. Locked into computer games, slumped in front of the TV, taken everywhere by car, much of theirmanual work done by machines, appliances and gadgets of all kinds requiring no more dexterity than the pushing of a button, children too move a greatdeal less. The consequences of this are encountered in the classroom. An experienced teacher once told me that in his rst class he had twenty healthy children and fourwith leaming difculties. In his second class he had four healthy children and twenty with leaming difculties. There are obviously any number of factors that play into this, and movement, or more precisely the healthy and complete development of the motor-sensory phase, is a major one. This is particularly emphasised by Steiner in connection w i t h d i f c u l t i e s i n a r i t h m e t i c : \" T h e b a s i s o f arithmetic is one's own will-lled movement, the sense of movement.\"' It is probably accurate, and certainly would do no harm to assume that children who come to Waldorf schools in Class 1 nowadays do not have a illy completed sensory-motor phase. All tme education needs to be therapeutic, and movement can be a particularly efcacious remedy in the classroom. Movement exercise can be used to improve the child's body image, handwriting, ability at arithmetic, even to conceptualise. All the children would benet. So what can one do? The following are some movement exercises I have found to be effective and workable in a classroom situation with classes ranging from Class 1 to Class 4. They cover a range of motor skills, and include body image and spatial development. They are just a few suggestions; the possibilities are endless. For gross motor Stepping and clapping in a variety of sequences. In Class 1 this could be used in leaming the^ables e.g. to step while counting up to 30. Step on every number but also clap the multiples of 3. Variation 1: only say the multiples of 3 aloud. Inwardly the children count every number, but outwardly you hear: step, step 'three!', step, step 'six!', step, step 'nine!' etc. Variation 2: say all the numbers exceptthe multiples of three. Other variations: stand on the clapping numbers i.e. come to a stop for that one number (this has a strong awakening effect); take a st^ backwards on the multiples of 3. In Class 2 you can step to, say, the count of 4 and clap on the 1, then on the 2, then on the 3, then on the 4, then the 1 again and so on but so that the underlined numbers are clapped: 123 4; 123 4; 123 4; 1234 etc. This canbe increased to a sequence of seven numbers in 10 11Moveiucni in morning ring time in the Kindergnrien. Riga (left). C l a s s 3 a n d s i m i l a r v a r i a t i o n s i n t r o d u c e d . Even more complicated is a sequence that transforms 7 steps into 7 claps (on the spot i.e. not stepping) and b a c k a g a i n ( n o n - u n d e r l i n e d n u m b e r s a r e steps, underlined numbersare claps): 1 234567:12 34567;i234567:and so on until you get to seven claps (1 2 3 4 5 6 71: now back again with six claps and one step 1 2 3 4 5 6 7: and so on until you areback at seven steps again. Such exercises are very e f f e c t i v e f o r c o n c e n t r a t i o n ! A s a v a r i a t i o n , instead of or as well as clapping, the children step backwards on the \"clap' places. Holding rods or beanbags, move the rod in front of the body for forward steps and behind the body for backward steps. As the teacher, tap out the beat with two sticks, on a tambourine or whatever. For children who nd this very difcult it is good to break the exercise into bite-size portions. Stop themat the end of each seven-sequence and ask them to tell you what comes next. When they are clear letDuring 'creativeplay'exenising balance, one of the so-called bodily .sense.s (centre). Photos: Ligita Gaile. them do it, and stop them again, ask them for the next sequence, and so on. This stopping has an awakening effect, but it is only preparatory, the goal is that they should e v e n t u a l l y d o i t without stopping. Walking a triangle Starting with one child at each comer of the triangle, the c h i l d r e n w a l k t h e form to the count of three, taking two steps on 1 and 2 and then a jump on 3 to the end-point and turn ready for the next side. This can then be done to the 3-times t a b l e , m u m o n t h e rst two steps and calling out the multiple of 3 on the jump. Depending on space, two or three triangles can be done at once, thus involving six or nine children at a time. The same can be done on a square, four children at a time, with tliree steps and a jump,using the 4-times table. An older class could also walk a pentagram. Chinese skipping An old playground game, jumping over two parallel lengths of knicker elastic xed around the ankles oftwo friends\u2014or chair legs. Children jump from side to side, land with both feel inside, both feet outside, turn about, and both teet on the elastic. We used a rhyme that starts Ingle angle .silver bangle... With enough elastic and some children acting as elastic anchors, the whole class is engaged. After a successful completion of the sequence the elastic is raised a little higher. Beanbags These are wonderful for learning all sorts of .sequences such as days of the week, months, tables. The bag can be passed round one's own waist, over the head, under a leg, to a partner, in front of one or a neighbour at the side. Children can stand in two concentric circles, the inner circle facing out. outer circle facing in and everyone thus facing a partner. A sequence is done, then everyone takes a step to the right to a new partner, and the sequence is repeated. Two favourite exercises went as follows: 1) Children in two concentric circles as described above, each facing a partner. The person opposite is the partner, the person on one's right is the neighbour. This involves giving and receiving, and the partners change after each sequence.the sun sees me. ) I see the moon. ) Movements/Actions \u2014With right hand pass beanbag into partner's left hand, holding your own hand out to receive. \u2014Pass beanbag from your LH pass over your head and give to LH. at the same time stepping with right foot to the right. \u2014Lower LH and pass beanbag from your LH to your RH, bringingleft foot together with right foot\u2014at which point you should be facing a new partner. 2) The same positions as for the above exercise: I see the sun, ) For every T and 'me' theRhyme Partner good morning: Neighbour good day. Partner good morning: We'll up and away.beanbag goes round the waist: For each 'sun', \"moon' and 'star\" the beanbag goes over the head. For both times that 'you' is said, the beanbag is passed to partner. the moon sees me.) 1 see my star, ) my star sees me. ) 1 s e e y o u , ) and you see me. ) Drawing with the feet Simple forms such as semicircles, circles andtriangles. This can be done with a penci 1 between the Rodexetvises: before andafterlettinggoandcatchingthe rod in 'the waterfall'\u2014see article on p. 19. 12 13toes on paper taped to a board, or with a stick in a smoothed sandpit. Steiner recommends this especially for poor handwriting: \"It would be enough if one got the children who have bad handwriting to draw very simple forms with their feet. This works back powerfully on the head.\"^ Folk dancing This can be done very simply , the desks having been pushed back or stacked, just with singing and a tambourine, or with a recorder. By Class 3, the children can learn new dances just from hearing them called i.e. 'right-hand star', 'promenade your partner', 'do-si-do'your partner etc. F o r n e m o t o r Finger games and exercises of all descriptions. Let the diildren tap the thumb with each nger threetimes each, then twice, then once. Do left, and right hand, both hands, with eyes shut, with hand behind the back. Let them slide their thumbs around each nger a few times as though unwinding animaginary thread around the nger. This is best done rhythmically, at different tempi, also with eyes shut. Use traditional rhymes or, best of all, nd appropriate images and make up a rhyme for it. A sequence of cat's cradle done to something like incy wincy spider, climbing up the spout could do the trick! Finger puppet sequences and dances done to music or rhyme. Body image For children who are weak conceptually, Steiner gave body image exercises: \"...basic exercise so that they must think by means of their own body. With your right middle nger touch your left shoulder. They must think these things through by means of their own body.\" This can be done quite simply with Class 1. \"With your right hand touch your leftankle,\" and become more complicated e.g. \"With the knuckle of your right index nger touch your right earlobe.\" This exercise can nish with a game of Simon Says. Spatial orientation This can be done on a large scale in a cleared space, or just behind the desks. Say: \"Turn to the left and take one step backwards,\" or \"Take one step to the right and turn left twice.\" One can increase the number of instructions so that it also becomes a memory exercise. For the young children it is often not clear that once they have turned left they now have a new left. When you're facing the board, 'left' is the wall side, but when you've turned to the wall.'left' is now the window side. They have to grasp 'left' from their own body orientation. The 'floor circles' described in Dafydd Grifths' article in Steiner Education vol. 34 no. 1 would also work excellently in this area.' Such exercises are inordinately difcult to describe and even harder to visualise from the written word. But three principles can be helpful to follow . Firstly , begin gross and get ner . Secondly , accompany the movement as much as possible with rhythm i.e. use short rhymes and poems or the times- tables, which the children recite while moving, or tap a tambourine or two sticks together. (Getting the children to speak the rhymes helps to get the movement more into the unconscious and 'skilled' level. Almost invariably it is the children with difculties who tend to stop speaking.) And thirdly , a good eurythmy therapy principle: get fast slowly, then slow down quickly. Finish on a slow, peaceful note. Such exercises harmonise the children and prepare them for the lesson. They can also help to counteract the forces of inertia that are so palpable in our technied, mechanised, digitalised society.These forces are harmful but necessary . Indeed, in many ways we can be grateful for them. But they are most harmful in the young child whose development is subtly lamed by them if they are not counteracted. The strongest means at our disposal for this counteraction is art in all its forms, and in the younger primary (Lower School) child, so alive in its limbs, artistic movement (be it as movement games, rhythmic movement, dancing or, most powerfully, eurythmy) is a vital component in a modem art of education.

I found myself sucked into situations with one child and then another, and 1 would spend endless time in preparation at night thinking of these particular children. The more 1 tried to concentrate on the individuals and tried to 'solve' problems, the more little individuals reared their heads and demanded my undivided attention. I was losing the class. 1 needed to nd a way to address the class as a whole while giving each individual child the sense that they were being recognised. A colleague suggested that 1 look at the children's temperaments and that 1 consciously address each temperament group in some individual way every day, even better every lesson. Why the temperaments? As some of the readers may already know, Rudolf Steiner gave many indications, to teachers especially, about the four temperaments which can be observed in children. In the 2nd Chapter of his Discussions with Teachers, Steiner responds to a question about a drawing lesson, with the following: \"Here our work of individualising begins. We have said that we can divide the children according to temperament. In the larger groups the children can all take part in the general drawing lesson, but by dividing them up into smaller groups we can individualise to some extent... You will be able to differentiate by your choice of forms, by taking forms with straight lines.\" A knowledge of the children's temperaments will enable the teacher to learn how to teach the individual child. Another quote from the same publication (p. 12) w i l l r e m i n d u s w h a t t h e s e d i f f e r e n c e s i n t h e temperaments are based on: In Spiritual Science we consider the human being from various points of view [particularly] the ego, astral body, etheric body and physical body. Now in an ideal man the harmony predestined by the cosmic plan could quite naturally hold sway between these four principles of the human being. But in reality this is not the case with any one person. From this it can be seen that the human being, when he is given over to the physical plane, is not really complete, but that education and teaching would serve to make a complete man of him One of the four elements preponderates in each child, and education and teaching must bring about the harmonising of these four principles. If the ego preponderates... [in the child], we have the melancholic temperament. If the astral body preponderates, we have the choleric temperament. If the etheric preponderates, we have the sanguine temperament. If the physical body preponderates, we have the phlegmatic temperament. Frequently there is more than one temperament within one person. Most people share a bit of all four. And it is important to keep this in mind when we focus on each temperament at a time for the sake of clarity. It is still helpful to observe whether a child has a dominant temperament, for this will show his or her particular tendency to one-sidedness. Having taught for some years and having had many interesting talks with colleagues I think it is important to say at this point, that in the 21st century this working with temperaments and identifying of children's temperaments is much more difcult Aan when I started teaching. The influences on the children which affect their behaviour and even their physical body\u2014such as bad diet, overdose of media, lack of rhythm in their daily lives, even maybe different beginnings of life\u2014cloud the picture we try to make. Nevertheless, although coming to simple conclusions may be more arduous nowadays, careful observation will eventually highlight one particular aspect of a child which can be helped through his/her temperament being addressed. There are many publications, some by Steiner and others by teachers who have worked with the temperaments in their own particular eld. Notwishing to repeat all that has been said and can be 14 15found in these excellent Liooks (see Bibliogtaphy). 1 will endeavour to try and give a useful foundation on which any beginner can sttirt to build. The most important aspect to remember is that this knowledge of the temperament must be a developing wisdom and become an instinctive\" tool in the activity of teaching. Applying it as dogma will end with the child not responding to a constricting label: m fact children often rebel under the yoke of dogmatic teaching. Working with the temperaments in story-telling Children from different temperaments can help each other to complete a picture. The teacher'.s role is to give the children the possibility to reflect back to the others their experience of a story . But before this the children need to feel that the teacher has prepared the lesson with them in mind. The children wait expectantly maybe in complete silence, but their inner being is reaching out for the beam which is justfor them, the colour that speaks to their soul, it envelops them in a feeling of warmth of recognition and is the beginning of their process of transformation of the content given by the teacher. This process is one of individualising and transforming the content into new skills. Steiner also recommends that we allow children of the same temperament to influence each other in order to lone down their temperament e.g. by sitting them together in the classroom. In Discussions with Teachers Steiner\"s work with the teachers on the art of story telling is described and there he pays particular attention to the different ways language can be used to involve children from all four temperaments. negative cliches about a temperament, it is my experience that talking about food need not appeal simply to the greedy aspect of a child, but can be used to bring out the importance of feeling well in one\"s physical body, and especially how it may, in this case, influence the outcome of a battle. In the story it may also be possibleto describe how well the parentsof the tribe were looking after the young ones who were scared of the noise and the preparation for Contrasting temperaments coming to expression in Class 3 weaving.In a summary we could say that the following areas can be varied according to the temperament you are addressing: \" The content of the story The pilch of the voice The rhytlim of the speech The speed of the telling The gestures accompanying the telling The content of the storyThe choice of a particular story may be made with one particular temperament in mind. In Class 3 you are telling the story of David and Goliath and many cholerics sit up expectantly at the thought of this battle. They admire David's fearlessness. Tliey show little compassion for the defeated. They sympathise with that particular way of solving problems. They wish that teachers and parents would allow them to ght to solve their problems. Most children of this age love this story , and there is plenty of scope for retelling and acting this out the next day. The sanguines in the front of the class will be quite restless in their excitement and the teacher can address them at the beginning by describing the activities in both camps: the details and the hustle and bustle, especially if you tell it from the point of view of a child being sent everywhere to run errands for David or for Goliath. The colours and the smells will capture the sanguines' attention and will give others the chance to dream into the story as they will take longer to become interested. For the phlegmatics it is always suggested that food should be mentioned; and without sliding intothe great duel. Phlegmatic children are often the ones w h o h e l p t h e c l a s s t e a c h e r m a k e s u r e t h a t e v e r y c h i l d is feeling cared for. This particular story may not appeal at all to the melancholies, they might dislike the confusion and the heroism involving violence. The Old T estament doesn i readily inspire compassion. They will need you to provide an entrance for them, through their ability to empathise with suffering, especially the suffering of the down-trodden. A little introduction about David's childhood, leading up to the battle and imagining how David fell the night before will help these children identify with him by recognising the fear or the loneliness and the sense of responsibility . This is also particularly pertinent for children in their ninth or tenth year: they often start to experience feaj- and loneliness and particularly melancholic children lend to take responsibility for the problems that they see around them. The pitch of the voice As you can imagine a class of young children is very sensitive to the human voice; it makes a deep impression on them and teachers must be aware of this as it is their basic teaching tool, especially in Steiner schools where there is little use of electronic equipment and infomiaiion technology. A teacher with a constantly high-pitched voice will tend to make children nervous and restless; the opposite may be quite restful but may be soporic. By doing speech exercises, by growing aware of one's voice, it is possible to use it as a pedagogical tool. In the above story it would be appropriate to vary the pitch used very slightly without making a caricature of any of the characters. It is certain that Goliath will have a tremendous roaring voice and the teacher's chest capacity must grow just for this, butwhen David speaks he will be clear but quite soft; ifone could imagine speaking more from the forehead for David and more from the stomach for Goliath the right result might be achieved. Varying pitch should be used with subtlety. It will, however, be wonderful the next day when you ask the children to come up in front to act ptuls of the story to sec a child puff up his chest and give a goliaihan mighty roar. Another child of a less choleric nature may enjoy acting out the gesture of preci.sion of David's catapult\u2014in total silence! The rhythm of speech ! have already mentioned how to focus the sanguine children at the beginning of the story tltrough the description. It will be appropriate to speak in short words and quite briskly to describe the child (in thesloiyO as he rushes arouitd watching ail the preparations. When the ght is about to begin, a mood of ceremony can be created by talking slower and emphasising the consonants. The cholerics willenjoy the strength of the sounds. These act as a fomiing force on them. How can some of the ordinary aspects ol\" life be portrayed for the phlegmatics to enjoy? A fluidity in the speech will re.sonate well with them and they will strain slightly forward if you speak softer and allow the vowels to sound out. There is no need to rush this part of the story. Let the cholerics grow slightly impatient; it will not harm tliem, and allow the phlegmatics to enjoy your sounds and de.scriplion.s. The melancholies would really enjoy hearing one of the beautiful minor Hebrew songs in the middle ofthe story, they are often the ones whose feelings overflow at the beautiful sounds. The speed of the tellingThe speed of the telling goes hand in hand with the rhythm described above. It is important to remember, however, to vary the speed. We so often settle in a certain mode that lasts the whole story long. This will not help your images to be alive and colourful. A few pauses in a story will bring back the phlegmatics who may have dreamed off. The gestures of the story teller In most stories a minimum of gesture is necessary. It can easily take the children's attention away from the sound of the words. For that reason a few well chosen moments where your gestures accompany an action in the story can complement your particular temperament slant. A slight stantp with the fool at the approach of Goliath will remind the cholerics of hisweight and therefore of the extraordinary featperformed by David. Y ou can outfox the sanguines by looking quickly from one side to the other during your description; this may be needed to allow them a bit of movement too before you focus on a more quiet and serious piul. This is a good time to release tension and make them laugh. It will be so much better if they laugh in the right place rather than upset the melancholies and cholerics by bubbling over with mirth at the tragic moment. How you stand and where you put your hands when you are describing the world of feelings will make a deep impression on the melanchoIic.s, you will see it the next day in the recall or later in the year when they act out a play. So far we have looked at how the teacher can address the temperaments in the class by varying a.spects of the story-telling. The next step consists in 1617The four lemperametUs in Class 8\u2014by which time they are normally well in band\u2014expressed ihmitgh paintings of imaginary industrial revolution scenes. enabling the children to give each other a different aspect of the complete experience in the next days. The story recall and the individual work in writing and drawing The day after the story has been told, you can expect the choleric children to come through the door begging to be allowed to retell the story or better still to act it out. Ideally a small group of children should be chosen, representing the different temperaments, and asked to go out in the corridor to prepare a little scene. While they are outside you can do another activity, which may appeal more to the melancholies: The children close their eyes and imagine the camp the night before the great duel. The teacher can help by asking children to respond to questions e.g: are there any noises? Can anything be seen? What light is there? What is the sky like? etc. Asking just for describing words (adjectives), children are called to the blackboard to write them down. These will come in useful both for the children's drawings and their writing of the story the next day. Melancholies who often enjoy remembering things of the past will benet from this exercise as it gives a certain objectivity, a wider context to their one-sided picture. Phlegmatics need a bit of pushing when it comes to articulating their inner life; they will be helped by the other children because once the activity is started, they actually enjoy falling into the pattern of making lists of words. They dislike havingto be the rst to do anything that involves work. In t h e s e r e c a l l e x e r c i s e s s a n g u i n e s o f t e n s t a r e a t y o u blankly as they have forgotten the whole story , or so they think. But they will take up the impulse of the cholerics in the acting out or will soon join in the game' of finding adjectives. A lot of these will probably have nothing to do with the story in question but sometimes the fact that sanguines are participating and not chatting to their neighbour is enough to satisfy one. This description is only a taster of what can start to happen in a class when you know the children well. As you get used to working in this way you nd that the lessons are enriched by this multiplicity and variety of hues and textures. It penetrates into all the parts of the lesson; it is particularly helpful in the realm of language teaching if you are leaching younger children only through the spoken word. A codetta on language teaching I t has been my experience when st art ing t o t each 6/ 7- year-olds French that some of them experience a feeling of insecurity at the rst hearing of those different words. A good way of bringing them intothe group without singling them out is to make sure that there is an activity in each lesson which meets their particular needs. The strong rhythmic poem for the cholerics. a dancing ring game for the sanguines, a picture dictation for the phlegmatics, and a memory game for the melancholies, for example. In a balanced language lesson all the above would happen anyway but to prepare them with the children's faces in your mind creates this gesture of community building: acknowledging the wealth of differences living in the children and using these differences for the fullment of the whole group, that is the potential gift of working with the temperaments.

Hodder&SiouchionCurriculum Research: Eurythmy rod exercises by MARTYN RAWSON If. for some reason, one hud to reduce the Waldorf curriculum to its absolute minimum, what would remain? How much can you take away and still call it Waldorf education? This may seem an entirely hypothetical and therefore un-serious question but it is not quite as theoretical as it may seem. There are essentially two reasons why we might have to consider such a drastic question. Firstly if some totalitarian educational regime said you can have .some elements of Waldorf education but not all. which ones do you insist upon? Secondly if some key aspect of the Waldorf approach were no longer possible because there weren't enough competent people to teach it, then it might drop off the curriculum and thus undemiine the whole Waldorf ethos. Well, both of these circumstances are no longer unthinkable. Certainly one of the core subjecl.s in tlic Waldorf curriculum, perhaps the core subject, is eurythmy. It is one of the few things taught in Waldorf schools that is not taught in any otherbranch of education. It isalso one of the subjects that can claim the most directconnection to anthropo.sophy. the philosophy underlying and infonning the Waldorf approach. No eurythmy. no Waldorf education. 1 think one could also make acaseforihecorollary. namely, no Waldorfeducation, no eurythmy. or at least its scope in theworld would be drastically reduced if it were no longer being taught in Waldorf schools. But is there arisk that eurythmy might in some way disappear from Waldorf education? The answer has to be po.ssibly\u2014the risk being greater in some countries than others. The reality is that for many rea.sons the number of eurythmists leaching in Waldorf .schools is declining. More and more schools tire not in a position to offer the subject. This is not unconnected to the fact that the educational quality ofthe eurythmy taught is not everywhere as high as itneeds to be. With many noble exceptions. eurythmi.sts tu-e nding it increasingly difcult to teach eurythmy as it should be taught. The rea.sons for tliat, are again complex. The Pedagogical Section at the Goetheanum has been concerned with this problem and has conducted research to establish the facts of the situation. Broadly.speaking, the reasons are thought to be as follows (obviously in an article of this length one cannot go into detail, so the reader is asked to accept the following summary without detailed supporting arguments). The amount of provision for the training of educational eurythmy is often inadequate. All eurythmists have a 4- or 5-year basic training in eurythmy. They can then do a post-graduate training in therapeutic or educational eurythmy. Despite the agreement on behalf of the Waldorf schools' movement not to take on eurylltmists without a pedagogical training, this still happens. The basic eurythmy training does not necessarily equip eurythmists to become teachers of children with the professional requirements that entails. Other teachers have an inadequate understanding of eurythmy or its place in the curriculum. Consequently eurythmy is not supported by teachers and parents with conviction based on insight. It is widely believed to do good but thatbelief is not always enough. Eurythmy is a difficult subject for many pupils to accept at school unless it is taught extremely well, perhaps more so than any other subject. The fact that it is scarcely known outside of the Steiner or Waldorf community does not help. The an of eurythmy has been inadequately explored in relation to how it works on the human being. Certainly non-eurythmists have-ver>' littleunderstanding of its effectiveness, and manyeurythmists are not experienced at translating this into terms that can be generally understood in the context of education. To put it bluntly, too few people eitlier understand eurythmy or are able to articulate its benets for the developing human being. I realise that these bare statements may shock and offend some readers but I would not make them if I were not convinced they were broadly true. The fact is, Rudolf Steiner created eurythmy out of the deepest insights into human nature and its needs in our times. Just as Waldorf education itself was conceived as an antidote to the social and spiritual devastation that 18 19Sieinor predicted tor ilie coming centuries, st) our>'lhmy has a special place in that task. Put veiy simply, the primai-y task of education today is to help developing individuals hannonise the s p i r i t u a l a n d s o u l s i d e o f t h e i r b e i n g s w i t h t h e b o d i l y - rhythmical side of their nature. The increasing materialism of our age is leading not only to a dryimi up of spiritual sources of renewal but an increasing scleroticism of the whole human constitution. Steincr offered humanity two central paths to spiritual integration; the path of knowledge which leads from the cultivation of living thinking to penetrate down into the will (the path from knowledge to the enlightened will), and the path that leads through the cultivation of the will to the ennobling of the soul and for the enlightenment of the mind. The latter path is that of eurythmy. Self- knowledge begins with self-education and this leads to the various spiritual paths an individual can follow as an adult. It all begins with education and for thisreason eurythmy is central to Waldorf education. Its contribution to the healing of humanity is vital. Thus far the best we can say is that it has-v/rt/Y e-r/to full this task. So what can be done? W ell many things are being done at an international level. The basic euiythmy training is undergoing a major revision in some countries. In Holland and Germany, where most eurythmy students train (Moscow is the second laigest eurythmy school after Den Haag. followed by Stuttgart) the educational eurythmy training has beenintegrated into the main teacher training institutions (Emerson College in England is following suit). In the case of Holland the basic eurythmy training has gone down this path as well, having gained state recognition as a primary training. Tliese steps to integrate eurythmy into the wider community ofanthroposophical adult education are important. Furthermore an iiilemational conference has been organised for parents, teachers, students and eurylhmists to reinvigorate the movement by showing the educational art at its best (16-21 April 2001). One of the most important steps that is being taken in many places is new research into the fundamentals of eurythmy . A real study of eurythmy from anthropological, physiological, educational and therapeutic perspectives has begun, involving workers from several different elds. It is hoped that the international conference will be a focus for this research work. The remainder of this article summarises one such modest attempt to explore an aspect of educational eurythmy. It involved myself as teacher and curriculum researcher.' Thea Kaesbach a school(Above ami on facing page) the 3rd and 4th movements in the 7-fold exercise. euryihmist, and Hajo Dekker. a co-leader of the Dekker-Schmandt Eurythmy School in Forest Row. Our task was to explore the pedagogical signicance of the rod exercises. Exercises using copper rods are an important feature of the eurythmy curriculum. They also have other therapeutic uses, which in this case was not the focus of our study. We explored the four basic exercises, recognising that each exercise can be u.sed with many variations. Our research method was quite simple and consisted of a series of steps. 1. We began by doing the exercises together and discussing how wc experienced them. 2. We discussed the origin of the exercises. 3. We experimented with different sizes and weight.s of rods to get a feeling for their effectiveness in supporting different aspects of the exercises. 4. We reviewed the curriculum use of the vjirious exercises and why they are used in the various classes. 5. Finally we attempted to describe how each exerci.se might affect the individual and thereforewhat its pedagogical value actually is. The detailed outcomes of this research, which is by no means complete, will be published in due course in a research journal. However, a few preliminary observations can be made. The rod exercises were introduced by Steincr specically as preparaloiy exerci.ses designed to assist the individual tune thei r bodily organism so that it can become a skilful medium capable of expressing the essence of human movement itself- The aim of the rod exerci.ses is to gradually free the bodily organismof any hindrances that might prevent it from being an organ of the soul permeable to spiritual impulses. This .somewhat concentrated denition needs alittle unpacking. Firstly the a.ssumption is that spirit can come to expression through movement, or put the other way round, movement is a non-physical but neverthele.ss real being in its own right. Spiritual content\u2014and this could for example be thoughts, aesthetic ideas or individual intentions\u2014can come to expression through the spiritual medium of movement made tangible and sense-perceptible through the human body . Mediating this is the human soul. T o simplify the matter even further we can say: an idea is experienced and made conscious in the soul, and this comes to expression through gesture and the movement of the individual. In this sense thought becomes visible, just as thought can also become audible in spoken speech. We are familiar with this process in its unconscious form, namely in body language. The gestures,movements and po,sture an individual adopts can be read' as an expression of thoughts and feelings. In eurythmy this process is intensied. In eurythmy as an art something of the essence of a piece of music or poetry can be made visible. The intrinsic and fundamental elements of music and language, from the primary sounds of the vowels and consonants, and the individual musical tones, to the most complex elements of composition, can be expressed through eurythmical gesture. In other words their spiritual form can be experienced and translated into movement. The process is not simply that of an impulse resounding in an instrument (like air being blown through a hollow reed, or the percussive force on a taught skin). The impulse is rst individualised through the human soul. In artistic eurythmy there is always a layer of conscious intention beyond the content of the material itself. There is choreography, selection of text and artistic interpretation. In therapeutic eurythmy it is more the case that an archetypal process is \"enacted\". This might be a process of contraction or expansion, or It might be immersion inthe qualities that belong lo a particular consonant, sequence of consonants, or to a particular rhythm. Through the 'enacling' of the consonantal form, for example, the soul draws a spiritual process into itself though the actual movement. Educational eurythmy stands somewhere between the artistic and therapeutic processes. The teacher's understanding of the developmental needs of the child enables him or her to combine both of these elements. What then is the educational value of eurythmy luid what do the rod exercises contribute to this process? As staled at the beginning of this article, education has the task of helping children hturnonise their development. Development means, at least in Steiner's use of the lenn, an inner determining principle (the individuality of the child) suiving to come to ever more complete expression through the biological organism within agiven bocial and cultural context. Children have to make lhem.se]ves at home in the body whose lomi they have inherited through the familiar genetic channels. This body has to become an instrument of tlieir intentions. (/ want to reach that apple on the table: I want to formulate the following ideas and communicate them to my Mum.) Furthermore, individuals have to structure and order the experiences they have in the world in such a way that they can remember them, form concepts, link ideas, comprehend feelings and relate to the world\u2014 in other words al 1 the things that belong to the sou! life of an individual. All this happens within a givensocial setting, culture and language. Throughout thecourse of his or her biography the individual strives continuously to individualise this whole process, which really means to give the individuality an ever clearer voice. This individuality is the spiritual core, the *1' of the person, This brief description, I think, makes abundantly clear why eurythmy has a key role in education. It is an activity that enables the spiritual impulses at work within an individual to nd expression rst in the soul and then through the body. This should not necessarily be seen as a process lied to this strict sequence. The child might imitate a eurythmical movement made by the teacher, experience It, and only later awaken in consciousness to what the movement contains as spiritual impulse. A professional eurythmist as artist may rst work with a piece of music, explore its intrinsic qualities, interpret it and then derive an appropriate form for it, before, as it were, it becomes eurythmy. The child imitating the teacher bypasses the preparation and simply does the movement. Even here, however, there are at least two fundamental preconditions. 20 21Firstly the child's feeling life must be engaged onhe movement may be mechanical. Therefore the experience requires a picture. The activity is introduced through a description, an image which stimulates the children to re-create pictures in their own mind's eye. When the movement is shown, the children join in and participate, thus linking the movement and gestures with an image they already have within them. This image is naturally an individually coloured version of the tirchetypal reality behind the eurythmy gestures themselves and the content of the poem or music. Therefore the picture has to be well-chosen and designed to appeal to the child at various ages. The second precondition is that the child's movement organisation and body are sufciently in harmony for the movement content of the eurythmy to be experienced at all. If the child is so uncomfortable in her own body or if she is so detached from her own experience there will be too much resistance and hindrance for the spirit as it were to resonate. The child will not experience much, other than physical discomfort, often in the form of tiredness, clumsiness or heaviness in the arms. In other words, the child is experiencing the physicalityof gravity rather than levity, of rhythm and pure movement. T o this end the rod exercises are designed to loosen the child's burden. The different exercises do so in different ways. The rod itself plays an important role. It gives the child something in the hand that makes themovements more visible. More importantly, the child experiences movement in the weight, texture and temperature of the rod. The length of the rod relates to the length of the arm. The thickness provides sufcient tactile contact without being unwieldy. The weight is sufcient to be conscious of the arms but not too heavy as to tire them out too quickly. Interestingly, some therapeutic exercises require particularly heavy rods made of solid copper,precisely because this weight is important as extra resistance. In most exercises the rod is held balanced in the middle, which therefore draws the warmth down into the child's hands and ngers. In moving the rod. the individual experiences his or h e r o w n m o v e m e n t s e x t e n d e d i n t o t h e i m m e d i a t e surrounding space. This has the effect of drawing the eld of proprioceptive perception (that is the body's monitoring of its own boundaries and the totality ofits movements in space) outwards. The extension of this eld of perception into the immediate surrounding space has a loosening effect. The(Above and on facing page) the front and back positions of the /2-foldexercise. movement of the rod supports the perception of the individual's own movement by amplifying it. This leads to the question as to when this experience i.s appropriate. There is a feeling that until children have acquired the ability to distance them.selves from their environment, and experience themselves as separate from it. the rod exercises will not have the desired effect. That means in practice after the ninth yeai', often known as the 'Rubicon' of self-awareness. Nor should the rod exercises be learned primarily through imitation because they are most effective when the child establishes the form and movement out of themselves. They need, as it were, to impose the structure on themselves as a conscious act. much as balancing a spinning plate on a stick requires active inner participation. This aspect of rod exercises certainly also suggests that age 9 is awatershed in this respect. One interesting aspect of the exercises which became apparent was that they appear to need relatively little picture support. In contrast to a poem or piece of music these exercises need to stand on their own, with minimal imaging. Rather they require accurate instructions, concerning the positions of the arms, the .sequence of movements and .so on. This element emphasises their exercise character. The precision that some of the exerci.ses require, calls for clarity of 'mental picture' as to what is being asked for. Instructing the child that the rod .should, for example, be held in a vertical position directly in front of the left shoulder, with the lower hand directly below the upper hand etc.\u2014requires little imaginative picturing. The precision that is attained is the result of the child's ability to structure his or her awareness of movement and bodily position fromwithin. In order to do so they have to have an accurate inner picture of what is required. To quote Martin Baker, leader of the spatial dynamics training at Michael Hall. Sussex: \"If you can picture it. you can do it.\" The 7-fold exercise' requires (he greatest amount of precision. The .spatial relationships are more important than the paths from one position to the next. Certainly from the perspective of the layper-son, this is surprising. We are used to try to move from one position toanotherwith lluidity. It is not that this is not required. It is more that the position the arms and the rod come into are more important, consciously lling the passage of space between them. This gives the exercise a .strongly formal, frontal and centred feel to it. The physical experience of space in its co ordinates up-down and right-left, and particularly the correct angles, are paramount. These directions are experienced as objective external qualities. In its basic form the exercise is done in standing but it can also be carried out whilst walking a simple forwards, sideways and backwards form. The 12-fold exercise has a much stronger element of rhythm to it. There is a flow and breathing quality to the movements, with an in-breath as the rod is raised at the front and behind the body, and an out- breathing as the rod is moved down again. This is enhanced by the spiral sequence of the whole exercise. There is also a strong element of tension andrelaxation, bending and stretching. The movementsarc kept close to the body as the rod moves from front to back and up and down. This gives a strong sense of being in the centre of a flowing movement. This exercise has several variations. The next sequence of exercises\u2014in which finger dexterity and a fluid mobility of the amis and in particular the wrists all feature\u2014clearly engages notonly ne motor skills but also a ne bahmce between lightness olT ouch. control and rhythm,which provide a basis for what can only bedescribed as gracefulness of movement. The fourth exercise, that known as the waterfall, involves the stiongest feeling yet for the quality of space around one. Following a distinct and rhythmical sequence of movement, the rod is raised over the head and placed behindthe neck just above the shoulders and then dropped behind the body. The hands then have to move rapidly to catch the rod as it falls. This exercise not only includes a strong element of front and back but also requires a condence in letting go behind one's back. Tliis awakens a consciousness for the space behind, which, given our frontal postiore and way of facing the world, has a liberating effect of opening up a space usually hidden, not only from view but from consciousne.ss (illustrated on p. 13). 1 hope from these brief de,scriptions it begins to become clearer what the pedagogical value of these exercises might be and that they work in a realm barely touched by other educational activities, with the exception of gymnastics. What distinguishes them from gymna.stics. however, is the fact thatalthough as exercises they arc formal and have a strongly physical basis, they are nevertheless essentially musical in their composition, not only because they are often accompanied by piano music or the beating of a tambourine. Their structure is akin to tuning exerci.ses or scales in music, in which arpeggios or chords are practised. It is not that melodies are played but rather mu.sical elements are highlighted and exercised. The engagement of the soul is modest but essential, so that the spiritual quality of the space can be experienced. ^ Martyn Raw.'ion was co-founder of the York Sieiner School.

That is, human beings are threefold and this, if strengthened, will bring threefolding forces into the world. The task of the Waldorf teacher is rst and foremost to educate in a threefold way: not only body , soul and spirit, but also the trinity of soul forces: thinking, feeling and willing. Rudolf Steiner speaks about the three soul forces on many occasions, thinking as a torch of truth, feeling as the grail of beauty and willing as the way to goodness, and this is what they might become\u2014three powerful tools in the hands of the human spirit. The teenager's head-over-heels craving for boundless experience needs to nd a harness in the birth of the ego or spiritual centre within the threefoldsoul forces at age 21. The soul seeks liberation. One of the means to such liberation of the astral organisation is music. Other arts also bring such a freeing from the 'prison', but though this liberation of the astral may be the taming of the lion, it is not yet the taming of the lion-tamer! Young people of today want to nd the golden island, the secret place, the king's throne. They seek to nd the way to self- mastery, this is their second craving. The conunercial world of movies with its larger-than-life characters is food for this craving, but this merging of circumstances needs to be found in the completeinversion of the James Bond idiom 'You only dietwice'. To experience the profound mystery of the decadent death-like forces of modem culture, as a call to re-awaken to a second life in spirit is what is staring us in the face, and this, through nothing more urgent and compelling than the cry of our children in the wilderness of a strangled society. In summary, young people need to feel free in their soul-life in their astral organisation, but they also need to take the reins of the soul and lead it by the wayof self-mastery , as a task beyond the age of 21, to new pastures, to new arenas of culture where spiritual content can abide, where soul and spirit can both nd each other in freedom. As educators or responsible adults we can nourish and guide young people in this direction. T o educate the three soul forces of thinking, feeling and willing, instead of feeding information to the intellect in adisharmonious way , leads to self-empowerment, to creativity of individuals. Beethoven was great because he broke the 'classical dogma' through the originality of his own passionate soul. Garibaldi was great because out of inner conviction bom of self- mastery he inspired men to free their nation. Y oung people of today wish to follow these ideals, but we must show them which key opens the door into the creative mind, teach them the language of the heart. It is awe of themselves which we must teach them. Great individuals like Beethoven and Garibaldi changed history; through their lives we can inspire a sense of the strength of the individual spirit as opposed to merely ctional heroes on a 'mission impossible'. The striving for meaning in life is fundamental, whether it be as tmth, beauty or goodness\u2014in the 'mummy and daddy' world ofthe 'lover the teenager's extravagant and exotic mmblings through virtual reality and the 'gardens of the forbidden :nit'. In the epic poem of Parzival by Wolfram von Eschenbach, which forms part of the Class 11 curriculum in Waldorf schools, Parzival represents the search for this meaning, but the character Gawainrepresents 'the way of the heart'. This way, the way of Gawain, is the way which many youngsters seek to bo and are going. Gawain is a dauntless knight of the sword. He is invincible amongst Arthurian knights, but gets himself into trouble because of his natural candour where the ladies are concemed and his overt compassion. This naive directness and spontaneity of emotion are too much for the dampened and languid natures he meets (adults!) upon his adventures. Impetuousness and passion all too readily get the better of him and so, in search of catharsis and self-mastery , he turns, like^'arzival, to the Grail quest. But it is the veiy qualities of compassion and warmth of heart which save the day. Parzival falls into a trance from which he cannot awake, but Gawain has pity on him and wakes him up. Many other knights pass Parzival by without so much as a thought for his predicament. He is trapped, caught up in agony of mind which, though illumined by the idealistic imaginative vision of undeled growth, cannot nd its place in the world. Parzival is destined to nd the Holy Grail, yet he is helpless. Gawain chanced upon him and lends him the forces of the heart which set him free. After this meeting between idealised vision which has become paralysed, and compassionate deed. 24 25Gawuinembarksonfujlheradvenlures. Wchearhow a powerl'ul king lays siege, on unjusi grounds to aciiy called Beaurosch. Gawain joins the defenders of the city, in the name of justice, hut one of the assailants is the fearsome Red Knight himself\u2014Parzival! Why is Paizival ghting on the wrong side? The one who will achieve the Grail is ghting on the side of evil. The assailant king is captured, the Red Knight departs invincible and Gawain also comes away victorious and unscathed. Gawain travels on until he approaches a sumptuous natural paradise of fruit trees, murmuring brooks, .scented valleys and distant strains of tantalising music which seemed to be floating towards him from a neiirby city. This is the City of Logrois. and half wrapped in ecstasy, he beholds the beauty of beauties. There, sitting beside a spring was the Duchess of Logrois. A paiagon. sublime and earthly all in one! Gawain asked her politely if he could be her knight\u2014she dismissed him with icy scorn. She told him that he must bring her horse to her\u2014on exchange of this she called him a goo.se!Whatever Gawain did. was met with mockery. Gawain eventually becomes angry, losing his temper, which the duchess dresses with words: \"I love to see you furious.\" The insults continue but Gawain undergoes a self-initiation. After some time he says to the dark, lascivious beauty the following words: \"The more you mock me the more you will want to make it up to me later.\" Passion has been tempered by forbearance. Indeed here a secret of the character is revealed. It is all an allegory of the soul. The Duchess of Logrois is Gawain's unredeemed heart forces, which he must now begin to come to terms with. But this is not the only symbolic character. The poet had already said, after the battle of Beaurosch: \"Two hearts that are not one have shown their strength in erce enmity.\" pointing to the fact that Parzival and Gawain are in fact the same person! And now it seems that Gawain meets characters which are. again, nothing but aspects of his own soul. But what of the battle of Beaurosch\u2014why was Parzival on the wrong side? Gawain is a knight of the sword, but Parzival is a knight of the 'word*\u2014a knight of the thinking spirit. They are different: Gawain must oppose evil, he must ght on the side of the good. But how can injustice be overcome in the w orld: how can the bi-polar world become a tri-polar world which balances out the perpetual conflict of \"right* and 'wrong*, equality and inequality, aggression and pacism, tyranny and anarchy , truth and falsity? Parzival symbolises the light growing in the 26darkness. Parzival is on the side of evil, because he can Iranstonn the evil Irom the inside, from his own inner nature. He does not ght outwardly against injustice, but enters the dragon and irradiates his blackness. Gawain has not letimt to do this yet and so lakes the path of 'outer' conflict. But how can one oppose evil outwLirdly without being drawn into evil one.self? This is Gawain's dilemma\u2014the dilemma of many a ghter'. powerless without Gawain, because love. Gawain is meaningless without Parzival because Parzival is purity. Gawain's soul becomes free when he passes through the experience of the castle of wonders, where all the powers of seduction and allurement must be met and conquered. The Duchess of Logrois, Orgeluse. as she is called, at once falls to her knees transformed into the kindest and gentlest creature, bestowing upon Gawain only the tenderest feelings. Parzival, being one and the same with Gawain has found a place for his idealistic vision, in the compassion and social forces of the he:ul. Gawain 'tames' the lion in the castle of wonders and Parzival tames the lion-tamer and nds the Grail. So it is with Steiner education. Its task is to embrace the whole human being as a three-fold .soul- spiritual being on the path to a greater humanity. Humanity is what is being demanded by the younger generation, but this means the 'freeing' olThc astral forces and the steering of the ship. But what about the great men and women of the past-it seems that they don't make them like that any more the.se days? Young people iu-e looking for something more than ideas. It is their will forces which they seek to put to .sei^'ice. Rudolf Steiner himself was a unique thinker in the respect that hewent beyond ideas. Goethe, his predecessor in the realm of 'free thought', was satised with ideas and their power of inspiration, but Steiner harnessed ideas and used them to penetrate to the reality of being. This is where we stand now as educationists. What is the being of the child? What is the being of the adolescent, the teenager, the human? What is the being of education itself, of society? It is a threefold being and this being must come to life once more. Alexander Zundel is a fanner pupit of the Rudolf Steiner School of Kings Langley.

Y oucan tell by lookingat it.\" \\ni\\ia\\\\y she was emphatic.But something of a summery mood prevailed and the lunicable conversation meanderedon, longer and more leisurely perhaps than if it had had to compete with newswoithiness such as the outcrop of BSE amongFrench and German cattle, that assailed Europe in the later autumn, bringing unprecedented chagrin to both the inning and political worlds. Try as he might, theinterviewer couldn't persuade his expert to budge on the new-bom being anything other than \"all lamb\". Hedid. however, manage to get her herclosing words; \"It's the//vc/iV.?f quipping; \"'Perhapsthe creature's just kidding.\" is hard to imagine. Be thatas it may , it goes to show iliai just as 'mutton dressed as lamb' is .sheer human vanity designed to deceive the sharp-sighted sharks perpetually swimming around our cocktail- and appearance-besotted society, so also 'goat dressed as lamb' can ju.st as well escape the 'partially' sighted, to whom only externalities arc visible as a direct result of their habitual mode of positivist thinking. Steiner's views were in marked contrast to positivism. He insisted that anthropo.sophy was extremely practical\u2014more practical, he claimed, than that vein of materialism that lacked awareness of the .spiritual dimension of the matter that was the 'the matter hand'. A striking case in point was his warning that the ox:- \"po.sse.sses forces... that can [transform]... plant into meat... What would happen if the ox were to eat meat directly instead of plants? It would lead all the forces that can produce flesh unused... the unused energy in the ox's body cannot simply be lost, so tlieox is nally lled with it. and this pent- up force does something in him other thanproduce flesh from plant substances. It produces waste products. Instead of flesh, hanTiful sub.stances [would be] produced. Therefore, if an ox were suddenly to turn into a meat eater, it would ll it.self with all kinds of liannful substances such a.s uric acid and urates. Now... the specic effects of urates are expressed in a particular afnity for the nervous system and the brain. The result is that if im ox were to consume meat directly, liu-geamounts of urates would be secreted: they wouldenter the brain, ruid the ox would go crazy\" (13 January 1923). With hindsight, one sometimes wonders what it must have been like for someone with the inner perceptions that Steiner had developed. Williout being a prophet of doom, there must have been moments when it seemed as though, despite enhirging on his perspectives with the utmost clarity, no-one seemed inclined to make ethical use of tlie vantage point he had gained. One can talk till the cows come home, but to what purpose, if nothing but deaf ears are turned? Sadly, when this p:irlicular 'cow' did come home, tlie evidence bore out all too tragically what he had predicted.'

In doing so it will be instructive to consider next a unworkable?airyfairy?otherworldly?removed?);the point Steiner made in lectures he gave to the original earthly type to be in danger of becoming too entrapped Waldorf teachers in June 1921.

Assessment in sober the other, that 'the second state of that man would be style. This was the setting in which Steiner came to worse than the rst'. Nor is he veering towards the speak of two 'types' of children that showed polar vapid concept of'balancing out'. It is more a questionopposite tendencies, each type requiring differing of jMpp/c/ne/iftng than balancing out. But however one pedagogical treatment. He termed these polar types . reflects on the indications, the teachers'task increases, 'cosmic' and 'earthly'. The cosmic child could be both in substance and in responsibility, recognised physiologically by a \"plastic forming of the head\"; the earthly child had \"a plastic moulding of the Objective observation rest of the organism, notably the limbs\". It is becoming more and more widely known that 2829Steiner s spiritual-scientic inner discipline meant that it could be decades before he gave out the 'tried and tested fruits of his research. It doesn't take much arithmetic to realise that the initial spadeworkof all hisr e s e a r c h m u s t h a v e t a k e n p l a c e i n t h e l a s t q u a r t e r o f t h e 19th cenmry . Furthermore, if there is one key-stone to his whole corpus, it is surely his concept of the threefold nature of the human being, something towhich he himself returned time and again, always in new guises\u2014^as in, for instance, \"By far the most important thing to aim for in our whole cultivation of school health is that the teacher absorbs right into his very flesh and blood a feeling for the threefold nature of the human organism.\" Steiner was speaking at a teachers' meeting at the W aldorf School at which the school doctor , Dr Kolisko, was also present. It was the occasion on which Steiner pointed out that all children belong either to the type in which the nerve-sense organism is not in order , or the opposite: the metabolic-limbs organisation. He goeson to exhort the teachers \"to develop a potential for noticing how the children express themselves so thatthis reveals to you what you have to do with the child to bring its health into complete balance.\" Steiner gave what amounted to a lecturette, indicating the medical t r e a t m e n t f o r t h e s e p r e d o m i n a n c e s w h e r e t h e y b e c o m e too extreme, at the same time making it clear that it was not just the concem of the school doctor: \"...every teacher should develop an eye for these things.\" For the teacher , there were symptoms that one or the other polarity was not in order . The laige-headed child could be too red-faced and lack the ability to discriminate mentally; while the small-headed child was often pale-faced and weak in imagination and synthetic thought. Again, the teacher's opportunity was to support both types in overcoming then- weakness. In observing their symptoms, adjusting their pedagogy accordingly and providing suitable activities for the two types, the teacher would be working \"prophylactically\". Unless one bears in mind that Steiner is always talking about whole-class teaching, one might be inclined to argue that there is an incipient danger in this approach, namely: in fostering the weaker sides of the child's natine, the teacher is ipso facto neglecting the child's strengths with the consequence that neglect might lead to atrophy. Three considerations will help to allay this fear. The rst is relatively obvious to anyone familiar with theclassroom: in practice, the teacher just won't neglect a pupil's strengths. The promising painter's paintings are going to get plenty of teacher-praise and admiration fix\u00bbm the rest of the class. While similarly, the talented draughtsman, or the very skilled embroiderer, or theq u i c k - t o - g r a s p g r a m m a r i a n w i l l c o n s t a n t l y b e h a v i n g their fair share of spotlight. At the same time, school life w i l l n o t b e a s o m e w h a t b o r i n g s i n e c u r e f o r t h e s p e c i a l l y gifted, after which they can't wait to get home to their lavish programmes of entertainment. Y es, they will hoe and tend the crops in the well cultivated elds, but equally , yes, they will deep plough the fallow eld as part of the way towards a better future. Secondly, one should not lose sight of the fact that in whole-class teaching, each pupil is tuned in the whole time. While the teacher is making efforts to 'reach' the small-headed type\u2014and has them particularly in mind\u2014the large-headed type, through the process of individuation, are soaking up her pedagogical approach because it is their 'natural 'element. And vice versa. Thirdly, there is the perspective of neuro psychology . The by now orthodox thinking about the brain will detect that in Steiner's small- and large- headed types are qualities related to the right and left hemispheres. Right-hemisphered thinking bears a resemblance to large-headed; left-hemisphered thinking bears aresemblance to small-headed. If one of these hemispheres is by nature stronger , supporting the other hemisphere does not only have signicance in itself: it gives added support across to the other side of the brain. It is somewhat puzzling that, in an age where various aspects of the physical body loom so large in life, we should be squeamish about too much reference to the physical nature of child development. Perhaps, encouraged by the endless care that Steiner took over such matters, we who are at the chalk face can strengthen our work by making detailed observations and taking direct action as a result.

Because K. J. Schroer's ideas remarkable about him, and works in an altogether were directly forged out of his extensive and poetic manner, is that energetic imagination and practical experiences, Rudolf Steiner believed they youthful spirit of which there is hardly any trace in could be successfully applied far beyond the Austria our old and withered world, in our latest inherently of that time. Thus 40 years after Questions of intellectual generation.\u2014This kind of imaginationEducation was published Steiner could still write: is only powerfully present in a select few, yet \"What one may nowadays term obsolete in this manifests itself so strongly in Goethe, that work from 1876 does not really come into according to Schiller's testimony all his cognitiveconsideration in regard to such a lively art of forces were concentrated upon this single goal. In thinking. This art of thinking which has its basis in a other words, we also recognise here that unique rich life experience continues to remain fruitful, characteristic of naive poetry, that Schiller 3031considered lo be ihe highest, and which humanity will po.ssess in the future; a period where eonceptums become universalised. and genuine feelings are granted validity. For this is really the poet's ultimate prize, explaining why the light and warmth ol poetry are able to penetrate into every sphere, while philosophy and history can gain no access. Thus Schiller was entirely right when he said: \"the poet is the true human being, comparedwith which the philosopher is merely a caricature.\" (History ofGennan Poetry. V. p.496.) if we consider this signicant passage of that outstanding literary' historian from the point of view of the educator, then we must surely be amazed at how closely tho.se lofty talents of Goethe coincide with what is nowadays demanded of education, or more precisely, with what is demanded of the teacher. If theory is to wrench it.self free from the ossication into which it has plunged, as is justly demanded on all sides, then the educator requires an extremely lively talent for teaching\u2014which can only be gained from immediate and practical conceptions. These conceptions must not be one sided. but necessarily of such a kind as to allow all the forces of the spirit\u2014not merely the intellect\u2014to be active as a whole, and which we especially nd in young flourishing minds. The harmonious co operation of all our spiritual forces bestows upon the imagination that remarkable energy we .so admire in Goethe, and which is only powerfully present in our \"old and withered world\" in very few people. If the deadening nature of an ossied theory transports the pupil's spirit into a stale of suffering receptivity, then the living activity of the teacher indicated above sympathetically awakens his full and active interest. Thus, nothing more is demanded of the teacher than a particular state of soul\u2014the aesthetic state\u2014described by Schiller in his Letters on the Ae-tthetic Education of Man. Here the senses and spirit are held in balance, to thereby bring about equilibrium in the individual. \"All other conceptual forms divide up the human being because they are either exclusively founded on the sense or spiritual part of his being. The aesthetic conception alone makes him whole, since it must harmonise both aspects of his nature.\" \u2014^Schiller also specifically \"happy middle\" mood of a \"free state\", because while in it both powers\u2014spirit and nature\u2014annul one another, such that the will becomes neither physically nor morally necessitated or determined. It is really nothing else but that particular mood of soul we mar\\ el at in theancient Greeks, and of which there scarcely exists anv trace in our lifeless and arid intellectual world.save in souls like Goethe, who stand before the world with living, childlike, loving and Joyful senses. Stones or bread? It is of the greatest importance to cultivate this \"happy middle\" state of soul. It is present as a unied seed in the child, who.se spiritual forces are still undivided, lending that liappiness to its nature that we envy, and which does not return again. It also holds sway at the heights of humanity, where spiritual forces are evenly and indivisibly formed without any predominance of the intellect or .sen.ses. for example\u2014in the arti.st. Here the harmonious alertness of the collective spiritual forces overcomes all natural drives and every desire for possession and pleasure, as well as that one-sided aspect of our spirit that is only directed towards the purposes of things. The senses lend a lustre to the reflective spirit as soon as all desirousness has withdrawn. Our spiritual nature then transforms this into innocent delight, for in the initial beholding of things it forgoes the question regarding their purposefulness for us. Viewing puiposefulness as usefulness is to consider only one of its sides, and only occupies one aspect of our spirit. In the view outlined here the total sum of all jointly working forces eliminates the one-sided prejudices of the spirit or senses. \u2014For in teaching, every one-sided intellectual activity transforms any subject\u2014be it the most living and spirited\u2014into an indigestible stony mass. As a consequence, our youth arc then supplied with stones instead of bread, a meal naturally impossible to change into flesh and blood, and like in life is therefore cast out undigested; a fact also learnt by closely examining with unvarnished eyes that broad fabric of our education\u2014the curriculum. For instance, the torment starts in the very rst lesson, when the child has to comprehend\u2014a thing entirely irrelevant and unintere.^iting to it!\u2014that a word is composed of different sounds, or more precisely, of vowels and consonants. And when there then follows every kind of reading method, we label them using such biu-baric terms as \"spelling\" or \"to sound\", or even \"to syllable\"! In any event here a healthy outlook always grasps more, because the form of the word is comprehended more quickly and readily as a whole than by using the methods above. This is especially true if the word is pictorial, for this greatly enhances understanding and communication. Also particularly frustrating is that instrument of torture for vouthful minds that goes under the nameHm flwo ni fm \"Bread, not stones\": narrative material in Lower School history (and other) lessons\u2014here in Class 5\u2014forms a large part of the educational 'diet' (topi. A / 7-\\ear-old's colour impression of Beethoven's 5th Symphony {bottom).of \"grammar\". Here things are taught that are not only absolutely without value for scholars and a nightmare for the lay person, but which have been fashioned into entire systems by pedantic natures convinced of their usefulness. These systems have been called (rather impolitely) \"a profundity inappropriate for uncivili.sed mind.s\".\u2014We are referring of course to the hair-splitting grammatical analysis carried out in our primary schools. The \" n-. T- painful demeanour of the pupil when faced with these operations is only apparently transformed into an active task, if one is fortunate enough to put the answer into his mouth when asking the question, or by all manner of trickery in the attempt to humour him. Thus the teacher is often in the same position as a dentist who has to extract a tooth from the child, carrying out all.sorts of different antics to distract him. just so that he will sit still! \u2014In all truth, it is no small matter to teach a village lad how to make \"complex sentences containing similar kinds of adverbial clauses\"; or how one \"expresses the adverbial clauses of principal, concessive and conditional clauses in the form of a question\". The young lad would surely prefer to have a tooth extracted than to be taught such things! Here he is overcome by anxiety and cold-sweats at the very thought! However, in his modesty he will believe: he possesses no talent for the subject. And yet we must confess: he did not lack the talent, but the fault lay with the schooling, that literally barred any access to a clear judgment of the facts.This occurred because we allowed the mind to aimlessly flay about in abstractions, which the child had to memorise without any real participation on his part. A child's joy in language Should we continue further, and see how education deals with a subject that should only evoke pleasure, delight and blissful elevation\u2014we mean, how it deals with poetry? Even more so than with the teaching of language, which will be discussed in more detail below, the pupil brings with it the greatest receptivity for poetry. In song, games and dance, the rhythm of language has already become a valuable source of aesthetic pleasure. In countless children's games (often combined in a wholly 32 33nonscnsictU manner), we discover rhythmical word-lormalions.Thisjustiesihe leaching of these rhythmical series of words in the classroom, or even their inclusion in children's books of ABC, as Heinrich Deinhardl has done. Later the class will fondly recall these with looks of delight in their eyes. And this is even more the case with songs, ballads and numerous kinds of poems, which are certainly not lacking in our present cultural epoch. Y et what are we to do when metrics and poetics are formally taught as a subject in the higherclasses, often in accordance with a handbook, so that the young become incapable of any true enjoyment of the poet? Or when one also believes the higher classes must be taught the history of literature, a subject naturally dependent on completeness, so that in the end the pupil can't see the forest for the trees! That is, the pupil is taught poetics and the history of literature to facilitate an enjoyment of the poet, yet doesn't view the aesthetic enjoyment in the subject itself, but in the completeness of the numerous facts to be examined! \u2014As long as memorisation is emphasised he will only be left with xed opinions and a crude appreciation of the different poetic styles and writers, yet it is the natural freshness of the subject that should be brought to the fore! \u2014This is the educational predicament we nd ourselves in if we are unable to raise ourselves up to those heights, or are incapable of maintaining that open attitude which freely holds the balance between the spirit and the senses. In reality, this is what culture boldly demands of the teacher. \u2014It asks him to represent an ideal, to be the highest human being, as Schiller does of the poet; it is an ideal embodied in Goethe, with the philosopher merely a caricature in comparison. Now. once a person recognises an ideal as one fullling his aspirations, it can and will never be loo lofty for him. We also mustn't forget that the demand to revitalise our conceptions and rekindle our enthusiasm by aspiring to the heights of great men must not be confused with the demand to be their equal. T h e t e a c h e r m u s t s t r i v e f o r a d i r e c t a n d unprejudiced view of reality, to give assistance in turn to immediate conceptions. What is required is an energetic immersion in the subject with one's entire soul out of a love of truth, not out of self- seeking or external compulsion. Yet compulsion must be applied if one demands a knowledge f o u n d e d o n m e m o r i s a t i o n a l o n e . Fichte wonderfully discusses this point in his Speeches to the German Nation (2nd speech). He says, \"It is a soul-burden and not a soul-activity ifthe memory alone is called into action: and thus it is not surprising to behold the pupil's great unwillingness in this regard. The acquaintance with wholly foreign and entirely uninteresting things is then a poor substitute for this burden. We therefore have to allay the pupil's aversion with the promisethis knowledge may be of use in the future; or that sKccess and a livelihood can only be won bv means of it\u2014yet only after overcoming the threat ofpunishment or recompense. We see that in order to make an impact upon the pupil here, knowledge is stressed from the outset as the setvant of oursensible well-bein^. Yet this kind of education is powerless for the development of a moral life\u2014in fact, it increases and contributes to the pupil's moral ruin, with his interests added to the interests of this ruin.\" We also arrived at this result in our earlier reflections: 'The development of the spiritual abilities alone should be at the basis of education, inflaming a desire for pure knowledge as such, while a slate of suffering receptivity lames and stifles all knowledge and moral sensibility from the very start.\" \u2014For \"its destructiveness consists in the fact that only the pupil's sensible well-being is promoted, and it does this by stimulating a fear or hope for this same well-being, whether in a present or future existence.\" \"In the place of that self-love\u2014we must foster and further a different kind of love, one that immediately and willingly proceeds onto the good, absolutely as such and out of its own inner nature.\" For what kind of child would be one who only learned so that it wouldn't be punished, or so it got good grades, or to receive future scholarly fame and fortune!? In our old and withered world, in which the generations are already horn intellectual, wouldn't we have to prefer the unruly child to such an all-too-clever child, one who looked beyond these considerations and just followed the strong i n c l i n a t i o n s o f h i s b l o o d ? T h u s , h o w d o w e engender that unassuming love of the true that is devoid of self-seeking and captivates the senses, yet also energetically stimulates all the soul-forces of our youth? Moreover, how do we acquire that youthful freshness of spirit innate in the ancient Greeks, and which appears to be reborn in Goethe himself? Lastly, how do we elevate ourselves to that aesthetic conception, which establishes the happy medium between spirit and nature? Lifelong learning Let us again cast a glance into the domain of education, where we can unfortunately see how it isn't to be done. Only after we have started from theKarl Julius Schrder (1825-1900) correct presuppositions, will we perhaps derive those guiding principles enabling us to full the demands outlined here, \u2014I cannot discuss how, within the debates concerning the organisation ofour school.s, education is frequently considered inan external and supercial manner, as a quantity able to be arbitrarily divided up. According to this view the \"correct allocation of the leaching hours\" is the main thing! Yet, how wc arc to skilfully teach all the best and most desirable subjects while making sure the individuality of the pupil\u2014whichshould be harmoniously developed as a uniedwhole\u2014is not overwhelmed, oppressed and confused, this is deemed to be of lesser importance! 1 also cannot go into the trouble that results when the different educational institutions proceed in this fashion along their own separate paths, and never at any lime consider education as a whole. \u2014I will only mention the training of primary school teachers. There we unfortunately behold how the words of the schoolmaster or instruction textbook continue to dominate! \"For what is printed in black and white, can safely be taken home.\" Here we ndthe quantum of knowledge demanded by the State dispensed in compendia; and once the teacher has imbibed it we say he is nished. On account of completeness these books commonly contain agreat deal more than can be taught; nevertheless, the requirements usually asked in total of the teacher are in reality exceedingly small. Of course, for the examinations the requirements are perhaps innitely and intolerably large; yet as demands asked of the teacher himself, who should desire to have a life-long and permanent relation to the fount of his knowledge if his teaching is not to become sterile\u2014they are actually futile and worthless. \u2014Ordoes anyone believe the quantum of knowledge demanded of the teacher is sufcient to last a human life-time? Of course it isn't, and we shouldn't then be surprised when a teacher who believes he possesses \"what is needed for the classroom\" presumes he is a capable teacher at 18-20 years of age; or when he becomes engrossed in all sorts of private interests and pursuits in the course of life, to discover his teaching is immune to advancement and his knowledge unable to be broadened. Such a teacher is today, just as he is tomorrow, and will be the same in yetu-s to come. Why does he need to learn more, especially if he has attended a \"good teacher training college\"?! \u2014The peasant farmer daily gathers experiences, and will never exhaust the knowledge of his profession; and yet the teacher issupposed to be \"nished and complete\" at 20 years of age! Every other profession demands a further development of its views and conceptions. Shouldn't this also be true of the teaching profession? Absolutely. The teacher must never believe his knowledge to be sufcient and closed; closed knowledge is dead knowledge, and as soon as he thinks it sufces, it will harden. All living knowledge generated by a direct and immediate conception is not only capable, but in need of innite expansion. Acontinuous and joyous interest in knowledge, as well as the desire to communicate it, uplifts the teacher, granting him the necessary vitality of soul. Yet so as not to be misunderstood, we have certainly demarcated a boundary here between the knowledge demanded of .scholars, and the knowledge required of the teacher. Such a boundary naturally comes into existence as soon as we realise the former knowledge is directed at solving the problems of science\u2014whereas the latter is concerned with the problems of life. Life itself and everyday experience must be the inexhaustible s o u r c e f r o m w h i c h t h e t e a c h e r d r a w s h i s knowledge. And hence, what is above all necessary for teaching is that the teacher becomes capable of this! {To be continued) 34 35Stress and the Waldorf Teacher: towards pre-emption through understanding by RICHARD HOUSE Introduction While the question of stress has received a great deal of research attention within education in general, there exists very little of substance in the published Waldorf literature on the stresses that might be specic to the Waldorf teacher's experience. A central feature of this article is its attempt to assess which aspects of the Waldorf teacher's workload are less stressful than that of the mainstream non- Waldorf teacher, and which aspects are distinctively different from those of the non-Waldorf teacher. The article will hopefully be useful to both existing and prospective Waldorf teachers in highlighting those demands peculiar to Waldorf teaching, some foreknowledge of which will surely help them to pre empt the more challenging aspects of those stresses. It may also interest disillusioned non-Waldorf teachers, many of whom are widely reported to be quitting their profession, and who might well embrace Waldorf teaching with enthusiasm if it could be demonstrated that, overall, Waldorf teaching offers teachers a signicantly less stressful working environment compared with the non-Waldorf sector. The article draws upon qualitative questionnaire survey data from British Waldorf teachers, with its main focus being on the class teacher\u2014though other types of teacher did also respond to the survey. Background issues It is useful to begin with a cautionary note about the very notion of 'stress' itself. A number of both academic and 'popular' commentators have not only displayed a considerable dose of scepticism as to whether 'stress' is a meaningful 'scientic' concept, but have even questioned its very existence as a valid concept. One Waldorf class teacher, for example, sent me a recent article from the Guardian newspaper (3/1/01, supplement, p. 10) entitled 'Stressed?...', which reported the provocative views of \"maverick psychologists\" that \"feeling bad at work is normal\"; that \"we're turning into a nation of emotional hypochondriacs\"; and that \"People feel 'stressed'b^ause they believe in the rst place that feelingstressed is a legitimate condition... Without such a belief, the subjective feeling is not possible\". I must say at the outset that I am very sympathetic to any approach which dares to challenge ttdce-for-granted, culturally fashionable norms\u2014and there is no doubt that 'stress' has become a very fashionable 'catch-all' term which may , at least in some usages, obscure at least as much as it reveals about challenging human experience. At its worst, uncritical, culturally fashionable cliches can certainly actively create subjective experience and constrain it along certain lines such that it can become very difcult not to think about our experience in certain culturally determined ways.'\" It is clearly important to be alert to this danger , then, when investigating the phenomenon of 'stress', and not necessarily to accept it uncritically as an unproblematic given of modem human experience. Concomitantly, we should also be open to the way in which 'stress discourse' might 'socially construct' the very ways in which we think about and conceptualise our own subjective experience. But 1 think it would be equally unhelpful simply to reject the validity of 'stress' as some socially constructed myth of the modem imagination\u2014for its very cultural existence and comparatively sudden emergence within modem discourse must surely be an important reflection of something. The cmcial question, of course, then becomes: a reflection of whati The consideration of stress that is specic to the teaching profession is hardly a new phenomenon: for over a quarter of a centuiy there has been voluminous, world-wide empirical research into the question, with results that have consistently found that teaching is indeed a profession peculiarly susceptible to stress\u2014 and for a whole range of (complexly interrelated) reasons (see Further Reading section). What does appear to be new, however, is the quite unprecedented degree of stress that teachers within mainstream (state) education have been suffering in recent years\u2014certainly within the UK. The press and broadcast media have reported ever-escalatingnumbers of horror stories about the manifold stresses that teachers are under , with particular prominence being given to a seemingly irreversible recmitment crisis, the advent of the school 'four-day week', and anumber of highly distressing teacher-suicides whichseem to have been directly related to a pernicious 'surveillance culture' which is arguably de- professionalising and 'infantilising' a generation of teachers (principally via the infamous Ofce for Standards in Education\u2014OFSTED).'-' In my own work as an NHS counsellor in general medical practice, I have in recent years worked with a numbers of teachers who have had to retire early on health grounds, sometimes on the verge of emotionalbreakdown; and it has seemed to me on hearing these distressing stories that there is something quite fundamentally wrong within the teaching profession, that has been, and continues to be, expediently (or even cynically?) ignored by politicians and policymakers alike. Y et it would be naive necessarily to assume that, in comparison, the Steiner (Waldorf) sector is relatively immune from teacher stress. Certainly, before researching this article my own anecdotal experience from talking with Waldorfteachers had been that they commonly nd their work demanding... but in what precise ways 'demanding' or 'stressful' seems to have received little if any systematic consideration in the Waldorf literature. The really interesting questions then become, rst: to what extent there might be systematic differences between the nature of the demands upon, and stresses experienced by, Waldorf and non-Waldorf teachers; and second, the extent to which stress in teaching is a universal, cultural phenomenon which ail- pervasively cuts across all teaching settings, rather than being predominantly an artefact of the relentless 'modernising utilitarianism' which has swept through the maintained sector in recent years(starting with the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1988). It was in part to address these important questions that the research reported below was conducted. The research survey In early December 2000 I compiled a 'stress questionnaire', three copies of which I sent to each of the 18 established Waldorf schools in Britain. In the covering letter I wrote that \"I am currently conducting some research on the vocational stressesexperienced by Waldorf teachers, and to this end I am conducting a questionnaire survey to gather information for an article on 'Stress and the Waldorf teacher'... I would be most grateful if you would draw the questionnaire to the attention of your teachers atthe next College meeting, to see if any would like to complete the questionnaire\". Respondents were assured of total condentiality if they required it:... \"Please be assured that the article will be written in such a way that it will be impossible to identify any individual's responses to the questionnaire. Do please state if you'd prefer not to be quoted anonymously [in the article]\". It is crucial to emphasise the methodologically limited nature of this survey. The 14 completed questionnaires which I received were clearly not anything approaching a statistically random or representative sample: rather, the sample is entirely self-selected, and in this sense it cannot be assumed accurately to represent the generality of Waldorf teachers' views about and experience of stress in their jobs. A far more methodologically sophisticated sampling design would be required to obtain such results. However , what the survey can legitimately be used for is to provide impressionistic, suggestive indications of at least some of the concerns of at least some Waldorf teachers\u2014indications which could, for example, then provide guidelines for furtherresearch in this area, or provide the basis for discussions within schools about how the demands of the working environment might be more successfully managed. Summary statistics of respondents Gender: 8 males, 6 females Age: 30-39 all teaching: 0-5 3 6-10 years: 2 Over 10 a Waldorf teacher: 0-5 years: 6 6-10 years: 3 Over 10 years: 5 Average years in all teaching: 13 years Average years as a Waldorf teacher: 8 years Number of sample with non-Waldorf teaching experience: 9 36 37Type of teacher: Kindergarten: Teacher: Upper School: 3 Specialist: 2 Part-time: 2 (T otals sum to more than 14 due to dual/multiple roles of some teachers.) Results Question 1: What do you consider to be the most stressful aspects of your work as a Waldorf teacher? A considerable number of 'stressors' were mentioned. Most frequently raised (with eight mentions) was parental expectations/criticisms. There were seven mentions each for general teaching demands and workload, and the \"polities' and inefciencies of the collegiate system. There were ve mentions each for level of pay/salaries and paucity of resources/poor working conditions. Finally, three mentions each were received for criticisms/conflicts with colleagues and covering for absentee colleagues. Some interesting comments were: Many consider our schools as altemative so they may nd conventional authority, respect and discipline hard concepts. We sell a 'wonderful' system\u2014might this make parental expectations too unrealistic? When starting out one does not have the experience to put parents' unrealistic expectations and excessive worries in perspective. Stressor: a lack of a proper framework in which to deal with parental criticism. Work with children does not give stress, unlike in the state sector\u2014rather, parents and colleagues are the source of stress! It is interesting to note that four potential Waldotf- specic sources of stress only received one mention each\u2014i.e. holding the mood of the class; difficulties in negotiating needs-based salaries; organising festivals; and carrying children 'in spirit'. Question 2: What personal ^coping strategies', if any, do you deliberately follow in order to help mitigate the effects of teaching stress? Respondents listed no less than 25 different coping strategies, just ve of which were mentioned three times or more: viz. meditation (ve mentions); and three mentions each for varied leisure time interests:walking (e.g. recreationally, or to and from school); sharing with and seeking support from others; and swimming. Clearly, it is important that teachers nd their own preferred coping mechanisms, which will reflect their interests, available opportunities andtheir particular personality/temperament. Question 3: Are there existing institutional mechanisms within the school which you think help to ameliorate teacher stress? And what additional institutional mechanisms might further help to alleviate stress? Five respondents answered 'no' to this question. Of those who answered 'yes', two factors received three mentions each\u2014^namely , the support provided by the College of Teachers, and mentoring or 'co- colleagueship' practices. Several respondents suggested potentially helpful innovations they would like to see\u2014namely: more creative work to facilitate trust between the teachers and respect for opinions; a buffer between the teachers and the responsibility of day-to-day mnning of the school\u2014allowing them to get on with their teaching; someone the parents could turn to as a mediator; proper line management structure and proper monitoring of management. Other interesting statements: Collegial support is essential. We have a college retreat once a year and strive to make time for social and artistic time together. This contributes to a supportive environment to work in. A mandated system of task management is being developed. Teacher/college meetings can be both supportive and stressful. Doing break duties and cleaning is stressful\u2014^people should be employed for this. Question 4: What character qualities do you consider are helpful for enabling the Waldorf class teacher to deal adequately with the stresses of teaching? Respondents listed no less than 30 distinct qualities. Those most frequently mentioned were patience and a sense of humour (ve mentions each); determination/persistence, enthiisiastn/inspiration and and a phlegmatic temperament! (three mentions each). Question 5: Did your Waldorf Teacher IVainingprepare you adequately for the stresses you subsequently encountered as a Waldorf teacher? yVnd if not, what could the course have done to prepare you more adequately in this regard? It was striking that no less than ten of the fourteen respondents answered 'no' to this question (two with added emphasis!), while just one answered 'yes'. Here are a number of comments made: [There is a need to] make students more aware of problems that might arise, [with] a course in coping with people management. Journal work with counselling and biography work would provide the necessaiy foundation of preparation for teaching. The ideal of the child and W aldorf teaching, and its perception in reality, are often poles apart... Courses need time to fully explore the gulf between the extremes\u2014^which largely involves self- understanding and self-development, so that the necessary life skills can underpin the work of the developing teacher. [I would have liked] more indications that working at a deeper (soul-spiritual) level [with children] makes other demands [on one]. I don't believe any course can adequately prepare one for the multi-faceted demands of being a teacher, but education on self-health and sleep life could be strengthened. Question 6: What stress-relevant advice/counsel, if any, would you offer to a new Waldorf class teacher who was about to embark upon a rst teachingjob? Nearly 30 distinct suggestions were made for the new teacher . It is revealing to categorise these according to whether they were more self- or environment- focused\u2014for just 4 of the 29 suggestions were unambiguously concemed with actively engaging with the environment of teaching (as opposed to being directed at one's own personal attitudes, beliefs, self-care etc.). These four suggestions were: saying 'no' to inappropriate 'extras' (two mentions); not allowing oneself to be pestered by over- demanding parents (two mentions); making firm boundaries for children; and addressing problems immediately they arise. There were just four other suggestions which received more than one mention\u2014i.e. don't neglect your home/family life (five mentions); prepare well in advance (three mentions); avoid perfectionism (two mentions); and seek good mentoring/supervision (two mentions). Question 7: If you've also taught in the non- Waldorf (e.g. state) sector, what differences are there, if any , between the teaching stresses you encountered there and those in the Waldorf sector? This question elicited some very interesting responses, and overall presented a very mixed, complex picture. On the one hand, there were many aspects of the state system which respondents regarded as substantially more stressful than the Waldorf environment\u2014e.g. \"a mechanistic soulless curriculum\"; the stress of larger classes (twomentions); having to deal with more \"damaged\" families; the boredom of teaching disaffected students; exams detracting from the joy of learning; far worse levels of pupil self-discipline; and the lack of a shared, collective vision. On the other hand, one respondentthe state system's clearer, more 'objective' framework for teaching; and four respondents mentioned that the state schools' clearer management structure did help to support the teacher. A number of Waldorf-specic stresses were also listed: viz. lack of money and time; more stressful human relations (e.g. with colleagues); longer meetings encroaching on preparation time; higher expectations from parents; more mixed ability and special needs demands; and being much more involved in 'carrying the school'. Some interesting quotations: In state teaching I found it to be more intellectual and one was stressed in a different way. The demands were more on the astral body. In Waldorf the demands in the Lower School are more on the life forces. An enormous difference\u2014cavernous.

[In state teaching] stress was due to too many abstract concepts being driven home by the teacher\u2014result: teacher with fried brains only alive by caffeine injection!! Question 8: Any other comments Here is a selection of additional comments offered by respondents: 38 391 did a four-year counselling iraining...

Stress [is] often of our own making. People here have soParsifal's journey to the Grail castle\u2014painting by a 17 year-old (see article on p.24). little appreciation of what life is really like 'OUT THERE' in other schools... We are so lucky here, a s a r e o i u \" c h i l d r e n : b e a u t i f u l e n v i r o n m e n t s , flexible curricula, smaller teaching groups, no \"boss' mentality, a spiritual focus for our work, longer holidays, supportive parents, and a more healthy rhythm to our work. Discussion and conclusions The results reponed above largely speak for themselves. The responses to quesdons 1.2 and 6 do strongly suggest that teachers possibly feel relatively powerless to effect changes in their 'external'working environment, focusing instead on self-care or self-change responses to the demands of their work. One respondent even described how her work as a Waldorf teacher was \"a form of sacricial service\". Certainly, it seems that there are signicant levels of stress in Waldorf schools stemming from difculties with parental expectations, the collegiate type of management suucture. in-school human relations and low pay levels (though it is inleresUng tliat the latter was mentioned less frequently than might have been e.xpected). However, these difculties are arguably more ihtm compensated for by the far greater educationaljicedoin ill W aldoif schools compared witii the slate sector . Indeed, one class teacher wrote movingly that he felt \"bles.sed to be in my job, not stressed... it is a ^ronderful job. Maybe things would be easier with more money, more staff and belter facilitie,s\u2014but maybe Ihcy wouldn't. 1 have worked In many jobs, as you know\u2014I count my blessings. I do hope you will nd some way of expressing the sheer joy to be had in teaching in a Steiner .school\". Coda: A need for further re.search? If. on reading this article, other Waldorf teachers wereinterested in completing the 'stress questionnaire', they can write to me at the address below for a copy , or else simply complete the questions as set out above and send the answers to me. Comments on the article's ndings would also be most welcome. If 1 receive sufcient of a response, 1 am very open to writing an update/follow-up article for Steiner Education. It would be particularly interesting to hear from teachers in countries other than the UK, so that international experience can be compared\u2014and. perhaps, international/global trends identied. This article has been largely empirical and descriptive rather than theoretical or analytical in nature. There are a number of questions about the 'unconscious', emotional, spiritual and cultural forces and pressures involved in teaching, and the peculitu-ly distinctive stresses to which these give rise, which I would also hope to explore in a future article.

In a book for the general reader, unacquainted with Steiner's careful exposition in a treatise such as Given the demands on many Waldorf teachers' time, it Theosophy, this is a tricky task. The author's approach might be thought a luxury to sink into an armchair with is as follows. He takes the case of the paediatric an autobiography of Ais dimension.

Not only for the general reader but also (ADHD), a signicant issue in American society, and for the educationist, this work, though at times looks at four major current psychological schools of demanding, is enlightening as well as being a good thought conceming its causes. These are the read. Perhaps it is because Steiner was conscious that biophysical school which sees, in dietary and/or he lived on more than one level that the incidents in his 42 43life, as well as his reflections on them, appear to have that bit more than the personal signicance that is usually associated with autobiography\u2014something in the nature of 'parables of the heart'. Thus, for the person interested in education in the light of the 'science of the spirit', there are many topicstouched on that will set W aldorf bells ringing. Indeed, the whole work is a campanile\u2014from the pull-stringbook through which Steiner spontaneously learnt to r e a d ( 1 7 ) , t o t h e t e a c h e r o f g e o m e t r y h e m e t a t a g e n i n e (22), to the idea of the nature story (86), to the educational value of descriptive characterisation as distinct from conceptual 'denition' (92), to the nature of picture thinking and its place in human development (106, 253), to the value of lively reports (234), to the insights into gender questions (96, 129, 357 n243), tothe importance of the teacher striving to become a W eltmensch (242), to the signicance of children's play (75), to the use of colour stories in liberating colour -om being shackled to the realistic (180), to the inception of 'main-lesson' books (320 nl24), to fairytales (122), to the creative polarity of Apollonian / Dionysian (172), to, to, to... These references (and theyare only a small selection to which 1 am making little more than a mention)\u2014come across as biographicalovertones that later sound forth from the great symphony of Waldorf. But beneath the rich upper partials, there are educational themes that boom coptantly throughout the work, like a magnicentlyvoiced tenor bell wrought in some world-famous foundry. First and foremost there is the subject of education itself\u2014its nature, and the fact that it is the means by which (through tutoring) Steiner was able to make ends meet in his student days. There is his constant interest in the latest scientic inventions and literary ideas\u2014something which eventually singled out the Waldorf curriculum rom all others. There is Steiner's emerging perception\u2014won through 30 years of persistent inner work\u2014of the threefold nature of the human being and the principle of metamorphosis which is intimately bound together with it. And finally\u2014finally in the slender fi*amework of this short review\u2014there are the dozens of references to Goethe and the long journey that destiny offered Steiner as the rst signicant companion, might one say, to Goethean science, a core curriculum theme that would benet from still more discussion in Waldorf circles. Without wishing to be sentimental over synchronicity, one cannot help noticing that this edition, in restoring the original number of chapters in which the work rst appeared as a serial (threescore and ten) highlights the fact that it is an autobiography which was broken off by Steiner's untimely death in 1925. (After the last chapter, the words 'to be continued' were omitted.) At the same time it is fortuitous that the narrative takes us to 1907, the year in which his book The Education of the Child in the Light ofAnthroposophy was rst published. T o conclude with one last echo from the metaphor of the campanile, this unique peal is even further enhanced by over a hundred pages of annotations (a quarter of the publication) written by the editor PaulA l l e n .

The Challenge of the Will by Margret Meyerkort and Rudi Lissau, Rudolf Steiner College Press sb 93pp \u00a39.95. The standard idea of a handbook is one that, like a manual, tells the reader in clear terms what to do. Well named, one might think: enable the reader to carry out certain actions that will have guaranteed results. What better way could there be of going about cleaning the carburettor? But in education, subjects such as crafts notwithstanding, an altogether deeper attitude towardsthe life of will is necessary, an attitude that this book is w e l l q u a l i e d t o e n g e n d e r . T h e a u t h o r s h a v e a d o p t e d a compact style that combines sharp decisiveness with open-armed freedom. They offer the nest cherries from the cake of their rich life experience. The result is far from being a handbook: they inspire the 'hand' of the teacher / parent / carer to become a creative faculty . A remarkable achievement. The work assumes considerable knowledge of anthroposophy . But it repays re-reading as one facesthe challenge of the will\u2014both the will that comes towards one 'om the young child, as well as that mostillusive of all our faculties: the will within\u2014that faculty which is destined to become a co-creator. B.M. CORRESPONDENCE Dear Editor, Having read a recent issue of Steiner Education 1 amamazed at all the wonderful work that is going on around the world. But 1 am wondering how Waldorf education at the present moment can be promoted in the less privileged areas of the world. In the Cape Flats in the Western Cape there is a lot of gangsterism, drugsand violence. 1 have played table tennis with young people who live in crime-riddled areas. Some of themshow no emotions. They have not been taught sensitivity and respect. 1 am sure that Waldorf education would help to develop such vital qualities. 1 know that work is being done; 1 would like to see new Waldorf schools opening in less privileged areas all over the world. 1 have just nished matric and can't help but wonder why 1 as a privileged person was allowed Waldorf education while other disadvantaged people were not.
