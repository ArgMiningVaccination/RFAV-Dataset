Due to pregnancy, the risk of developing complications like [pneumonia](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pneumonia) are very high, which can pose as a problem during childbirth. [Miscarriage](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/miscarriage), low birth weight, premature birth are some of the major issues, which might develop if the mother has suffered from flu during her pregnancy. Although flu [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) during pregnancy has certain risks, it has been observed that in most cases the benefits of [inactivated](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/inactivated-influenza-vaccine) influenza vaccine outweigh the risks. However, Live attenuated influenza vaccine is not recommended at all during pregnancy. Recommendations across the world suggest that prevention of influenza by administration of inactivated influenza vaccine is the best intervention in pregnancy. The vaccine for Flu should be administered before the onset of flu season. RANZCOG, NHS UK, RCOG, FOGSI recommends inactivated flu vaccine for all the pregnant women unless there are any contraindications. Taking inactivated influenza vaccine can be beneficial in multiple ways: - Prevents maternal complications: During pregnancy, the heart and lungs go through extra [stress](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/stress-disorder). Pregnancy can also severely impact your immune system. Opting for a inactivated flu vaccine can decrease significantly, the chance of falling severely ill due to flu. - Prevents [pregnancy problems](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pregnancy-problems)due to flu: Getting infected by flu during pregnancy can increase the chance of miscarriage during childbirth. Administering inactivated flu shots can prevent miscarriage as well as premature birth and low birth weight. - Protects the baby after birth: Infants have a huge risk of getting infected with flu after birth. But as vaccines cannot be administered to them until they are 6 months old, it is the best recourse to opt for inactivated flu shots during pregnancy as the [antibodies](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/torch-screen-antibodies/health-feed)pass onto the child from the mother via placenta. The child can hence be protected from such diseases. Some concerns Often, one [fear](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fear) about the vaccine, is the development of Gullain Barre syndrome. This is very rare and the risk of GBS are higher following influenza like illness. Also, if the patient is allergic to eggs they are advised to consult a physician. Flu vaccines have traces of egg [protein](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/protein-benefits-sources-and-side-effects) in it. Certain precautions are taken after studying the patient's medical history. The doctor may keep the patient under observation. Or in certain instances the physician might suggest alternative flu vaccine, which do not contain egg protein. Physicians decide it after studying any prior [allergic reaction](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/allergic-reaction). As per the WHO SAGE position paper, from 1990 to 2009 the vaccine adverse event reporting system database in USA reported only 20 serious adverse events following administration of trivalent influenza vaccine to an estimated 11.8 million pregnant women.
