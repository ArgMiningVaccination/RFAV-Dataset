However, some methods entail a considerable degree of animal suffering. In particular, a number of procedures for testing the efficacy of vaccines involve the deliberate exposure of animals, with or without prior vaccination, to a disease-causing organism or microbial toxin. Some of the animals in these 'challenge tests' suffer very serious effects, and may die from infection or the effects of toxin action. Some safety tests on vaccines are also of very high concern, such as the test for neurovirulence of oral polio vaccine, in which primates suffer neurological symptoms, including paralysis. Alternative methods of testing are urgently needed to stop animals suffering in tests of this kind. Indeed, there is also a need for more reliable and consistent tests, and alternative methods can and should be superior to the testing methods on animals that are currently in use. \" - [RSPCA](http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&assetId=1232715021222&mode=prd) (the whole "}
