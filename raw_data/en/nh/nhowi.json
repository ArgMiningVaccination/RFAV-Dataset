Order your copy of Dr. Kellyann's Bone Broth Diet now! Why Bone Broth? Health Benefits and More The health benefits of bone broth are all due to the nature of the cooking process. A high-quality bone broth should slow-cook grass-fed animal bones for six hours or more. When the bones simmer, the connective tissues and marrow inside release a steady supply of nutrients. Bone broth is packed with many essential nutrients, like collagen \u2014 plus, it's low in calories, sugar, and carbohydrates. Incorporating nourishing bone broth into your daily routine can also help you on your weight loss journey. The added protein can help to keep you feeling fuller for longer in between meals and can support and sustain muscle mass. Drinking bone broth everyday can add up to 32 grams of protein to your diet. The nutrients found in bone broth can include: Collagen Amino acids (Glutamine, glycine, proline) Vitamin A Vitamin K Iron Calcium Phosphorus Magnesium - Potassium When the collagen in the bones is cooked, it turns into gelatin. When that gelatin is broken down in our digestive systems, it takes the form of amino acids, which our bodies can then use to make more protein. The amino acid glycine, which is found in bone broth, has many important jobs. It helps the body produce joint cartilage, which can support joint health. Glycine can also support sleep by regulating body temperature and promoting serotonin production, which has a direct impact on the body's melatonin synthesis. Glutamine, glycine, and proline are three amino acids found in bone broth that can support your gut health. These amino acids can help support your gut microbiome and your intestinal lining, which can all help make digestion easier on your system.

Frequently Asked Questions The bone broth diet has three components: Bone broth, intermittent fasting, and eating foods that burn fat and are low in sugars and carbohydrates. It's an efficient way to lose weight while improving the elasticity of the skin with collagen protein. On fasting days, remember that bone broth can break your fast. For tips on how to eat a low-carb diet, how to meal plan for a keto diet, and how to cook bone broth recipes, check out our blog. If you eat a paleo diet, start the bone broth diet by drinking two servings of Dr. Kellyann's beef or chicken bone broth. To combine bone broth with intermittent fasting, follow Dr. Kellyann's 16:8 rule \u2014 fast for 16 hours, and eat only during the remaining eight hours. You may have one to two cups of bone broth for breakfast. Make sure to also avoid high-carb and potentially irritating foods like legumes and high-starch veggies, as well as switch to low-carb sweeteners like monk fruit extract. You should also make sure you're getting plenty of healthy fats and non-starchy vegetables to maintain your nutrition. The difference between stocks, broths, and bone broths is the cook times. Bone broth must cook for at least six hours. During that cooking time, nutrients are extracted from the bones and connective tissues. That is what sets bone broth apart. If you follow Dr. Kellyann's program and suggestions, you may see the results you want in just 21 days. Making bone broth a part of your everyday lifestyle after the 21 days can be an easy and stress-free way to maintain your overall wellness. Simply replace sugary or caffeinated beverages in the mid-morning or mid-afternoon with a cup of savory bone broth. "}
