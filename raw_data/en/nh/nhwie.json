(Vitamin C, Amino, Antioxidant) GLUTATHIONE Skin tone boost- IV DRIP | $60/ buy package of 4 $220 ($20 savings) Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant that's found naturally in the body. As we age or become ill, our natural production slows down. Free radicals cause oxidative stress on the body. This can result in increased signs of aging and illness. We need antioxidants to fight off these free radicals. Glutathione, as a master antioxidant, can help to ward off this oxidative stress, improving our energy and skin tone. NAD+ Anti Aging and Brain Health Replenishing cellular levels of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) give your cells the opportunity to live longer, healthier lives. Research shows that as we age, levels of NAD+ decline substantially either due to lifestyle, diet, stress, toxins, or a host of other factors. Because of its key role in many [biological processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342515/), when NAD+ levels are low we are more susceptible to neuro and muscular degeneration, it compromises our cardio-metabolic health, and it compromises our capacity for cellular repair and resiliency. In short, declining levels of NAD+ compromises our cells' ability to create energy, resulting in accelerated aging and an increased risk of disease. Patients who have received NAD+ infusions report better focus and mental clarity. Neuro-inflammation, amyloid-beta plaques, mitochondrial damage, and increased oxidative stress contribute to cognitive decline. NAD+- dependent enzymes called [sirtuins](https://journals.lww.com/co-psychiatry/Abstract/2012/05000/Sirtuins_in_cognitive_ageing_and_Alzheimer_s.11.aspx) have shown to [benefit brain health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342515/) by acting on amyloid plaques, repairing DNA, lowering inflammation, and promoting neuronal function, which in turn can prevent or delay the onset of mild cognitive decline. Brain Health For optimal brain health results, we prescribe 500mg per dose administered over 5 sessions. Booster sessions are recommended every 4-6 weeks for the first 3 months and then as needed per your experience. - 2500mg - $2000.00 (5 therapy sessions at $400 each) - 500mg - $1500.00 (1 x monthly for 3 months booster) - BNAD sublingual tablet- $75 (1 daily with meal) *Cost includes Myers Cocktail and Glutathione IV which prepares your body to maximize the efficacy of the NAD+ infusions. Anti-Aging Declining levels of NAD+ compromises our cells' ability to create energy, resulting in accelerated aging and an increased risk of disease. - 1500mg- $1500 (3 therapy sessions at $500 each) - 500mg - $500.00 (1 x monthly for 3 months booster) - BNAD sublingual tablet- $75 (1 daily with meal) *Cost includes Myers Cocktail and Glutathione IV which prepares your body to maximize the efficacy of the NAD+ infusions.
