You may have originally heard him in the highly popular episode \" [The Crazy Future Of Medical Biohacking: Skull Resets, Suppositories, Nasal Sprays, Nebulizers, Sound Therapy & More With Dr. John Lieurance.](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/biohacking-podcasts/medical-biohacking/)\", in which we delved into everything from Amazonian herbal [rap\u00e9](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/kambo) nasal spray to nebulizing glutathione to NAD suppositories and a whole lot more. Today's episode promises to be just as riveting, but is focused around one molecule in particular that John has been intensively studying and is now releasing a groundbreaking book about: melatonin. We'll answer questions about and also take a deep dive into the science behind melatonin topics such as: Should you consider melatonin supplementation? How much is too much? Does melatonin lower your own endogenous production? What delivery mechanism of melatonin is best? Is melatonin good for anything besides sleep? Should anyone not take melatonin? Can you \"reset\" your circadian rhythm with high-dose melatonin supplementation? So who is John (just in case you didn't hear my first podcast with him)? Dr. John Lieurance is a naturopathic physician, chiropractic neurologist, and all-around expert in medical biohacking who has been in private practice in Florida for 25 years. He is the chief scientific advisor of [MitoZen Scientific](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/glutagenic) and heads up [Advanced Rejuvenation](https://advancedrejuvenation.us/), a multi-disciplinary clinic with a focus on treating chronic diseases, regenerative medicine, functional neurology, functional medicine, and stem cell research. Dr. Lieurance has spent most of his career focused on finding solutions for hearing loss, balance disorders, tinnitus, degenerative neurological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, autoimmune disease, chronic Lyme, Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS), and mold illness and has suffered from chronic Lyme and mold illness himself for many years. From his treatments, he has seen the same success and ability to recover and regain a normal life\u2014free from the chronic inflammation and pain associated with those disorders\u2014for himself as well as his patients.
