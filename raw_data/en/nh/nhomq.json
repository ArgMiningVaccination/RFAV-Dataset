However when it comes to implementation of these Laws/Principles agreement often stops. The Editorial Board of Homopathic Links has taken up the challenge to see if we, as an international community united in our love of Hahnemann sgreat contribu- tion to humanity, can reach united posi- tions regarding the extended practice of homeopathy. The series of articles outlined below deals with the often vexed issue of immunisationoptions. Vaccination has become a corner-stone of allopathic medicine, and a massive revenue earner for the pharmaceutical in- dustry. Yet there are genuine concerns re-garding its practical effectiveness and safety. Hom oprophylaxis (HP) provides a nontoxic and apparently comparatively ef-fective alternative to vaccination, yet there is disagreement within the homeopathic community as to its philosophical correct-ness and its empirical consequences. There is a great need for a united position on HP. Disunity affects our patients whoare often left confused by conflicting views, it gives encouragement to our allopathic detractors, and gives cause for regulatorsto view HP and homeopathy with suspi- cion. Over the course of six issues we shall ex- plore all aspects of HP, and invite interested practitioners to state and then supporttheir position regarding HP. These different views will be collected and published ei- ther in summary or in full where appropri-ate. An attempt will be made to reconciledifferences and to prepare a generally agreed evidence-based position on HP. Part 1: An Opportunity for Homeopathy? The dilemma is considered from the view- point of an intelligent patient who asks rea- sonable questions about immunisation and its options. The opportunity this presentsto homeopaths is made apparent, as is the need to respond with a generally united voice. Six different positions regarding HPthat homeopaths can take are identified,and practitioners are invited to state their position and write in support of it.Part 2: The Long-term Safety of Immunisation Options HP is nontoxic, but does the use of a long- term program disturb the subtle bodies? Vaccination is potentially toxic, and short-term adverse events are documented, buthas the long-term safety of the method been adequately quantified? These funda- mental questions regarding the long-termsafety of immunisation options will be ex- amined. Part 3: Positions within the Inter- national Homeopathic Community A review of the positions on HP by homeo- pathic associations around the world willbe conducted. As well, the feedback from practitioners requested in Part 1 support- ing a range of possible positions on HP willbe summarised. General conclusions about the extent of agreement/disagreement re- garding HP, informed by this analysis, willthen be made. Part 4: A Comparison of Effectiveness Evidence quantifying the effectiveness of vaccination and HP will be examined. New international research describing and ana-lysing HP interventions will be reported. Anevidence-based conclusion will be reached. Part 5: Towards International Agreement on Hom oprophylaxis A position on HP will be suggested, in- formed by the material presented in thepreceding articles. Once again, practition- ers will be invited to comment either briefly or at length, and these comments SUMMARY Immunisation is an area of medicine that can generate blind belief as well as aggressive disagreements both within and between allopathic and ho- meopathic professions. Trust in evidence becomes central to the different positions people take. Allopaths frequently criticise homeopathy, both fortreatment and prevention, as being devoid of \"scientific \"evidence, but also they face questions regarding the unreliability of data obtained from meta- analyses of clinical trials. It will be shown that data supporting the effec-tiveness of homeopathic immunisation is real, and is considerable. Howev- er disagreements among homeopaths about immunisation are acknowl- edged and a first step is proposed towards an international consensus posi-tion statement on hom oprophylaxis. This step involves identifying six possible positions a practitioner can take, and then offering homeopaths a chance to participate in an international survey where each practitioner may record their position and further state their views if they wish. Futurearticles in this series will expand the evidentiary basis of hom oprophy- laxis and work towards a consensus statement.

Part 6: An Agreed Position on Homoprophylaxis A final statement on HP will be presented within an edition of Homopathic Links de- voted to hom oprophylaxis. Suggestions by or for homeopathic regulatory bodies re- garding HP will be made. Substantive articles supporting or disagree- ing with the new majority position on HP will be published in this edition. The aim will be to accommodate differences, tomaximise agreement, and provide the clear majority of homeopaths with a position statement that is evidence-based, that is in-tellectually rigorous, and that delivers a consistent and practically useful interna- tional position on HP. Introduction to Part 1 Disagreement within any profession is ex- pected. Not all allopathic practitioners sup- port vaccination; not all homeopaths sup-port hom oprophylaxis (HP). The major difference is that the allopathic profession, as well as many governments and citizens,is massively influenced by the pervasive in- fluence of corporations that generate bil- lions of dollars in profits from vaccines andother pharmaceuticals. This influence is in-creasingly examined within allopathic jour- nals, but a recent contribution by Professor John Ioannidis and colleagues, people who are held in high regard within the allopathic community, put beyond any doubt the ex- tent of the corrupting influence of Big Phar-ma [1]. This influence imposes a consistent view on most allopaths, and many consum- ers who accept what they are told by allo-paths and health department officials. Within the homeopathic community dis- agreements are mainly conceptual con-cerning interpretations of the Law/Principle of Similars . However pragmatic (political) issues are becoming more common due toregulatory pressures. Some national ho- meopathic associations recommend vacci- nation, others are less prescriptive, and in-dividual homeopaths and their patients are often left confused by apparently con- flicting positions within the homeopathiccommunity. So this is a first step which hopes to recon- cile some of these differences, and allowthe profession to speak with a clear major-ity voice. Part A of this article attempts to define the problem from the patients/par-ents viewpoint -especially those who are seeking immunisation options. Part B looks at options for homeopaths, and invites in-terested practitioners to participate in an open discussion conducted through Hom- opathic Links to see what common ground can be found. Part A: The Vaccine Debate -A Question of Trust There are many difficult conversations in health care -how to best assist people dy- ing in pain; policies regarding foetal termi- nation; the ethics of spending a million dol- lars on a procedure to help one personrather than using that money to assist hun-dreds of others, and so on. But the conver- sation that attracts the most venomous dis- agreement relates to something where allsides have already agreed on the final goal -minimising the likelihood of a person (often an infant) being harmed by a poten-tially preventable infectious disease. The decision of whether to vaccinate against potentially serious diseases is one of the most difficult that many parents will face when raising their children. Most al-low the decision to be made for them andvaccinate according to Government recom- mendations. But a growing number of par- ents question whether vaccination is thebest option for their child based on their as- sessment of potential benefits and risks. Given the overwhelming level of \"official \" support for vaccination in most countries, one must ask why there is any doubt aboutthis issue at all. The answer for many is that they have lost trust in orthodox advice. There are real reasons why this has hap-pened, reasons which Health Departmentliterature and reports in the mainstream media have failed to address. There are tens of thousands of parents in Australia, and countless more international- ly, who have witnessed what they believe isdamage caused totheir children by vaccines. Yet, their genuine concerns are typically dis- missed by orthodox clinicians as being \"just coincidence \",\"hysteria \",\"ignorance \", and so on. Yet these parents live with real conse- quences every day of their lives, and view such conclusions as being arrogant and dis-missive of their genuine concerns.They are told that vaccines are proven to be safe, yet parents know that vaccine manu-factures only operate because they are in- demnified from prosecution by Govern- ment legislation. They see the huge Gov-ernment payouts made in vaccine damage compensation schemes in some countries (America has now passed the $2.5 billionmark [2]) proving that some adverse events do occur. They look up Government sites like the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Events Re-porting System) database containing hun-dreds of thousands of entries, so they know that there is too much here to be simple \"coincidence \"[3]. The more informed ask a simple question - where are the long-term studies examiningthe holistic health (intellectual, emotional and physical) of age-appropriate, fully vac- cinated and completely unvaccinated chil-dren? They don t find such studies. Instead they find relatively few studies which claim to prove the long-term safety of vaccina- tion, but either these studies don t consider the holistic health of participants, or don t look at age-appropriate cohorts, or don t compare fully vaccinated and unvaccinatedcohorts -the combination of which is nec- essary to conclusively demonstrate long- term safety. And these commonly citedstudies have other faults -for example, the very large \"Danish studies \"published in 2002 [4] and 2003 [5], credited with prov-ing that autism is not related to thimerosaland MMR, are weakened by significant con- founders and researcher fraud [6,14]. So based on careful research, some intelli- gent and reasonable people ask a second question -we are told repeatedly that the risks from vaccines are less than the risks from the diseases they prevent, but if the long-term risks are not fully quantified, how can such a statement be scientifically credible? That question has yet to be an- swered other than by returning to the lessthan adequate studies already cited. Finally, some of these parents continue their research and find that there is a mid-dle path -immunising their child homeo- pathically, a practice that was first used in 1798 (vaccines were first used in 1796).They are told by orthodox authorities that homeopathically prepared substances have nothing in them, so they can t work, and al- so that there is no evidence of effectiveness.All agree that \"nothing \"cannot be toxic, so the real question then becomes -is there evidence of effectiveness?

This experienceshows that any state- ment that \"there is no evidence \"is simply a denial of reality. Of course the evidence may be contested and the results argued over, but the fact that evidence does exist to sup-port claims regarding the effectiveness of homeopathic immunisation is undeniable. I was first invited to visit Cuba in December 2008 to present at an international confer- ence hosted by the Finlay Institute, which is a W.H.O.-accredited vaccine manufac-turer. The Cubans described their use of HP to control an outbreak of leptospirosis (Weil s syndrome -a potentially fatal, water-born bacterial disease) in 2007 among the residents of the three eastern provinces which were most severely dam-aged by a severe hurricane -over 2.2 mil- lion people [7]. 2008 was an even worse year involving three hurricanes, and thecountry s food production was only just re- covering at the time of the conference. The HP program had been repeated in 2008, but data was not available at the conferenceregarding that intervention. I revisited Cuba in 2010 and 2012, each time to work with the leader of the HP in- terventions, Dr. Bracho , to analyse the data available. Dr. Bracho is not a homeopath;he is a published and internationally recog-nised expert in the manufacture of vaccine adjuvants. He worked in Australia at Flin- ders University during 2004 with a teamtrying to develop an antimalarial vaccine. In 2012 we accessed the raw leptospirosis surveillance data, comprising weekly re- ports from 15 provinces over 9 years (2000 to 2008) reporting 21 variables. Thisyielded a matrix with 147420 possible en- tries. This included data concerning possi- ble confounders, such as vaccination andchemoprophylaxis, which allowed a carefulexamination of possible distorting effects. With the permission of the Cubans, I brought this data back to Australia and it isbeing examined by mathematicians at an Australian university to see what other in- formation can be extracted. Clearly, thereis objective data supporting claims regard- ing the effectiveness of HP. The 2008 result was remarkable, and could only be explained by the effectiveness ofthe HP intervention. Whilst the three hurri- canes caused immense damage throughoutthe country it was again worse in the east, yet the three homeopathically immunised provinces experienced a negligible increasein cases whilst the rest of the country showed significant increases until the dry season in January 2009 [8]. This is but one example -there are many more. It is cited to show that there is signif-icant data available, and that orthodox sci-entists and doctors have driven the HP in- terventions, in the Cuban case. Many peo- ple internationally now know this, so onceagain claims by orthodox authorities that there is no evidence merely serves to show that either the authorities are making unin-formed/unscientific statements, or that they are aware but are intentionally with- holding information. Either way, confi-dence is destroyed and leads to groups ofpeople questioning what they are told. A Way Forward It is contended that what now seems to bean endless and repetitive battle between pro- and anti-vaccination groups would be unnecessary if Governments made threedecisions: 1. Ensure that the parents of vaccine- damaged children and the childrenthemselves are appropriately sup-ported, and that these people and other parents genuinely concerned about the possibility of vaccine damage are notattacked as being irresponsible and a danger to the community. 2. Support those parents who would oth- erwise not vaccinate their children to use homeopathic immunisation. This in turn would lead to an increase in im-munisation coverage and boost herd immunity. It would also allow coverage against diseases such as meningococcalmeningitis type B, and dengue fever forwhich there are no vaccines. It would not require Governments to endorse the method, just appropriate paper-work to identify which type of immuni- sation was being used -vaccination or HP. 3. Establish Government sponsored stud- ies of long-term vaccine safety examin- ing the holist health of age-appropriate,fully vaccinated and unvaccinated chil-dren, and publish the full results. Given the legislative protection and finan- cial support most governments provide tomultinational vaccine manufacturers, it makes sense that governments evaluatethe possibility of having vaccines used in a country made in the country by not-for- profit manufacturers. If a small country likeCuba can do this, then so can most devel- oped Western countries as well as some other countries with lower GDPs. Citizensshould not have to bear the costs of a near- mandatory procedure without sharing the benefits, but this is the existing situationwith vaccination in most countries in theworld. This divisive issue has caused many soci- eties to become less tolerant places, where free speech is prevented through selective media bans, and the discussion of ideasand options is attacked by academics and scientists who should be the champions of open and objective dialogue. We need toreturn to evidence -not just selected and convenient results but all the evidence from all sides of this issue. The orthodox re- sponse is that all the evidence has beenconsidered and there is no more to discuss. But too many people know that this is not true, and until a fully open conversation isheld this issue will never be resolved. And it needs to be -in the interest of us all. Part B: The Homeopathic Response -a Question of Consistency The author s survey of Australian homeo- paths in 2002 revealed that 75% said they were using or intending to use HP, 19% said they were unsure, and 6% were opposed tothe use of HP (most of these would not vac- cinate either) [9]. The majority of the ho- meopaths not using HP or unsure about itsuse had not read Hahnemann se s s a y The Cure and Prevention of Scarlet Fever where he described his first use of HP in 1798. The Australian figures may be quite differ- ent to the experience in other countries. Certainly there is a range of views expressedby homeopathic associations. For example, the Australian Register of Homeopaths di- rects that homeopaths should not take ananti-vaccination position during a consulta- tion, but should offer balanced evidence- based information discussing both vaccina-tion and HP. Then if parents so request, thehomeopath should provide HP [10]. In the United Kingdom the British Homeo- pathic Association says that \"The BHA fol- Isaac Golden, The Immunisation Dilemma -Homopathic Links Spring 2014, Vol. 27: 11 -15 \u00a9 Thieme Medical and Scientific Publishers Private Ltd. 13 VACCINATION This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Where there is a medical contra- indication and/or a patient would other- wise remain unprotected against a specificinfectious disease, it may be appropriate to consider the use of the relevant hom o- prophylactic preparation applicable to thatdisease. \"[11,12]. In an attempt to facilitate agreement, the five questions and resulting six differentpositions shown in Table 1 summarise the options open to homeopaths. The six posi- tions are restated in Table 2.A Call for Responses Homopathic Links would like to invite readers who are homeopathic practitioners to participate in an international survey ofattitudes towards and use of HP. We re- quest that practitioners log on to the survey and indicate their support for one of the sixpositions listed above and, if they wish,state the reasons for their support. The six positions are restated in Table 2. There is still a number of issues requiring discussion, such as the potency and fre- quency of remedies, and the use of nosodesversus genus epidemicus remedies, but these are more a matter of technique thanfundamental conceptual issues, and have been discussed in detail elsewhere [13]. Towards an International Homoprophylaxis Statement The current position regarding HP may be summarised as follows:1. The knowledge of HP varies considera- bly both between and within countries. 2. In many \"developed Western \"countries the influence of multinational pharma-ceutical companies acts as a barrier to research findings about HP reaching or- thodox practitioners, politicians, andthe general public. 3. Within the international homeopathic community there are varying viewsabout (i) the \"homeopathic integrity \" of HP, (ii) the evidence base demon- strating the safety of HP, and (iii) the evidence base demonstrating the effec-tiveness/efficacy of HP. This variance will lessen with better education re- garding the philosophical/conceptualbasis of HP, and better dissemination of HP research results. 4. There is value in assembling research data about HP from every possible in- ternational source, and preparing a de- finitive scientific statement describingthe potential value of HP to publichealth systems internationally. This could be accompanied by an appropri- ate economic cost-benefit analysis ofthe budgetary impact of HP on national health budgets. 5. Once all conceptual issues are consid- ered, and all evidence collected and summarised, an International Hom - oprophylaxis Statement should be pre- pared which would inform homeopath- ic associations throughout the world as well as governments and citizens. Final Conclusions The attacks against homeopathy in general and HP in particular will almost certainly continue. If we can achieve a significantlevel of agreement then we would be able to answer challenges to HP with a single, cohesive, evidence-based, and generallyunited response. This would be a significantimprovement to the existing situation. If you identify with one of the positions listed in Tables 1 and 2 then we would en-Table 1 Alternative positions available to homeopaths. Question 1: Should we attempt to prevent potentially serious infectious diseases? Answer 1.1: No POSITION 1 Answer 1.2: Yes (if yes, move to Q.2) Question 2: Given that we should attempt to prevent potentially serious infectious diseases, which method should we use? Answer 2.1: General protection only POSITION 2 Answer 2.2: Disease-specific protection, or a combination of both methods (if yes, move to Q.3) Question 3: Which method of disease-specific protection should be used? Answer 3.1: Vaccination POSITION 3 Answer 3.2: Hom oprophylaxis, or a combination of both methods (if yes, move to Q.4) Question 4: Is it appropriate to use both vaccination and hom oprophylaxis? Answer 4.1: Yes POSITION 4 Answer 4.2: No (if yes, move to Q.5)Question 5: Use just hom oprophylaxis, but only during epidemics or acute outbreaks? Answer 5.1: Yes POSITION 5 Answer 5.2: No POSITION 6 Table 2 The six positions on immunisation restated. POSITION 1: Homeopathy should only be used to treat patients with symptoms. We should not attempt to prevent potentially serious infectious diseases, but only become involved if a disease is acquired, andthen treat with a remedy similar to the resulting symptoms. POSITION 2: We should try to prevent potentially serious infectious diseases, but should do so using general methods to make the person as healthy as possible, such as using homeopathic constitutional treatment, rather than using disease-specific prevention. POSITION 3: We should use a disease-specific method to prevent potentially serious infectious diseases, and vaccination is the preferred method. POSITION 4: We should use a disease-specific method to prevent potentially serious infectious diseases, and can/should use vaccination and hom oprophylaxis together. There is a number of options within this position such as using vaccination for some diseases and HP for others, using both methods for the same disease, or using HP in infancy and vaccination when the child is older. POSITION 5: We should use a disease-specific method to prevent potentially serious infectious diseases; we should only use hom oprophylaxis, but only when there is an outbreak of the disease in the region. POSITION 6: We should use a disease-specific method to prevent potentially serious infectious diseases, and use just hom oprophylaxis for both short- and long-term prevention, whether or not there is a def- inite outbreak.
