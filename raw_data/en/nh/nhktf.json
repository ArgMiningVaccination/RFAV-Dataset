This is important because it gives people time to understand more about their substance use and set a solid foundation for recovery. Detoxification, more specifically, is an important first step in the recovery process. People who have become dependent on substances may need to go through detox, which is the process of clearing the body of toxins. Detox programs can also help manage any potentially uncomfortable or harmful withdrawal symptoms.1 For those who have family responsibilities or a demanding job, a short-term detox program may be a good option to start their rehabilitation, but it's important that people remember to continue to pursue other forms of treatment in order to achieve successful recovery. You may decide to choose a 72-hour weekend or 3-day detox, 5-day, 7-day, or 10-day detox program.1 If you think you may need rehab, choosing a detox and addiction therapy program is an important first step toward getting help for alcoholism and drug addiction and finding recovery from substance abuse. Though [inpatient rehabilitation programs](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/levels-of-care/inpatient/) are frequently [28 or 30 days](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/programs/30-day/) to [90 days long](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/programs/long-term-rehab/), the first part of all of them is detox. During detoxification, a treatment professional helps you to manage the symptoms of withdrawal that occur when you stop taking drugs or alcohol. A [medical detox](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/levels-of-care/detox/benefits-of-medical-detox/)\u2014as opposed to a non-medical detox\u2014uses a program of medication to help you cope with withdrawal symptoms you may be experiencing. How Should You Choose Drug and Alcohol Detox Programs or Facilities? There are a number of factors that may impact your choice of detoxification programs to start recovery, including: - Cost of Detox: You may be wondering, 'how much does detox cost?' or 'how can I pay for rehab?' Substance abuse rehab programs that include other services besides detox can be costly. Drug and alcohol detox programs alone can be a more affordable way to begin the recovery process, combined with other types of support like [12-Step groups](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/therapy/group/12-step-programs/)or [counseling](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/therapy/). - Personal obligations: If you are a caretaker or have other personal obligations at home, it may be difficult to go into inpatient alcohol or drug rehab for detox. If you are assessed at a lower level of care in [outpatient settings](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/levels-of-care/outpatient/), an alcohol and drug detox program near you may allow you to attend to personal or professional matters while starting your recovery. - Good foundation for recovery: Detox is a great way to begin your recovery journey in a safe environment with plenty of support. What Determines the Length of Detox\u20143, 5, 7, or 10 Days? There are several determining factors when choosing the length of the [detox process](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/levels-of-care/detox/), including:1 - Type of substance being used: Some drugs will clear the system faster, while others may have more severe withdrawal symptoms that require medical supervision. - Length of time a substance was used for: If a person has been using a substance repeatedly for long periods of time, they may have developed a dependence on the substance that may affect the [withdrawal process and/or their symptoms](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/withdrawal/). - How much of a substance was used: If people used substances at increasingly higher doses, it may affect the detox process. While some people may choose rapid or ultra-rapid detoxification, these are not recommended for detoxing safely. What Happens During Drug & Alcohol Detox Programs? If you begin a detox program near you, you'll find that the detox process can be intense but also an important part of your recovery. The detox process typically includes the following stages:1 - Evaluation: You will start a medically supervised detox with an assessment to make sure that you receive the proper level of care and support through the detox process. For many, this is a safer option than [detoxing from home](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/levels-of-care/detox/dangers-at-home/). - Stabilization: As your body goes through physical withdrawal, you may experience withdrawal symptoms that will vary depending on the kind of drug you have been taking. The intention of this stage is to make sure you are medically stable during the withdrawal process. The withdrawal process for some drugs, such as [opioids like prescription painkillers](https://drugabuse.com/opioids/withdrawal/), can involve the use of medications to help minimize or prevent withdrawal symptoms. This will be assessed in the first phase of detox when you are assessed. - Ongoing support for continued [addiction treatment](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/)and recovery: If you choose an inpatient detox program, you will receive 24-hour support in the clinic to help you manage the process. Outpatient detox facilities also offer support, but you will not remain in the facility overnight. Whatever type of program you choose, it's important that they assist you in preparing for other forms of treatment to support your recovery. What Happens After Medical Detox? It's very important to continue with some kind of drug or alcohol addiction treatment after detox is over. It can be challenging to remain sober after detox without the ongoing support of a detox clinic. Fortunately, there are many different types of support available. Your detox center may be able to refer you to inpatient or outpatient [rehab programs](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/programs/), depending on the level of care you require. Outpatient treatment programs typically involve visiting a facility for several hours a day while still fulfilling your home and work obligations. You can also take advantage of support groups, which can be found through religious institutions, treatment facilities, doctors, or a community group. Some people may find it easier to transition to a [sober living house](https://drugabuse.com/treatment/levels-of-care/sober-living/) after a drug and alcohol detox program, which is a structured, drug- and alcohol-free home to help maintain your sobriety. You may also consider working with an individual therapist, which might give you the privacy you desire as well as the help that you need.
