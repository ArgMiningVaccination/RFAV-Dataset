Ginger was posted on [our blog here](http://aromaticstudies.com/beloved-ginger/). And here is a much loved spice: Black pepper! Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a member of the Piperaceae family (also known as the Pepper family) which includes over 8 genera and 2000 species including the popular kava (Piper methysticum). Black pepper is native to Southern India. The 'Land of Pepper' lies inland from the ports of Kerala. Piper nigrum is a tropical, evergreen perennial climber to 20 feet with heart-shaped leaves. It bears clusters of small flowers and small spherical fruits that turn red when they ripen. The black, white and green peppercorns are products of the same plant. The green pepper is the whole fresh berry and when dried in the sun becomes black. Black pepper is the almost mature, complete berries that are dried. White peppercorns come from the mature berry which has the skin removed and is then dried. Historical Information Black pepper is called \"The King of Spices\" and it is considered to be the most important and most widely used spice in the world. Black pepper has been used in Ayurvedic, Unani, Siddha, and Traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years for the treatment of cold, pain, fever, and as an antimalarial treatment. It was an important spice in early east-west trading. Pepper is mentioned in the writings of the early Romans. The Roman empire wanted black pepper, more than any other spice, from India. The Caesars treated pepper as a currency, storing vast quantities of it, unused, in the Roman treasury. (Dalby, A., Dangerous Tastes: The Story of Spices) According to Grieve (1982), Attila the Hun is known to have demanded 3000 pounds of pepper in ransom for the city of Rome (p.627). During the time of Hippocrates the pepper was used as both a spice for food and as a medicine. It has been employed for treatments of the stomach, for excess gas and in fever preparations. The Asian world has long considered black pepper to be an important spice for detoxifying and as an anti-aging compound. World Production Current world producers of black pepper include: As of 2008, Vietnam is the world's largest producer and exporter of pepper, producing 34 percent of the world's Piper nigrum crop as of 2008. Other major producers include India (19 percent), Brazil (13 percent), Indonesia (9 percent), Malaysia (8 percent), Sri Lanka (6 percent), China (6 percent), and Thailand (4 percent). An Aromatic Experience If you have a black pepper grinder with fresh black pepper, go and get it. If you don't have the grinder, than use already fresh ground pepper or find a friend who has a grinder (even better!). Also gather up any essential oils of Black pepper you have. First, take a few inhalations of the essential oil of Black pepper. Close you eyes and hold a bottle of Black pepper essential oil close enough to your nose to be able to smell, waft the bottle to the left and right, inhale, observe, feel. Notice its aroma, its affects on your mind/body/emotions. Then clear your nasal palate by taking a few inhalations of fresh ground coffee or coffee beans. Then, take a few moments to grind a bit of black pepper into your palm, close your eyes, and hold your palm a few inches from your nose, and gently (so as not to sniff up the ground black pepper, not fun!) take a few inhalations. Take a moment to observe its aroma and aromatic impact on your mind/body/emotions. Take another moment to smell the freshly ground black pepper. Then clear the nasal palate by smelling ground coffee or coffee beans. Now repeat this process with the essential oil. Close you eyes and hold a bottle of black pepper essential oil close enough to your nose to be able to smell, waft the bottle to the left and right, inhale, observe, feel. What differences do you note? How did smelling the fresh ginger enhance your perceptions of the ginger essential oil? NOTE: If you ever happen to be at the Longwood Gardens outside of Philadelphia in Kennett Square, PA take a look inside the Conservatory and you will find Black pepper vines and if your lucky, some pepper growing on the vines. http://www.longwoodgardens.org/ Black pepper Chemistry The sharp aroma of black pepper is due to its essential oil content. Black pepper contains approximately 1.2 to 3.5% essential oil. Its key chemical constituents include: 20%), a-pinene, b-pinene, sabinene, b-caryophyllene is oils rich in monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (e.g. b-caryophyllene). As a herb: Black pepper contains 5-10% pungent acid-amides (pseudoalkaloids), with piperine as its main compound and several others including piperyline, piperoleines, and piperamine. Pharmacological studies show that piperine is analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and exhibits a depressant effect on the central nervous system.

According to a research study carried out in North Carolina, 48 cigarette smokers took part in a 3 hour study during which they were not allowed to smoke and were instead given dummy cigarettes impregnated with black pepper extract, or with mint/menthol (placebo 1), or with nothing (placebo 2) (Rose and Behm, 1994) Those who inhaled the black pepper reported that their craving for cigarettes was significantly reduced. According to research by Ebihara et al (2006), nasal inhalation of black pepper essential oil, which can activate the insular or orbitofrontal cortex, was found to improve the reflexive swallowing movement caused by dysphagia. It was found that it can be effective regardless of the individual patients level of consciousness or physical and mental status.
