Energy Medicine & Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (PEMF) The general benefit of PEMF is to stimulate cells by recharging them at the bioelectrical level, which increases cellular efficiency. The advantage of this procedure is that it is safe, thorough, non-invasive and there are very few side effects... at least with low frequency and low-intensity PEMF systems. This makes it an alternative that can benefit many patients looking for healing solutions to all kinds of health issues. This practice is also known as magnetic field stimulation and its use has become extremely popular worldwide. Many athletes and professional sporting organisations use PEMF for injury recovery, pre and post-workout recovery and increases in athletic performance. What are the benefits of PEMF therapy? The correction of cellular dysfunction and the improvement of cellular communication all through the body is one of the first things listed as a benefit of PEMF.

PEMF can be considered as an exercise for your cells and can also help to boost your energy levels. In fact, PEMF therapy reproduces the same effects one gets from exercise. It produces the same microcurrents, which are generated from the physical movement of the body through the piezoelectric effect. It's kind of like turbocharging the body with a very efficient delivery system which PENF therapy can provide.
