LASKOWS KI, III : No. 3:10cv600 and M ARISO L LA SKOWS KI, : Plaintiffs : (Judge M unley ) : v. : : UNITED STATES OF A MERICA : DEPA RTM ENT O F VE TERA N : AFFAIRS, : Defendant : :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: MEMORA NDUM Plain tiffs Stanley and Maris ol Laskowski initiated this action again st the United States of Americ a Depart ment of Veterans Affairs for damag es pursuant to the Federa l Torts Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 again st the medic al professionals and admini strative staff at the Wilkes-Barre Veterans Affairs Med ical er (\"WBVAMC\") located in Wilkes-Barre, Penns ylvania. Plain tiffs assert that the United States of Americ a Depart ment of Veteran Affairs commit ted professional negli genc e in treating Plain tiff Stanley Las kowski for post traumat ic stress disorder (hereinafter \"PTSD\") at the WBVAMC. Plaintiff Maris ol Laskowski, Stanley Las kowski's wife, has asserted a claim for lossof consortium. 1 The government and the Laskowskis agree that Mr. Laskowski's valoro us service to the country is not at issue. Nor is this case abou t Mr. Laskowski's PTSD d iagno sis, the hardship this disease has caused Mr. Laskowski and his family, or Mr. Laskowski's current status as 100% disabled and unab le to work in the Americ an economy. The parties also agree that WBVAMC ha d a duty to care for Mr. Laskowski and that the WBVAMC violated this duty by failing to provide ps ychotherapy. Althoug h the government and the Laskowskis agree on much in this case, they disagree on whether the defenda nt breached other duties it owed to the plain tiffs in addition to its failure to provide p sychot herapy. They also dispute two is sues pertainin g to causation. First, the parties dispute the cause of the severe, and appa rently irreversibl e, worse ning of Mr. Laskowski's men tal disease from April 2007 to Augu st 2007. Second, The Defe ndan t in the instant case is the United States of Americ a1 Depart ment of Veterans Affairs. It is the operator of the WBVAMC an d owed duties and oblig ations to ensure appropria te med ical care was provided to Plaintiff Stanley Las kowski. (Doc. 62, Unidisputed Facts \u00b6 75). During the relevant time, the United States undertook to provide h ealthcare services to veterans such as Plain tiff Stanley Las kowski and held itself out as a provider an d institution equip ped and \"staffed to provide s killed and compet ent diagno sis and treatment of medic al conditions\" includin g PTSD. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11). the healt hcare providers workin g at the WBVAMC an d ment ioned below ac ted as employees of the United States of Americ a and were enga ged in the course and scope of their employment in providing the treatment at issue in this case. (Id. \u00b6 74). 2the parties disagree as to whether the ment al healt h professionals at the WBVAMC c ould have fo reseen the decline in Mr. Laskowski's condit ion. Plain tiffs contend that defenda nt's failure to provide pro per PTSD treatment from April to Augu st 2007 caused Mr. Laskowski's deterioration, and that any reasonab ly prudent men tal health professional could have foreseen the ment al decompen sation that followed. In defense, the government would have th e court shift all respons ibility to Mr. Laskowski for his declining ment al healt h. In so doing , the government asserts that Mr. Laskowski began inappropria te self-medic ation and that the shorthand comment s of Veterans Affairs employees indicate that Mr. Laskowski unde rreported his sympto ms. This case deman ds that the medic al records and live testimony be assessed in conjunc tion. The court finds, as will be explain ed below, that a preponde rance of the evidenc e presented at trial establishes that the WBVAMC c ommit ted medic al malpra ctice with respect to the care that it provided to Mr. Laskowski and that its medic al malpra ctice caused his foreseeab le injuries. Accordin gly, the court will gr ant a verdic t for the plain tiffs, and, in so doing , we note that this holdin g is unique to the facts presented before the court. We do not intend this decision to be a sweeping criticism of the defenda nt's treatment of veterans with PTSD. Rath er, this case is very fact specific and we can make no comment on the 3defenda nt's treatment of any oth er patients. As noted above, Plain tiffs Stanley P. Laskowski, III and Maris ol Laskowski instituted this action pursuant to the Federa l Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 seq. (herein after \"FTCA\"). The plain tiffs filed this case on Marc h 17, 2010 and the court held a seven-day non-ju ry trial begin ning on September 10, 2012. In accordance with the court's directive, the parties have filed their respective pos t-trial submis sions. The following constitutes the court's findin gs of fact and conclusions of law, as require d by Rule 52(a) of the Federa l Rules of Civil Procedure. 2 Jurisdiction Gene rally, t he doctrine of sovereig n immunit y protects the United States from suit. The FTCA, howev er, waiv es this immu nity for situations where neglig ent or wrongf ul acts or omissions of government employees, acting in the scope of their employment, cause injury to others. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (b)(1). The FTCA pr ovides: \"The United States shall be liable, respecting the provision s of this title relating to tort claims , in the same manne r and to the same e xtent as a private individual unde r like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgme nt or for Rule 52(a) provides: \"In an action tried on the facts without a jury or2 with an advisory jury, t he court mus t find the facts specially and state its conclusions of law se parately. The findin gs and conclusions may be stated on the record after the close of evidenc e or may appea r in an opini on or a memoran dum of decision filed by es.\" U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (b)(1). The liability in such a situation is based upon the \"law of the place where the act or omis sion occurred.\" Id. Here the alleg ed e took place in Wilkes-Barre, Penns ylvania. According ly, we will apply th e substantive law of Penn sylvania. Regard less of the law of the place where the act or omis sion occurred, howev er, the parties are not entitled to a jury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2402 . 3 Standar d of review Plain tiffs have th e burden of proving t heir case by the preponde rance of the evidenc e. Plain tiffs mee t this burden when, in light of all the evidenc e, they est ablish that what they claim is more likely so than not so. Gree nwich Collier ies v. Dir. , Office of Workers' F.2d 730, 736 (3d Cir. 1993). In determini ng whether any fac t has been proven by a preponde rance of evidenc e in the case, we have co nsidere d the testimony of all witnesses, both plain tiff witnesses and defense witnesses. We have also examined all exhibits received in evidenc e, whethe r presented by the Prior to bring ing suit unde r the FTCA, a plain tiff must The plaintiffs have ex haus ted their admini strative remed ies. (Doc. ound Plain tiff Stanley Las kowski was born on January 26, 1978 and graduated from Bishop O'Hara High School in May 1996. (Doc . 62, Undis puted Facts at \u00b6 6). He served mos t hono rably in the United States4 Marine Corps between Februa ry 1999 and Februa ry 2007. In October he marrie d Plain tiff Maris ol Laskowski. They have four children and live in Carbon dale, Penns ylvania. (Id.) Plain tiff enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on Februa ry 23, 1999 . (Id. \u00b6 14). He rose to the rank of Serg eant. (Id.) In early 2003 , plain tiff served as an infantry squad leader. He was deployed t o Kuwait as a fire squad leade r. (Id. \u00b6 15). He took part in \"Operation Iraqi Freedo m,\" leadi ng his squad operations with valor and distinction.\" (Id. \u00b6 17). Plaintiff received very favorable Fitne ss Review s from his superio r officers during this time. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 17-19). The Marine s awarded him the following med als and ribbo ns for his service: the Navy This case involves two plain tiffs Stanley Las kowski and his wife4 Maris ol. Plain tiff Stanley has princ ipal cause of action, med ical malpra ctice, and his wife Maris ol has a derivativ e consortium claim. For purposes of clarity and simplic ity, we will us e the term \"plain tiff\" throughout to refer to Stanley Las kowski, unles s we indicate otherwise. We will refer to Marisol as Plaintiff Marisol Laskowski. We will refer to them collectively as \"plaintiffs.\" 6and Marine Corps Achievement Med al with 1 star, the Marine Corps Good Conduc t Medal with 1 star, the Combat Action Ribbon , the Iraq Campaig n Medal, the Glob al War on Terror ism Service Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon with 1 star, and the National Defe nse Service Medal. (Id. \u00b6 21). During his service in Oper ation Iraqi Freedo m, plain tiff proved hi us and courageous . He also experie nced the horror of combat . (Id. \u00b6 20). Upo n returnin g to the United States - and for four years thereafter - plain tiff remain ed in the Marine Corps and served as a Marksmans hip Coac h and Instructor at Parris Island, South Carolin a. (Id. \u00b6 23). He performed this job with distinction and continued to receive very favorable Fitne ss Review s. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 22-26). Plain tiff served in the Marine Corps for a total of eight years, and was hono rably dis charged in Februa ry 2007, at which time he and his wife moved to Northeastern Penn sylvania. (Id. \u00b6 26). Plaintiff obtained a job as a financ ial advisor and sales associate for a compan y called Keystone Financ ial. (Id. \u00b6 27). Upon leaving t he Marine Corps, plain tiff was informed that he should contact his local Veterans Affairs Outreach Cent er to arrange for compens ation and pens ion screenings regarding injuries he suffered while in the service. (Id. \u00b6 26). To this end, he arranged for such screenin gs at 7the Wilkes-Barre Outreach Cent er. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). On April 11, 2007, plain tiff arrived at the WBVAMC f or his first compens ation and pens appo intment , plain tiff reported that he had suffered from insomnia for two days, and he also reported other symptoms consistent with PTSD. He was told that he could go to the Veterans Hospital emerg ency room for treatment . (Id. \u00b6 32). On that same d ay, he went to the emerg ency room, thus commenc ing the treatment that would eventually lead to the instant lawsuit. (Id. \u00b6 33). As this case involves allega tions of medic al malpra ctice, it is import ant to review the medic al treatment that plaintiff received in some detail. The relevant time period is between April and Augu st 2007. During this time plain tiff visited the WBVAMC in person four (4) times. Additionally, h e telepho ned the WBVAMC f ive (5) times and his wife telepho ned one (1) time. During all these mont hs he was never treated5 The following is a summary of plain tiff's contact with the WBVAMC5 durin g the relevant time frame: 1) 4/11/07, plaintiff saw Physician's Assistant Bernard Boro ski in person 2) 4/20/01, plaintiff saw Francisco F. Santos, M.D. , a psychiatrist, in person, for a compens ation and pens ion evaluat ion 3) 5/11/07, plaintiff saw Certified Nurs e Practitioner Eugen e Lucas, Jr., in person 4) 5/17/07, plaintiff teleph oned Physician Assistant Jennif er Pierce Lucas plaintiff teleph oned Lucas 8) 7/03/07, plaintiff saw Lucas in person 8by a physician at the WBVAMC, but dealt mainly with \"physic ian extenders\" -medic al professionals such as nurses and physic ian assistants who are supervised by physicians and serve as caregivers to patients. We will6 review the medic al treatment plaintiff received chronologically. April 11, 2007 Plain tiff, at his wife's urging , sought treatment at the WBVAMC because he was having night mares and difficulty sleepi ng. (Doc . 68, Note s of Testimony (herein after \"N.T.\") 9/13/12 at 12). Plain tiff presented hims elf at the WBVAMC Eme rgency Room on April 11, 2007. A Triage Nurs e, Mary J. Filipk owski, evaluat ed him. Plain tiff reported his insomnia, and he screened positive for PTSD, depression and alcohol use. Filipk owski referred plain tiff to Physician Assistant (herein after \"PA\") Bern ard Boro wski who s aw him on that same day. (Doc . 62, Unidsputed Fact \u00b6 33). Plain tiff reported to PA Boro wski that he had not slept for two days and that he had suffered from night mares since 2003 . He told Boro wski of a recurring night mare and reported daytime i rritability and isolation. He also indicated that he had a history of substance abus e with alcohol and 9) 7/16/07, plaintiff 10) 7/18/07, Plaintiff Marisol Laskowski teleph oned Lucas He d id see a psychiatrist, Dr. Santos, but this was for purposes of a6 compens ation and pens ion evaluat ion not treatement . 9drugs when he was eighteen to nineteen years old. Boro wski concluded that plaintiff had Adjustment Disorder with PTSD features. (Id. \u00b6 34). He prescribed 25-50 mg o f Trazadon e for sleep. (Id.) Plaintiff specifically requested \"talk therapy\" on April 11, 2007; regardless, in the subseque nt four mont hs, the defenda nt did not provide \"t alk therapy\" or psychot herapy. (Doc . 70, at 56). April 17, 2007 Kathleen Collelo-Minora , a Licensed Clinic al Social Worker (\"LCSW \"), served as a Social Worker-Cas e Manag er unde r the Depart ment of Veterans Affairs VHA Ha ndbo ok for the Trans ition Assistance and Manag Freedo m (\"OEF\") Veterans the Depart ment of Veterans Affairs VHA Dir ective f or the Role of VHA P oints of Con tact and Case Manag ers to Coordi nate Care for Returning Comb at Servicememb ers and Veterans. (Doc . 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 35). Collelo -Minor a was responsible for coordinating the care and services provided t o plain tiff. To this end, she was require d to review and coordin ate his care, his needs and his access to services every thir ty (30) days be ginni ng on April 17. (Doc . 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 151). Her job required that she establish and maint ain an effective therapeutic relationship with OIF/OEF veterans so as to provide ap propriate services to 10the veterans and their families . (Doc. 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 179). The defenda nt provided d rug and alcohol counseling programs and a ment al healt h clinic to veterans such as plain tiff. Additionally, i t had counseling services availab le for spous es of veterans such as Maris ol Laskowski. (Doc . 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 180). Collelo -Minor a's job included creating \"a patient record flag which would ident ify eac h veteran when you went into their record as an OIF/OE F veteran.\" (Id. at 181). In the instant case, the only ac tion Collelo -Minor a took was to mak e this patient record flag. She did not condu ct the requisite mon thly follow ups or coordinate plain tiff's care as is provided f or in the Depart ment of Veterans Affairs VHA Ha ndbo ok for Trans ition Assistance and Case Manag ement ation Endu ring Freedo m Veterans, the Depart ment of Veterans Affairs VHA Direc tive f or the Role of VHA P oints of Con tact and Case Manag ers to Coo rdina te Care for Returning Comb at Servicemembe r and Veterans. (Doc . 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 36). April 20, 2012 On April 20, 2007, plaintiff met with Franc isco F. Santos, M.D. , Staff Psychiatrist Beha vioral Services , for a Comp ensation and Pens ion examinat ion. Dr. Santos recorded that plaintiff \"has sleep disturbance, avoids crowds, is hypervigilant , feels edgy ev ery day , has moo dines s and 11outbursts of temper, feels depressed, low energy, has nightmares , intrusive recollections and anxiety .\" (Id. \u00b6 37). Dr. Santos further noted that plaintiff \"is showing persisting symptoms of avoidan ce, includin g suppression of the traumat ic events and memorie s for years up until his discharge from the military.\" (Id.) He diagn osed plain tiff with Chronic PTSD and noted plain history of substance abus e.\" (Id. \u00b6 37). Althoug h Dr. Santos was authoriz ed to treat Sgt. Laskowski's PTSD, he provided no medic al treatment to him. He me rely ev aluat ed plain tiff for compens ation and pens ion purposes. (Doc. 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 8). May 1, 2007 Plain tiff had a psychotherapy appoin tmen t schedu led for May 1, 2007 with Dr. Matthew Doo ley, a clinical psychologi st. (Doc . 70, N.T. 9/17/12 at 77). For reasons that are unclear, Plaintiff did not appea r for the appo intment . The WBVAMC s taff should have notified Dr. Dooley of the missed appo intment so he could contact plain tiff and reschedule it, but they did not. (Id.) May 11, 2007 On May 11, 2007, Eugen e Lucas Jr., a Certified Regis tered Nurs e saw plaintiff. Nurse Lucas became plain tiff's primary c are provider a t the WBVAMC. On this initial visit, he noted that plaintiff had a history of alcohol and substance use with an occasional binge . Also he had a family 12history of such use. Plaintiff reported suffering disrupted sleep, hypnop omic and hypnog mares , flashbacks, intrusive though ts, irritability, an ger, and anxiety . Nurse Lucas confirmed Dr. Santos' diagno sis of Chronic and with . prescribed Clonaz epam, a benzodiaz epine , at .5 mg for sleep and Brup roprian at 100 mg in the mornin g for irritability and ange r. Lucas7 further prescribed a follow-up visit in two mont hs' time and had a note to refer Sgt. Laskowski to psychology fo r PTSD f ollow up. Aruna Bhatia, M.D. , co-signed the note regarding plaintiff's visit on the same d ay. (Id. \u00b6 39). Dr. Bhatia served as a supervising physic ian or \"collab orating physic ian\" of Nurse Lucas. She never met or treated plain tiff and evident ly never dis cussed him with Nurse Lucas. (Doc. 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 121, 126). The Clonazepam first prescribed to plaintiff on this visit would be the primar y drug used by the WBVAMC t o treat him. Clonazepam is a As indicated, the parties' undisputed facts assert that plaintiff initially7 was prescribed .5 mg of Clonazepam. The evidenc e presented at trial indicates that although he was prescribed a .5 mg tablet, he was instructed to break it in half and take a .25 mg. dose. (See Doc. 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 96-97; Doc. 77, Pl. Med. Records at 37; Doc. 91-123, Ex. 95, Clonaz epam Dosing A \"disinhib iting drug\" is one which \"mak es a person do things that they w ould not normall y do.\" (Id. at 24). Nurse Lucas believed, incorrectly, that the WBVAMC s uppo rted the use of Clonazepam in PTSD patients. (Id. at 24) When he prescribed it, Nurse Lucas was aware that Food & Drug Admin istration (\"FDA\") direc ted that addiction-prone individuals should be unde r careful surveillance when taking Clonaz epam. (Id. at 16). May 17, 2007 The next c ontact plain tiff had with the WBVAMC was via the telepho ne. He telepho ned the Ment al Healt h Hygiene Clinic on May 17, 2007 and spoke with Jennif er E. Pierce, a Physician Assistant. Pierce had never s een or treated plain tiff prior to the call or afterwards. (Doc . 62, Undis puted Facts \u00b6 41). Plain tiff reported that the Burp roprion, which Lucas had prescribed for irritability and ange r, made him feel very anx ious like he wanted to put his head through a window. (Doc. 67, N.T. 9/12/12 at 19). During the call Pierce discontinued the Burp roprion and prescribed Paxil (Pa roxetene) instead. Pierce schedule d no follow up at that time. No supervising physic ian co-signed Pierce's note regarding the treatment of plaintiff. Nurse Lucas, howev er, did sign the note to acknowledge its receipt. (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 41). 14May 31, 2007 Plain tiff's next contact with the WBVAMC was another telepho ne call. Plain tiff placed this call on May 31, 2007. (Doc . 77, Pl. Trial Ex. 1(a) at 33). He reported that the Paxil made him feel like he was \"crawling o ut of his skin.\" He further complain ed abou t daytime a nxiety. (Id.) Lucas discontinued the Paxil and double d the dose of Clonazepam. (Doc . 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 12). Nurse Lucas's supervising physic ian did not countersign his note regarding this interaction with plaintiff. (Doc. 77, Pl. Tr. Ex. 1(a) at 33). June 4 , 2007 Plain tiff again teleph oned the Ment al Hygiene Clinic on June 4, 2007 at which time he spoke with Nurse Lucas. Lucas prescribed 0.5 mg Clonaz epam twice a day unt il plain tiff's schedule d appo intment on July 3, 2007 . Nurse Lucas's supervising physic ian did not countersign his note regarding this interaction with plaintiff. (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 44). June 2 2, 2007 Plain tiff called the Ment al Hygiene Clinic on June 22, 2007 and spoke with Nurse Lucas. Lucas discontinued the daytime d ose of Clonazepam. (Id. \u00b6 47). Because Clonaz epam is habituating, decreasing the drug dosage can cause withdrawal s ympto ms. (Doc . 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 15). Plain tiff, however, did not receive any educ ation or drug and alcohol 15counseling when t his dosage of Clonazepam was halved on June 22, 2007 . (Doc. 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 149; Doc. 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 94). Arou nd this time, plaintiff began to self-medic ate with improperly obtained Vicoden , a paink iller. (Doc . 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 48). He started by taking two Vic oden a day and by Augus t was taking up to eight daily. (Id. \u00b6 50). He d id not report taking Vicoden to his healthcare providers at the VA, although he insists that they nev er asked him. (Id. at 51). Additionally, p laintiff's alcohol consumpt ion had steadil y increased from April to July. (Id. \u00b6 30). July 3, 2007 Plain tiff had an appo intment with Nurs e Lucas on July 3, 2007 for medic ation and symptom manag ement . Lucas ine, Buspiron e. Lucas's supervising physic ian signed Lucas's note of this visit. (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 54). Plaintiff reported to Lucas that \"I really w ould like to work on the ange r and irritability durin g the day, bu t I am u nsure what approach to take.\" (Doc. 77, Pl. Ex. 1(a) at 36). Lucas's note of the appo intment indicated that plaintiff \"continues with some irritability and ange r. The patient also has some intrusive thinking durin g the day.\" (Id.) Lucas did not, howev er, ensure that plaintiff had been to psychotherapy to which he 16had been referred. July 16, 2007 Plain tiff telepho ned the WBVAMC c linic again on July 16, 2007, and he spoke with Nurse Lucas. Plaintiff reported that he felt more irritable on the Buspiron e medic ation. As a result, Nurse Lucas chang ed the medic ines. He increased the dose of Clonazepam to 1.0 mg at the hour of sleep and 0.5 mg d uring the day. (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 55). Clonaz apem does not treat the core symptoms of PTSD, however, it is the only medic ine prescribed to plaintiff from July 16 through Augu st 13, 2007. (Pl. Tr. Ex. 1(a), 33-35, 39-41; Doc. 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 11, 15). This teleph one call was plaintiff's last contact with the WBVAMC durin g the relevant time frame. As of the date of the call, there was no treatment plan for plaintiff's PTSD. (Doc. 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 113). July 18, 2007 On July 18, 2007, Plaintiff Marisol Laskowski, telepho ned Nurs e Lucas at the WBVAMC. (Doc. 77, Pl. Ex. 1(a) at 41). Nurs e Lucas noted that Marisol had concerns because plain tiff's irritability and ange r had been escalating over the prior few weeks . (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 56) Maris ol also reported that plaintiff was mixing alcohol with his med ications. (Id.) Lucas sugge sted that Marisol encourage the plain tiff to come to the clinic as a \"walk-in.\" (Id.) He a lso made a call to plaintiff's cellular 17telepho ne, but did not reach him. (Id.) This teleph one call is the last \"treatment \" received by plaintiff at the WBVAMC t hat is relevant to this action. Thus , plain tiff's contact with the WBVAMC du ring the relevant time frame c an be summariz ed as follows: On April 11, 2007, plaintiff screene d positive for PTSD a nd was seen by PA Boro ski who p rescribed Trazadon e for sleep. On April 20, 2007, plain tiff saw Dr. Santos for a compens ation and pens ion evaluat ion. Dr. Santos diagno sed plain tiff with PTSD b ut did not treat him. Plaintiff visited Nurs e Lucas on May 11, 2007 who confirmed the PTSD diagn osis and prescribed Clonazepam, a benzodiaz .5 mg for sleep and Brup roprian at 100 mg in the mornin g for irritability and ange r. Lucas also referred plain tiff to psychol ogy for PTSD t reatment . This referral was never acted on by the WBVAMC. After a phone call from plaintiff, on May 17, 2007, PA Pierce discontinued the Brup roprian and prescribed Paxil. O n May 31, 2007, durin g a phon e call with the plain tiff, Lucas discontinued the Paxil and increased the dosage of Clonazepam. On June 4, 2007, plaintiff again telepho ned Lucas. Lucas chang ed the dosage of Clonazepam. On June 22, 2007, after speaking with the plain tiff on the phon e, Lucas again altered the Clonaz epam prescription. Prior to this date, plaintiff had been 18taking a daytime a nd night time dose of the medic ine. Lucas discontinued the daytime d ose of Clonazepam on June 22. Plain tiff had an in-pe rson appo intment with Nurs e Lucas on July 3, 2007 where Lucas continued the prescription for Clonaz epam and prescribed Buspiron e. On July 16, 2007, plaintiff teleph oned Lucas and indicated that the Buspiron e made him more irritable. Lucas discontinued the Buspiron e and again adjusted the dosage of the Clonaz epam upward. That is all the contact plain tiff had with the healt hcare providers during the relevant time frame. In the early morni ng hours of Augus t 13, 2007, plaintiff parked his car abou t six blocks away from the Family Pharma cy in Olyphant, Penn sylvania. (Doc . 62, Und isputed Facts, \u00b6 63). Plain tiff was dressed in black and also had a black mask with him that he had made earlier. (Id. \u00b6 64). He proceede d to the pharmacy, and threw a r ock through its window. (Id. \u00b6 63). He e ntered the pharmacy, grabbed some d rugs, placed them in a backpack and exited the build ing. He ma de his way back to his car. (Id.) Later, the Olyphant Polic e Depart ment arrested the plain tiff for burgla ry of 19the pharmacy and Keysto ne Financ ial8 terminat ed plain tiff's employment after he was arrested. (Id. \u00b6 71). On the night of his arrest, the police learn ed that plaintiff was a combat vetera n who was under treatment for PTSD. (Doc. 91-21, Tierne y Aff. \u00b6 6). The Olyphant Polic e Depart ment contacted the Veterans Admin istration Ment al Hygiene Clinic and spoke with Nurse Lucas. (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 66). The police requested inpat ient treatment for plain tiff at \u00b6 66). authorities incarcerated plain tiff in the Lackawanna Cou nty Prison. (Id. \u00b6 70). Augus t, plaintiff's stepmot her spoke with Collelo-Minora , the social worker assigned to plain tiff's case who had previousl y done nothing but flag plain tiff as an OIF veteran .

Again the request was denied . (Id. \u00b6 69). Collelo -Minor a indicated that the prison system could provide a ppropriate ment al healt hcare. (Id.) The district attorney's office, however, agreed to a release plan that called for plain tiff's release from the prison and direc t commitme nt to the PTSD clinic operated a fter spendin g forty-two days in jail, plaintiff was admit ted into the Coat esville, Penns ylvania, Veterans Admin istration Medic al Cent er, PTSD in patient treatment program. (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 71). Ultima tely, the district attorney exercised its prosecutorial discretion to provide ac celerated rehabilitative disposition (\"ARD\") to Aff . \u00b6 11). He complet ed the ARD o n May 8, 2010 , and the court dismissed all charges again st him on October 7, 2011. (Id. \u00b6 13). The arrest and charges were then expung ed from the plain tiff's record. (Id. \u00b6 14). Curren tly, the Depart ment of Veterans Affairs rates plain tiff as unemp loyable due to his PTSD. They intend to review thi s classification in 2014 . (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6 72). Likewise, the Social Security Admin istration treats plain tiff as 100% disabled and unab le to perform any job in the Americ an economy. (Id. \u00b6 73). 21Plain the instant med action. The court held a seven-day non-ju ry trial begin ning on September 10, 2012. The parties have filed their post-trial briefs and the matter is ripe for disposition. Disc ussion As noted above, the main cause of action in this case is med ical malpra ctice, and unde r the FTCA, we must apply Pen nsylvania state law. Penn accepted standa rds of medic al practice resulting in injury to a patient, includin g all liability-producing conduc t arising from the rendition of professional medic al services.'\" Gros sman v. Barke, 868 A.2d 561, 566 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1140 , 1145 on a of med ical malpra ctice unde r Penns ylvania law, t he plain tiff must establish: (1) a duty owed by the physic ian to the patient (2) a breach of duty from the physic ian to the patient (3) that the breach of duty was the proximate cause of, or a substantial factor in, bringing abou t the harm suffered by the patient, and (4) damag es suffered by the patient that were a direc t result of that harm. 22Thierf elder v. W olfert, 52 A.2d Kamrin , 584 A.2d 888, 891 (Pa. 1990)). In addition to these elemen ts, the plain tiff in a medic al malpra ctice case is \"'required to present an expert witnes s who will testify, to a reasonab le degree of med ical certainty, that the acts of the physic ian deviated from go od and acceptable medic al standa rds, and that such deviation was the proximate cause of the harm suffered.'\" Estate of9 Keating ex rel. Keating v. Coat esville VA Med. Ctr., No. 11-4397, 2012 WL 3140 915, at *2 (3d Cir. Aug. 3, 2012 ) (quoting Mitzelfelt, 584 A.2d at 892). We will address these issues separately. 1. Duty /Standar d of Care The government and plain tiff agree that the professional staff at the WBVAMC owed p laintiff duties and oblig ations to ensure that he received appropria te med ical treatment . (Doc. 62, Und isputed Facts \u00b6\u00b6 74-75). Thus , the first element neede d to establish a medic al malpra ctice claim is Penn sylvania courts have ca rved out a narrow exception to the9 requiremen t that ical malpra ctice plain tiffs employ ex pert witnes ses. Expert testimony is not require d when a matter \"is so simple or the lack of skill or care is so obvious as to be within the range of experie nce and compreh ension A.2d 52, 54 n.1 (Pa. 1997). Instances in which expert opinio ns are unne cessary in a med ical malpra ctice case are rare. Simps on v. Fed. au of Prisons, No. 3:02cv2313 , 2005 WL 2387 631, at *5 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 28, 2005) (citing Toogoo d, 824 A.2d at 1149.). In the instant case, expert witnes s testimony w as necessary and was provided. 23satisfied. The parties dispute, however, whethe r plaintiff established the appli cable standa rd of care. Plain tiff asserts that his expert witnes ses, Dr. Robert Goldstein and Dr. Harv ey Don dershine, sufficiently established the standa rd of care with respect to seven different aspects of PTSD treatment . (Doc . 75, Pls.' Prop osed Finding s of Fact & Conc lusions of Law at 58-78). Defenda nt argues, with a particular focus on the WBVAMC's pharmaceutical and telepho ne prescription practices, that plaintiff's experts have fa iled to establish the relevant standa rd of care. (Doc . 74, Req uest for Findings of Fact & Con clusions of Law on Beha lf of the United States of Americ a at 46-47). To better assess defenda nt's contention with respect to the sufficiency of plain tiff's experts' testimony, the court will br iefly review the standa rd again st which this testimony is to be meas ured. The Penn sylvania Supr eme Court explain ed the concept of \"standard of care\" as follows: The standa rd of care required of a physician or surgeon is well- settled. . . . A physician who is not a specialist is require d to possess and employ in the treatment of a patient the skill and knowledge usually pos sessed by physicians in the same o r a similar locality, giving due regard to the advanced state of the profession at the time of the treatment ; and in employing t he required skill and knowledge he is also required to exercise the care and judgme nt of a reasonab le man. However, a physician or surgeon is not bound to employ any part icular mode of treatment of a patient, and, where among physicians or surgeons of ordin ary sk ill and learn ing more than one meth od 24of treatment is recognized as proper, it is not neglig ence for the physic ian or surgeon to adopt either of such meth ods . . . . The burden of proof in a malpractice action is upon the plain tiff to prove eit her (1) that the physic ian or surgeon did not possess and employ the required skill and knowledge or (2) that he did not exercise the care and judgme nt of a reasonab le man in like circumstances . . . . son v. Maffucci, 156 A.2d 835, 838 (Pa. 1959)(citations omitted). A specialist acting within his or her speciality is held to a higher standa rd. Spec ialists are \"expect ed to exercise that degree of skill, learn ing and care norma lly possessed and exercised by the average physic ian who devotes special study and attention to the diagn osis and treatment \" of diseases within that speciality. Pratt v. Stein, 444 A.2d 674, 708 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1982) (quoting McPhee v. Reichel, 461 F.2d 947, 951 (3d Cir. 1972)). Plain tiff has the burden of proving t hat defenda nt's condu ct fell below the standa rd of care owed to plaintiff. See Podlog v. United States, 205 F. Supp . 2d 346, 361-62 (M.D. Pa. 2002). Experts, however, need not use \"magic words \" when testifying a s to the appli cable standa rd of care. Maure r v. Trs . of the Univ. of Pa., 614 A.2d 754, 762 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992) (citing Mitzelfelt, 584 A.2d at 894). Penn sylvania courts have co nsistently explain ed that \"the standa rd of care in medic al malpra ctice actions is first and foremos t what is reasonab le unde r the circumstances.\" Joyce v. 25Boulevard Physic 648, 656 (Pa. Supe r. Ct. 1997) (citing Collins v. Han d, 246 A.2d 398 (Pa. 1968)). Althoug h the standa rd of care must be objec tive, an expert who re lies on his or her years of practice and experie nce in a particular field can sufficiently establish the standa rd of care. Joyce, 694 A.2d at 655-56. An expert with extensive experie nce can even establish the relevant standa rd of care if he or she expresses an opini on in the first person and does not cite to treatises or medical perio dicals. See id. In Joyce the Penn sylvania Supe rior Court assessed whether an orthope dic surgeon established the standa rd of care relevant to patient referrals to physic al therapists. Id. The expert in Joyce, Dr. Ratn er, testified that the defenda nt \"should have discussed Mr. Joyce's case with the physic al therapist or specified written instructions on the referral sheet.\" Id. at 656. The court noted that all orthope dic surgeons refer patients to physical therapists, and that \"[i]t is well within the knowledge of an orthope dic surgeon, such as Dr. Ratner, to articulate an opini on upon the standa rd of care when referring patients to physic al therapy.\" Id. The court specifically found that Dr. Ratner was compet ent to proffer such an opini on because he had thirty years of experie nce in the field of orthoped ic med icine. Id. The court also found that \"Dr. Ratn er's use of the first person in describing the standa rd of care did not necessarily mean that he was presenting a personal opini on.\" Id. 26In the instant case, plaintiff presented two expert witnesses at trial-Dr. Don dershine and Dr. Gold stein. Plain tiff asserts in his post-trial10 brief that his experts established the standa rd of care appli cable to the PTSD care that the WBVAMC pr ovided plain tiff and that the WBVAMC breached the relevant standa rd of care with respect to seven interrelated aspects of PTSD treatment . Before turning our attention to plaintiff's alleg ation that defenda nt breached its duty, the court will as sess whethe r plain tiff carried his burden and established the appli cable standa rd of care with respect to the seven aspects of plain tiff's PTSD a t issue. First, plaintiff proffers that the standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD requires psychot herapy. (Doc. 75, Pls.' Prop osed Finding s of Fact & Conc lusions of Law at 58). This aspect of the standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD is not in dispute. Dr. Donder shine testified that plaintiff Harv ey Don dershine, M.D., J.D., is a med ical doctor board certified10 in psychiatry. (Doc. 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 3). He has taugh t at Stanford Medic al School in the Depart ment of Psychiatry since the late 1970 s. (Id. at 4). He was also a psychiatrist in the military w here he dealt with patients suffering from the psychologi cal injuries of war. (Id.) He also spent approximately twenty-five years workin g for the VA. For twenty of those years he was the chief psychia trist for the division of the National Cent er for PTSD in Men lo Park, California . (Id. at 5). He continues today to treat patients, including combat vetera ns with PTSD. (Id.) During the course of his career he has treated more than \"2,000, perhaps 3,000\" patients suffering from PTSD. (Id. at 5-6). The quali fications of Robert Gold stein, M.D. are addressed below in the section deali ng with causation. 27should have been referred to psychotherapy, . 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 17), and defenda nt's expert, Dr. Glazer, agreed that the standa rd of care for PTSD treatment require s psychotherapy. (See Doc. 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 47). Thus , plain tiff carried his burden and established the standa rd of care with respect to the need for psychotherapy. Second, plaintiff maintains that the standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD re quire s the appli cation of the VA/Depart ment of Defe nse Clinic Guid eline s for the Manag of Post-Traumat ic Stress (herein after the \"Guidelin es\"), informed by the sound clinical judgme nt, supervision and clinical experie nce. (Doc . 75, Pls.' Prop osed Finding s of Fact & Conc lusions of Law at 60). Dr. Donder shine testified that, \"[t]he guide lines have to be informed by supervision and by experie nce and keeping up with the literature, but it does reflect broad guidel ines of what you do on step one and step two.\" (Doc. 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 54). Moreo ver, Dr. Donder shine and counsel for defenda nt engag ed in the following exchan ge at trial: Q. And the guide lines don't recommend a particular form of treatment . They are just recommenda tions, correct? A. Well, they hav e to be - - I would say when t here is evidenc e - - depen ding on the level of evidenc e, because, you k now, t he guide lines, they say whethe r the evidenc e is good, med ium or whatever. The stronger the evidenc e, the more you deviate only for a very good reason. They become stronger in their recommenda tions. 28Q. The guide lines mus t alway s be appli ed in the context of a provider's clinical judgme nt for care of a particular patient, correct? A. Correc t. Q. And they are meant to inform and support clinicians withou t constricting them, correct? A. Correc t. (Id. at 102-03). Dr. Gold stein similarly te stified as follows: The guide lines are not - - well, they are not compuls ory in t he sense that they are not, you know, legal ly man dated. They are not the same a s the standa rd of care, but, you know, since they do put forth the best availab le state of the art evidenc e-based treatment practice at that time, anyone that choos es to exercise judgme nt to - - to depa rt from or deviate from these practice guide lines, pretty well damn better have a good med ical justification for doing so, and in this case, I don't see there was any. (Doc . 69, 9/14/12 Trial Tr. at 14). The Guid eline s strongly recommend Selective Sero tonin Reupt ake Guid eline s also ident ify significant benefits from psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD. (Id. at I- 17). Defe ndan t's expert, Dr. Glazer, provided a n opini on which is similar to Guid eline s recommenda tions. He stated that, \"the cognit ion beha vioral therapies designed for PTSD. \" (Doc . 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 91). After reviewing t he expert testimony and exhibits presented at trial, the court finds that plaintiff established the appli cable standa rd of care for treating and maint ainin g PTSD. Althoug h the Guid eline s are not legally manda ted and do not represent the standa rd of care in an absolute sense, the evidenc e-based treatment s strongly recommended in the Guid eline s cannot be disregarded on a whim. All of the experts who testified at trial agreed that clinicians should first consider the treatment recommendat ions contained in the Guid eline s-SSRI herapy-prio r to making an educ ated decision to deviate from that course. The court notes that the meth ods described in the Guid eline s are not experime ntal. 11 Under Penn sylvania law, t he plain tiff fails to carry the burden of11 establishing the appli cable standa rd of care when the expert's testimony pertains to wholly ex perime ntal treatment s. See Maure r, 614 A.2d at 762- 63. In Mau rer, the plain tiff suffered a brain injury that left him comat ose for two mont hs. Id. at 756. The plain tiff awoke and was treated by a neurosurgeon. Id. The plaintiff suffered complic ations, includin g the hardening of his joints. Id. The plaintiff initiated a medic al malpra ctice action again st his neurosurgeon in which he alleg ed, inter alia, that the neurosurgeon committ ed malpra ctice by failing to adminis ter a drug called Didron el. Id. An en banc panel of the Supe rior Court of Penn sylvania found that the plain tiff failed to establish the standa rd of care as a matter of law. Id. at 762-63. The Supe rior Court held that plaintiff's expert was unab le to articulate an appli cable standa rd of care for the use of Didronel because, at the time plaintiff was treated, Didronel had not moved b eyond the experime ntal phas e. Id. As noted above, the treatment methods 30Moreo ver, Dr. Don dershine and Dr. Gold stein, experts who each have extensive experie nce treating combat -indu ced PTSD, offered the opini on that the average clinician treating combat -indu ced PTSD patients should be aware of the recommenda tions and evidenc e-based treatment practices contained in the Guid eline s. Thes e experts testified that clinicians should only dev iate from the evidenc e-based treatment practices strongly recommende d in the Guid eline s in situations in which experie nce and clinical judgme nt provides a compellin g reason to do so. Defe ndan t argues that Dr. Goldstein and Dr. Donder shine's opinio ns are at odds with respect to the standa rd of care unde r the Guid eline s. Defe ndan t requests the following c onclusions of law: 22. Dr. Gold stein's testimony acknowledging that the Guid eline s do not represtent the standa complet ely shine's ons that the medic ation choices were i mprop er unde r the guide lines. 23. It was Plain tiff's burden to provide t he court with testimony identifying what the standa rd of care is, and they never did that, at least with respect to medic ation choices. 24. Dr. Gold stein never pro vided the Court with what the standa rd of care was. Therefore, withou t the bene fit of knowing what the standa rd of care was, it is impossible for the court to determine whether the treatment and care was proper because we have not hing to compar e it to. described in the Guid eline s are not experime ntal. 3125. As for Dr. Gold stein's testimony it provided t his court with absolutely no guida nce regarding why treatment was improp er. . . . 27. Dr. Gold stein's were iven in gene ralities. (Doc . 74, Req uest for Findings of Fact & Con clusions of Law on Beha lf of the United States of Americ a at 46). The defenda nt's proposed conclusions of law do not accurately reflect the facts or the law. Althoug h the court agrees that it is plaintiff's burden to establish the standa rd of care, the court disagrees with respect to the defenda nt's assessment of Dr. Gold stein's testimony. Dr. Goldstein, like Dr. Donder shine, testified that the Guid eline s, while not compuls ory, put forth the best treatment s known in psychiatry for PTSD. The doctors also agreed that departure from the Guid eline s is only warrant ed when the clinician finds a compell ing medic al justification for doing so. Penns ylvania law allows an expert to offer an opini on on the standa rd of care in his or her own words, and an expert need not utter \"magic words \" to establish the appli cable standa rd of care. See Joyce, 694 A.2d 655-56; Mau rer, 614 A.2d 754. Moreo ver, the court finds that Dr. Don dershine' s testimony, in itself, is sufficiently compell ing to establish that the relevant standa rd of care requires the average clinician treating PTSD patients to be familiar with the recommenda tions contained in the Guid eline s and only to deviate from them for compell ing reasons. The court is satisfied that this was the 32relevant standa rd of care when the WBVAMC at tempte d to treat Mr. Laskowski for PTSD in 2007 . Third, plaintiff contends that the relevant standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD requires \"a nexus between the symptoms , the diagn osis, and the selected medic ations.\" (Doc. 75, Pls.' Prop osed Finding s of Fact & Conc lusions of Law at 64). In other words, plain tiff asserts that diagno sis of a disease drives the treatment of that disease. Thus , the standa rd of care requires that a clinician treat a patient diagn osed with PTSD with those treatment s which the clinician knew to be appropria te at that time based upon the patient's history. (Id. at 63-64). At trial, when i t comes to the need for diagn osis to drive tr eatment , Dr. Donder shine testified as follows: [I]f you ha ve a toothache, you migh t take aspirin for the pain, but that will no t hand le the cavity. The issue is, is the symptom, the pain, a result of a condit ion, a diagno sis, and then what treatment do we know to give because of the diagn osis. We rely on the diagn osis and the history of it and how it is treated and what we k now abou t it to plan the treatment . With respect to med ications, there has to be a nexus b etween the symptoms , the diagn osis and the medic ations you pic k; otherwise, [treating] in the dark. (Doc . 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 10). In the specific context of treating patients with PTSD, Dr. Donder shine testified that drugs such as benzodiaz epine s were acceptable to stabilize a patient in the short term. However, the use 33of the drug over the long term to treat PTSD c ould aggravate the condition. (See id. at 15). In light of Dr. Donder shine's testimony, and his decades of experie nce treating combat vetera ns with PTSD, the court finds that plain tiff has carried his burden to establish this aspect of the standa rd of care. It is uncontested that the gene ral precept that diagno sis drives treatment applie s to men tal health clinicians. As such, the standa rd of care requires that clinicians prescribe medic ation or therapy that treats the core symptoms of PTSD. At trial, the experts testified that, in certain circumstances, it is within the standa rd of care to prescribe drugs, such as benz odiaz epine s, to a PTSD patient to stabilize that patient over a short perio d of time. As Matthew Doo ley the staff psychologi st at WBVAMC admit ted at trial, Chronic PTSD d oes not improve abs ent treatment . (Doc. 70, N.T. 9/18/12 at 69-70). Thus, it is not within the standa rd of care to prescribe drugs intende d for short term stabilization of PTSD p atients for long term treatment when t hese drugs do not to treat the core symptoms of PTSD. Fourt h, plaintiff asserts that the appli cable standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD requires the coordin ation of care through communic ation and the creation of an interdis ciplina ry treatment team. (Doc . 75, Pls.' Prop osed Finding s of Fact & Conc lusions of Law at 67). 34With regard to this aspect of the standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD, Dr. Don dershine testified at trial as follows: The VA is a complex s ystem. In many respects, the care was shared among different parties; therefore, everybody has to know what everybody else is doing. If a patient is seen in one clinic and given medic ine that is bad for him in terms of another clinic, the clinician has got to know. If a person is referred for a treatment , you got to know if they got it. . . . The reason for medical electronic record is so that [supervisors ] would know [what care physic ian extenders were providing] . The collabo ration is not only person to person. It is often by the electronic records so everybody knows what everybody is doing , but as far as I can tell, it wasn' t used and nothing was coordin ated. (Doc . 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 16-17). On cross-examinat ion, Dr. Glazer agreed that PTSD c are should be coordin ated when he testified as follows: Q. You're aware that the V.A. had policies where they were suppos ed to flag and ident ify Iraqi war veterans for medical treatment ? A. Correc t. Q. Right , so your r eport says based on this guidel ine on or abou t May 17, 2007 it would have been Ms. Collelo 's respons ibility as case man ager to coordin ate the care and services of Mr. Laskowski right? A. That's my unde rstanding . (Doc . 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 151-52). In light of the agreement among the experts in this case, the court finds that plaintiff carried his burden to 35establish the standa rd of care with respect to the need to coordin ate the care PTSD patients receive. Fifth, plaintiff contends that the relevant standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD requires that physician extenders \"mus t practice unde r the supervision of a physic ian who is responsible to be aware of the case, to provide ed ucation and to intervene, if necessary, for the welfare of the patient.\" (Doc. 75, Pls.' Prop osed Finding s of Fact & Conc lusions of Law at 70). With regard to this aspect of the standa rd of care, Dr. Don dershine testified that Dr. Bhatia's responsibility in the instant case \"was to supervise, was to be aware of [the] case, to provide e ducation and to intervene, if necessary, for the welfare of the patient.\" (Doc. 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 12). Moreo ver, with respect to the authority to prescribe medic ations, Dr. Donder shine testified that physician extenders are authoriz ed to prescribe so long as they hav e adeq uate supervision . (Id. at 58). Regard ing the role of physician extenders and the need for physic ians to supervise them to ensure best practices, Dr. Donder shine testified as follows: The physic ian extenders are used when maybe they don't have enou gh doctors. Maybe t hey w ant the doctors only for the serious cases and to have the initial stuff hand led by less trained, but that becomes even more import ant to have so me oversight to when it is beyond that person's capac ity and when someone else has to take over. 36There has to be some u nderstandin gs. You don't give five- mont h prescriptions. You don't schedule two-mon th appo intment s. You don 't change med ications over the phon e. I wouldn 't change them over the phon e. (Id. at 59). Plain tiff carried his burden and established the standa rd of care with respect to the need for physic ians to supervise the care physic ian extenders provide t o PTSD patients. Dr. Donder shine, an expert with many years of experie nce treating veterans in the VA system, testified that it is not within the standa rd of care for supervising physic ians to ignor e physic ian extenders. In other words, it is not within the standa rd of care to allow physic ian extenders a free hand to practice medic ine and prescribe treatment s to PTSD p atients without supervision. Rath er, the standa rd of care requires supervising physic ians to oversee physic ian extenders and familiari ze thems elves with the patient's course of treatment set by the physic ian extender. Sixth, plain tiff maint ains that he carried his burden and established the standa rd of care relevant to treating PTSD patients over the telepho ne. Plain tiff specifically contends that the standa rd of care allows for the discontinuan ce of medic ation by teleph one when the clinician belie ves the medic ation is harmful. But, this standard also requires that the clinician schedu le a follow-up a ppoin tmen t to determine the efficacy of the decision to discontinue the medic ation. (Doc . 75, Pls.' Prop osed Finding s of Fact & 37Conc lusions of Law at 72). Furthermo re, plaintiff contends that the relevant standa rd of care does not allow fo r the stoppin g of one prescription and prescribing a new drug over the telepho ne. (Id.) When it comes to the treatment of PTSD over the telepho ne, Dr. Donder shine testified as follows: The problem there is that she didn't examine him. This was a phon e call, and in a phon e call, if there is an emerg ent med ical problem, I can see stoppin g a medic ation if you think it is harmf ul, but then the patient has to be seen, because you may be wrong or the harm may continue, but to prescribe a new medic ine to a patient you ha ve never met , and indee d I think it was a two-mon th prescription of med icine, with no follow up or any idea whether that med icine will work, is fraught with peril, because there is just so much data you can get through a phon e call. Part of what psychia try doe s is use our senses. We look, as well as hear. So that, I think, is just somet hing that is akin to Internet prescribing , and I teach resident s they canno t prescribe new medic ines on the phon e to a person they have never k nown w ithout a face-to-face examinat ion. (Doc . 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 13). Dr. Donder shine explain ed that the standa rd of care forbids the prescription of new PTSD med ications over the telepho ne, in part, because it is impossible to determine with certainty whether the patient is suffering because of an adverse reaction to his medic ation or a worsening of his PTSD. (Id. at 48-49). With respect to the problems posed by treating PTSD patients over the telepho ne, Dr. Donder shine explain ed: 38One of the problems with treating with people over the phon e is that the disorder itself tends to avoid pain, and there has to be a structure within pain -- within which pain can be vented and shame and guilt and stories told. They just don't occur. It's the nature of the disorder. (Id. at 143). In light of Dr. Donder shine's convincing expert testimony on telepho ne medic ine, the court finds that plaintiff carried his burden and established the standa rd of care relevant to treating PTSD patients over the telepho ne. Plain tiff established that all clinicians treating PTSD patients over the phon e should observe two s imple practices. First, with respect to stopping med ications, it is within the standa rd of care for a clinician to instruct patients over the telepho ne to stop medic ations if a follow-up a ppoin tmen t is schedule d. Second, the standa rd of care requires that clinicians examine a patient in-person prior to prescribing new prescription medic ations; new pres cription regime ns should not be initiated over the telepho ne or internet. The telepho ne, and its use to communic ate with patients, is not novel or experime ntal. Dr. Donder shine explain ed which practices the psychiatric communit y believes to be safe and which are unsafe practices with respect to teleph one medic ine. He o pined that teleph one medic ine cannot replace the import ant insights gaine d from in-person examinat ions. Dr. Donder shine based his testimony on the standa rd of care with respect 39to treating PTSD patients over the telepho ne on his twenty-six years of experie nce treating PTSD patients in the VA system a s well as his addit ional years teaching psychiatry students at Stanford Medic al School. Althoug h Dr. Donder shine drew on his personal experie nces in forming his opini on, the court finds that Dr. Don dershine' s testimony on the appli cable standa rd of care was objective and that the standa rd of care he discussed appli es to all clinicians treating PTSD patients. Moreo ver, given Dr.12 Donder shine's testimony and extensive experie nce treating patients with combat -indu ced PTSD, the court is not persuade d by the testimony of defense expert Dr. Glazer that the standa rd of care allows for the prescription of new med ications over the phon e durin g short and superficial calls. The court is especially sk eptical of Dr. Glazer's testimony on the appropria teness of treating PTSD patients by teleph one given his specialization in a subtopic of schizophrenia and not combat -indu ced PTSD. (Doc . 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 43, 87-88, 118-19). The court notes that Dr. Bhatia testified that the WBVAMC ha d a12 policy of keeping teleph one calls with PTSD patients \"very sup erficial\" because asking PTSD patients probing ques tions, as would be done in a counseling session, could cause the patient to decompen sate. (Doc. 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 131-32). Dr. Bhatia's admis sion that it is difficult to ascertain the informat ion necessary to make an informed pharma ceutical decision over the telepho ne appe ars to corroborate Dr. Donder shine's testimony regar ding the standa rd of care relevant to the treatment of PTSD patients over the telepho ne. 40 In its proposed conclusions of law, de fendan t requests the following with respect to the standa rd of care appli cable to treating PTSD patients over the telepho ne: 36. Dr. Goldstein never ment ioned anything abou t variou s phon e calls and what standard of care was in the communit y. 37. Dr. Donder shine, never established what the standa rd of care was regarding phon e calls. What he did say, is that he advises his students at Stanford University, which is in California , to stay away from phon e medic ine. 38. What Dr. Don dershine teaches the studen ts in a classroom at Stanford is irrelevant, the standa rds that need to be appli es are the ones here in Penn sylvania where the medic al providers are practicing. (Doc . 74, Req uest for Findings of Fact & Con clusions of Law on Beha lf of the United States of Americ a at 47). The court disagrees with defenda nt's assertion that Dr. Don dershine did little more than state a personal opini on that he holds in the classroom. Rath er, as is fully ex plain ed above, Dr. Donder shine stated the standa rd of care relevant to the entire psychiatric communit y when i t comes to treating PTSD patients over the phon e. The fact Dr. Don dershine instructs his students in this standard of care at Stanford does not render this standard inapp licable to VA clinicians in Penn sylvania. See Joyce, supra. Finally, p laintiff asserts that he carried his burden and established a seventh aspect of the relevant standa rd of care. Spec ifically plaintiff contends that the standa rd of care requires the monit oring of PTSD 41patients with known alc ohol and abus e co-morbi tities. (Doc. 75, Pls.' Prop osed Finding s of Fact & Conc lusions of Law at 77). When asked at trial abou t the significance of plaintiff's positive alcohol screen, Dr. Donder shine answered that vetera ns with combat -indu ced PTSD who exhibit a pattern of binge drink ing need to be monit ored. (See Doc. 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 23). With respect to the need to monit or PTSD patients on benz odiaz epine s in particular, Dr. Don dershine testified as follows: Because PTSD, you c an self-medic ate with alcohol, because benz odiaz epine s are bad drugs to give to people with an alcohol problem, and also what happe ns is if you do n't treat the PTSD, it gets worse and the patient will re sort to self- medic ating. So it is somet hing to be alert to and monit or. (Id. at 41). The Physic ians' Desk Reference similarl y provides that \"[a]ddiction-prone individuals (such as drug addic ts or alcoholi cs) should be unde r careful surveillance when receiving Clonaz epam or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habit uation and depe Desk Refe rence at 3). Despite the expert testimony presented by Dr. Don dershine, and the mate rial from the Physic ians' Desk Reference, the court finds that plaintiff has not carried his burden and established this aspect of the standa rd of care for patients with PTSD. As presented by the plain tiff, the standa rd is not specific, but merely require s that clinicians \"monitor\" PTSD patients 42with a history of drug and alcohol abus e for signs of self-medic ation. Plain tiff asserts that mon itoring is especially need ed when the PTSD patient has been prescribed a habit uating drug such as a benzodiaz epine . Plain tiff has presented no evidenc e of the type of mon itoring that is necessary. Moreover, the evidenc e presented to establish a breach of this aspect of the standa rd is not convincing . Plain tiff merely c ites to a portion of Nurse Lucas's testimony where he states that he was not providing surveillance of the plain tiff while he was under his care. (Doc . 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 18-19). We find this standard and the evidenc e to suppo rt it to be too nebu lous to support liability on the part of the defenda nt. Practically speaking, our conclusion with respect to this portion of the standa rd of care has no effect on the case because, as discussed below, we find that the other portions of the standa rd of care were in fact breached by the defenda nt and these breaches caused harm to the plain tiff. 2. Brea ch In addition to establishing the standa rd of care that the defenda nt owed, plaintiff has also established a breach of the standa rd of care. We will address each breach as it correspond s to the specific aspects of the standa rd of care discussed above. First, the parties agree that the defenda nt had a duty to provide psychotherapy to the plain tiff. They also agree that they breac hed this 43duty. (Doc. 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 47) (defense expert admitting that failure to properly ref er plain tiff to the psychology dep artment was a breach of the standa rd of care). Next, the plain tiff established that the standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD requires the appli cation of the Guid eline s informed by sound clinical judgme nt, supervision and clinical experie nce. Plain tiff has established a breach of this standard of care. Nurs e Lucas's treatment of plain tiff was not informed by the Guid eline s because Nurs e Lucas was not familiar with them. (Doc . 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 52-55). He was also unaware of the PTSD checklist contained in the Guid eline s where a patient can write down how he feels on his visits. (Id. at 55-58). The defenda nt breached the standa rd of care by not ensuring that one who was treating patients with PTSD was aware of the Guid eline s and providing treatment according ly. Further, the defenda nt failed in the supervision of Nurs e Lucas by allowing hi m to prescribe a drug not approved by the United States FDA without authoriz ation of a collab orating 33). Althoug h Clonaz epam is not FDA approved for treatment of PTSD, Nurs e Lucas wrote plain tiff prescriptions for it on May 31, June 4 and June 22, 2007. (Id. at 22, 33). He wrote these prescriptions withou t approval of a collabo rating physic ian. (Id. at 33). For all these reasons, we agree that defenda nt violate d the standa rd of care with regard to treating PTSD 44through the appli cation of the Guid eline s informed by sound clinical judgme nt, supervision and clinical experie nce. Plain tiff also established that the standa rd of care requires a nexus between the chosen medic ation and the diagn osis. In other words, diagn osis of a disease drives the treatment of that disease, and that the standa rd of care requires that a clinician treat a PTSD p atient based upon the patient's history of PTSD and the treatment that clinician knew to be appropria te at that time. In the instant case, Nurse Lucas prescribed Clonaz epam, a benzodiaz epine , to ndan t established through Dr. Donder shine that it breaches the standa rd of care to prescribe Clonaz epam to a patient like the plain tiff who suffered from Chroni c PTSD, had a history of drug and alcohol abus e and known active alc ohol use with occasional binge drinking. (Doc . 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 11, 15). Spec ifically, Dr. Donder shine testified with regard to the use of a benzodiaz epine from April 11 through July 2007 for the treatment of plain tiff's PTSD: I think it was not appropriate. . . . It was not appropria te to use that in this case in that way. . . . If there's an acute stress disorder and an accident just happ ened , it is okay to use a drug like benz odiaz epine for three to five days, but not longer because it could actually aggra vate the condition. Coming to this case, which is one of chronic PTSD that was endu ring alrea dy, benz odiaz epine s are known not to decrease any of the core symptoms of PTSD. They are a particular problem because they can disinhib it, like taking a drink of alcohol. 45They are also habit uating. So once the person gets used to it, decreasing it can cause problems because they can have w ithdrawal pr oblems . (Doc . 57, N.T. 9/10/12 required the13 chosen medic ation and the diagn osis is not present here. Simila rly, both the plain tiff's expert witnes s and the defense expert witness agreed that it is a deviation from the standa rd of care to prescribe Clonaz epam to treat the core symptoms of plain tiff's PTSD. (Doc. 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 15) (plaintiff's expert Dr. Don dershine indicating that the use of Clonaz epam was inappropria te); Doc. 68, N.T. 9/13/12 (defense expert Dr. Glazer indicating that it is not his opinio n that it was within the standa rd of care to treat the core symptoms of PTSD with Clonazepam) . In the instant case, it is undisputed that the defenda nt treated plain tiff with Clonazepam for several mont hs. In fact, it was the sole medic ine prescribed to the plain tiff from May 31 to July 3 and from July 16 to Augus t 13. (See Doc. 78, Pl. Ex. 1(a), Medic al Records). Nurs e Lucas indicated that he was aware that the FDA d id not approve using Clonaz epam to treat PTSD (Do c. 54, N.T. 9/11/12 at 22). He b elieved t hat the VA approved of the use of Clonazepam for the treatment of PTSD. (Id. at 22-24). The VA, however, indicated that such A disinhib iting drug can cause a person to do things that they13 norma lly would not do. (Doc . 54, N.T. at 24). 46medic ine the treatment PTSD. 91-1, Pl. Ex. 2 at I-5). Indeed , the Coat esville VA Hospital indicated that its PTSD program \"in complian ce with VA policy, does not suppo rt the use of benz odiaz epine s in the treatment of PTSD . . Please ensure that if benz odiaz epine s have been prescribed, their use is discontinued prior to the veteran's arrival.\" (Doc. 81, Pl. Ex. 28 at 41). According ly, we conclude that plaintiff has established that defenda nt violate d the standa rd of care with regard to a nexus b etween the chosen medic ation and the diagn osis. The next s tandard of care established by the plain tiff is the requiremen t for coordinated care. The appli cable standa rd of care for the treatment of PTSD requires the coordin ation of care through communic ation and the creation of an interdis ciplina ry treatment team. The defenda nt breached this standard of care in several ways. First, there was no coordin ation or discussion of plaintiff's care among st s medic al provides, Collelo-Minora , Boro wski, Lucas, Pierce, Santos and Bhatia. The second breach is Collelo-Minora 's failure to perform appropria te case man ageme nt or suppo rtive services for plain tiff or his family. (Doc 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 152-53). Also, plaintiff's med ical providers , Lucas, Pierce, Bhatia and Santos, violated the standa rd of care by failing to 47effectuate plain tiff's referral to psychot herapy. (Id. at 154-56). Pierce, Bahtia and Santos also violated this standard by failing to refer plaintiff to psychotherapy thems elves. (Id. at 155). Plain tiff also established that the standa rd of care permit ted defenda nt to use physic ian extenders like Lucas and Pierce. The standard requires however, that they prac tice unde r the supervision of a physic ian who must be aware of the case, provide e ducation and intervene when necessary for the patient's welfar e. Donder shine testified that the defenda nt deviated from the standa rd of care by not sufficiently supervising the treatment Lucas and Pierce provided t o plain tiff. (Doc . 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 12). For example, Lucas generally tre ated plain tiff without consultation with the supervising physician. (Doc . 54, N.T. 9/11/12 8-9, medic ines and doub the dosages of patient's med icines withou t discussion or approval of a supervising physician. As set forth above, Dr. Donder shine established the standa rd of care with regard to practicing medic ine over the telepho ne. He a lso has established the breach of this standard. The standa rd does not permit Pierce's actions of stoppin g one prescription and starting a new one over the telepho ne without seeing the patient and with no folllow-up. (Doc. 57, N.T. 9/10/12 at 12-13). Additionally, L ucas breached the standa rd of care 48durin g three phon e calls from the plain tiff on May 31, June 4, and June 22. He d id not question plain tiff in any sig nificant detail regarding his PTSD symptoms , but he discontinued one medic ine and increased and decreased another. (Id. at 14-15). He did all this while comply ing with a rigid rule of a two-mon th appoin tmen t schedu le. That is, he did not ask plain tiff to come in for an earlier appo intment despite the repeated phon e calls and problems plaintiff was reporting. (Id. at 14). Based upon all of the above, especially th e convincing testimony of plain tiff's expert witnes ses, we f ind that the defenda nt breached the standa rd of care in several ways. 3. Causati on Because we have fo und a duty and breach of that duty by the defenda nt, we must next de termine whether that breach caused harm to the plain tiff. Thierf elder , 52 A.2d at 1264. Gene rally, in a med ical malpra ctice action, a plaintiff needs expert testimony to establish causation. Gros sman v. Barke, 868 A.2d Ct. 2005). \"[L]aypersons generally [la ck] the knowledge to determine the factual issues of medic al causation[.]\" Id. at 567. In the present case, plaintiff provided t he expert witnes s testimony of Robert L. Gold stein, M.D., to establish causation. (Doc . 69, N.T. 9/14/12 at 3-19). Dr. Goldstein is an expert in the field of psychia try and the 49treatment and care of PTSD. (Id. at 3). Dr. Gold stein is board certified in psychiatry. (Id. at 5-6). He served for the past twenty y ears as a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Colleg e of Physicians and Surg eons at Columbia University. (Id. at 3). For the fifteen years before that, he served on the faculty of New York University Medic al School in Manha ttan. (Id. at 2). His main professional activity at this time is in the full-time practice of psychiatry and treating patients. (Id. at 4). More specifically relevant to this case, for six years in the late 1970 s and early 198 0s, Dr. Gold stein served as the direc tor of the outpatient psychiatry service at the New York Veterans Admin istration Medic al Cent er. (Id. at 4-5) For two and a half of those years, he was also the direc tor of inpat ient service. (Id. at 5). During his tenure at the VA he treated well over one thousand veterans suffering from PTSD. (Id. at 6). He a lso treated PTSD patients over the years in his private practice. (Id. at 7). The defenda nt stipulated to Dr. Goldstein's qualifications, and he was accepted at trial as an expert. (Id. at 3). Dr. Gold stein provided the following c onclusions: Plain tiff is totally and perma nently disabled since prior to Augu st 2007. (Id. at 7). When he arrived at the VA in April 2007, plaintiff would have bene fitted from psychotherapy and proper medic al therapy that the VA had availab le. (Id. at 10). At that time he was a high functioning individual without any prior 50history of psychiatric treatment , and he had a very good prognosis for substantial improvement or complet e recovery. (I d. at 11). Further, Dr. Gold stein opine d that it was foreseeab le that plaintiff would begin self- medic ating with Vicodin. (Id. at 12). Plain tiff never rec eived the appropria te treatment for worsening PTSD s ympto ms, and in such patients it is highly fo reseeab le, and very highly prob able, that the patient will re sort to self-medic ation and develop a n addic tion or habit uation habit . (Id.) epine , Clonaz epam, to plain tiff. At the time in 2007, it was recogniz ed that such medic ations could kick off another bout of addic tion and self-medic ation with addictive beh avior in patients with a history of prior substance abus e. Thus , it was to be prescribed with caution to patients with such a history. (Id. at 13). Here, not only did the VA not provide pro per PTSD treatment , but they admini stered a med ication would in self-medic ation with an addic tive s ubstance. The VA has develope d drug and alcohol counseling and educ ation programs for peop le with a history of substance abus e. The defenda nt never rec ommende d such programs for the plain tiff. (Id.) In fact, the defenda nt failed to impleme nt an appropria te treatment plan for the control and manag ement of plain tiff's PTSD. (Id. at 17). 51According ly, plain tiff has established that the defenda nt failed to provide h im with appropria te treatment between April and Augu st 2007. This failure is directly, causally and foreseeab ly related to plaintiff's disability. (Id.) The defenda nt could have fo reseen and predicted that its failure to treat plaintiff appropriately would lead to self-medic ation, substance abus e, and a substantial risk of impulsive, reckless, self- destructive and possibly violent behavior. (Id. at 16). If the defenda nt had provided appropria te standard of care treatment , plain tiff's prognosis for substantial improvement or complet e recovery w as very good. (Id. at 10). However, the defenda nt's failure to provide s uch treatment increased the risk that plaintiff would become perma nently disabled and this increased risk was a substantial factor in causing plain tiff's harm. (Id. at 18). If plain tiff's condit ion had not gotten worse, but had remain ed the same a s when he presented hims elf to the defenda nt, he would have co ntinued to function norma lly, and work. (Id. at 14). Unfo rtunately, howev er, defenda nt's actions did cause plain tiff's condition to worse n. We conclude that the plain tiff has established the causation between the defenda nt's breaches of the standa rd of care and the harm that has been caused to the plain tiff. In other words, defenda nt has caused plain tiff 52to be perma nently disabled due to its failure to provide a ppropriate treatment for plain tiff's PTSD b etween April and Augu st 2007. 4. Damages The final aspect of plaintiff's med ical malpra ctice action is damage s. The purpose of providing d amage s unde r the FTCA is to compens ate the plain tiff for his losses. Barnes v. United States, 685 F.2d 66, 69 (3d Cir. 1982 ). \"The purpose of personal injury compen sation is neither to reward the plain tiff, nor to punish the defenda nt, but to repla ce plaintiff's losses.\" Id. (quotation mark s and citation omitted). Thus , several different types of damag es are availab le to the plain tiff. Plain tiff can recover for economic damag es, which include his past earnings loss and his future loss in earnings. See PA. R. CIV. PRO. 1042 .71. Additionally, h e can recover for both past and future non-economic damage s for matters such as the pain and suffering he endu red due to the defenda nt's neglig ence. Id. We will address the economic damage s and the non-economic damage s in seriatim. A. Economic harm As noted above, plain tiff's economic harm claim is broken into past lost earnings and future loss in earnings. We will discuss each separately. 531. Past Lost Earn ings The plain tiff called two expert witnesses in support of his economic damag es claims , a vocational expert and an economis t. We will briefly discuss their quali fications and their testimony regar ding plain tiff. The parties stipulated to the expert witnes s quali fications of Patricia Chiller i, a vocational expert. (Doc. 69, N.T. 9/14/12 at 20). Chilleri has a bachelor of science degree in psychology and human service as well a s a master of science degree in rehabilitation counseling . Since 1981 , she has worke d in the field of vocat ional rehabil itation. She works to help peop have physic al, cognit ive or emot ional disabilities develop a rehabil itation plan and reintegrate back into the work world. (Id.) She meet s and evaluat es individuals with disabilities to determine their residual employability and earning potential. Additionally, s he is under contract with the federal government as a vocational expert for the Social Security Adminis tration. (Id.) In the instant case, she performed a residual employabilit y assessment of plain tiff. (Id. at 21). She found that the hand icap that the plain tiff's disability pos es in the work setting is extreme b ecause Dr. Gold stein determine d that from a medic al standp oint that plaintiff has total and perma nent disability. (Id.) She concluded that plaintiff suffers from a total vocat ional disability. (Id. at 36-37, 43). In other words plaintiff's 54\"economic horizons are stoppe d.\" (Id. at 43). Without the disability tha t he suffered, Chiller i opined that plaintiff would have co ntinued and been successful as a financ ial advisor. (Id. at 41). The median annua l wage of financial advisors in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area is $61,360 and the experie nced annu al wage is $85,210. (Id. at 42). When the salary statistics are examined for the whole state it reveals a median annua l wage of $67,470 and an experie nced annu al wage of $111,600. (Id.) Additionally, Chi lleri provided a n alternative pro fession pursuant to a transferable skills analysis . (Id. at 43). If plaintiff had sought out alternate employment, he had skills directly transferable to the occupational classification of \"training and development man ager.\" (Id.) In the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area this occupation has a med ian wage of $97,430 and an experie nced wage of $109,500. For the entire state of Penn sylvania, these amoun ts are $98,370 and $122 ,600. (Id.) In conclusion, Chilleri opined that plaintiff lacked the prerequis ites to maint ain compet itive employment in today's l abor market. Based upon Dr. Gold stein's prognosis and diagn osis, she also opine d that plaintiff is precluded from meet ing the standa rds of compet itive gainf ul employment. (Id. at 44). Also testifying r egarding plain tiff's economic damage s was plaintiff's final witness, Andrew Verzilli, an economis t. (Id. at 55). Verzilli has been 55an economis t for twenty-two years providing analysis and opini ons regarding the manne r in which events affect one's ability to earn income. (Id.) He testified regarding the plain tiff's lost earnin g capacity, which is an estimation of earnin gs plaintiff would have made had the medic al malpra ctice not occurred. (Id. at 56). Verzilli examined plaintiff's \"economic horizons and had this event not occurred what was [his] oppo rtunity to produce income based on [his] skills and talents, to some extent, [his] actual experie nce as well a s [his] educ ation and training .\" (Id. at 57). He reviewed t he following in mak ing his calculations: the vocational report of Patricia Chiller i, plain tiff's income tax returns for the years 2004-2009 , plain tiff's VA bene fit statement s, IRS/P A tax tables and variou s publi cations and source document s. (Doc . 91-23, Pl. Ex. 107). Verzilli comput ed plain tiff's past earnings loss for Securities/Fina ncial Sales position at $214,582. Verzilli comput ed also calculated a future14 An offset for the amoun t of vetera n's benefits plaintiff has alread y14 received is reflected in this amount . (Doc. 91-23, Pl. Ex. 108). Such a setoff is provided f or unde r 40 PENN. STAT. \u00a7 1303 .508(a) (providing that a plain tiff in a medic al malpra ctice action cannot recover damag es for past lost earnings to the extent that the loss is covered by a private or publi c bene fit that claiman t received prior to trial.) Verzilli also comput ed past lost wages for plain tiff with regard to the occupation of Training /Development Manag er. (Id.) We have ch osen to proceed with the comput ation with regard to the Securities/Fina ncial Sales position as that is the career plain tiff was pursuing at the time that he became perma nently disabled . Verzilli made two c alculations of the future earnings loss, one based on a wage growth of 3% and one based on a wage growth of 3.5%. (Id.) We 56loss in earnings at $2,144,803. (Id., Doc. 64, Stipulation Regard ing Economic Dama ges \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8). Thus, the total of the past and future loss of earnings as explain ed by Verzilli is $2,359,385. 2. Non-ec onomic damage s The second facet of damage s availab le to the plain tiff is non- economic damage s. Non-ec onomic damage s are provided to compen sate the plain tiff for pain and suffering , embar rassment and humilia tion; loss of ability to enjoy th e pleas ures of life and disfigureme nt. Vogels berger v. Magee -Womens Hosp. of UPMC Hea lth Sys., 903 A.2d 540, 555 (Pa. Supe r. Ct. 2006) (quoting PA. R. CIV. PRO. 223.3). In determini ng the non- economic damage s we consider \"the age of the plain tiff, the severity of his or her injuries, whether the injuries are tempora ry or perman ent, the duration and nature of med ical treatment , the duration and extent of physic al pain and ment al angu ish on the part of the plain tiff, and the plain tiff's . . . Ener gy, Inc., 51 A.3d 841 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2012). As set forth above, p laintiff has had significant \"pain and suffering \" due to the defenda nt's malpractice. Our verdic t will contain an amoun t sufficient to compens ate him for this pain and suffering . have ch osen to use the calculation based on a wage growth of 3%. 57Defe ndan t raises three other issues which it claims should reduce the amoun t of damage s availab le in the instant case. Thos e issues are compara tive neg ligen ce, set off and publi c We find no merit to the defenda nt's remainin g argument s, but we will add ress them a ll none theless. 5. Compar ative own negli genc e should reduce the amoun t of damage s to which he is entitled. Gene rally, we ag ree that a plain tiff's award of damage s should be reduced by the amoun t of his own negli genc e. The law provides as follows: In all actions brought to recover damag es for negli genc e resulting in death or injury to person or property, the fact that the plain tiff may have been guilty of contributory neglig ence shall not bar recovery by the plain tiff or his legal representative where such negli genc e was not greater than the causal negli genc e of the defenda nt or defenda nts again st whom re covery is sought, but any damage s sustained by the plain tiff shall be diminis hed in proportion to the amoun t of neglig ence attributed to the plain tiff. 42 PENN. CONS. STAT. ANN. \u00a7 7102 . According to the government , plain genc e includes the following: 1) self-medic ating with alcohol and illegal drugs; 2) failing to tell medic al providers of the self medic ation; and 3) failing to be hone st and 58open about sympto ms includin g not informing Nurs e Lucas that he wanted to \"jump off a roof\" or \"blow his brains out.\" Def's Req uested Conc . of Law \u00b6 58, at p. 50). We are unconvinced by the government 's argume nt. The testimony at trial revealed that plaintiff was initially a good patient and actively seeking help from the VA. The VA did not provide t he help and medic al treatment neede d by the plain tiff, and as a result, plaintiff began self- medic ating with alcohol and illegal drugs. The fact that plaintiff self- medic ated and failed to inform the medic al providers of it was caused by the government 's own failure to treat him. Accordin gly, the government 's liability should not be reduced. 6. Set off for future benef its As noted above, the VA has rated plain tiff as totally dis abled and pays hi m a mont hly disability bene fit. The governme nt will re evaluat e the plain tiff in 2014 to determine if he continues to be disabled under their rules and therefore entitled to further disability bene fits. The government seeks a credit for past and future VA disability co mpens ation bene fits that it has paid or will pay the plaintiff in the future. The plain tiff appe ars to agree with a set-off for the bene fits alrea dy paid, however, it argues that a set-off for non-guaranteed future mont hly disability bene fits is 59inapp ropriate. After a careful review , we agree with the plain tiff that a set- off for non-guaranteed future mont hly disability bene fits is inappropria te. First we note, that under Penns ylvania law, a plain tiff must prove damag es to a \"reasonable certainty.\" Barnes, 685 F.2d at 69. Once a plain tiff has established damag es to a reasonab le certainty, if the defenda nt seeks to then lower t he amoun t of damage s it must produce evidenc e to demons trate the proper reduction. Id. The reason for this rule is that \"the risk of uncertainty should be placed on the wrongdoer, rather than the innoc ent party.\" Id. In light of this standard, we t urn to the law with respect to the collateral source rule. Gene rally, P enns ylvania applie s the collateral source rule, which allows a plain tiff to recover from a defenda nt as well as another, indep ende nt source, such as an insurance policy. See Johnson v. Bean e, 664 A.2d 96, 100 (Pa.1995 ) (citing Beec hwoods Flying , 476 A.2d 350 (Pa.1984 The principle behin d this rule is that \"it is better for the wronged plain tiff to receive a potential windfall than for a tortfeasor to be relieved of responsibility for the wrong.\" Id. In our case, howev er, the paym ents at issue are from the tortfeasor, not an indep ende nt source such as an insurance policy. The law provides that \"a payment mad e by a tortfeasor or by a person acting for him to a 60person whom he has injured is credited again st his tort liability, as are paym ents made by another who is, or belie ves he is, subject to the same tort liability.\" Moo rehead v. Croz er Ches ter A.2d 786, 788 n.3 (Pa. 2001) (abrogated on other grounds by Northbrook Life Ins. Co. v. Commw . of Pa., 949 A.2d 333 (Pa. 2008)). Thus, we agr ee with the parties that a set-off for alread y paid bene fits is appropriate. The sole ques tion, therefore, is how to treat future bene fits that the defenda nt may pay the plaintiff on account of his disability. In suppo rt of its position that a set off for future bene fits is appropriate, the defenda nt cites to Carter v. Un ited States, 982 F.2d 1141 (3d Cir. 1992). In Carter, the plain tiff had been a patient at a VA hospital in Indiana . He brought a malpra ctice action again st the VA unde r the FTCA. Id. at 1143 . Indian a impos es a cap on the amoun t of damage s that can be recovered in a medic al malpra ctice action. The Carter court addressed whether this cap appli ed to limit damag es for which the United States could be liable. It also addressed the issue of whethe r veter ans' benefits paid to the patient should be dedu cted from the total amount of damag e incurred by the plain tiff or if it should be dedu cted from the statutory cap . The court concluded that the cap does apply to the United States and that the set-off amount should be dedu cted from the statutory cap not from the actual amoun t of damage s. Id. at 1143 -44. This case is thus not 61direc tly on point to the position for which the government cites it. In fact, the court used langu age that does not suppo rt the government 's position at all. It indicated: Reader s of this opinio n should guard again st the conclusion that we have pas sed on the ques tion whether the proje cted value of ongoin g veterans' bene fits is an 'advance' payment for purposes of Indiana 's law. Today's value o f tomorrow's bene fits is prophesy, not a fact. Congre ss could change the law, re ducing or even elimina ting the paym ents the Carters now receive mont h to mon th. Or the Carters might renoun ce receipt of these bene fits. Id. at 1145 . Thus, this opinio n provides little suppo rt to the government 's position. The government also cites to Cole v. United States, 861 F.2d 1261 (11th Cir. 1988). In Cole, a vetera n sued for medical malpra ctice for treatment rendered at a VA hospital. The court determine d that a set-off on the damag es should be awarded for present value o f expected future bene fits. Id. 1266 . This issue, however, is not the same issue we must address. In this case, we mus t determine how to treat uncertain future bene fits, not expected future bene fits. The parties agree that a set-off should apply to the past bene fits. It is the future, uncertain, possible but not guaranteed, benefits that are at issue here. The cases cited by the government therefore, are not precisely on point . The United States District Cou rt for the District of Maine, however, 62has addressed the issue which we must decide. See Poirier v. United States, 745 F. Supp . 23 (D. Me. 1990 ). In that case, the plain tiff, Poirier sued the United States for medic al malpra ctice for treatment he received at a VA hospital in Togus , Maine. Id. at 24. The court found that the VA hospital was liable. Id. at 29. In assessing the damag es, the court addressed whether the government was entitled to a set-off for the amoun t of disability bene fits to be paid to the Poirier in the future. Id. at 33. The court did not reduce his award based on future bene fits. Id. It explain ed: Also the court is hesitant to reduce plaintiffs' award in this case by any future bene fits from the VA in light of the uncertainty of those bene fits. It is well known that Con gress has the authority to change the level of VA bene fits at anytime it may dic tate, and the Veterans Admin istration has the right to adjus t its determina tions as to the percentage of bene fits [plaintiff] is entitled to, again , at anytime based upon employability s tandards [that are] difficult to articulate with any specificity. Id. We agree with the reasoning of Poirier. It is inappropria te to provide a set-off for non-guaranteed future bene fits. For example, the parties agree that plaintiff is to be reevaluat ed by the VA in 2014 to determine whether bene fits should continue. There is no guarantee that they w ill. According ly, allowing f or a set-off would not be making plain tiff whole. 637. Publi c policy Defe ndan t also argues that it is entitled to a verdic t because of the publi c policy that holds that an individual cannot benefit in a civil action from his illegal, immo ral or criminal acts. Evident ly, the government view s the instant case as an attempt on the part of the plain tiff to benefit from his robbery of a pharmacy in Augus t 2007 . After a careful review , we disagree. Penn sylvania law provides that \"[t]he common law princ iple that a person should not be permit ted to benefit by his own wrongdoing , particularly his own crimes , prevents a plaintiff from recovering losses which flowed from those criminal acts.\" Holt v. Navarro, 932 A.2d 915, 920 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2007) (citing Mineo v. Eure ka Sec. Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 125 A.2d 612, 615 (Pa. Super Ct. 1956 )). The factual scenarios, howev er, where the princ iple appli es are far different from the instant case. For example in Holt, the plain tiff, William Holt, had been commit ted to a hospital for a men tal health evaluat ion. Id. at 917. Holt absconded during an ambula nce transfer. He ran to a shopp ing center and enga ged in car jacking. Id. at 918. After his convicti on, Holt sued the hospital for negli gently transporting him. He a sserted that the criminal conviction that resulted from his escape caused him to suffer a reduced earning potential. Id. A jury aw arded the Holt $350,000, however, the Penn sylvania 64Supe rior Court reversed. The court noted that \"the no felony co nviction recovery rule appli es to discourage courts from as sisting convicted felons in collecting damag es that would not have occurred absent the criminal conviction.\" Id. at 920. In other words, Holt sough t damag es for injury that resulted direc tly from the conviction. The Penn sylvania Supe rior Court also appli ed the rule in Mineo, 125 A.2d 612. In that case, two restaurant owners were c onvicte d of burnin g down th eir restaurant. They had four insurance policies on the restaurant, and, after their arrests, they ass igned their rights unde r the policies to a third party. Id. at 614. The third party tried to collect on the policies, but the court ruled that they cou ld not. Id. The third party stood in the ident ical position as the arsonists would have. The arsonists would not be able to bene fit from their crime and therefore the insurance policy holder could not either. Id. The instant case is readily dis tinguishable . Plaintiff does not seek to bene fit from the commiss ion of a crime like the convicted arsonists in Mineo. Althoug h the facts surrounding this case include criminal acts committ ed by the plain tiff, plaintiff seeks to recover for medical negli genc e which rendered him perman ently disabled . crime is basically irrele vant as to defenda nt's liability. Plain tiff does not allege a chain of causation in which the alleg ed injury is directly caused by the criminal act as was the 65case in Holt. Hypothet ically, even if the plain tiff had not commit ted the crime, he would still have a professional negli genc e case agains t the defenda nt. Therefore, this case is not the sort of case where the plain tiff seeks to benefit from the commiss ion of a crime. Defe ndan t argues that plain tiff lost his job because he had been arrested. He seeks lost wages from the job he lost because of his arrest. Theref ore, his recovery is barred. We disagree. Here plain tiff may have officially been discharged from his employment because he was arrested, however, the evidenc e reveals that he is now one hund red percent disabled from working due to the defenda nt's med ical malpra ctice. 8. Loss of consorti um The final issue we must address is Plaintiff Marisol Laskowski's loss of consortium claim. The complai nt allege s that at all relevant times Maris ol Laskowski and Stanley Las kowski were husband and wife and residing together. (Doc . 1, Comp l. \u00b6 79). Due to her husband 's injuries -and the nship, society, affection and support of her husband .\" (Id. \u00b6 81). Thus she seeks judgme nt for damag es in excess of $150 ,000 for loss of consortium. Awarding, Marisol Laskowski damage s for loss of consortium is appropria te. 66A loss of consortium claim is derivativ e and can only su rvive where the injured party's claim has merit. Schroeder v. Ear, Nose & Throat Associates of Lehig h Valle y, Inc., 557 A.2d 21, 22 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1989). In the instant case, we have f ound that the injured party's claim, does indee d have merit . Thus, we will add ress the loss of consortium claim. A consortium claim is the vehicle through which a plain tiff recovers for \"right of one spouse to the company, a ffection, and assistance of and to sexual relations with the other.\" Machado v. Ct. 2002). As no mark et value f or loss of consortium damag es, \"the amoun t to be awarded for loss of consortium is left to the sound judgme nt and common sense of the fact-finder.\" Tind all v. Friedman , (Pa. Super. Ct. 2009). Theref ore, we mus t address the facts as presented at trial. When plain tiff returned to his family aft er serving in Iraq, he was a confident and attentive husband . (Doc . 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 5). He helpe d around the hous e, helped with the children, and assisted with such chores as washing dishes and taking out the trash. (Id. at 5-6). He would go out to dinne r with his wife, and was able to go out in crowds and to socialize. (Id. at 6). Plain tiff Maris ol Laskowski testified regarding the manne r in which her relationship with Stanley has chang ed due to his PTSD. While he was once an active par tner in parenting their children, the assistance he 67provides now is muc h less and Maris ol has to monit or the children to mak e sure that they do not trigge r a negative reaction in Stanley. ( Doc. 68, N.T. 9/13/12 at 32-33). He is unable to attend activities , such as danc e recitals and karate exhibitions in which his children participate. (Id. at 28). He is also unab le to do simple things such as take Maris ol out to dinne r. (Id. at 30). They canno t take family v acations. When they tried to go to the Phila delph ia zoo, the trip had to be cut short due to Stanley's disorder. (Id. at 28-29). She also testified that their intimate relations have change d due to his PTSD. (Id. at 30-31). The defenda nt does not challe nge the loss of consortium claim. According ly, we find that Plaintiff Marisol Laskowski has lost muc h of her husband 's compan y, affection and assistance. An award of damage s for loss of consortium is thus warrant ed, and we will set forth an appropria te amount for it in our verdic t. Conclusi on For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the defenda nt committ ed medic al malpra ctice. The United States owed a duty to the plain tiff which it breached. Defe ndan t diagn osed plain tiff with the PTSD from which he suffered but never treated him appropria tely. The defenda nt provided inapp ropriate medic failed to provide ps ychotherapy. Despite his condit ion not improving, and plain tiff continual ly contacting the 68VA to complai n abou t his sympto ms, the defenda nt never devised a coordin ated plan to address his PTSD. As a result the plain tiff suffered harm and is now disabled from working. Plain tiff has suffered past loss wages and will suffer wage loss in the future. Additionally, P laintiff Marisol Laskowski is entitled to an award of damage s for loss of consortium. An appropria te verdic t follows. We empha size again, that this case is very fact specific and our holdi ng appli es only to this plaintiff. Our decision should not be interpreted as an sweeping criticism of the care that the defenda nt provides to the nation's vetera ns in general. Our decision is based on the treatment received by this plaintiff as explain ed by the experts that testified in this case. Date : 1/16/13 s/ James M. Mun ley Judge James M.
