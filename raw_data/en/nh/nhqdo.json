Some forty years later the challenge proposed by Joshua Lederberg has been successfully taken up and his dream of see\u00ad ing defined molecular vaccines has been fulfilled (see Table 1 for the key steps). The chemical treatment (that is, by glutaralde\u00ad hyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide), a procedure that was developed at the beginning of the century to detoxify other toxins such as diphtheria and tetanus'. The vaccine here de\u00ad scribed is unique, because it contains a mutated, nontoxic form of pertussis toxin that is genetically detoxified. The mutant toxin is produced by an engineered strain of Bordetella pertussis containing the pertussis toxin gene that has been modified by site-directed mutagenesis in order to introduce two amino acid substitutions (Arg9~Lys and most advanced scientific knowledge has been ap-Table 1 Key steps of the development of the recombinant pertussis vaccine Glu129~Gly), in the active site of the enzyme. These amino acid changes render inactive the cat\u00ad alytic site and make the molecule nontoxic' (Fig. 1). Therefore, the plied to design rationally and to develop a geneti- 1984 cally engineered vaccine 1985 against pertussis that is 1987 molecularly defined and 1988 that confers maximal pro-1989 tection from disease by using low amounts of antigens, thus providing a 1990 safe product.

This approach offers several advantages. First, the mutant PT exhibits none of the toxic properties of the wild\u00ad type toxin, while retaining all other biological activities of the molecule. Second, the genetically engineered mutant PT is expected to retain the correct conformation of the wild-type toxin, and hence showing that rational engineering may indeed be used to im\u00ad prove the effects and the safety of vaccines and possibly drugs. the conformational (neutralizing) epitopes known to exist in the five subunits of the toxin. In fact, a recent study using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (see Table 2) has shown that toxin-neutralizing epitopes were well conserved in the genetically detoxified PT; however, these epi\u00ad topes were destroyed by the chemical detoxification of PT, which is usually used for vaccine production.

Pertussis toxin (PT) represents the key antigen in modern acel- 374 Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the cavity containing the active site of pertussis toxin and rationale for genetic detoxification. The toxic activity of pertussis toxin is mediated by the ADP-ribosyl\u00ad transferase ezymatic activity. During this reaction, the ADP-ribose group of NAD' is transferred to target proteins of eukaryotic cells. The active site of the enzyme is formed by a ~ strand and an a helix that make the floor and the ceiling of the cavity, and it contains two amino acids (Arg9 and Glul29) that are essential for catalysis. Following mutagenesis of the PT gene, to replace Arg9 with Lys and Glul29 with Gly, the mutant B. pertussis strain synthesizes a PT molecule that is enzymatically inactive and therefore nontoxic. The mutant PT molecule is the basis of the recombinant pertussis vaccine.

In the final formulation, the vaccine contains the mutant PT (5 Jlg/dose), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA; 2.5 Jlg/dose) and Pertactin (PRN; 2.5 Jlg/dose). This vaccine has now been tested in several phase II clinical trials. Valuable information was ob\u00ad tained from a trial performed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the USA, where the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine were compared with those of eleven vaccines containing chemically detoxified PT. Vaccines containing the recombinant PT induced an anti-PT response 10--20 times as high (on the basis of weight) as that from vaccines containing chemically inactivated PTs and had a steeper dose-response curve (Fig. 2)\"'. ... and efficacy The vaccine was tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy trial performed in Italy, involving approximately 16,000 infants. The trial was sponsored by NIAID and per\u00ad formed by the Istituto Superiore di Sanita in Rome. The results showed that the vaccine containing the genetically detoxified PT was very efficacious (84o/o) in protecting from disease, and during the first 30 months of observation, the subjects had fewer pertussis cases (55 cases) than those administered an effi\u00ad cacious acellular pertussis vaccine containing the same pertus\u00ad sis antigens, but prepared by conventional chemical inactivation (81 cases) [ref. 6, 7 and Greco, D. et al., Int. Congress for Infectious Diseases, Abstr. (1996)]. A close look at the results of the trial revealed that recipients of the vaccine containing genetically detoxified PT experienced 200.--------------------------, Detoxified PT: I=' ::E 150 A Genetically 8 ~ Chemically c 0 100 ~ ~ >-'0 0 .0 \u00b7.;:; ~ 50 o+----.----.----.---.----.----1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 PT (~g/dose) NATURE MEDICINE VOLUME 3 NUMBER 4 APRIL 1997 the vaccine containing chemically detoxified PT (composed of 25, 25 and 8 Jlg of PT, FHA and PRN, respec\u00ad tively), while, as expected from the higher antigen content, the antibody response to FHA and PRN was higher for the latter vaccine. The vaccine containing the genetically detoxified PT, in spite of having one-sixth as much protein, induced an earlier and longer lasting protection from disease. As the only difference between the two vaccines resides in the antigenic quality of the PT antigen, it is very likely that the observed superior protec\u00ad tive efficacy of the vaccine containing the genetically detoxi\u00ad fied PT is due to the PT antigen, which, in spite of being present in lower quantity, induces a better immune response. A qualitatively different immune response might explain why only during stage I, in coincidence with the very short peak of the maximal antibody response (shown as a green curve in Fig. 3), the higher quantity of the chemically inacti\u00ad vated PT (25 Jlg/dose) was able to induce a level of immunity that could compensate for the antigenic quality of the geneti\u00ad cally inactivated PT (5 Jlg/dose). In marked contrast, the low\u00ad dose recombinant PT was able to protect better from disease during the period of incomplete immunization and for an ex\u00ad tended time after the third immunization (stage II), when the antibody titers are low and the quality of the memory response is essential for protection. The success of vaccination using recombinant PT is an example of the importance of the quality of the immune response. Hence immunization may be improved by using high-quality antigens that can be delivered in low doses and with fewer im\u00ad munizations, which is preferable to the high doses and multi- Fig. 2 Antibody responses to pertussis toxin in vaccinated infants. The genetically detoxified pertussis toxin induces an immune response that differs in quality (as indicated by the slope of the curve) and in quantity (as indicated by the different titers), from that induced by chemically detoxified pertussis toxin. Infants were immunized with vaccines containing different amounts of chemically or genetically detoxified pertussis toxin molecules, during a large-scale phase II study performed in the USA by NIAID (ref. 2, 5). Titers are indicated as geometric mean titers (GMn. 375 \u00a9 199 7 Nature Publishing Group http://www.nature.com/naturemedicine COMMENTARY Fig. 3 Cases of pertussis (red and blue bars) and antibody re\u00ad sponse (green curve), during the first 30 months of the Italian effi\u00ad cacy trial. The trial compared the efficacy of a vaccine containing 25 J,lg of a chemically detoxified PT with a vaccine containing 5 J,lg of the genetically detoxified PT. Both vaccines were very effica\u00ad cious (84%) in protecting infants form disease during stage I of the trial, that coincides with the peak of the antibody response . In fact, during this period, only 37 and 36 cases occurred in the two groups, respectively , whereas more than 140 cases ' occurred in a group vaccinated with a whole-cell vac\u00ad cine that was only 36% effica\u00ad cious .

Congress for Infectious Diseases, Abstr . (1996)). This suggests that a different quality of immune response is induced by the two vaccines an that only during the peak of antibody response (stage 1), the higher quantity of chemically detox ified PT could compensate for the superior quality of the immune response induced by the genetically detoxified PT. The antibody response is reported as the percent of maximal response observed . ple immunizations required with low-quality antigens, where quantity can substitute for quality, but only for a short time during the peak of immune response. Conclusions The recombinant acellular pertussis vaccine represents the first example of a molecule constructed by rational design that has been shown to be efficacious in a clinical trial. This feature differ\u00ad entiates this product from all other acellular vaccines, developed during the same years, which contain an active toxin inactivated by chemical treatment. With minimal antigen content, the re\u00ad combinant vaccine induced earlier and longer lasting immunity, showing that the rational design of new molecules can modify the quality of the immunity induced, and provide vaccines that better serve our needs.
