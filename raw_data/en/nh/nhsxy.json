At its core, the Strategic Plan is focused on graduating students ready for life and work. Our Vision A global university of technology, design and enterprise.Our Values Passion We take pride in RMIT and its achievements and we are deeply committed to extending and deepening RMIT's positive impact. Impact RMIT achieves impact through an applied, practice-based approach to meeting contemporary needs. We shape the world for the better through collaborative design, research, learning and problem-solving. Inclusion RMIT creates life-changing opportunities for all, welcomes students and staff from diverse backgrounds, honours the identity and knowledge of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations, and is an accessible and open institution dedicated to serving the needs of the whole community. Courage We are honest and fair in our conduct and relationships. We embrace new thinking and evidence, test it rigorously and apply it to our own learning. We are strongly committed to performance, accountability and value for money. We speak out on issues of importance to our community and our world. We respect the rights of others and our obligations to the health of the planet. Agility We are forward-looking, balanced and sustainable in our approach to organisation and resourcing. We are able to adapt quickly and effectively to new pressures and opportunities. Imagination We value innovation and creativity as essential qualities of our work and resources for the economy and society. We are committed to developing, applying and sharing new ideas and perspectives. RMIT University 2016 Annual Report 44Organisational OverviewOur Mission RMIT exists to create transformative experiences for our students, getting them ready for life and work, and to help shape the world with research, innovation, teaching and engagement. RMIT embraces the task of extending the benefits of a fast-innovating, high-skill knowledge economy to our whole community and our world. We are dedicated to helping shape a new urban and industrial renaissance in the global economy. We are driven by impact and focused on the challenges and opportunities emerging around us. As the world economy transforms, we have a responsibility to make the resulting changes work for the whole of society. Our distinctive approach to connected education and research links creative ideas with technical knowledge. We empower students to shape their own lives, achieve impact and create valued places for themselves through work and engagement in the wider community. RMIT understands how to do this during a period of deep technological change - because we have been through it before. RMIT began helping people and organisations make the transition to an industrial society more than a century ago. Today, we embrace the challenge of helping to shape a new urban and industrial renaissance in a global economy.The innovation and pace of change now under way is immense. New industries are being created while others are destroyed. Yet more are being transformed and renewed. The mass factories of the past are being replaced by clusters of production centred around new knowledge, technology, skills and creativity. Students, workers and institutions need entrepreneurship and teamwork to adapt and succeed. Today, how we learn is just as important for success as where and what we learn. Being ready for life and work means combining contemporary ideas and deep knowledge with cutting-edge learning skills and methods. We are passionately committed to growing interdisciplinary expertise and creative thinking, together with practical application and problem-solving directly relevant to the lives of the communities we serve. Our commitment to serving students from all backgrounds is equally strong. This includes a responsibility to take a leading role in supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, to ensuring access and effective support for students with disadvantaged backgrounds, and to embracing the global diversity and talent of all our students and staff. In the coming years RMIT will offer programs and research in ways that will: \u2014 enhance creativity and impact \u2014 fully embrace the digital environment \u2014 get students, experts and employers working together \u2014 apply learning through work and enterprise \u2014 draw upon the leading edge of industry practice \u2014 introduce students to potential employers and investors \u2014 encourage students to belong to the life of their cities and their world \u2014 help students to start and succeed in enterprises of their own We will deploy our distinctive research capabilities to make new discoveries, to innovate through practice and to generate ideas and culture that enrich the economy and community. Our unique mix of interdisciplinary expertise and collaborative clustering will help to solve complex local national and global problems. For RMIT, this approach is both historically grounded and firmly contemporary. This is how we were established and how we have developed over almost 130 years. Being a university of technology, design and enterprise and a great urban university located in some of the most dynamic and creative cities around the world gives us a major advantage. By building on what we have achieved and embracing the possibilities of digital, economic and social transformation, RMIT will help to shape the future in a way that no other university can. Our task is to bring the talents of our staff and students together with industry and the community to renew ourselves through teaching, learning, research and collaborative innovation, all supported by new technology. RMIT University 2016 Annual Report 55\u2014 Chancellor's Statement 2016 was an important year for RMIT, its students and staff. The RMIT Strategic Plan, enunciated in 2015, began to come to life under the leadership of Vice-Chancellor Martin Bean CBE. The Strategic Plan aims to lead the University into the future by focusing on graduating students ready for life and work, while also providing lifelong training options for the many looking to upskill. With a global track record in innovation and the provision of flexible learning, and a mandate to continue to improve the unique RMIT student experience, our Vice-Chancellor has proven to be a man for the times, bringing with him the capabilities, innovative ideas and energy necessary to make the plan a reality. The strategy, Ready for Life and Work, puts the student experience unequivocally at the front and centre of everything we do at RMIT, focusing attention on good teaching, focused research, careers and employability, and inclusion and access. While our outlook is steadfastly fixed on the future, our aims reflect the original purpose for which RMIT was established in 1887 as the Working Men's College - to bring education to the people. As a global university with in excess of 84,000 students across the world, RMIT remains Australia's largest and most internationalised tertiary institution. Our scale means we can provide opportunities and resources which benefit our students. Our researchers and our alumni continue to make important contributions across the globe. On the commercial side, the year saw group revenues reach $1226 million, up 5.4 per cent on the previous year, and operating cash flows of $205 million. Given our strong balance sheet and underlying operational performance, and the current low interest rate environment, this cash flow augmented by borrowings is sufficient to fund the near billion dollars of capital investment we expect to make in support of offshore campuses, new infrastructure, IT systems and research facilities over the next five years. In 2016, RMIT embarked on the ambitious New Academic Street project which is transforming the City campus and providing our students with modern facilities optimally designed to support them both academically and socially. The project ensures that RMIT will continue to provide students, staff and visitors with a unique urban experience in the heart of Melbourne's CBD. RMIT opened its first student accommodation, Walert House, at the Bundoora campus, providing a high-tech model that enhances the student experience by integrating learning and living on campus. 2016 also saw the opening of the RMIT Activator, a dynamic platform for the RMIT community that empowers people to create ideas, bring them to life and facilitate start-ups through collaboration, access to advice and knowledge. Our readiness to design and construct facilities, and to innovate in learning and teaching technologies to provide best practice, ensures a contemporary and satisfying student experience and builds confidence in our ability to produce graduates who are job-ready and equipped with the skills necessary for success in a digital and connected world - a world that is changing rapidly in sometimes unpredictable ways. Whether it be political, demographic or environmental change, or fundamental change to global workforce models, skill needs and career options, RMIT must be able to adapt to unexpected challenges - and opportunities. And we must provide our students with the capability to do the same if we are going to succeed in our mission. Designing for a future that is so unpredictable is both exhilarating and unsettling. Everything we do at RMIT seeks to prepare our students to master future challenges, whether they are with us undertaking research, completing a program of study, or participating in a start-up enterprise under our guidance. The University continues to be well served by its Council and I am grateful to my colleagues for their diligence, enthusiasm and wisdom in helping guide our institution. We welcomed Associate Professor Debra Bateman and Mr Ariel Zohar to the Council during 2016 and farewelled Mr James Michelmore and Mr Brett Paton. In particular I would like to thank the Deputy Chancellor, Ms Janet Latchford, who fulfilled a busy calendar of duties in Melbourne and globally with grace and aplomb - as she always does. The year ahead will see RMIT progress its goal to create a world-class educational experience for its students. Universities everywhere will be subject to the same forces of change and disruption as we are. Yet while we will remain alert to unexpected shifts, at RMIT we believe we are well placed to respond to challenges and exploit shifts to the benefit of RMIT and its community. The Vice-Chancellor and his executive team are energetically pursuing our aspiration to be a leading global university of design, technology and enterprise. They build upon a proud history which has emphasised the needs of students, staff and the communities we serve as its focus, while accepting that past performance is no guarantee of future success. I join with the Vice-Chancellor in thanking all of RMIT University's staff who work diligently to ensure a quality experience for all. Dr Ziggy Switkowski AO Chancellor RMIT University 2016 Annual Report 66\u2014 Vice-Chancellor's Statement Guided by our Strategic Plan, Ready for Life and Work, and empowered by the enthusiasm and capability of our staff, RMIT University made substantial headway in 2016 in implementing our three strategic directions. As part of this, the University launched some significant initiatives to enhance access and outcomes for students and staff. They included: \u2014 The Reconciliation Action Plan, to improve the levels of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in leadership, learning and teaching, research, staff and student participation, and community engagement. \u2014 Our Future Ready program, designed to prepare students for life after university, including access to an individualised final-year Career Health Check. \u2014 Establishment of RMIT Activator, a dynamic platform that empowers students, staff and alumni to create ideas, bring them to life and energise existing start-ups through collaboration, advice and knowledge. Life-changing experiences for our students Among students, participation in global mobility programs continued to grow, as did participation in student sports, clubs and activities. We continued to focus on improved learning and teaching technology, career and course advice, mentoring and industry placements. Importantly, all these activities were underpinned by a continuing strong financial performance. There were two groups of students whose achievements in 2016 deserve special mention. A multidisciplinary team who designed and constructed a functional Hyperloop pod prototype were rewarded with the 2016 Premier's Design Award (Student Design category). They also competed against 1700 other student teams to win a place in the final of Elon Musk's SpaceX Hyperloop Pod competition. Three students won medals at the Rio Olympics and Paralympics. Jared Tallent OAM won silver in the 50km walk, becoming the only Australian male athletics competitor to win a medal at three consecutive Olympics. In the Paralympics pool, Ashleigh McConnell won gold and set a world record and Monique Murphy won silver.Passion with purpose, powered by our values In an exciting development for RMIT, we held our inaugural Sustainability Week. Highlights included a tour of RMIT's green roofs, an \"ideas incubator\" pitching session, ethical and sustainable food tours near the City campus, networking opportunities with industry partners, and Earth Hour. Work continued on the Sustainable Urban Precincts Program, RMIT's biggest ever investment in energy and water efficiency. The $128 million project aims to reduce electricity use by 263 million kWh over eight years, leading to a 32,000-tonne reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Water use will be cut by 53 million litres. To this end, works were completed at Brunswick campus and neared completion at Bundoora campus. The annual reduction of CO2 emissions of almost 11,000 tonnes enabled RMIT to achieve our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 25 per cent four years early. The New Academic Street project continued to transform the heart of the City campus by creating new facilities that will enable RMIT to deliver better services for students and improved facilities for all. During 2016, first works were completed across 13 buildings, including two on Bundoora campus. Shaping the world through teaching and researchWe continued to improve our global position in the 2016 QS World University Rankings, with RMIT now ranked 13th in Australia and 252nd overall: a rise of 52 places from 2014. For the first time, RMIT has appeared in the Academic Ranking of World Universities' top 500. These results reflect RMIT's strengthening record in delivering research with impact. We received significant external research funding in 2016, with a 12 per cent increase in grant application numbers and a 61 per cent increase in application success rates compared with the previous year. Our researchers received $9.27 million in Australian Research Council grants for 23 projects. Further confirmation of our research standing came with the award to Associate Professor Sharath Sriram of the 2016 3M Eureka Prize for Emerging Leader in Science. Our global scale continues to make an impact. RMIT Vietnam, which celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2016, has launched a new Master of Architecture as well as a new PhD program with a focus on research in business, management and engineering. RMIT Europe secured the first award of European research funding to RMIT Vietnam through the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation funding scheme. RMIT Europe also delivered the first Global Summer in Barcelona event, with 30 RMIT students from Australia, Vietnam and Singapore taking part. The whole RMIT community is rising to the challenge of building a stronger and more effective university. I have confidence this will continue in 2017 and beyond.

A collaboration between RMIT's Quantum Photonics Laboratory, Politecnico di Milano and the South University of Science and Technology of China has trialled a processor capable of routing quantum information from different locations, in a critical breakthrough for quantum computing (pictured). The Quantum Photonics Laboratory, in partnership with EQuS at the University of Sydney, has also demonstrated a new technique for self-guided quantum tomography, which opens up pathways for the characterisation of large quantum states and provides robustness against inevitable system noise. RMIT researchers, supported by partners in Melbourne, Singapore and China, have developed a device that allows the development of an ultrafast information processing platform for large-scale optical computing. The discovery could facilitate applications in photonic data storage, light generation, biophotonics enabling subwavelength optics in microscopy and lithography beyond the resolution limit of an optical imaging system. A low-cost, low-energy device that will help data centre technology suppliers increase their computing power and reduce energy consumption has won CSIRO backing. The Australian Silicon Photonics team at RMIT developed the novel device which replaces electronic interconnects with photonic links. An RMIT collaboration has led to the discovery of a new form of science's latest wonder material, silicine. The research with Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology and Toyota Central R&D Labs has developed a two-dimensional nanomaterial resistant to oxidation for widespread application in the manufacturing industry. Groundbreaking research in RMIT's state- of-the-art MicroNano Research Facility has developed a stretchable nano-scale device, paving the way for smart contact lenses. The device manipulates light to such an extent that it can filter specific colours while still being transparent. The research combined RMIT's materials science and nanofabrication expertise with University of Adelaide researchers' proficiency in interaction of light with artificial materials. Science fiction is inching closer to reality with the development of revolutionary self- propelling liquid metals by RMIT Engineering researchers, in a critical step towards future elastic electronics. As well as being able to change into virtually any shape, metal in liquid form retains a highly conductive metallic core and a thin semiconducting skin, essential for making electronic circuits. We will shape the world by focusing on high-impact research and collaboration, by embedding industry and enterprise into everything we do, and by ensuring global reach and outlook.

A team of researchers from RMIT and China's Hainan University has completed a study providing the first conclusive evidence that microbeads directly contaminate fish with toxic chemicals. Federal Government is working with industry towards a voluntary phase-out of microbeads by mid-2018. Funding of $3 million by the ARC Industrial Transformation Research Hub will support a new RMIT Centre in Lightweight Automotive Structures. The Centre will bring together world-leading scientists and industrial engineers from Australia, Germany, the UK and US to support transformation of Australia's automotive industry from vehicle production to exporting engineering services and locally manufactured high-value products. RMIT's Micro/Nanomedical Research Centre was one of three recipients selected for substantial funding from 470 applications world-wide in the World Without Disease QuickFire Challenge supported by Johnson & Johnson and Janssen BioTherapeutics. The Centre is developing a revolutionary nebuliser (pictured) to deliver lung cancer drugs and vaccines via inhalation. A new class of sound wave created by RMIT's MicroNano Research Facility could help drive a revolution in stem cell therapy. Researchers combined two types of acoustic sound waves (pictured) to create a hybrid gentle enough to use in biomedical devices to manipulate fragile stem cells, opening new possibilities in vaccinations, stem cell therapies and cancer treatments. Self-cleaning clothes are on the way, thanks to pioneering research working with copper and silver-based nanostructures, known for their ability to absorb visible light. Researchers from RMIT's NanoBiotechnology Research Lab and the Ian Potter NanoBioSensing Facility have developed a cheap and efficient way to grow special nanostructures - which can degrade organic matter when exposed to light - directly onto textiles (pictured). The first animal trials of smart gas-sensing pills developed at RMIT (pictured) have examined the impact of low and high-fibre diets and offered new clues for treatment of gut disorders. Intestinal gases have been linked to colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, but their role is poorly understood and there is currently no effective tool for detecting them. RMIT, in partnership with Adelaide, Harvard and California university researchers, has revealed the secret behind the Australian blue-banded bees' unique approach to pollination: high-speed headbanging. The discovery could lead to advances ranging from improving the efficiency of certain crop pollination to better understanding muscular stress and the development of miniature flying robots. RMIT researchers have compiled the first comprehensive carbon footprint table for fresh food, enabling chefs, caterers and individuals to prepare meals without cooking the planet. The greenhouse gas emissions dataset will help consumers and catering firms calculate the environmental impact of the fresh food they eat and the menus they serve. Engineering researchers have shown how fired-clay bricks made with cigarette butts can save energy and help solve a global littering problem. They have demonstrated that bricks with as little as 1 per cent cigarette butt content can cut brick production costs and save the environment. RMIT is setting the agenda on what it means to live in environmentally, socially and culturally sustainable cities through a series of workshops, symposiums, talks and forums held in Barcelona. The Ethical Cities Event Series positioned RMIT on the European agenda for research into city resilience and liveability, and as a key partner for upcoming Horizon 2020 research on ageing and the built environment. Also in Barcelona, RMIT tackled issues affecting the built environment at a symposium on disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation, conflict risk management, recovery and reconstruction. Sixty people took part from across Europe, including academics and representatives of government and organisations working in the disaster and development sector. RMIT Europe is working with partners University International of Catalonia, UN-Habitat and the Federation of the Red Cross to provide a global learning platform to design resilient and sustainable spaces and cities. As part of the Urban Futures program, a new Master of Disaster, Design and Development was launched in 2016 to build city resilience and design systems for disaster alleviation. It will include intensive seminars in Barcelona and Melbourne incorporating work with multidisciplinary teams across sites of environmental and economic risk. RMIT researchers will work on a plan for eight new \"smart\" cities to be linked by high-speed rail. The project, led by Consolidated Land and Rail Australia - thought to be the largest undertaking of its kind in the world - aims to address overcrowding in Melbourne and Sydney by developing high-tech and sustainable cities in regional Victoria and NSW. An RMIT Design Hub exhibition provided ideas and answers to the challenges of life in the modern metropolis. Occupied brought together local and international artists and architects with proposals for housing more with less by retrofitting and adapting existing structures and environments. The exhibition was a finalist in the 2016 Premier's Design Awards (Communication Design category). Business IT and Logistics researchers have made an important contribution to examining Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires, determining that better forward planning could have dramatically cut the death toll. Their findings regarding emergency evacuation of late evacuees could help in a range of disaster scenarios, including hurricanes and flooding.

Officially opened in May by the Minister for Training and Skills, Steve Herbert, the RMIT Skills and Job Centre is a first point-of-call for those looking to start training or retrain, workers needing to reskill, and employers offering work placement opportunities. RMIT's Careers and Employability Service was voted the best University career service in Victoria and in the top four nationally by the Australian Association of Graduate Recruiters. The recognition highlights our focus on providing effective engagement with employers to maximise work-integrated learning and graduate employment opportunities. Future Edge, RMIT's co-curricular student employability program, has grown both in student engagement, with 1740 enrolments, and program structure. Development activities around Indigenous awareness, leadership, innovation, sustainability and digital literacy have been incorporated to support students in developing 21st century skills. The Future Ready program was run across the University in Semester 2, resulting in 3500 student attendances. Students take part in a range of events designed to help them reflect on their experiences at RMIT and prepare for graduate life, including access to a final-year Career Health Check. RMIT's industry mentoring program has surpassed 900 mentoring partnerships between students and industry professionals. The program received a commendation at the 2016 GLOBE Awards for Connecting the GLBTI Community and was shortlisted for the ANZ Excellence in Business award. Student Activity RMIT Link oversaw the running of 42 clubs and collectives with 3031 active members, an increase of 36 per cent on 2015. The Social Sport on Campus program was a big success, with participation in the program doubling as the emphasis shifted towards activities and programs led by students. Overall, 247 social sport activities were run at all campuses, with 3263 participants. For the second year running, the RMIT Redbacks team of 200 students were crowned overall champions at the Southern University Games. The RMIT Women's football team also claimed gold for the second year in a row at the Australian University Games. Learning and Teaching A new Academic Careers project will deliver a single flexible career pathway for higher education academics. The model is based on three role-specific benchmarks for teaching, engagement and research. A further project is strengthening orientation and transition experiences for students, and is also supporting new approaches to credentialling, more adaptive pedagogies and renewed approaches to the staff professional development. A renewed focus on academic integrity was introduced in response to demonstrable risks to assessment integrity through the rise of contract cheating services. This initiative has taken an educative approach that addresses the awareness and responsibilities of all members of the university community. A number of technical developments were made to RMIT's learning systems. To increase the availability of streaming media communication, YouTube and Hangouts on Air was activated, along with renewed online grading technology. A Basic Key Skills Builder (bksb) online evaluation tool was launched which introduced individual assessment of Maths and English skills for all incoming VE students. The implementation of a pre-training review has enabled systematic identification and delivery of support services for individual VE students. RMIT Vietnam has prioritised the promotion and facilitation of digitally enabled industry-relevant and work-integrated learning experiences.

Cycling support Over the past two years, RMIT has been delivering on its Sustainable Integrated Transport Plan with a focus on cycling. The centrepiece of the plan was the delivery of a bike hub on the City campus. In response to feedback that the availability of high-quality end-of-trip facilities is a key motivator for cycling to the University, the bike hub offers parking for 400 bikes, change facilities, showers, lockers, drying cupboards, ironing boards and hair dryers. Electric bike charging, repair stations and a bike vending machine complete the space, which hosts weekly student-led bike repair workshops. Secure bike cages have been installed at Bundoora and Brunswick campuses, as well as improved lighting and CCTV to ensure students and staff are encouraged to ride to campus.Achieving our targets The Sustainable Urban Precincts Program, RMIT's biggest ever investment in energy and water efficiency, was progressed across the University's three Melbourne campuses. Part of RMIT's commitment to manage resources for long-term value, the program aims to reduce electricity use by 263 million kWh over eight years, leading to a 32,000-tonne reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Water use will be cut by 53 million litres and heating, ventilation and aircon facilities are being upgraded. Working with our industry partners, 2016 saw the completion of works at Brunswick campus and near completion at Bundoora campus. A reduction of almost 11,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions has been recorded, which will continue to be realised annually. These initiatives have enabled RMIT to achieve its ATN greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 25 per cent four years early. The program was highly commended at the Green Gown Awards Australasia in recognition of work already completed. Bike repair station on the City campus.

These policies have been consistently applied to all years reported, unless otherwise stated. The financial statements include the statements for Royal MelbourneInstitute of Technology ( RMIT ) as the parent entity and the consolidated entity consisting of RMIT and its subsidiaries (the Group). The principal address of RMIT is Building 1, 124 LaTrobe Street, Melbourne. (a)Basis of preparation The annual financial statements represent the audited general purpose financial statements of RMIT . They have been prepared on an accrual basis and comply with Australian Accounting Standards. RMIT applies Tier 1 reporting requirements. Additionally the statements have been prepared in accordance with following statutory requirements: Higher Education Support Act 2003 (Financial Statement Guidelines) Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) interpretations Financial Management Act 1994 Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission Act 2012 RMIT is a not-for-profit entity and these statements have been prepared on that basis. Some of the Australian Accounting Standards requirements for not-for-profit entities are inconsistent with IFRS requirements. Date of authorisation for issue The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Council members of RMIT on 28 February 2017 . Historical cost convention These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss, certain classes of property, plant and equipment and investment property. Critical accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. They also require management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying RMIT 's accounting policies. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group . The areas involving a higher degree of judgment, complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed below: Key Estimates Depreciation Management establishes the useful life of buildings based on advice from external independent valuers. Useful lives of other property, plant and equipment are established according to the guidelines provided by the Department of Treasury and Finance, the Australian Taxation Office and Australian Accounting Standards. Assets are reviewed annually at a class level and this includes making an assessment of the useful life and residual value. Any adjustments to useful lives are then made to a selection of assets within those classes. Amortisation of Intangible Assets Management uses estimates of useful life to determine the amortisation of internally developed or acquired Intangible Assets.L ong Service Leave Provision In calculating long service leave provisions, management uses a combination of the bond rates issued by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the salary increases in accordance with the Enterprise Bargaining Agreement and the probability factors based on staff retention rates. F-11Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-11 F-12Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (a)Basis of preparation (continued) Key Judgments - Impairment RMIT assess impairment at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group that may lead to impairment of assets. Where an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. Value-in-use calculations performed in assessing recoverable amounts incorporate a number of key estimates and judgements. Provision for impaired receivables Included in consolidated Accounts Receivable at 31 December 2016 are amounts receivable from customers and students amounting to $16.807 m (2015 - $26.402 m). The full amount of the debt is not recoverable and as such a doubtful debts provision amounting to $5.374 m (2015 - $9.732 m) has been set aside. Provision for other financial assets Management takes up a provision for its investment in unlisted shares when it believes these are no longer recoverable. A provision is taken up for shares in non related companies when there is an inability to repay outstanding debt to the university or there is support they may no longer be recoverable (eg. where the company declares no dividend and/or is largely funded by other universities). C omparative amounts Where necessary, comparative information has been reclassified to enhance comparability in respect of changes in presentation adopted in the current year. (b)Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of RMIT as at 31 December 2016 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. RMIT and its subsidiaries together are referred to in the financial statements as the Group or the consolidated entity. Subsidiaries are all those entities (including special purpose entities) over which the Group has control. The Group has control over an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Power over the investee exists when the Group has existing rights that give it current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertibleare considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. Returns are not necessarily monetary and can be only positive, only negative, or both positive and negative. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group . They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group . Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group . Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated income statement , statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity. (c)Foreign currency translation (i)Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group 's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entities operate ('the functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is RMIT 's functional and presentation currency. (ii)Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of thetransactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement . If gains or losses on non-monetary items are recognised in other comprehensive income, translation gains or losses are also recognisedin other comprehensive income. Similarly, if gains or losses on non-monetary items are recognised in profit or loss, translation gains or losses are also recognised in profit or loss. F-12Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-13 F-14Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (c)Foreign currency translation (continued) (iii)Group entities translation The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: - assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position ; - income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions); and- all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are accounted for by recognising the effective portion in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in the income statement . When a foreign operation is sold or any borrowings forming part of the net investment are repaid, the gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the hedge that has been recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement as a reclassification adjustment. ( d)Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, tradeallowances, rebates and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group and specific criteria have been met for each of the Group 's activities as described below. In some cases this may not be probable until consideration is received or an uncertainty is removed. The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.Revenue is recognised for the major business activities as follows: ( i)Government financial assistance Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where the Group obtains control of the right to receive the grant, it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group and it can be reliably measured. (ii)HELP Payments Revenue from HELP is categorised into those received from the Australian Government and those received directly from students. Revenue is recognised and measured in accordance with the above disclosure. (iii)Fees and Charges Fees and charges are recognised as income in the year of receipt, except to the extent that fees and charges relate to courses to be held in future periods. Such receipts are treated as income in advance in the statement of financial position . Conversely, fees and charges relating to current year courses are recognised as revenue in the income statement . (iv)Investment income Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the financial asset. (v)Consultancy and Contracts Contract revenue is recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method. The stage of completion is measured by reference to labour hours incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total labour hours for each contract. Other human resources revenue is recognised when the service is provided. The following factors are used to assess whether a research contact is reciprocal or non-reciprocal and therefore must be recognised on receipt or can be deferred to future periods: - the benefits of the grant are for the greater community and not directly for the grant provider; - the other party cannot demonstrate that approximately equal value is directly given in exchange to the grantor/s; and- the requirement to return funds to the grantor if service levels/milestones are not met. ( vi)Sale of non-current assets The net profit or loss of non-current asset sales are included as revenue or expense at the date control of the asset passes to the purchaser, usually when an unconditional contract of sale is signed. The gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset at the time of disposal and the net proceeds on disposal.

(viii)Contribution of assets and donations Contributions of assets and contributions to assist in the acquisition of assets, being non-reciprocal transfers, are recognised as revenue at the fair value of the asset received when the Group gains control of the contribution. (e)Income tax RMIT does not provide for Australian income tax as it is exempt under provisions of Division 50 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA). The income tax expense or income for the period is the tax payable/receivable on the current period's taxable income based on thenational income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differencesbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction (other than a business combination) that at the time of the transactionaffects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in controlled entities where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable thatthe differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to the same taxation authority are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and they are intended to be either settled on a net basis, or the asset is to be realised and the liability settled simultaneously. Current and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised outside profit or loss are also recognised outside profit or loss. ( f)Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases - note 33(b) . Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. (g)Impairment of assets Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not berecoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount for most assets is measured at the higher of depreciated replacement cost and fair value less costs to sell. Recoverable amount for assets held primarily to generate net cash inflows is measured at the higher of the present value of future cash flows expected to be obtained from the asset and fair value less costs to sell. Non-financial assets that were previously impaired arereviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. ( h)Cash and cash equivalents For statement of cash flows presentation purposes, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to knownamounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.

Trade receivables are due for settlement no more than 120 days from the date of recognition, and no more than 30days for other debtors. Collectability of receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. At year end a full review of each debtor balance over 90 days is conducted. Debts which are known to be uncollectible are written off. A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments (more than 30days overdue for trade and 45days overdue for student related debt) are considered indicators that the receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value ofestimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short-term receivable are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement . The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within 'Bad and doubtful debts'. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade /students receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 'Bad and doubtful debts' in theincome statement . Estimated provision for doubtful debts is recorded based on the aged trial balance and the management judgement of debt recovery. Outstanding trade debts that are 90days overdue are reviewed on an individual basis, and the provision is recorded based on the assessment of the individual debt and the possibility of the debt recovery. Student debts that are 90days overdue are provided with 100% provision. No provision is made for receivables from government and education sectors. ( j)Inventories Stock held for distribution Stock held for distribution is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs are assigned to individual items of inventory on thebasis of weighted average costs. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costsnecessary to make the sale. W ork in Progress Services: Valuation of Work in Progress - Services is based on the number of hours charged to project milestones in respect of incomplete and unbilled milestones. These hours are calculated at the average labour cost per billable hour, including oncosts, for the final quarter of the year. An allowance of 10% has been deducted for potential project overruns. Products: Valuation of Work in Progress - Products is based on the number of hours charged to project milestones net of budget overruns. These hours are valued at the average direct cost per billable hour. Digital Products: Valuation of Work in Progress - Digital Products is based on the number of hours charged to project milestones net of production overruns. These hours are calculated at the average labour cost per billable hour, including on-costs, for four months post annual salaryincrease. ( k)Investments and other financial assets Classification The Group classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, and available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired and held. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and, in the case of assets classified as held-to-maturity, re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date. F-15Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-15 F-16Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (k)Investments and other financial assets (continued) (i)Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. (ii)Derivatives Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. RMIT designates certain derivatives as either: (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges). (a)Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement , together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. (b)Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within other income or other expense. Amounts that have been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in the income statement . When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, anycumulative gain or loss that has been recognised in other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective shallremain separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. ( c)Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement . (iii)Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance date which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are included in receivables in the statement of financial position . ( iv)Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Group 's management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. (v)Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets, comprising principally marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date - the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and transaction costs areexpensed in the income statement . Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in other comprehensiveincome are included in the income statement as gains and losses from investment securities. F-16Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-17 F-18Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (k)Investments and other financial assets (continued) Subsequent measurement Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arisingfrom changes in the fair value of the 'financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' category are included in the income statement within other income or other expenses in the period in which they arise. Changes in the fair value of monetary security denominated in a foreign currency and classified as available-for-sale are analysed between translation differences resulting from changes in amortised cost of the security and other changes in the carrying amount of the security.The translation differences related to changes in the amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss, and other changes in carrying amountare recognised in equity. Changes in the fair value of other monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity. F air Value The fair values of quoted investments are based on quoted prices in an active market. If the market for a financial asset is not active (and for unlisted securities), the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques. These include reference to the estimated price in an orderly transaction that would take place between market participants at the measurement date, involving the same instruments or other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing models refined to reflect the issuer's specific circumstances. In relation to RMIT's investments in unrelated entities, these are valued on a net cash basis. Impairment The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a securitybelow its cost is considered in determining whether the security is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss - measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit and loss - is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement . Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement . In applying AASB 139 , two tests have been considered in determining whether the impairment entries are to be taken to equity: i. the decline is \"substantial\" (more than 20% below investment cost) and ii. \"prolonged\" (more than 12 months in that state). Failure to meet either test would require the impairment to be charged to the income statement . (l)Fair value measurement The fair value of assets and liabilities must be measured for recognition and disclosure purposes. The Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.The fair value of assets or liabilities traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date (level 1). The quoted market price used for assets held by the Group is the most representative of fair value in the circumstances within the bid-ask spread. The fair value of assets or liabilities that are not traded in an active market (for example, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments (level 2) are used for long term debt instruments held. Othertechniques that are not based on observable market data (level 3) such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining assets & liabilities. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The level in the fair value hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Fair value measurement of non financial assets is based on the highest and best use of the asset. The Group considers market participants use of, or purchase price of the asset, to use it in a manner that would be highest and best use. In light of AASB 13, the Group has reviewed the fair value principles as well as its current valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value, and the assessment has not materially changed the fair values recognised, eg. the depreciated value represents a reasonable estimate of fair value. The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. F-17Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-17 F-18Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (m)Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings are shown at fair value, based on periodic, but at least triennial, valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. The last revaluation of land and buildings was performed at the end of 2014. An assessment of land and buildings is performed every year apart from the full revaluation years and any variances greater than 10% are adjusted. All other plant and equipment is relatively low in value, but represents a large proportion of the total volume of assets. Such assets areacquired and disposed of frequently, have short depreciable lives and subject to impairment tests as applicable. There is no evidence to indicate a fair value significantly different from the depreciated cost. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Increases in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and buildings are recognised, net of tax, in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the heading of revaluation surplus. To the extent that the increase reverses a decrease previously recognised in profit or loss, the increase is first recognised in profit or loss. Decreases that reverse previous increases of the same asset are also firstly recognised in other comprehensive income before reducing the balance of revaluation surpluses in equity, to the extent ofthe remaining reserve attributable to the asset class; all other decreases are charged to the income statement . Upon disposal, any revaluation surplus relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred out to retained earnings. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts. These are included in the income statement . When revalued assets are sold, it is Group policy to transfer the amounts included in other reserves in respect of those assets to retained earnings.Land and works of art are not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated using the straight line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives, as follows: 2016 Years2015 Years Buildings 25-100 25-100 Equipment, The capitalisation threshold for plant, equipment, computers, motor vehicles and furniture and fittings to be recognised as an asset is $2,000 (2015: $2,000 ). The library collections are capitalised on an individual unit basis as they are considered to be significant in value as a collective group. The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. (n)Leasehold improvements Leasehold improvements are capitalised and amortised over the shorter of their useful life or the remaining life of the lease. (o)Intangible assets (i)Research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense, when it is incurred. Expenditure on development activities, relating to the design and testing of new or improved products, are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will, after considering its commercial and technical feasibility, be completed and generate future economic benefits and its costs can be measured reliably. The expenditure capitalised comprises all directly attributable costs, including costs of materials, services, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Capitaliseddevelopment expenditure is recorded as an intangible asset and amortised from the point at which the asset is ready for use. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over the period of the expected benefit, which varies from 4 to 20 years ( 2015: 4 to 20 years).

(iii)Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The total amount of new internally developed intangible assets must be $500K or higher in order to be considered for capitalisation. (iv)Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. (v)Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis in profit or loss over their estimated useful lives, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows: 2016 Years2015 Years Software 3 3 Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. (p)Trade and other payables These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year, which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30days of recognition. (q)Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are removed from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in other income or other expenses. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date and does not expect to settle the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. (r)Borrowing costs Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying asset are expensed as incurred in accordance with Financial Reporting Directive 105 . All other borrowing costs are also expensed. Exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs are included in the definition of borrowing costs. (s)Provisions Provisions for legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. F-19Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-19 F-20Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (s)Provisions (continued) Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Provisions for PhD and HDR scholarships are recognised when the Group has a present legal obligation as a result of past events. It is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions aremeasured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. And, the attrition rates were applied to estimate the probability of HDR scholarship enrolments for the life of scholarships. ( t)Employee benefits Provision is made for employee benefits and on-costs accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to the reporting date. These benefits include wages and salaries, annual leave and long service leave. (i)Short-term obligations Liabilities for short-term employee benefits including wages and salaries and non-monetary benefits are measured at the amount expected to be paid when the liability is settled, if it is expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting period, and is recognised in other payables. Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken andmeasured at the rates paid or payable. ( ii)Other long-term obligations The liability for long-term employee benefits such as annual leave, severance allowance, and long service leave is recognised in current provisions for employee benefits if it is not expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting period. It is measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reportingdate. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Severance allowance is calculated based on employees' years service and average salary for the six-month period prior to the end of balance date. Severance allowance for foreign employees is calculated on the basis of a half-month salary for each employee for each year of service with the company. For allowances that are expected to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date, the amount is measured at nominal value. For allowances that are not expected to be settled wholly before 12 months a discount rate is used to determine the present value. Regardless of the expected timing of settlements, provisions made in respect of employee benefits are classified as a current liability, unless there is an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date, in which case it would be classified as a non-current liability. ( iii)Retirement benefit obligations All employees of the Group are entitled to benefits on retirement, disability or death from the Group 's superannuation plans. The Group plans are either a defined benefit scheme or a defined contribution scheme. The defined benefit scheme provides defined lump sum benefits based on years of service and final average salary. The defined contribution scheme receives fixed contributions from the Group and the Group 's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions. A liability or asset in respect of defined benefit superannuation plans is recognised in the balance sheet, and is measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of the superannuation fund's assets at that date and any unrecognised past service cost. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments which arisefrom membership of the fund to the reporting date, calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience and adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity and in the statement of financial position . Past service costs are recognised in income immediately, unless the changes to the superannuation fund are conditional on theemployees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on astraight-line basis over the vesting period. Contributions to the defined contribution fund are recognised as an expense as they become payable. Further details are provided in note 37. F-20Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-21 F-22Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (t)Employee benefits (continued) (iv)Deferred government benefit for superannuation The unfunded liabilities recorded in the balance sheet under provisions have been determined by an actuary and relate to the estimates of net liabilities at 31 December 2016 . The methodology of measurement of the net liabilities is based on the following actuarial assumptions: Economic 2016 2015 Discount Rate 3.3% pa 3.5% pa Salary increase rate 4.0% pa 4.0% pa Pension Indexation 2.5% pa 2.5% pa The actuary currently believes, in respect of the long-term financial condition of the Fund, that assets as at 31 December 2016 , together with current contribution rates, are not expected to be sufficient to provide for the current benefit levels for both existing members and anticipated new members if experience follows the \"best estimate\" assumptions or the more conservative \"funding\" assumptions. An arrangement exists between the Australian Government and the State Government to meet the unfunded liability for RMIT 's beneficiaries of the State Superannuation Scheme on an emerging cost basis. This arrangement is evidenced by the State Grants (General Revenue) Amendment Act 1987, Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and subsequent amending legislation. Accordingly, the unfunded liabilities have been recognised in the statement of financial position under Provisions with a corresponding asset recognised under Receivables. The recognition of both the asset and the liability consequently does not affect the year end net asset position of the Group. Deferred government benefits for superannuation are the amounts recognised as reimbursement rights as they are the amounts expected to be received from the Australian Government for the emerging costs of the superannuation funds for the life of the liability. (v)Termination Benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits not expected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value. (vi)Employee benefit on-costs Employee benefit on-costs, including payroll tax and workcover, are recognised and included in employee benefit liabilities and costs when the employee benefits to which they relate are recognised as liabilities. (u)Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable fromthe taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of financial position and no GST is included on accruals. Cash flows are included in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are classified as operating cash flows. ( v)Repairs and maintenance Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except where they relate to the replacement of a component of an asset, in which case, the costs are capitalised and depreciated. Other routine operating maintenance, repair and minor renewal costs are also recognised as expenses, as incurred.

The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity. (x)Contingent assets and contingent liabilities Contingent assets and liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position , but are disclosed by way of a note (refer note 32) and, if quantifiable, are measured at nominal value. Contingent assets and liabilities are presented inclusive of the GST receivable or payable respectively. (y)Commitments Commitments include those operating, capital and other outsourcing commitments arising from non-cancellable contractual or statutory sources and are disclosed at their nominal value and inclusive of the GST payable. (z)Rounding of amounts Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded off in accordance with Class order 98/0100 as amended by Class order 04/667,issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, relating to the 'rounding off' of amounts in the financial statements. Amounts have been rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain cases, the nearest dollar. ( aa)Corrections of prior period (i)Correction of prior period research revenue The University's policy on revenue recognition is that a contribution is recognised as a non-reciprocal transfer when the University receives an asset without directly giving equal value in exchange to the other party to the transfer. The University has identified an error in applying this policy when recognising research grant revenue in the prior period. We have made the correction in the 2016 financial year as it was not practical to correct the 2015 financial year because of the: - impending implementation of new revenue standards.- large volume of research contracts involved that would have to be reviewed and the significant time and resources required to complete this review. Therefore as a consequence there is $17.288 million deferred revenue in 2015 that has been recognised as income in 2016. No retrospective restatement has been made to the 2015 comparative information. ( ab)New Accounting Standards and Interpretations Certain new Accounting Standards and Interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2016 . RMIT 's assessment of the impact of these new Standards and Interpretations is set out below: Standard/Interpretation Application dateImpact on financial reports AASB 9 Financial Instruments-The key changes includethe simplified requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets, a new hedging accounting model and a revised impairment loss model to recognise impairment losses earlier, as opposed to the current approach that recognises impairment only when incurred.1 January 2018 The assessment has identified that the financialimpact of available for sale assets will now be reported through other comprehensive income (OCI)and no longer recycled to the profit and loss. While the preliminary assessment is that the change should not have a material impact on RMIT University, it will continue to be monitored and assessed. F-22Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-23 F-24Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (ab)New Accounting Standards and Interpretations (continued) Standard/Interpretation Application date Impact on financial reports AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 (December 2010) - Therequirements for classifying and measuring financial liabilities were added to AASB 9. The existingrequirements for the classification of financial liabilities and the ability to use the fair value option have been retained. However, where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities the change in fair value is accounted for as follows: - The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is presented in other comprehensive income (OCI); and - Other fair value changes are presented in profit and loss. If this approach creates or enlarges an accounting mismatch in the profit or loss, the effect of the changes in credit risk are also presented in profit or loss. 1 January 2018 The assessment has identified that the amendments are likely to result in earlier recognition of impairmentlosses and at more regular intervals. Changes in own credit risk in respect of liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss will now be presented within other comprehensive income (OCI). Hedge accounting will be more closely aligned with common risk management practices making iteasier to have an effective hedge. AASB 2014-1 Amendments to Australian AccountingStandards [Part E Financial Instruments] - Amends various AAS's to reflect the AASB's decision to defer the mandatory application date of AASB 9 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018as a consequence of Chapter 6 Hedge Accounting, and to amend reduced disclosure requirements. 1 January 2018 This amending standard will defer the applicationperiod of AASB 9 to the 2018-19 reporting period in accordance with the transition requirements. AASB 2014-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from AASB 9 - Amends various AAS's to incorporate the consequential amendments arising from the issuance of AASB 9. 1 January 2018 The assessment has indicated that there will be no significant impact. AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers -introduces a five step process for revenue recognition with the core principle of the new standard being for entities to recognise revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration (that is, payment) to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Accounting policy changes will arise in timing of revenue recognition, treatment of contracts costs and contracts which contain a financing element. AASB 15 will also result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (eg. Service revenue and contract modifications) and improveguidance for multiple element arrangements.1January 2018 The changes in revenue recognition requirements in AASB 15 may result in changes to the timing and amount of revenue recorded in the financial statements. The Standard will also require additional disclosures on service revenue and contract modifications. A potential impact will be the upfront recognition of revenue from licenses that cover multiple reporting periods. Revenue that was deferred and amortised over a period may now need to be recognised immediately as a transitional adjustment against theopening returned earnings if there are no former performance obligations outstanding.

Trade receivables, that do not have a significant financing component, are to be measured at their transaction price, at initial recognition. Dividends are recognised in the profit and loss only when: -the entity's right to receive payment of the dividend is established; -it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity; and -the amount can be measured reliably.1 Jan 2017, except amendments to AASB 9 (Dec 2009) and AASB 9 (Dec 2010) apply from 1 Jan 2018The assessment has indicated that there will be no significant impact. AASB 2015-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Effective Date of AASB 15 - This Standard defers the mandatory effective date of AASB 15 from 1 January 2017 to 1 January 2018.1 January 2018 This amending standard will defer the applicationperiod of AASB 15 to the 2018-19 reporting period in accordance with the transition requirements. AASB 2015-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards-Extending Related Party Disclosures to Not- for-Profit Public Sector EntitiesThis standard extends the scope of AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures to include application by not-for-profitpublic sector entities.1 July 2016 The implementation of this standard will causedisclosure of related party transactions and key management personnel (KMP) remuneration for not- for-profit public sector entities, there will be no impact on the reported financial position or performance of the entity. AASB 2016-3 Amendments to Australian AccountingStandards - Clarifications to AASB 15 - amends AASB 15 to clarify the requirements on identifying performance obligations, principal versus agent considerations and the timing of recognising revenue from granting a licence. The amendments require: -A promise to transfer to a customer a good or service that is 'distinct' to be recognised as a separate performance obligation; -For items purchased online, the entity is a principal if it obtains control of the good or service prior to transferring to the customer; and -For licences identified as being distinct from other goods or services in a contract, entities need todetermine whether the licence transfers to the customer over time (right to use) or at a point in time (right to access).1 January 2018 The assessment has indicated that there will be nosignificant impact for RMIT, other than the impact identified in AASB 15. F-24(ab) New Accounting Standards and Interpretations (continued)Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-25 F-26Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (ab)New Accounting Standards and Interpretations (continued) Standard/Interpretation Application dateImpact on financial reports AASB 16 Leases - Removes the distinction of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for a lessee.Instead all leases are treated in a similar way to finance leases applying IAS 17. AASB 16 will cause the majority of leases of an entity to be brought onto the statement of financial position. There are limited exceptions relating to short term leases and low value assets which may remain offbalance sheet.1 January 2019 The assessment has indicated that as most operating leases will come on balance sheet,recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities will cause net debt to marginally increase. Depreciation of lease assets and interest on lease liabilities will be recognised in the income statement with marginal impact. The amounts of cash paid for the principal portion of the lease liability will be presented within financingactivities and the amounts paid for the interest portion will be presented within operating activities in the cash flow statement. AASB 2016-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Recoverable Amount of Non-Cash- Generating Specialised Assets of Not-for-Profit Entities - The standard amends AASB 136 Impairment of Assets to remove references to using depreciated replacement cost (DRC) as a measure of value in use for not-for-profit entities. 1 January 2017 The assessment has indicated that there is minimal impact. Given the specialised nature and restrictions of public sector assets, the existing use is presumed to be the highest and best use (HBU), hence currentreplacement cost under AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement is the same as the depreciated replacement cost concept under AASB 136. AASB 1058 Income of not-for-profit(NFP) Entities -AASB 1058 supersedes all the income recognition requirements relating to the majority of income recognition requirements relating to public sector NFP entities, previously in AASB 1004 Contributions. The timing of income recognition depends on whether such a transaction gives rise to a liability or other performance obligation (a promise to transfer a good or service), or a contribution by owners, related to an asset (such as cash or another asset) received by an entity. AASB 1058 applies when a NFP entity receives volunteer services or enters into other transactionswhere the consideration to acquire an asset is significantly less than the fair value of the asset principally to enable the entity to further its objectives. In the latter case, the entity recognises and measures the asset at fair value in accordance with the applicable Australian Accounting Standard.1 January 2019 Each revenue stream, including grant agreementsare currently being reviewed to determine the impact of AASB 1058. We anticipate that some grant agreements which were previously recognised immediately on receipt may be able to be deferred as the performance obligation is satisfied.

Property, plant and equipment The allocation of buildings is based on the usage of space by the VET division. All other assets are allocated to VET division only if directly acquired to be used by VET. Trade and other payables Trade payable directly attributable to either Higher Education or VET have been applied. Other payables have been allocated on a proportional basis. Borrowings The non-current interest bearing loan facility represents RMIT 's loan with the CBA and Westpac and is allocated on a proportional basis between Higher Education and VET based on the usability of assets. During 2015, the arrangements in relation to unsecured loans from subsidiaries were reviewed and this liability has been reclassified to 'related party payables' in 'trade and other payables'. Provisions Provisions have been attributed to either Higher Education or VET as follows:- directly to the appropriate Division in relation to the teaching and administrative staff operating within each Division; - administrative support staff not directly operating within the teaching departments have been allocated on a proportional basis; and - a small number of teaching and administrative staff who operate across the two divisions within the teaching departments have been solely allocated to the area in which they predominantly operate, as it is impractical to determine their proportional contribution to each division. O ther liabilities Revenue in advance included in other liabilities is directly attributable to either Higher Education or VET, while all other revenue in advance has been allocated on a proportional basis.

UniSuper Plans UniSuper is a multi employer superannuation fund operated by UniSuper Limited as the Corporate Trustee and administered by UniSuper Management Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of UniSuper Limited. The operations of UniSuper are regulated by the SuperannuationIndustry (Supervision) Act 1993. (i) UniSuper offers eligible members the choice of two schemes known as the Defined Benefit Division (DBD) or Accumulation Super (2). The contribution rate to the scheme is 21.00% of member's salary of which the member contributes 7.00% and the Company 14.00% . From 1 July 2006, members can elect to reduce the level of member contributions with corresponding reductions in benefits. (ii) UniSuper also offers a cash accumulation productivity scheme known as Accumulation Super (1). Company employees have no requirement to contribute to the scheme. The Company contributes the equivalent of 3.00% of the base salary in respect of those employees who were members of the Defined Benefits Division or the Accumulation Super (2) Plan. Employees who do not qualify for membership of the Defined Benefits Division or the Accumulation Super (2) Plan will have a minimum contribution 9.50% of their annual salary contributed by the Company to Accumulation Super (1) prescribed under the Superannuation Guarantee Charges Act 1992. Casual and non-permanent employees who do not qualify for membership of the Defined Benefit Division or Accumulation Super (2) are eligible for Accumulation Super (1). The employer is required to contribute on account of eligible employees at a minimum rate of 9.50% to all superannuation funds. No contribution remained unpaid at the end of the year except to the extent of normal and current terms of payment. The amount payable at 31 December 2016 was $2.60 m (2015 - $2.85 m). 3 8Financial risk management Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement andthe basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument is disclosed in note 1of the financial statements. ( a)Financial risk management objectives The Group 's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group 's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by adhering to principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments,and the investment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by management on a continuous basis.The Consolidated Entity does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. The Group uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate, foreign exchange and other price risks, ageing analysis for credit risk and data analysis in respect of investment portfolios to determine market risk.

Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters so as to minimise the total exposure to exchange rate risk. The Group is mainly exposed to the currencies of the United States of America and Vietnam. The following table details the Group 's sensitivity to a 13% increase or decrease in the Australian Dollar (AUD) against the relevant foreign currencies. 13% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management's assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 13% change in foreign currency rates. 31 December 2016 Currency rate risk -13.0% 13.0% ConsolidatedCarrying Amount $'000Result $'000Equity Cash and cash equivalents 4,626 601 601 (601) (601) Receivables 3,219 418 418 (418) (418) Other financial assets 49,034 $'000Result $'000Equity Cash and cash equivalents 3,333 433 433 (433) (433) Receivables 2,074 270 270 (270) (270) Other financial assets 43,779 Liabilities Payables 5,035 (655) (655) 655 655 Total financial liabilities 5,035 (655) (655) 655 655 (c)Interest rate risk Interest rate exposures arise predominantly from assets bearing floating interest rates.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group 's exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by management regularly. The Group minimises concentrations of credit risk by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers and counterparties, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and by performing extensive due diligence procedures on major new customers. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, grossed up for any allowances for losses, represents the Group 's maximum exposure to credit without taking account of the value of any collateral obtained. The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The Group has not obtained any collateral or other security for its financial assets. 39Fair value measurements Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument is disclosed in note 1of the financial statements. (a)Fair value measurements The carrying amounts and aggregate net fair values of financial assets and liabilities at balance date are: 2016 2015 Consolidated NoteCarrying Amount $'000Fair Value $'000Carrying Amount $'000Fair Value $'000 Financial assets Cash at bank and on hand 17 17,640 17,640 20,132 20,132 Deposits at call 17 37 37 261,409 261,409 260,289 260,289 Financial 364,134 364,134 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes. The net fair value of cash and cash equivalents and non-interest bearing monetary financial assets and financial liabilities of the consolidated entity approximates their carrying amounts. Due to the short-term nature of the current receivables, their carrying value is assumed to approximate their fair value and based on credit history it is expected that the receivables that are neither past due nor impaired will be received when due. The net fair value of other monetary financial assets and financial liabilities is based upon market prices where a market exists or by discounting the expected future cash flows by the current interest rates for assets and liabilities with similar risk profiles.

Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (i)Recognised fair value measurements Consolidated Note2016 $'000Level 1 $'000Level 2 $'000Level 3 $'000 Financial assets Available for sale financial assets 20 91,131 70,804 - 20,327 Unlisted shares in non-relatedcompanies 21 37 - - 37 9 1,168 70,804 - 20,364 Non-financial assets Land 22 438,701 - - 438,701 Buildings 22 1,548,948 - - 1,548,948 Leasehold Improvements 22 11,340 - - 11,340 Equipment, motor vehicles, furniture & fittings, library collection 22 149,041 - - 149,041 - 9,443 - 2,157,473 - 9,443 2,148,030 Financial liabilities Interest rate swaps 25 368 - 368 - Consolidated Note2015 $'000Level 1 $'000Level 2 $'000Level 3 $'000 Financial assets Available for sale financial assets 20 84,200 70,752 - 13,448 Unlisted shares in non-relatedcompanies 21 37 - - 37 8 4,237 70,752 - 13,485 Non-financial assets Land 438,626 - - Buildings 1,391,413 - - 1,391,413 Leasehold Improvements 22 11,234 - - 11,234 Equipment, motor vehicles, furniture & fittings, library collection 22 155,429 - - 155,429 - 8,881 - 2,005,583 - 8,881 1,996,702 Financial liabilities Interest rate swaps 25 474 - 474 - F-58Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2016ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUBSIDIARIES F-59 F-60Notes to the Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2016 39 Fair value measurements (continued) (b)Fair value hierarchy (continued) (ii)Disclosed fair values The Group has a number of assets and liabilities which are not measured at fair value, but for which the fair values are disclosed in the notes. The fair value of assets or liabilities traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and available for sale securities) is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date (level 1). This is the mostrepresentative of fair value in the circumstances. The fair values of held to maturity investments and interests in associates that are disclosed in note 20were determined by reference to published price quotations in an active market (level 1). The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values due to the short-term nature of trade receivables. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the futurecontractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments (level 3). The fair value of non-current borrowings disclosed in note 26is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates that are available to the Group for similar financial instruments. For the period ending 31 December 2016 , the borrowing rates were determined to be between 3.17% and 4.84% depending on the type of borrowing. The fair value of current borrowings approximates the carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant (level 2). Derivative contracts classified as held for trading are fair valued by comparing the contracted rate to the current market rate for a contract with the same remaining period to maturity. ( c)Valuation techniques used to derive level 2 and level 3 fair values (i)Recurring fair value measurements The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities, land (excluding vacant), buildings (excluding recently acquired) equipment and artworks. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance date. Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:- The use of quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments - The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. - The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date - Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments All of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2 except for unlisted equity securities which are included in level 3.Land and buildings are valued independently each year. At the end of each reporting period, the Group updates their assessment of the fair value of each property, taking into account the most recent independent valuations. The Group determines the property's value within a range of reasonable fair value estimates.The best evidence of fair value is current prices in an active market for similar properties. Where such information is not available the Group considers information from a variety of sources, including: - current prices in an active market for properties of different nature or recent prices of similar properties in less active markets, adjusted to reflect those differences. - discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows- capitalised income projections based on a property's estimated net market income, and a capitalisation rate derived from an analysis of market evidence All resulting fair value estimates for properties are included in level 3 except for vacant land and recently acquired land and buildings. The level 2 fair value of vacant land has been derived using the sales comparison approach. Sale prices of comparable land in close proximity are adjusted for differences in key attributes such as property size. The most significant input into this valuation approach is price per square metre.
