I cousin actually recommended me there, at first i was a bit confuse as I thought it was some anti-aging centre however i was very amazed with the treatments they offer at their centre. Not to mention the friendly staff who works there. When i arrived, a consultant guided me into her room as she slowly explains the types of services, promotion and packages available at their centre including the cost and duration. I chose the Traditional Dusun Massage, Hydrotherapy and Health scan where they take a small sample of my hair before I start the massage. At the end of the treatment, they handed me over my health report and explained my health condition. I never knew I had some skin allergies, they gave me some homeopathy remedy to consume. After 4 days, I realized that the dry patches on my upper arm had dissapeared! I am so pleased with the results and would deffinately come back again! Oh yes! They also gave me a small sample of their Misai Kuching Tea. Excellent Herbal Tea! The Spa is based in KK Times Square, you dont have to worry about getting a transport there, they actually provide a free pick up service within KK area!!! This "}
