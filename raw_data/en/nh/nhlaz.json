On every continent, hundreds of millions received the BCG (Bacillus Calmette Gu\u00e9rin) vaccine and millions more benefited from newly discovered antibiotics. TB research and attempts to control the disease knit together disparate populations and places as a network of experts and a matrix of ideas spread out across the globe linking the world through a common vaccine, a battery of antibiotics, and a knowledge network. Medicine became internationalized as organizations like the WHO and UNICEF began to see diseases as global problems and not solely the concern of individual countries. - Type - Research Article - Information [Comparative Studies in Society and History](/core/journals/comparative-studies-in-society-and-history), [Volume 2010 209 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 Society for the Comparative Study of Society and History 2010 References 1 See Iriye, Akira, Global Community: The Role of International Organizations in the Making of the Contemporary World (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Global+Community%3A+The+Role+of+International+Organizations+in+the+Making+of+the+Contemporary+World&author=Iriye+Akira&publication+year=2002). 2 Brown, Theodore M., Cueto, Marcos, and Fee, Elizabeth, \"The World Health Organization and the Transition from 'International' to 'Global' Health,\" in Bashford, Alison, ed., Medicine at the Border: Disease, Globalization, and Security, 1850 to the Present (London: MacMillan, Tuberculosis: The International Tuberculosis Campaign in India 1948-51,\" Bulletin of the History of Medicine 81, [CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/bhm.2007.0022) [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Vikings+against+Tuberculosis%3A+The+International+Tuberculosis+Campaign+in+India+1948%E2%80%9351&author=Brimnes+Niels&publication+year=2007&journal=Bulletin+of+the+History+of+Medicine&volume=81&doi=10.1353%2Fbhm.2007.0022).

Apparently he was a longstanding servant of the Madras government and had a close relationship to Congress leadership. He claimed to have been influential in directing Gandhi's attention to sanitation in the 1920s. The magazine People's Health seems very much to have been his own enterprise. See A. V. Raman to C.
