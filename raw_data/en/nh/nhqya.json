One of the reasons for this is the lack of suitable cellular immune [methods]that are easy to perform in large amount of vaccinated individuals. Conventional [methods]of measuring cellular and [humoral immunity]are complex and expensive in a [pandemic]situation. Here we present data about in vivo Delayed Type [Hypersensitivity](DTH) results on the long-term follow-up of vaccinated immunocompetent [health care] [workers]showing that DTH is a suitable and affordable [method]to understand immunigenicity elicited by Covid- [vaccines]. This tool could be used to modify [vaccine] [administration]to optimize responses obtained in the vaccinated individuals. [Method](s) Forty healthy [healthcare workers]accepted to participate during [protein S]of [SARS-CoV]- 2 at day 35 and day 200. At the same [time], we perform specific anti-RBD [IgG]using a classic [ELISA]before [vaccination]and on days 35 and 200. Result(s) All forty individuals had a positive DTH [skin]response al day 35, whereas thirty-nine participants had a positive [skin test]at day 200 (Figure 1). Moreover, although all 40 individuals showed a humoral response of specific [IgG]against spike [protein]at day 35 considered positive, most of them have significant lower levels at day 200. Conclusion(s) DTH responsiveness has been shown to be an ideal and easy [method]to predict [cellular immunity]response to [mRNA vaccines]200 days ... LILACS LIS "}
