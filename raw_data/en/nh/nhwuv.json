We provide the highest quality Chiropractic care to families in Michiana. We provide care for patients of all ages, from new born to old age. Chiropractic is all about maintaining a properly functioning nervous system. Interference to the nervous system through misaligned vertebrae (subluxation), causes disease, loss of function and sometimes pain. Subluxations are removed with the Chiropractic Adjustment. This is treating the cause of a problem rather than using potentially dangerous drugs that treat only the symptoms. A healthy nervous system is key to optimal performance and health. Our clinic specializes in Chiropractic, Chiropractic Neurology, massage therapy, pregnancy care, and nutrition. Our doctors are experts in their field and have a passion to teach others about Chiropractic and other ways to achieve optimal and natural health. They are available for speaking engagements and teaching educational health related classes to businesses and or clubs. We also offer special workshops once a month at our clinic. - Website - [http://www.NHFChiropractic.com](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2ENHFChiropractic%2Ecom&urlhash=X94f&trk=about_website) External link for Natural Health Family Chiropractic - Industries - Wellness and Fitness Services - Company size - 2-10 employees - Headquarters - Elkhart, Indiana - Type - Self-Employed - Founded - 1995 - Specialties - Chiropractic and Chiropractic Neurology, Nutrition, Pregnancy Care, and Massage Therapy Locations - Primary 625 E Bristol St Elkhart, "}
