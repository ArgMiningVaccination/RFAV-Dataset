The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides reso urces to State , Territory , and Tribal grantees to enable low -income parents to work or pursue education and training so that they may better support their families while at the same time promoting the learning and development of their children. The CCDF a lso provides funding to be used to enhance the quality of child care for all children. On November 19, 2014, President Obama signed the bipartisan -supported Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 into law (Pub.L. 113 -186) (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/occ/child_care_and_development_block_grant_mark up.pdf ). The law reauthorizes and significantly revises the purposes of the CCDF program and requirements f or State and Territory grantees. The law establishes minimum child care assistance eligibility periods , health and safety standards and training requirements for providers , monitoring, consumer information and ot her components that when fully implemented will stren gthen child care in this country and support child and family success . States and Territories must comply with the provisions of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act, as revised by reau thorization. The Office of Child Care (OCC) has provided interpretive guidance on the new requirements of the law through Program Instructions or responses to Frequently Asked Questions, which are available at: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ/ccdf -reauthorization . Pending the issuance of implementing regulations, States and Territories are to comply with the law base d on their reasonable interpretation of the requirements in the re vised CCDBG statute. Further Federal clarification through guidance and regulation is forthcoming. Once final rules are issued, any States and Territories that do not fully meet the requirements of the regulations will need to revise their policies and pro cedures to come into compliance, and file appropriate Plan amendments related to those changes. CCDF Plan Overview . The Administration for Children and F amilies (ACF) re-designed the CCDF Plan to assist State and Territory grantees to plan for full impleme ntation of the law. We recognize that the CCDBG Act of 2014 includes a significant number of changes, some of which are straightforward to implement, while others are complex and will be phased -in over several years. The level of effort needed for implemen tation will vary across the country depending on the number of changes a State or Territory needs to make. We encourage all States and Territories to take time to think systematically and consider large -scale changes to advance a coherent vision for their child care programs and achieve the goals of the reauthorization - that is, to improve the health, safety, and quality of child care and to improve low -income working families' access to child care assistance and care that promotes child development . Some State s and Territories will need time to enact changes through their legislatures or rulemaking processes. In addition, some requirements will take time to fully operationalize. ACF will work with State s and Territories to ensure that adoption DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 6 and implemen tation of these important changes is done in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner. The Plan process continues to be the primary mechanism by which ACF will determine State and Territory compliance with requirements in the new law. The CCDBG Act of 2014 c hanged the Plan cycle from a biennial to a triennial Plan period; thus, this Plan will cover a 3 -year period . (658E(b)) States and Territories are required to submit their FY 2016 -2018 CCDF Plans by March 1, 2016, and approved Plans will bec ome effective J une 1, 2016. This Pre-Print will provide a tool for State s and Territories to describe to ACF their implementation plans to: 1. Define CCDF Leadership and Coordination with Relevant Systems 2. Promote Family Engagement through Outreach and Consumer Education 3. Provide Stable Child Care Financial Assistance to Families 4. Ensure Equal Access to High Quality Child Care for Low-Income Children 5. Establish Standards and Monitoring Processes to Ensure the Health and Safety of Child Care Settings 6. Recruit and Retain a Qualifie d and Effective Child Care Workforce 7. Support Continuous Quality Improvement 8. Ensur e Grantee Accountability These organizational categories reflect key functions of an integrated system of high quality care for low -income working families. Although the Plan is divided into sections for reporting and accountability purposes, ACF encourages Lead Agencies to approach the Plan in a cross -cutting, integrated manner. The intention is that grantees and the federal government will be able to use this information to t rack and assess progress, determine need for technical assistance and CCDF Plan amendments, and ultimately determine compliance with specific requirement s and deadlines. For purposes of simplicity and clarity, the specific provisions printed herein of applicable laws are sometimes paraphrases of, or excerpts and incomplete quotations from, the full text. The State /Territory acknowledges its responsibility to adhere to them regardless of these modifications. The Plan contains definitions where provided by la w. For terminology not defined in the law, some illustrative examples may be provided. These should only be considered examples, and not requirements, for purposes of responding. If no definitions are provided, States /Territories should respond based on their own definitions for those terms. CCDBG Implementation Deadlines . In some cases, t he CCDBG Act of 2014 specifies a particular date when a provision is effective. Where the law does not specif y a date, the new requirements became effective upon the date of enactment and States /Territories have until September 30, 2016 to implement the new statutory requirement(s) . ACF has determined that when a State or Territory cannot certify compliance with a specific requirement at the time of CCDF plan submission (March 1, 2016) , the grantee must provide a State /Territory -specific implementation plan for achieving compliance with such provision(s) . The implementation plan must provide sufficient information to support approval of the Plan for funding. Specifically, as part of its implementation plan , States /Territories will be asked to describe : DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 7 Overall target completion date (no later than appropriate effective date deadline) Current overall status for this section (not yet started, in progress, partially complete d, substantially completed , other ) including describing progress to date for any requirements already implemented and listing any unmet requirements that are not yet fully implemented. Specific steps (activities) you will take to complete the unmet requirement (s) (e.g., secure legislative or rule changes, modify agreements with coordinating agencies, etc.) . Timeline for implementation including projected start date and end date for each step Agency /entity responsible for completion of the goal/objective , and pa rtners who will work with the responsible agency to complete the goal/objective. We recognize that it will take multiple steps and interim activities toward complete implementation of the requirement. We have included spaces to allow respondents to outline those interim steps and associated timelines (projected start and end dates) for those interim steps to be outlined. A comprehensive summary of the topical implementation plans across sections will be generated electronically to facilitate monitoring of p rogress towards completion. ACF will work with States and Territories to monitor progress towards achievement of these requirements and will conduct reviews of implementation plans at least every six months. Upon completion of the implementation plan, the State /Territory will submit a Plan amendment to certify fulfillment of the requirement(s). These updates and amendments can be submitted at any time prior to the effective date for the requirement. For example, States and Territories may, and are encourage d to, submit amendments to certify compliance with requirements upon completion, but no later than the effective date of the requirements (refer to the Program Instruction on Effective Dates for these deadlines https://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/occ/resource/pi -2015 -02 and corresponding timeline of Agencies can access a variety of federal technical assistance resources to s upport implementation of the new requirements at: https://childcareta.acf.hhs.gov/ccdf -reauthorization In addition to these materials, States and Territories will continue to receive supp ort through the Office of Child Care's Technical Assistance Network (CCTAN) to assist with implementation of the new law. ACF recommends reviewing these resources prior to starting and completing each section of the Plan . CCDF Plan Submission. States and T erritories will submit their Plans electronically through the ACF - 118 electronic submission site. The ACF -118 site will include all language and questions included in the final CCDF Plan Preprint template approved by the Office of Management and Budget. Pl ease note that the format of the questions in the ACF -118 site may be modified from the Word version of the document to ensure compliance with Section 508 policies regarding accessibility to electronic and information technology for individuals with disabi lities (see http://www.section508.gov/ for more information). Until the final draft is approved, States and Territories may use the draft CCDF Plan preprint templates as they work to implement the new law. In res ponding to questions, States and Territories are asked to provide brief, specific summary text DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 8 and/or bullet points only. Do not use tables or copy and paste charts, attachments or manuals into the Plan. All information and materials developed to support C CDF implementation and information reported in the CCDF Plan are subject to review by ACF as part of ongoing monitoring efforts of CCDBG compliance. In cases where the CCDBG Act of 2014 did not change CCDF regulatory requirements (e.g., Public Hearing requ irements), th e CCDF regulations are still in effect and relevant questions are included in this Plan. The CCDF Plan does not contain the Quality Performance Report (QPR) appendix included in previous Plans. The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires ongoing collectio n of some information that was included in the QPR. ACF will issue a separate information collection tool for public comment and approval linked to the CCDF Plan and updated based on the new requirements in the law . 1 Define CCDF Leadership and Coordination with Relevant Systems Implementation of the requirements of the CCDBG Act of 2014 will require leadership and coordination between the child care assistance program and other child - and family -serving agencies, services, and supports at the state and loca l levels. ACF recognizes that each grantee must identify the most appropriate entities and individuals to lead and participate in implementation based on the context within that Stat e or T erritory. This will include those that manage various components of CCDF -funded activities and requirements ( fiscal, subsidy, health and safety monitoring, and continuous quality impr ovement) as well as other public and private partners. This section collects information to help ACF understand the stakeholders convened and consulted to develop the Plan, where authority lies to make policy decisions and program changes, and who is responsible for implement ing the blueprint for action it describes. For example, the law requires that, at the option of the Tribes, State /Territo ry Lead Agencies must collaborate and coordinate with Indian tribes or tribal organizations in the State in a timely manner in the development of the CCDF Plan. ACF expects that new requirements in the law will necessitate that grantees build partnerships with other agencies and organizations to better link the children and families receiving financial assistance to information , services and resources regarding other programs for which they may be eligible, including developmental screenings for children, and other resources (also in section 2) . In addition, State s and Territories must describe how public -private partnerships are being used to increase the supply and quality of child care services. 1.1 CCDF Leadership The Governor of a State or Territory shall designate an agency (which may be an appropriate collaborative agency), or establish a joint inter- agency office, to represent the State (or Territory) as the Lead Agency.

Describe 1.5 Optional Use of Combined Funds The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a provision that States and Territories have the option to combine funding for CCDF child care services with funding for any of the required programs listed in 1.4.1. These include programs operating at the Federal, State and local levels for children in preschool programs, tribal early childhood programs, and other early childhood programs, including those serving infants and toddlers with disabilities, homeless children, and children in foster care. (658E(c)(2)(O ))(ii)) Combining funds c ould include blending multiple DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 23 funding streams, pooling funds, or layering funds together from multiple funding streams in an effort to expand and/or enhance services for children and families to allow for delivery of comprehensive high quality care that m eets the needs of children and families. For example, State/Territory agencies may use multiple funding sources to offer grants or contracts to programs to deliver services; a S tate/Territory may allow county/local government to use coordinate d funding str eams; or policies may be in place that allow local programs to layer funding sources to pay for full -day, full- year child care that meets Early Head Start/Head Start or State/Territory pre-kindergarten requirements in addition to S tate/Territory child care licensing requirements. As a reminder, per the OMB Compliance Supplement governing audits (https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133_compliance_supplement_2014 ), CCDF funds may be used in collaborative efforts with Head Start (CFDA 93.600) programs to provide comprehensive child care and development services for children who are eligible for both programs. In fact, the coordination and collaboration between Head S tart and the CCDF is mandated by sections 640(g)(2)(D) and (E), and 642(c) of the Head Start Act (42 USC 9835(g)(2)(D) and (E); 42 USC 9837(c)) in the provision of full working day, full calendar year comprehensive services (42 USC 9835(a)(5)(v)). In orde r to implement such collaborative programs, which share, for example, space, equipment or materials, grantees may blend several funding streams so that seamless services are provided. 1.5.1 Will you combine CCDF funds with the funds for any program with which you coordinate (described in 1.4.1)? Yes. If yes, describe at a minimum : o How do you define \"combine\": Layered Funding o Which funds will you combine : Local ly Appropriated Funds , Office of Head Start and CCDF Funds o Goal(s) of combining funds (why?) and expec ted outcomes , such as extending the day or year of services available (i.e., full- day, full- year programming for working families), smoothing transitions for children, enhancing and aligning quality of services, linking comprehensive services to children in child care or developing the supply of child care for vulnerable populations Funds are combined to support job embedded professional development, linkage s to comprehensive services and for the enhancement and alignment of quality services . o Method of fun d allocation (how you will be combining multiple sets of funding, such as at the S tate/Territory level, local level, program leve l?) Funds will be combined at the program and state level through grants to sub - recipient organizations and contracts. o How are the funds tracked and method of oversight OSSE uses an electronic grants management system (EGMS) to track all grant funds and expenditures. Additionally, on -site reviews are conducted to review compliance and eligibility. All sub -recip ients are required to submit A -133 audits and/or financial statements on an annual basis. The OSSE Director of Operations and Management in the Division of Early Learning establishes the spend plans and tracks and monitors DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 24 all expenditures.

This model use s Early Head Start Program Performance Standards to increase the supply of high -quality infant and toddler care in the District. To achieve the goal of enhancing young children's school readiness, the QIN sites provide comprehensive services to promote the overall health, development, and well -being of infants and toddlers and their families. QIN agencies set goals that promote : Family Well- Being; Positive Parent -Child Relationships; Families as Lifelong Educators; Families as Learners; Family Engagement in Transitions; Family Connections to Peers and Community; and Families as Advocates and Leaders. OSSE is leveraging resources from District agencies to accomplish efficiencies and improve effectiveness and system coordination. To this end OSSE has establ ished the QIN Interagency Steering Committee comprised of the following city agencies: Department of Health, Department of Behavioral Health, Health Care Financing, Child and Family Services Agency and the Department of Human Services. The I nteragency Steering Committee meets monthly to discuss specific areas of coordination and supports for the child care partners and the families and children they serve. Through this committee the agencies provide professional development and technical assistance in thei r specific areas of expertise to leverage existing programs that can support families in achieving their goals in areas such as employment training, economic self-sufficiency, mental health and substance abuse treatment. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 25 With the support of private philan thropy, OSSE will conduct a comprehensive implementation and impact evaluation of the QIN as it pertains to children , families , teachers and administrators.

State and Territory child care systems interact with parents in multiple ways, therefore present ing many opportunit ies to engage DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 30 and inform families . Child care providers can serve as convenient and trusted sources of information for parents and family members on child development and community supports and services. State /Territory and local child care assistance systems should be designed to p romote seamless linkages to useful information and other child - and family -services , such as during subsidy intake and redetermination processes and when parents utilize child care resource and referral or QRIS agencies . The CCDBG Act of 2014 includes key purposes that address the role of parents as child care consumers who need information to make informed choices regarding the services that best suit their needs . A new purpose of CCDBG is to \"promote involvement by parents and family members in the develo pment of their children in child care settings .\" States and T erritories have the opportunity to consider how information can be provided to parents through the child care assistance system, partner agencies, and child care sites that will support their role as their children's teacher and advocate . Key new provisions include: 1. The plan must certify that States and Territories will collect and disseminate consumer and provider education information to CCDF parents, providers, and the general public, including information about : a) the availab ility of child care assistance, b) the quality of child care providers (if available), c) Other programs (specifically T emporary Assistance for N eedy Families (TANF), Head Start and Early Head Start, Low-Income Home E nergy Assistan ce Program (LIHEAP) , Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) , Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program , Child and A dult Care Food Program (CACFP) , Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP )) for w hich families may also qualify . d) Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) programs and services, e) Research and best prac tices in child development, and f) State /Territory policies regarding social- and emotional -development , including preschool expulsion policies for children 0 -5. 2.

The unintentional con sequence of child care assistance that is linked to adult work and school obligation is that child care arrangements - and the opportunity for children to form trusting relationships with teachers - are o ften interrupted and u nstable. Child care financial assistance policies that make it easier to get and keep assistance support continuity of care and relationships between the child and child care provider and enable parents to stay employed or complete training/education. Child care support that extends un til families are able to pay the full cost of care themselves promotes longer lasting e conomic stability for families. CCDF funds may support families until they reach 85% of State Median Income (SMI). The CCDBG Act of 2014 included requirements to establi sh 12 -month eligibility and redetermination period s, requiring that State s and Territories have a process to account for irregular fluctuations in earnings, a policy ensuring that families ' work schedules are not disrupted by program requirements, policies to provide for job search of not less than three (3) months, and DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 50 to describe policies for graduated phase - out of assistance.

All of the aforementioned individuals involved in the lives of children in the child welfare system share the need for quality child care to secure the necessary care and support for the child while they a re working and/or pursuing job training or further education and to promote the child's overall positive development (The District does not use CCDF funds for respite care for children in protective services ). 2) Does the Lead Agency waive the co -payment a nd income eligibility requirements for cases in which children receive, or need to receive, protective services on a case -by-case basis? (658E(c)(5)) Yes. No. Note - If the Lead Agency elects to provide CCDF -funded chi ld care to children in foster care whose foster care parents are not working, or who are not in education/training activities for CCDF purposes these children are considered to be in protective services and should be included in this definition. 3.1.4 Eligibility Criteria Based on Family Income a) How does the Lead Agency define \"income\" for the purposes of eligibility at the point of determination ? Provide the Lead Agency's definition of \"income\" for purposes of eligibility determination. Definition of income - For the purpose of eligibility , the District of Columbia defines \"income\" as participants entering the program having an income equal to or less that 250% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) guidelines for their family size and exit the program when income reaches 300% of FPL.

Pending additional guidance from ACF, t his could be achieved through policies such as establishing a second income eligibility threshold at re -determination (e.g., establishing a different entry and exit level income eligibility threshold) or by granting a sustained period of continued assistance to the family before termination. Providing a graduated phase -out supports long- term family economic stability by allowing for wage growth and a tapered transition out of the child c are subsidy program. (658E (c)(2)(N)(iv)). This might be achieved DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 54 through policies such as establishing a second income eligibility threshold at redetermination (e.g., establishing a different eligibility threshold for families first applying for assistanc e and those already receiving assistance, sometimes called an \"exit threshold\") or by granting a sustained period of continued assistance to the family before termination. Describe the status of the State/Territory's policy regarding graduated phase -out o f assistance. Fully implemented and meeting al l Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016 . List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and describe the policies and procedures for graduated phase -out: The Lead Agency gradual phase out is as fo llows : o Entry Level: The child care subsidy income sliding fee scale is based upon the 2 014 HHS Poverty Guidelines and the 2 014 DC State Family Median Income. The fee scale incorporates 85 percent of the state median income as constrained by up to 300% of the federal poverty guideline. o The family remains eligible for 12 months. Exit Level: The exit level is set at the point where income equals 85 percent of the state median income (SMI) as constrained by 300% of the federal poverty level. Where 85 percent of SMI exceeds 300% of the FPL, the income exceeds the maximum eligibility level and the family must exit . Not implemented .

(658E(c)(2)(N)(i)(II)) Note - this change requires that States and Territories have policies to account for the fact that some parents with seasonal or other types of work schedules may have irregular earnings over the course of a year , including changes that temporarily exceed 85% of SMI . States and Territories should have procedures to guide how eligibility and copayments are set in a manner to take such circ umstances into account. For example, averaging family income over a period of time to broaden the scope of income verification to be more reflective of annual income rather than tied to a limited time frame that may have seasonal irregularities. Describe the status of the State/Territory's policy related to the fluctuation in earnings requirement. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016.

DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 60 \"affordable child care arrangements\": Affordable Child Care Arrangements are terms of agreement between the p arents and the p rovider that meet the needs of the parents and the children by using the Child Care Subsidy with the providers in the District of Columbia. Parents can obtain care for their children using the available subsidy, as long as they are participating with the District of Columbia's extensive provider system, which includes all categories of care (infants, preschoolers, school- age), in all wards. c) How are parents who receive TANF benefits informed about the exception to individual penalties associated with th e TANF work requirements? In writing Verbally Other: 3.1.10 The Lead Agency certifies that it will require a family member to certify that the family assets do not exceed $1,000,000. A check -off on the application is sufficient. Yes. The Lead Agency certifies that it will require families to certify that the family assets do not exceed $1,000,000 no later than September 30, 2016 . 3.2 Increasing Access for Vulnerable Children and Families At a minimum, CCDF requires Lead Agencies to give priority for child care assistance to children with special needs, or in families with very low incomes. This did not change under reauthorization. Prioritization of CCDF assistance services is not limited to eligibility determination (i.e., establishment of a waiting list or ranking of eligible families in priority order to be served). Lead Agencies may fulfill priority requirements in other ways such as higher payment rates for providers caring for children with special needs or waiving co -payments for families with very low incomes (at or below the federal poverty level). (658E(c)(3)(B)) 3.2.1 Describe how the Lead Agency will prioritize or target child care services for the following children and families (658 E(c)(3)(B)), including definitions , any time limits, grace periods or priority rules in the description: i. Provide definition of \" Children with special needs \" and describe how services are prioritized for this special population the lead agency works expedit iously to assist families with locating child care. Children who have a disability or special health care need, and who are under nineteen (19) years of age who do not function according to age appropriate expectations in one or more areas of development. The lead agency does not have a waiting list. Should the need arise for a waiting list , the lead agency will give priority to this special population . Additionally, there are no time limits. ii. Provide definition of \" Families with very low incomes \" and des cribe how services are prioritized for this special population . A family with a very low income is defined as a family of three with an income at or below $ 10,045 per year. The lead agency does not DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 61 have a waiting list. Should the need arise for a waitin g list , the lead agency will give priority to this special population . iii. Describe how services for f amilies receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), those attempting to transition off TANF through work activities, and those at risk of becomi ng dependent on TANF are prioritized (Section 418(b)(2) of the Social Security Act) The lead agency does not have a waiting list. Should the need arise for a waiting list , the lead agency will give priority to this special population. Additionally , the Lead Agency partners with other District Agencies , such as the DC Department of Human Services, to ensure families receiving TANF , attempting to transition of f TANF and those at risk of becoming dependent on TANF are supported. Many services may be accessed at the same points o f entry to reduce access burdens to families needing to work and attend training programs. 3.2.2 Improving Access for Homeless Children and Families . The CCDBG Act of 2014 places greater emphasis on serving homeless children and families. Stable access to high -quality child care provides tremendous benefits to all children, especially our most vulnerable children. Children and families who experience homelessness face many challenges. Improving access to child care can buffer children and families from the challenges and risks associated with homelessness by supporting children's learning and development in safe, stable and nurturing environments. Under the new law, States and Territories are required to use CCDF funds to 1) allow homeless children to receive CCDF assistance after an initial eligibility determination but before providing required documentation (including documentation related to immunizations); 2) providing training and technical assistance to child care providers on identif ying and serving homeless children and families (addressed in Section 6); and 3) conduct specific outreach to homeless families. (658E(c)(3)) States and Territories also must establish a grace period that allows homeless children and children in foster car e (if served by the Lead Agency) to receive CCDF assistance while their families are taking the necessary actions to comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements as described in Section 5. This flexibility will significantly make it ea sier for these vulnerable families to access child care services. This language is consistent with current requirements established through CCDF regulations in 1998, which required a grace period in which children can receive services while families take the necessary actions to comply with the immunization requirements. (658E(c)(2)I)(i)(I)) ACF recommends States and Territories consult the definition of homeless in the McKinney -Vento Act (section 725 of subtitle VII -B) as you implement the requirements of this section. Describe the status of the State/Territory's establishment procedures to enroll and provide outreach to homeless families and establish a grace period for children in foster care, if served, for meeting immunization requirements Fully impleme nted and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above.

States and Territories are required to demonstrate in the Plan that no later than September 30, 2016 each child who receives assistance will be considered t o meet all eligibility requirements for such assistance and will receive such assistance, for not less than 12 months before the State /Territory redetermines the eligibility of the child, regardless of changes in income (as long as income does not exceed the federal threshold of 85% of State median income) or temporary changes in participation in work, training, or education activities. (658E(c)(2)(N)(i) & (ii)) DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 64 Note that this change means a State/Territory may not terminate CCDF assistance during the 12 - month period if a family has an increase in income that exceeds the State's income eligibility threshold, but not the federal threshold of 85% SMI . In addition, this change means the State /Territory may not terminate assistance prior to the end of the 12-month period if family experiences a temporary job loss or temporary change in participation in a training or education activity. Examples of temporary changes include but are not limited to: absence from employment due to maternity or extended medical leave , changes in seasonal work schedule, or if a parent enrolled in training or educational program is temporarily not attending class between semesters. Describe the status of the State/Territory's establishment of 12 -month eligibility and redetermination periods for CCDF families. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above by March 1, 2016 . List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and describe : The District of Columbia currently has a 12 - month eligibility period. OSSE is in the process of revising the eligibility p olicies, in partnership with DHS, to ensure families in seasonal employment and families experiencing temporary job loss or temporary change in participation in a training or education activity remain eligible for 12 - months. O SSE will train DHS eligibility staff and Level II enrollment coordinators on the new policies by March 1, 2016. Not implemented . If no t implemented , the State/Territory must provide a State /Territory - specific implementation plan for achieving comp liance with this requirement, including planned activ ities, necessary legislative or regulatory steps to complete, and target completion date (no later than September 30, 2016 ).

However, prior to terminating the subsidy, the State/Territory must provide a period of continued child care assistance of at least 3 months to allow parents to engage in job search, resume work , or to attend an education or training program as soon as possible. (658E(c)(2)(N)(iii)) Note that unless the State a llows a minimum 3 -month job search period - the State/Territory may not exercise the option to terminate assistance based on a parent's no n-temporary job loss or cessation of attendance at a job training or educational program prior to the end of the 12 month eligibility and re -determ ination period. Does the State/Territory terminate assistance prior to 12 months due to a parent's loss of wo rk or cessation of attendance at a job training or education program? No, the State /Territory does not allow this option. Yes, the State/Territory allows this option . List the Lead Agency's policy citation(s) and provide the period of time and circumstan ces allowed : The OSSE Child Care E ligibility Manual, Section 300.6 Eligibility Need - outlines the provision for loss of employment and maternity leave for period of not more than three months . The District allows a minimum three -month job search period f or reduction in force through no fault of the employee. The District must revise current eligibility process to implement a 12-month continuous eligibility for non - temporary changes in work and training requirements . 3.3.3 Prevent Disruption of Work The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a requirement that States and Territories must describe in the Plan the procedures and policies in place to ensure that parents (especially parents in families receiving assistance under TANF) are not required to unduly disrupt their empl oyment , education or job training activities in order to comply with the State /Territory 's or designated local entity's requirements for redetermination of eligibility for assistance. (658E(c)(2)(N)(ii)) Examples include implementing re -determination strategies to verify income and employment electronically as opposed to more onerous practices such as asking parents and families to come to the subsidy office for an in -person visit , or aligning eligibility with other early care and education programs to coll ect information centrally . The process by which States and Territories collect eligibility documentation represents a potential barrier to services, particularly when documentation can only be provided in -person during standard work hours. States and Territories can offer a variety of family -friendly mechanisms for submitting documentation for eligibility determinations and/or re -determination . Describe the status of the State/Territory's redetermination procedures and policies to ensure that parents (espec ially parents receiving TANF) do not have their employment, education or job DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 66 training unduly disrupted in order to comply with the State/Territory's or designated local entity's requirements for redetermination of eligibility.

(658E(c)(5 ) In addition to income and size of the family, the Lead Agency may use other factors when determining family contributions/co -payments. The sliding fee scale is subject to review by ACF as part of ongoing mon itoring efforts to CCDBG compliance. 3.4.1 Provide the CCDF copayments in the chart below according to family size. Note - If the sliding fee scale is not statewide, fill in the chart based on the most populous area of the S tate. Check here to indicate the sliding fee scale is not statewide.

No. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 69 3.4.4 The Lead Agency may waive contributions/co -payments from families whose incomes are at or below the poverty level for a family of the same size (98.42(c)). Will the Lead Agency waive family contributions/co -payments for families whose inc omes are at or below the poverty level ? Yes, the Lead Agency waives family contributions/co -payments for families with income at or below the poverty level for families of the same size. The poverty level used by the Lead Agency for a fa mily size of 3 is: $ 10,045 . No, the Lead Agency does not waive family contributions/co -payments. 3.4.5 How will the Lead Agency ensure the family contribution/co -payment, based on a sliding fee scale, is affordable and not a barrier to families receiving CCDF ? Check all that apply. Limit s the maximum co -payment per family. Describe : Copayment s are made only for the first and second oldest child . Limit s combined amount of copayment for all children to 10% o r less of family income .

Describe The State does not allow providers to charge the difference between the maximum reimbursement rate and their private pay rate Covers all fees (such as registration, supplies, field trips) to minimize the additional fees charged to the families by the provider. Describe : Other. Describe: 4 Ensure Equal Access to High Q uality Child Care for Low -Income Children The 2014 r eauthorization of the CCDBG Act is designed to help States and Territories advance improvements to the quality of child care in order to prom ote the healthy social- emotional, cognitive and physical develo pment of participating children. Ensuring that low -income and vulnerable children can access high -quality care (and remain enrolled to school entry and beyond ) is an equa lly important purpose of CCDBG. Payment levels and policies have a major impact on acc ess. The CCDBG Act of 2014 revises the requirement for a market rate survey (MRS) so that: (1) it must be statistically valid and reliable; and (2) it must reflect variations in the cost of child care services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child. Also, a State /Territory may develop and conduct an alternative methodology for setting payment rates, s uch as a cost estimation model , to take into account the cost of meeting quality requirements . DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 70 To provide stability of funding and encourage mo re child care providers to participate in the subsidy program, t he State /Territory 's payment practices for CCDF child care providers must reflect generally accepted payment practices of non -CCDF child c are providers in the State /Territory , such as paying f or supplies, field trips, registration fees . In addition, t o the extent practicable, the State /Territory must implement enrollment and eligibility policies that support the fixed costs of providing child care services by delinking provider payments from a child's occasional absence due to holidays or unforeseen circumstances such as illness or closures due to emergency . The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a provision that the State /Territory must also develop and implement strategies to increase the supply and impr ove the quality of child care services for: (1) children in underserved areas; (2) infants and toddlers; (3) children with disabilities (the CCDBG Act of 2014 added a new definition of child with disability (658(P)(3)) ; and (4) children who receive care du ring non - traditional hours. With respect to investments to increase access to programs providing high -quality child care and development services, the State/Territory must give priority to children of families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and that do not have such programs. (658 E(c)(2)(M)) 4.1 Parental Choice In Relation to Certificates, Grants or Contracts The parent(s) of each eligible child who receive (s) or is offered financial assistance for child care services has the option of either enrolling such child with a provider that has a grant or contract for the provision of service or receiving a child care certificate. (658E(c)(2)(A)) This did not change under the CCDBG Act of 2014 . 4.1.1 Describe how the parent of each eligible child is advised that the Lead Agency offers the option of selecting a provider that has a grant or contract or receiving a child care certificate (658E(c)(2)(A)(i), 658P(2)) Parents can select a child care provider from the online child care finder or by reaching out to the Child Care Resource and Referral hotline. Additionally, staff at the Department of Human Services, Child Care Services Division provide information about child care options to families seeking child care admission forms . 4.1.2 Desc ribe how the parent is informed of the option to choose from a variety of child care categories - such as private, not -for-profit, faith -based providers (if using a certificate), centers, family child care homes, or in -home providers (658E(c)(2)(A)(i), 658 P(2), 658Q)) Certificate form provides information about the choice of providers , including high quality providers Certificate is not linked to a specific provider so parents can choose provider of choice Consumer education materials on choosing child ca re Referral to child care resource and referral agencies Co-located resource and referral in eligibility offices Verbal communication at the time of application DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 71 Community outreach, workshops or other in -person activities Other.

Information is provided in multiple languages as outlined in DC's Language Access Act. 4.1.3 Child Care Services Available through Grants or Contracts a) In addition to offering certificates, does the Lead Agency provide child care services through grants or contracts for child care slots? (658A(b)(1) ))) Note : Do not check \"yes\" if every provider is simply required to sign an agreement in order to be paid in the certificate program. Yes. If yes, describe the type(s) of child care services available through grants or contracts, the entities who receive contracts (e.g., shared services alliances , child care resource and r eferral agencies, family child care networks, community based agencies, child care providers, etc.), the process for accessing grants or contracts, the range of providers available through grants or contracts , how rates are set for grants and contracts , how the S tate/Territory determines which entities to contract with for increasing supply and/or improving quality , and if contracts are offered statewide and/or locally : No. If no, skip to 4.1.4. b) Will the Lead Agency u se grants or contracts for child care services to achieve any of the following (check all that apply): Increase the supply of specific types of care with grants or contracts for: Programs to serve children with disabilities Progra ms to serve infants and toddler s Programs to serve school -age children Programs to serve children needing non -traditional hour care Programs to serve homeless children Programs to serve children in underserved areas Programs that serve children with diverse linguistic or cultural backgrounds Programs that serve specific geographic areas Urban Rural Other.

Describe 4.1.4 The Lead Agency certifies policies and procedures are in place that afford parents unlimited access to their children whenever their children are in the care of a provider who receives CCDF funds . (658E(c)(2)(B)) This requirement did not change unde r the CCDBG Act of 2014 . Describe the policies and procedures for unlimited access . Parents have unlimited access to their children whenever their children are in the care of a provider. Parents are informed of this policy during the p arent application and orientation process. Providers are informed of this policy during the subsidy provider orientation and in the subsidy provider agreement . 4.1.5 The Lead Agency must allow for in -home care (i.e., care provided in the child's own home) but may limit its use. Will the Lead Agency limit the use of in -home care in any way? Yes. If checked, what limits will the Lead Agency set on the use of in -home care? Check all that apply . Restricted based on minimum number of children in t he care of the provider to meet minimum wage law or Fair Labor Standards Act .

Describe No 4.2 Assessing Market Rates and Child Care Costs The new law revises the provisions for a market rate survey (MRS) so that: (1) it must be statistically valid and reliable; and (2) it must reflect variations in the price to parents of child care services by geographic area, type of provider, and age of child (658E(c)(4)(B)). A State /Territory has the option to develop and use a statistically valid and reliable alternative methodology for se tting payment rates, such as a cost estimation model. Any payment rates established using an alternative methodology or market rate survey must be reviewed and approved by ACF as part of the CCDF Plan review process. Because the alternative methodology is a new basis for setting payment rates, we highly recommend any State or Territory considering an alternative methodology to submit a description of its proposed approach to the ACF Regional Office in advance of the Plan submittal in order to avoid delays w ith Plan approval. The MRS or alternative methodology must be developed and conducted no earlier than two years before the date of submission of the Plan (instead of two years before the effective date of the Plan, as previously required for t he MRS). The State must consult with the State Advisory Council or other state- or state -designated cross -agency body if no SAC , local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral agencies, and other appropriate entities prior to developing and conducting the MRS or alternative methodology. The State/Territory must prepare a detailed report containing the results of the MRS or alternative methodology. The State must make the report with the se results widely available no later than 30 days after completion of the MRS or alternative methodology, including posting the results on the Internet in an easily interpretable and understandable form . The State/Territory must set CCDF subsidy payment rates in accordance with the results of the current MRS or alternative methodology. When setting payment rates, the law requires States and Territories to take into consideration the cost of providing higher quality child care services than were provided prior to November 2014 (e.g., tiered reimbursement or o ther methods) and without, to the extent practicable , reducing the number of families receiving CCDF relative to the number served as of November 2014 .

Describe OSSE consulted with n ationally recognized early childhood finance experts to model the cost of delivering services at each level of the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS) in center and home -based sett ings that serve children of varying ages and needs. The DC QRIS system has three levels of quality: bronze, silver and gold. All licensed centers are bronze, a child development center or home that seeks national accreditation and completes its self -study is silver and accredited programs are gold. The goal s of th e alternative methodology work are: 1) identify the fiscal impact of the DC QRIS standards; 2) identify key cost drivers that cut across all QRIS levels; 3) carefully explore differential costs be tween programs that serve primarily (or exclusively) infants and toddlers and those that s erve primarily (or exclusively) three - and four -year old children; and 4) use this information to test a range of alternative rate -setting and policy recommendations with a clear understanding of the fiscal impact of these decisions. Both. Describe Other. Describe 4.2.2 Describe how the State consulted with the State Advisory Council or other state- or state- designated cross -agency body if no SAC , local child care program administrators, local child care resource and referral age ncies, and other appropriate entities prior to developing and conducting the MRS or alternative methodology. The State Early Childhood Develo pment Coordinating Council was consulted on the alternative cost estimation methodology at its March and November 2 015 meeting s. 4.2.3 Describe how the market rate survey or alternative methodology is statistically valid and reliable. To be considered valid and reliable, the MRS or alternative methodology must represent the child care market, provide complete and current data, use rigorous data collection procedures, reflect geographic variation, and analyze data in a manner that captures other relevant differences. For example, market rate surveys can us e administrative data such as child care resource and referral d ata if they are representative of the market. If an alternative methodology such as cost modeling is used, demonstrate that the methodology used reliable models that estimated the cost of delivering services in center - and home -based settings at each level of quality defined by the S tate/Territory . The District used a cost modeling approach that was developed and tested by national experts Anne Mitchell of the Alliance for Early Childhood Finance and Andrew Brodsky of Brodsky Research, and Augenblick, Pala ich and Associates (APA), a leader in education finance. These leaders worked collaboratively with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care through the support of the National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement and the Child Care State Systems Specialist Network to build the Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC), a dynamic, web -based tool that calculates the cost of quality child care based on site -level provider data. The D istrict adapted DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 75 the PCQC by embedding its principles in a set of Excel spreadsheets that are aligned to the District's unique reimbursement rate variations that are based on a range of quality and other funding factors. This cost model allows OSSE to understand the potential impact of rates and other policy changes on these quality and funding variations. Careful attention was paid to ensuring that the data used to inform cost assumptions in the model accurately reflect s provider experience. Consultants carefully reviewed available financial and enrollment data on early childhood programs in the District and, in some cases, conducted targeted surveys to gather specific data (e.g. enrollment data in home -based care.) Group and individual interviews with the sector were also conducted to gather and/or vet information. 4.2.4 Describe how the market rate survey reflects variations in the price of child care services by: N/A the District did not use a market rate survey. a) Geographic area (e.g., statewide or local markets) N/A b) Type of provider c) Age of child d) Describe any other key variations examined by the market rate survey, such as quality level 4.2.5 Describe the process used by the State /Territory to prepare a detailed report containing the results an d make the report widely available to the public. a) Date of completion of the market rate survey or alternative methodology (must be no earlier than July 1, 2013 and no later than March 1, 2016 ) February 1, 2016 . b) Date report containing results were made wi dely available , no less than 30 days after the completion of the report March 1, 2016 . c) How the report containing results was made widely available including the internet address where the report is posted .

The ages and types of care are meant to provide a snapshot of categories on which rates may be based and are not intended to be comprehensive of all categories that may exist in your State /Territory . Please use the most populous geographic region (serving highest number of children). All eight wards of the District are cons idered one geographic region. The majority of children in subsidized child care are served in centers with the highest level of quality. The rates below are for the base payment rate which is the b ronze tier in DC's QRIS system. a) Infant (6 months), full -time licensed center care in most populous geographic region Rate $46.81 Percentile N/A b) Infant (6 months), full -time licensed FCC care in most populous geographic region Rate $32.76 Percentile N/A c) Toddler (18 months), full -time licensed center care in most populous geographic region Rate $45.80 Percentile N/A d) Toddler (18 months), full -time licensed FCC care in most populous geographic region Rate $31.21 Percentile N/A e) Preschooler ( 4 years ), full- time licensed center care in most populous geographic region Rate $29.21 Percentile N/A f) Preschooler ( 4 years ), full- time licensed FCC care in most populous geographic region Rate $22.03 Percentile N/A g) School -age child ( 6 years ), full -time licensed center care in most populous geographic region Rate $19.85 Percentile N/A h) School -age child ( 6 years ), full -time licensed FCC care in most populous geographic region DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 77 Rate $20.00 Percentile N/A i) Describe the calculation/definition of full- time care: The definition of full- time care is care of six or more hours. 4.3.5 States and Territories may choose to set base payment rates that differ because they tak e into consideration such factors as 1) geographic location, 2) age of child, 3) needs of children (special needs, protective services, etc.), 4) non -traditional hours of care, or 5) quality of care. In other words, base rates for infants may be set at a higher level than for school -age care because the cost of providing infant care tend s to be higher than school -age care . In addition to these rates that differ tied to mar ket variations in prices, States and Territories can choose to establish tiered rates or add -ons on top of these variable base rates as a way to increase payment rates for targeted needs (i.e., higher rate for special needs children as both an incentive fo r providers to serve children with special needs and as a way to cover the higher costs to the provider to provide care for special needs children ). Check which types of tiered payment or rate add -on, if any, the Lead Agency has chosen to implement. In the description of any tiered rates or add -ons, indicate the process and basis used for determining the tiered rates , amount or percentage of the tiered rate/add -on, and indicate if the rates were set based on the MRS or another process. rate/rate add -on for non -traditional hours. Describe The District offers a tiered reimbursement rate for both center and home providers for non -traditional care. Rates increase with the quality rating - bronze is the lowest reimbursement rate, silver is the middle reimbur sement rate, and gold is the highest reimbursement rate . Tiered rate/rate add -on for children with special needs as defined by the State/Territory. Describe The District offers a special needs reimbursement rate for center providers who provide child car e and related services for children with special needs. Providers sign a modification to the child care subsidy agreement. Based on cost modeling, OSSE will explore the possibility of increas ing the rate for Gold Level centers that serve children with spe cial needs . Tiered rate/rate add -on for infants and toddlers (do no t check if you have a different base rate for infants/toddlers with no separate bonus or add -on). Describe The District offers a tiered reimbursement rate for both center and home provide rs for infant and toddler care. The rates increase with quality rating - bronze is the lowest reimbursement rate, silver is the mid dle reimbursement rates, and gold is the highest reimbursement rate. Based on the cost modeling, OSSE intends to adjust the rate for children ages 12 -30 months. OSSE will also explore increasing rates for infant and toddler s enrolled in Gold Level centers and homes to help fill the gap identified by cost modeling. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 78 Tiered rate/rate add -on for programs meeting higher quality as defined by the State/Territory. The District offers a tiered reimbursement rate for both center and home providers for increase quality of care.

As noted above, we are exploring additional adjustments to our tiered rates based on findings from cost modeling. Tiered rate/rate add -on for programs serving homeless children . Describe Other tiered rate/rate add -on beyond the base rate . Describe None. 4.3.3 Describe how the State/Territory set payment rates for child care services in accordance with the results of the most recent market rate survey or alte rnative methodology The cost modeling methodology is an extremely helpful way to establish rate policy because it not only allows OSSE to analyze the impact of standards and likely revenues , but also takes into consideration a host of additional factors that impact costs , such as e nrollment levels, program size, gaps in subsidy eligibility and fee collection. For example, in addition to identifying the financial challenges of serving infants and toddlers, we learned that in order to meet DC higher quality standards and break even under current policies and reimbursement rates , child care centers need to be 98 percent enrolled, able to collect tuition and fees for all children every day, and serve at least 200 children. Similarly, family child care ( FCC) homes need to be fully enrolled in order for the provider to make a decent wage (currently our FCC homes report that, on average, they are only 60 percent enrolled). As a result, OSSE plans to explore both rate and policy changes that could address enrollme nt efficienc ies and program size , potentially including: Higher subsidy reimbursement rates for centers and homes that serve infants, toddlers and children with special needs, and have attained the QRIS Gold level . Quality grants for centers and homes tha t serve infants, toddlers and children with special needs and are currently at the b ronze or silver level, with demonstrated interest in moving up the quality ladder. These grants would be time -limited, and focused on helping sites make the changes needed to attain a gold level rating. Revisions to subsidy policy aimed at boosting enrollment in c hild development homes, as well as centers that serve children with special needs that have attained a gold level rating. Contracting for slots, with emphasis on h igh-quality centers and homes, located in neighborhoods where significant numbers of vulnerable children live, that ha ve attained some economies of scale via multi- site centers or Shared Service Alliances that centralize administration and program leadersh ip. OSSE plans to explore these options with its partners, in consideration of overall needs and available budget. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 79 4.3.4 In setting payment rates, how did the State /Territory take into consideration the cost of providing higher quality child care services th an were provided prior to November 2014 (e.g., tiered payment or other methods) and without, to the extent practicable, reducing the number of families receiving CCDF relative to the number of families served as of November 2014. For example, providing tie red payment with a sufficient differential to support higher quality, considering the cost of quality using a cost estimation model or other method, or examining the participation rate of high -quality providers in the subsidy system (e.g., using indicators from a quality rating system , accreditation or other state -defined indicators of quality ) and adjusting payment rates if necessary. The District's Child Care Subsidy Program rates include the full range of provider types , including specific rates for lic ensed centers, family child care homes, relative and in -home care. Rates are further categorized by the age of the child , as well as the quality of the center o r home (as determined by the D.C.'s tiered rate reimbursement system/QRIS -Going for the Gold) . DC is committed to maintaining the number of families receiving CCDF at the November 2014 level. We are also committed to using the results of the cost modeling study to explore options for ensuring that our child care centers and homes serving our most vu lnerable children have greater enrollment and financial stability to ensure access and quality for our families. OSSE is working to align Early Head Start funding with child care programs to maximize all resources. In order to prepare children for success in school and life we must ensure that the early childhood programs they attend are of the highest quality. 4.4 Summary of Facts Used to Determine that Payments Rates Are Sufficient to Ensure Equal Access The CCDF plan shall provide a summary of data and facts relied on by the State/Territory to certify that payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access. (658E (c)(4)(A)) Equal access is not limited to a single percentile alone but is inclusive of various metrics or benchmarks that would offer children rec eiving CCDF access to the same services (type of care, quality of care) as children not receiving CCDF. 4.4.1 What data and facts did the State use to determine equal access (i.e., what is your metric or benchmark of equal access - such as percentile that rates cover or proportion of costs covered)?

Describe 4.6 Supply Building Strategies to Meet the Needs of Certain Populations The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a provision that the State /Territory will develop and implement strat egies to increase the supply and improve the quality of child care services for children in underserved areas, infants and toddlers, children with disabilities, and children who receive care during non -traditional hours. (658 E(c)(2)(M) ) 4.6.1 Has the State /Terr itory conducted data analysis of existing and growing supply needs? Yes. OSSE uses Kids Count data, administrative data and the Head Start Community Needs Assessment to identify needs of young children and families by geographic areas of the city. Addit ionally, agency performance data is analyzed annually to determine the availability and quality of licensed child care and preschool education. T o inform the market rate survey, OSSE coordinated with two advocacy organizations that conducted interviews wit h child development centers to learn more about the finances, business practices and enrollment in District child care centers. The CCR&R conducted a survey of child development homes. This information indicated that most family child care homes, and many child care centers, are not fully enrolled . Thus, there are available slots in most District neighborhoods. However, due to our historically low reimbursement rates for infants and toddlers, coupled with challenges regarding consistent eligibility, some pr oviders with vacant slots do not serve subsidized children. Additionally, providers that serve children with special needs face significant cost challenges. Thus, OSSE is exploring supply -building strateg ies focused on boosting the quality of existing cent ers/homes - most especially in areas of greatest need and maximizing all available slots in these centers and homes so t hat they are at least 85 percent enrolled at all times . No. If no, how does the State/Territory determine most critical supply needs? 4.6.2 Describe what method (s) is used to increase supply and improve quality for: a) Infants and t oddlers Grants and contracts (as discussed in 4.1.3) Family child care networks Start -up funding and technical assistance support Recruitment of prov iders Tiered payment rates (as discussed in 4.4.1) Other.

Describe OSSE is building a partnership with community -based organizations that specific ally address es the needs of and assistance to families who are in transitional h ousing and/or are homeless. 4.6.3 The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires States to describe the procedures and process it uses, in terms of the investments made to increase access to programs providing high quality child care and development services, to give pri ority for those investments to children in families in areas that have significant concentrations of poverty and unemployment and that do not have such high - quality programs. (658E(c)(2)(Q)) Describe the status of State/Territory 's process and procedures to give priority for investments to children and families from areas with high concentrations of poverty and unemployment that do not have high -quality programs. Fully implemented and meeting all Federal requirements outlined above. Describe The Distri ct of Columbia does not have a wait list for child care development services. The lead agency funds organizations that provide training and technical assistance to individuals interested in opening child development homes in underserved communities. Additi onally, through the Early Head Start -Child DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 85 Care Partnership Quality Improvement Network s, OSSE has set a five-year goal of increasing by 1,000 the number of quality slots availab le for infant and toddler care across the District . This increase will focus particularly in neighborhood s and communities with high concentrations of poverty and limited access to high quality child development services. Not implemented .

This includes both the standards that must be established and the pre - service/orientation and ongoing minimum training required. States and Territories mu st also explain why exemptions to any of the licensing standards did not endanger the health and safety of CCDF children in license -exempt care. States and Territories are required to have standards for CCDF providers regarding group size limits and approp riate child -to-provider ratios based on the age of children in child care. Pre-licensure and annual unannounced inspections of licensed CCDF providers and annual inspections of license -exempt CCDF providers are now required. The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires States and Territories to establish qualifications and training for licensing inspectors and DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 86 appropriate inspector- to-provider ratios. It also requires States and Territories to conduct criminal background checks for all child care staff members, including staff members who don't care directly for children but have unsupervised access to children and lists specific disqualifying crimes. States and Territories must certify that all child care providers comply with child abuse reporting requirements of CAPT A (mandatory reporting of known and suspected instances of child abuse and neglect). 5.1 Licensing Requirements and Standards Each State /Territory is required to certify it has in effect licensing requirements applicable to all child care services provided within the State /Territory (not restricted to providers receiving CCDF) , and to provide a detailed description of such requirements and how such requirements are effectively enforced. (658E(c)(2)(I)(i)) 5.1.1 The State/Territory certifies that it has licensing req uirements applicable to child care services provided within the State. (658(c)(2)(F)) This requirement did not change under the CCDB G Act of 2014 . List the categories of care that your State/Territory licenses and provide your definition of each licensed category of care . The current definitions are: Child Development Center or \"Center\" means a Child Development Facility located in premises other than a dwelling occupied by the operator of the Facility. \"Child Development Facility\" or \"Facility\" means a center, home, or other structure that provides care and other services, supervision and guidance for children, infants, and toddlers on a regular basis, regardless of its designated name. \"Child Development Facility\" includes \"Child Development Center.\" \"Child Development Facility\" does not include a public or private elementary or secondary school engaged in legally required educational and related functions. Child Development Home\" means a private residence which provides a child development program for a maximum of six (6) children with a ratio of one adult caregiver to 2 children if there are 2 or more children younger than 2 years of age in the group; provided, that each adult caregiver possesses a post -secondary degree in early childhood education or a related field as determined by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, hold a current Child Development Associate (\"CDA\") credential, is enrolled in a CDA training program, or can provide evidence of enrollment in a CDA training program that will begin within 6 months of the first day of the adult caregiver's work with children at the child development home. The total of 6 children shall not include those of the caregiver who are 6 years or older; provided, that the total number of children of the caregiver between the ages of 6 and 15 years shall not exceed 3, and of those 3 children, no more than 2 shall be age 10 years or younger. A child development home shall also include c are given to a child by a caregiver related to the child. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term \"related\" means any of the following relationships by marriage, blood, or adoption: Grandparent, parent, brother, sister, step -sister, step -brother, uncle , or aunt. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 87 \"Expanded Child Development Home\" means a Child Development Home in which child care is provided by two (2) or more Caregivers for up to twelve (12) children. 5.1.2 Does your State/Territory exempt any child care providers from its licensing require ments? Yes. If the State /Territory exempts any child care providers from State/Territory licensing requirements, the CCDBG Act of 2014 requires S tates and Territories to describe how such licensing exemptions do not endanger the health, safety, and devel opment of children who receive services from license exempt providers . (658E(c)(2)(F)(ii)) Describe who is exempt from licensing and how such exemptions do not endanger children who receive services from exempt providers The following programs are exempt from licensure: Occasional babysitting in a babysitter's home for the children of one family; Informal parent -supervised neighborhood play groups; Care provided in places of worship during religious services; Care by a related person, as defined in section 399 of this Chapter; Facilities operated by the federal government on federal government property; except that a private entity utilizing space in or on federal government property is not exempt unless federal law specifically exempts the Facility from D istrict of Columbia regulatory authority.

States and Territories are required to have requirements, policies, an d procedures in place to conduct criminal background checks for staff members of child care providers ( other than relatives that are licensed, regulated or registered under State /Territory law or receive CCDF funds) . Background check requirements apply to any staff member who is employed by a child care provider for compensation or whose activities involve the care or supervision of children or unsupervised access to children. For family child care homes, this includes the caregiver requesting a check of him/herself, as well as any other individuals in the household that may have unsupervised access to children. These provisions must be in place no later than September 30, 2017. States and Territories must also have licensing and regulatory requirements, not limited to CCDF, that prohibit the employment of child care staff members who refuse or do not pass the criminal background check. A child care provider is ineligible for CCDF funds if the provider employs an ineligible child care staff member. The CC DBG Act of 2014 specifies what a comprehensive cri minal background check includes and a child care provider must submit a request to the appropriate State /Territory agency for a criminal background check for each child care staff member, including prospective child care staff members at least once every 5 years . A criminal background check must include a search of: State criminal and sex offender registry in the State where the staff member resides and each State where the staff member has resided over the past 5 years; State child abuse and neglect registry in the State where the staff member resides and each State where the staff member has resided over the past 5 years , National Crime Information Center (run by the FBI); FBI fingerprint check using Next Gener ation Identification ; and National Sex Offender Registry. Child care staff members cannot be employed by a provider receiving CCDF if they refuse a background check; make materially false state ments in connection with the background check; are registered or required to be registered on the State or National Sex Offender Registry; have been convicted of a felony consisting of: murder, child abuse or neglect, crimes against children, spousal abuse, crime involving rape or sexual assault, kidnapping, arson, p hysical assault, or DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 113 subject to an individual review, at the State's option, a drug- related offense committed during the preceding 5 years; or have been convicted of a violent misdemeanor committed as an adult against a child. The State /Territory may conduc t an individualized review of staff members who have received felony criminal convictions for drug -use to determine eligib ility for employment. Timeliness of background checks - The State /Territory must conduct the background checks as quickly as possible and shall not exceed 45 days after the child care provider submitted the request. The State /Territory shall provide the results of the background check in a state ment that indicates whether the staff member is eligible or ineligible, without revealing spec ific disqualifying information. If the staff member is ineligible, the State /Territory will provide information about each disqualifying crime to the staff member. Fees for background checks - Fees that a State /Territory may charge for the costs of process ing applications and administering a criminal background check may not exceed actual costs to the State /Territory for processing and administration. Transp arency - The State /Territory must ensure that policies and procedures for conducting criminal backgro und checks are published on the State /Territory 's consumer education website (also see section 2. 3) or other publicly available venue. Appeals process - The State/Territory shall have a process for a child care staff member to appeal the results of their b ackground check to challenge the accuracy and completeness . The fees charged by a State or Territory for completing the background checks may not exceed the actual cost of processing and administration. The State /Territory must publish the background check policies and procedures on the State /Territory and local lead agency websites. If there is no website, then the information must be made publicly available in another venue. Privacy considerations - Lead Agency may not publicly release the results of indi vidual background checks.

Current Status - Describe the State/Territory's status toward completion for any requirement(s) not fully implemented (not yet started, in progress, partially completed, substantially completed, other) Partially Completed . In the District of Columbia there are currently several regulations which cover safety sensitive positions (people working with children), including the \"Criminal Background Checks for the Protection of Children Act of 2004\", the \"Child and Youth, Safety and Health Omnibus Congressional Review Emergency Amendment Act of 2005\" (CYSHA), and the D.C. Merit Personnel Act \u00a7 1-620.36 \"Coverage of private contractual providers and private licensed providers.\" Safety -sensitive positions are defined as : (A) employ ment in which the District employee has direct contact with children or youth; (B) is entrusted with the direct care and custody of children or youth; and (C) whose performance of his or her duties in the normal course of employment may affect the health, welfare, or safety of children or youth. Each private entity licensed by the District government that has employees who work in safety -sensitive positions must establish mandatory drug and alcohol testing policies and procedures. D.C. Official Code \u00a7 1 -620.36. This section of the Merit DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 115 Personnel Act has ensured that the requirements of CYSHA and Criminal Background Checks cover any providers who work with children. Thus, by virtue of being licensed by the District of Columbia, all providers, private and public, are required to establish drug and alcohol testing and to obtain criminal background checks every two years for all employees. Criminal background checks are defined as being fingerprint checks from both the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for each employee that works at your facility. All applicants shall submit a criminal background check from the FBI and MPD that is no older than three (3) months. The aforementioned regulations have been a part of the District's law since at least 2005. If a provider is deemed unsuitable for employment with children, providers may request an appeal to the results of the criminal background check suitability determination through OSSE's appeals process. A request for appeal must be submitted to OSSE in writing within 15 calendar days of the date of the suitability notice. Background check information will be reviewed and a determination letter will be sent to the provider within 10 calendar days of receipt of the requ est for appeal. Tasks/Activities - What specific steps will you take to complete the requirement (e.g., legislative or rule changes, modify agreements with coordinating agencies, etc.) OSSE will form a partnership with other District agencies that also require criminal background checks, obtain a contract with a FBI approved third party vendor to perform the criminal backgrou nd checks and receive results directly in a timely manner as required.

These require a competent, skilled, and stable workforce. Research has shown that specialized training and education, positive and well- organized work environments and adequate compensation promote teacher stability and effectiveness with young children in child care. In addition, professional development strategies that emphasize on -site mentoring and coaching of teachers have emerged as promising to change practices with children and families. The CCDBG Ac t of 2014 requires States and Territories to establish professional development and training requirements in key areas such as health and safety, early learning guidelines, responding to challenging behavior and engaging families. States and Territories are required to offer ongoing annual training and to est ablish a progression of professional development opportunities to improve knowledge and skills of CCDF providers. (658E(c)(2)(G)) An example of how a State /Territory might address this is to establish a system or framework of professional development that includes professional standards, a \"career ladder\" that allows an individual to move from introductory training to advance level education , including obtaining a credential or post -secondary degree. Pr ofessional development should be designed in a manner that builds and is cumulative to result in higher credentials, certification or advanced degrees recognized by the State /Territory as demonstrating mastery in their profession. Training and education supporting professional development is also one of the options States and Territories have for investing their CCDF quality funds . (658G(b)(1)) Responsive, well -qualified adult caregivers are one of the most important factors in children's development and le arning in child care settings. ACF strongly encourages States and Territories to link CCDF health and safety trainings (see Section 5) and child development trainings and education to this broader professional development framework as the foundation for b uilding a knowledgeable early childhood education workforce. Questions related to requirements for recruiting and retaining a qualified and effective child care workforce have been consolidated into Section 6. 6.1 Training and Professional Development Requirem ents The CCDBG Act of 2014 added a requirement that the State /Territory develop training and professional development requirements designed to enable child care providers to promote the social, emotional, physical and cognitive development of children and to improve the knowledge and skills of the child care workforce. Such requirements shall be applicable to child care providers caring for children receiving CCDF. (658E(c)(2)(G)) The State/Territory also must develop and implement strategies to strengthen the business practices of child care providers to expand the supply and improve the quality of child care services. (658E(c)(2)(V)) For purposes of this section, the term professional development is inclusive of credit bearing coursework, postsecondary de gree programs, and technical assistance (targeted assistance such as mentoring, coaching or consultation) activities . Health and safety topics that require renewal of a credential or certification should be considered continuing education unit trainings. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 119 6.1.1 Describe the status of the State /Territory 's professional development system or framework, including training and professional development requirements to enable child care providers to promote the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of c hildren and to improve the knowledge and skills of the child care workforce. The Lead Agency assures that the State /Territory 's training and professional development requirements: a) Provide ongoing training and professional development, provide for a progres sion of professional development reflecting research and best practice to meet the developmental needs of participating children and improve the quality and stability of the child care workforce (such as allows an individual to build on entry - and mid -level training and education both in terms of the skills and knowledge they attain but also in terms of credit that leads toward a higher level credential or certification, including articulation agreements) OSSE's Early Childhood and Out of School Time Caree r Guide includes a career ladder with four career pathways: Leadership, Infant/Toddler, Pre -Kindergarten, and Before/Afterschool. There are twelve levels each with qualification requirements that are flexible enough to ensure that professionals can pursue individualized professional growth plans. The Career Guide includes ( 1) documentation of earned professional learning units (PLUs) required annually for employment in a subsidized licensed child care setting; (2) credentials including CDA Infant Toddler, CDA Preschool (offered in English and Spanish), Director Credential I, and/or a credential in a specialized field of study; and (3) earned college credits and higher education degrees. The approval process for Level progression is individualized and issue d by OSSE . Additionally, OSSE has a robust, research -based Trainer Approval Program (TAP) that ensures the child care workforce has access to a wide variety of quality training opportunities that improve their knowledge, skill and competenc y in early childhood development from infancy through pre -K to Kindergarten. TAP certifies both individual and organizational professional development trainers that provide ongoing training and professional development opportunities in 11 core knowledge areas (CKAs). Core Knowledge Areas (CKAs) detail the specific knowledge and skills needed by early childhood professionals to work effectively with all young children and families. CKAs include: 1. Child Growth and Development; 2. Social- Emotional Development and Mental Healt h; 3. Observing, Documenting and Assessing to Support Young Children and Families; 4. Inclusive Practices; 5. Health, Safety, and Nutrition; 6. Curriculum; 7. Learning Environments; DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 120 8. Building Family and Community Relationships; 9. Diversity: Family, Language, Culture, and Society; 10. Program Management: Operation and Evaluation; and 11. Professionalism and Advocacy. OSSE supports TEACH and CDA scholarships for the early care and education workforce as well as in -person and on -line resources through the OSSE Early Learning Fou ndations Course Catalog , published quarterly .

The progression of professional development for a new professional in a subsidized child care program begins with basic orientation for the professional working in a licensed and subsidized child care setting. Following this orientation, a supplemental week of early learning foundational training is provided to include health and safety, social- emotional, basic DC CCELS, SIDS preventio n, Healthy Nutrition, CPR/First Aid, Act Early: Developmental Milestones, CSEFEL). This series of Early Learning Foundations professional development is made available to all members of the workforce, free of charge. Once all sessions in the series are co mpleted the individual earns 20 professional learning units (PLUs). Each of the courses embeds child development information and informs providers how to use the DC Common Core Early Learning Standards for planning. By introducing the use of best practices , professionals learn the importance of their professional growth and are introduced to the comprehensive core knowledge areas in the Early Learning Foundations Course Catalog. Career ladder or lattice. Describe. The District of Columbia Career Gu ide for Early Childhood and Out of School Time Professionals: Pathways to Professional Growth outlines a systemized professional development trajectory, with entry requirements for the workforce across all early education settings. The lattice provides a p rogressive articulation of professional attainment designated by Levels 1 through 12. The DC Career Guide is designed to support retention in the workforce based on individuals' decisions regarding their professional goals. The Career Guide encompasses fo ur career pathways: Leadership, Infant/Toddler, Pre-Kindergarten, and Before/Afterschool. Early educators access teaching and learning opportunities, and at their own pace, attain the next professional level in the career guide. There are twelve levels wi th Qualifications Requirements that are defined, yet flexible, to ensure that professionals can pursue their own individualized professional growth plans. The Career Guide utilizes a system for pathways to progress through the 12 Levels based on the following: (1) documentation of earned professional learning units (PLU's), required annually for employment in a subsidized licensed child care setting ; (2) credentials (CDA Infant Toddler, CDA Preschool, Director's Credential I, and/or a credential in a specialized field of study); and (3) earned college credits and higher education degrees. The approval process for Level progression is individualized and issued by the District's Division of Early Learning (DEL) Professional Development Unit (PDU) . Articulation agreements between two - and four -year postsecondary early childhood education or degree programs. Describe. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 124 The Program Quality Committee of the SECDCC is exploring how the District can ensure that early childhood professionals who complete a CDA cr edential will simultaneously earn an equivalent of six college credits. At this time, three schools with Associate Degree (AA) early childhood programs in the District transpose the CDA to earned college credit based on the 480 required CDA practicum hours in child care centers. Additionally, a new Associate Degree program of study in Early Childhood with an Infant -Toddler endorsement is launching at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). Currently, there is interest between representatives fr om local colleges, technical assistance organizations, and student scholarship program staff to engage in a discussion and develop articulation agreements. The research recently released by the National Academy of Sciences, \"Transforming the Workforce\" wi ll be a foundation for partnership between professionals, including all levels of leadership and faculty of higher education programs. The regional perspective and dialogue is currently facilitated by the membership of a local private foundation. The conv ersation surrounding implementation is evolving and potentially pivotal in local implementation for workforce recruitment and retention strategies. This regional discussion extends to collaborative decisions that guide the local professional field and pote ntially instrumental in defining competencies and career pathways. Collectively this influence accelerates the movement toward formal articulations and agreements between two and four -year postsecondary early childhood education programs.

The SECD CC is the cross -agency body that seeks to ensure best practice, equitable access, and high quality for early childhood programs. The SECDCC Committee for Program Quality is focused on improving access and actively contributes to improvements in professiona l development. The committee membership is comprised of a quality improvement coach, OSSE certified professional development trainers, higher education faculty, a family child care home provider, a licensed child care center director, and representatives f rom OSSE 's Early Learning Division. The committee is focused on the quality improvement with regard to the Career Lattice, pedagogy for higher education and competence of providers, and identification of strategies for collecting information and feedback from the provider community. OSSE professional development system is articulated through t he District of Columbia Professionals Receiving Opportunities and Support (DC PROS) Professional Development (PD) Plan is designed to serve as a guide for the District of Columbia to solidify and expand professional development opportunities for the early childhood workforce. DC PROS builds upon current systems and includes the goals and initiatives designed to accomplish the DEL workforce development objectives. DC PROS is a fluid document that will be reviewed by the Program Quality Committee as the agenda progresses to further address and adapt to best practices in the field and legislative or policy changes. OSSE administration is participating in The Regional Im plementation Network with regard to the collaboration activities in response to the National Academies of Sciences, Institute of Medicine and National Research Council report, Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8: A Unifying Foundati on. The network has convened with state- based leadership, including neighboring states Virginia and Maryland, with the intent to identify a core group of administrators and foundation stakeholders for ongoing representation at the national level.

The District's early education programs and professional development trainers include content relevant to all types of characteristic factors and require a comprehensive understanding, attitude and practice of inclusion versus exclusion. The DCCCELS articulate progression and differences in the approach to learning with infants, mobile infants, toddlers, 3's, 4's and 5's. The trajectory of child development is clearly articulated in DCCCELS as well as reinforced in textbooks, curricula, and practicum assignments. Supportive practices in these standards provide guidance regarding the inclusion of English learners and children with special needs. OSSE provides specialized b ilingual trainers to accommodate language diversity in its professional development trainings . The District of Columbia offers both oral translation services to individuals who seek to access or participate in the services, programs or activities and writt en translation services of vital documents (applications, notices, complaint forms, legal contracts, and outreach materials that inform individuals about their rights or eligibility requirements for benefits and participation) in the following languages: A mharic, Spanish Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Korean. OSSE contracts with various companies and utilizes Language Access, an online translation service, for translation and support services. 6.1.7 Describe the strategies the State/Territory uses to recr uit and retain providers who will serve eligible children. OSSE recruits providers through Community -Based Organizations (CBO), District schools and organizations that serve culturally diverse and linguistically similar neighborhoods across the District. T he District is a longstanding community of multicultural backgrounds and, fortunately, this diverse community includes early learning professionals from around the world. For example, following active recruitment activities, one EHS Child Care Partnership Hub now includes 11 Family Child Care Homes and providers that collectively represent nine different Spanish speaking countries. OSSE reaches providers across the District with limited English proficiency by virtue of the multicultural population. Targeted outreach is ongoing, and the Quality Improvement Network (QIN) functions with intention to recruit multicultural professionals to the workforce. OSSE QIN provides 440 slots for available affordable high quality child care during Year One, with the goal o f more than 1,000 by Year Five. The QIN provides enhanced comprehensive quality child care services to be provided in neighborhoods in all Wards of the District demonstrating highest need, including those with limited English proficiency. Through its' foc us DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 128 on building interagency services delivery systems, the QIN model provides bilingual coaching staff (Spanish/English) as well as a contract for language access and translation in all languages other than Spanish/English. Implementation of the QIN is and will be provided through long standing community based organizations in the District well known to the public at large as supportive, multicultural, family -centered agencies. Quarterly provider meetings strategically provide a local networking opportunity for outreach within and between the community -based organizations, and for those that function as independent small businesses opportunities to learn from same language peers about child care licensing requirements is primary. In addition, cultural kinship, word of mouth at community centers and events, recruitment posters, OSSE sponsored events for parents and families, and OSSE sponsored professional development events for providers (field trips, arts integration and education programs) all entail multic ultural infusion to the interests and recruitment of new providers. OSSE is also recruiting through a career and technology program entitled First Step. The pilot program will be located in one high school in the District for 20 students who are interes ted in a career in early childhood. First Step is designed to build workforce capacity as high school students will graduate with six college credits and a stackable credential, the Child Development Associate Credential (CDA) that leads to employment and/ or higher education. 6.1.8 Describe how the S tate/Territory will recruit providers with limited English proficiency, or who will serve and be available for families with limited English proficiency. OSSE provides a grant to a community based organization that conduct s outreach and recruitment to attract culturally and linguistically diverse providers to become child care providers in their homes or in centers throughout the District. Coaching, technical assistance and mini grants are provided to ensure the District has a diverse pool of providers that are able to meet the needs of children and families . The Quality Improvement Network (QIN) also helps recruit multicultural professionals to the workforce and provides bilingual c oaching staff. 6.1.9 How will the Lead Agency overcome language barriers to serve providers with limited English proficiency?

DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT 6.3.3 Does the State/Territory use CCDF quality funds to improve on the development or implementation of early learning and development guidelines by providing techni cal assistance to child care providers to enhance children's cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and support children's overall well -being? Yes, the State/Territory has a system of technical assistance operating State/Territory - wide Yes, the State/Territory has a system of technical assistance but not State/Territory -wide No, but the State/Territory is in the development phase No, the State/Territo ry has no plans for development a) If yes, check all that apply to the technical assistance and describe. Child care providers are supported in developing and implementing curriculum/learning activities based on the State's/Territory's early learning and development guidelines. Describe OSSE provides Early Learning Standards training and technic al assistance (T/TA) for teachers and administrators. The T/TA is selected and prioritized based on data from a variety of sources including, but not limited to: community requests and workgroups, analysis of CLASS, ITERS, FCCERS and ECERS assessment data scores, Education Services Monitor program reports, licensing inspection reports, and Unusual Incident Reports. OSSE offers a range of professional learning experiences to enhance the infrastructure of professional development for providers including: Traditional Course offerings: The Early Learning Course Catalog is published quarterly and encompasses the foundation of the DC Common Core Early Learning Standards, as well as cross - sector targeted subject matter that is aligned with identified needs. The catalog selections range from basic to advanced learning opportunities in eleven core knowledge areas for professionals who work across different early care and education settings. Communities of Practice: Communities of Practice (CoP) are groups of peop le who share a concern or a passion for something they do, and actively learn how to do it better as they meet regularly and receive technical assistance and feedback. In the past two years OSSE has introduced CoPs around cutting edge topics in early chil dhood education including DC Early Mathematics Collaborative, Early Literacy, CLASS Dimensions and participation in the Science Education Leadership Cadre. Priority examples for the upcoming years are the Cradling Literacy (a birth to three early literacy initiative), a pre -K Language Learning and Early Literacy program, and the Program Administration Scales (a program management tool for self- assessment ). DC Early Learning Standards 301 - Field Trip Fridays: These hands on learning opportunities are planned throughout the fiscal year and provide an opportunity for teachers, administrators, DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 139 coaches, and family child care home providers to explore the Early Learning Standards through hands -on activities; collaborate and network with their peers and colleagues; and avail themselves of free cultural and educational resources in the District. PD On -Demand/On -site: OSSE will provide extensive on -site technical assistance and site -based trainings on the DC CCELS to the community during the months of December, Januar y, and February. PD Coaching and Technical Assistance: The Division of Early Learning supports technical assistance through the coaching for classroom teachers, and coaching for the Early Head Start Child Care Partnerships centers and family child developm ent homes. PD Campaign Initiatives: OSSE participates in the development of an annual conference, and supports the workforce through high profile campaign topics designed to expedite awareness and behavior change. This strategy is responsive and used to m ove the work force toward career pathways and targeted areas of interest. Also, it is the means for T/TA and fast -track implementation of best practice. In some cases, topic choice relates to local emergent needs, as well as national awareness campaigns su ch as: 1) Early Head Start, and routines and relationship -based care of infants and toddler age children and parents, and 2) family and community engagement . The technical assistance is linked to the State's/Territory's quality rating and improvement syste m. Describe Child care providers working with infants and/or toddlers have access to the technical assistance for developing and implementing early learning and development guidelines. OSSE has supported and sustained infant and toddler quality improv ement initiatives using a technical assistance coaching support system and is currently working with technical assistance providers and other key stakeholders to develop a state- based coaching model that will support early learning professionals in improving their practice. The Early Head Start (EHS) Child Care Partnerships QIN provides continuous, intensive coaching with teacher/provider staff to ensure fully compliant programs, enhance competency, while implementing the comprehensive EHS framework with all partnering programs. QIN partner programs currently receive coaching on PITC pedagogy, reducing risks while promoting health and safety, and utilizing data assessment to inform positive changes and best practices. OSSE provides technical assistance o n understanding and using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) data for Infants and Toddlers to improve program quality. Data engagement meetings support program leaders in learning more about the CLASS data and how to use it to improve outcomes for children. Program leaders are given their program and classroom level reports on the CLASS observation prior to the data engagement meeting. During the meeting, program leaders ask specific questions based on the information in their program/class le vel reports. The information exchange assists attendees in effectively using their data. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 140 Addtionally, OSSE Education Services Monitors and professional development staff are certified PITC traininers and use the knowledge and information to provide techn ical assistance to child development centers and homes. Child care providers working with preschool -age children have access to the technical assistance for developing and implementing early learning and development guidelines. Describe Professional d evelopment offerings in the DC Early Learning Foundations Catalog - entitled DC Common Core Early Learning Standards 101, 201, and 301 - are provided with intentional scaffolding and immerse early care professionals, teachers, administrators, coaches and specialists in the continuum of learning. Through these offerings, they gain a thorough understanding of the early development that is expected of all young children (from birth through exit from pre -Kindergarten). The implementation of technical assistanc e through an early literacy community of practice (CoP), introduced in 2013, exemplifies a move to center -based, side by side observations, and incorporates feedback sessions and a coaching model. This investment was well- received by the District's early l earning professionals. The DC CCELS 301 is a hands -on training that provides strongly integrated teaching for coaches, family child home providers, teachers, and administrators. Additionally, partnerships between OSSE and community experts on the arts and sciences include hands -on technical assistance with teachers and family child care home providers, incorporating active engagement with STEM, arts integration, early mathematics and early literacy immersion experiences to comprehensively support school re adiness for young children . Child care providers working with school -age children have access to the technical assistance for developing and implementing early learning and development guidelines. Describe Child care providers working with school- age chi ldren and out of school time programs have full access to the Early Learning Foundations Catalog offerings and, specifically, the DC CCELS 101, 201 and 301 training opportunities offered each month in English (and four times annually in Spanish). Indicate which funds are used for this activity (check all that apply) CCDF funds. CCDF Discretionary funds will be used to support the professional development system, communities of practice and supports for continuous quality improvement. Other funds. 6.3.4 Check to demonstrate that State /Territory assures that CCDF funds will not be used to develop or implement an assessment for children that: ( 658E(c)(2)(T)(ii)(I)) Will be the primary or sole basis to determine a child care provider ineligible to participate in the CCDF program DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 141 Will be used as the primary or sole basis to provide a reward or sanction for an individual provider Will be used as the primary or sole method for assessing effec tiveness of child care programs 7 Support Continuous Qua lity Improvement Lead Agencies are required to reserve and use a portion of their Child Care and Development Block Grant funds for activities designed to improve the quality of child care services and increase parental options for, and access to, high -qual ity child care. States/ Territories may provide these quality improvement activities directly, or through grants or contracts with local child care resource and referral organizations or other appropriate entities. The activities should be in alignment with a State /Territory -wide assessment of the State's/Territory's needs to carry out such services and care. States and Territories will report on these quality investments in three ways. ACF will collect annual data on how much CCDF funding is spent on qualit y activities using the expenditure report (ACF -696) . In the Plan, States and Territories will describe the types of activities supported by quality investments over the three- year period. For each three -year Plan period, States and Territories will submit a separate annual report that will show the measures used by the State/Territory to evaluate its progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in the State /Territory . The CCDBG Act of 2014 requires States and Territories to use the quality set -aside to fund at least one of the following 10 activities: 1) Supporting the training and professional development of the child care workforce (as describe d in Section 6) 2) Improving on the development or implementation of early learning and develop ment guidelines (as describe d in Section 6) 3) Developing, implementing, or enhancing a tiered quality rating system for child care providers and services 4) Improving the supply and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers 5) Establishing or expanding a Statewide system of child care resource and referral services (as described Section 1) 6) Supporting compliance with State/Territory requirements for licensing, inspection, monitoring, training, and health and safety (as described in Section 5) 7) Evaluating the quality of child care programs in the State/Territory, including evaluating how programs positively impact children 8) Supporting providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 142 9) Supporting the development or adoption of high -quality pro gram standards related to health, mental health, nutrition, physical activity , and physical development 10) Other activities to improve the quality of child care services as long as outcome measures relating to improved provider preparedness, child safety, chi ld well- being, or kindergarten -entry are possible. Throughout this Plan, States and Territories will describe the types of quality improvement activities where CCDF investments are being made, including but not limited to, the quality set - aside funds. We r ecognize that for some areas, States and Territories may leverage other funds to support the quality improvement goals, which we encourage and support. For example, activities related to early learning and development guidelines may be supported by a combi nation of CCDF and education funding. States and Territories continue to have such flexibility. 7.1 Activities to Improve the Quality of Child Care Services 7.1.1 What are your overarching goals for quality improvement ? Please describe how the State/Territory selec ted these goals , including any data or the State/Territory -wide assessment of needs that identified the needs for quality improvement services . The District's early learning strategic plan was established by the SECDCC and focuses on building a comprehen sive early learning and development system that integrates and aligns policies, services and programs in pursuit of better outcomes for the District's youngest children, particularly children who face multiple risk factors to their learning and development . The following goals drive the District's system building work: All District children , birth through age 8 will develop in comprehensive and enriching environments. All families of children, birth through age 8, are linked to opportunities and resource s that strengthen their role as parents. Professionals working with young children have the knowledge, skills, and supports to work effectively with and on behalf of children and families. All communities (neighborhoods in all Wards of the District of Co lumbia) are safe places where resources are available to help children and families thrive. As a result of these shared goals and our strategic approach, the District will realize the following outcomes: Significant decrease in the school readiness gap and the academic achievement between populations of children. Improved knowledge and practice of nurturing behaviors, parenting, nutrition and wellness among families and early childhood professionals. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 143 Increased number of environments, including but not li mited to early childhood and development settings, providing early identification, intervention, supports, and mental health consultation. Increased number of children who live in safe, stable, and supportive families. Increased number of children receiving developmental screens in a timely manner, including Medicaid -eligible children who will receive EPSDT screening on a periodicity schedule that meets the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics Improved access for families to information ab out high -quality early childhood and development settings for their children. Increased number of early childhood professionals that have a clearly articulated path that is inclusive of teacher preparation programs for career advancement and aligns with t he Workforce Knowledge and Competency Framework. Increased number of neighborhood clusters that have access to high -quality early childhood development programs. The SECDCC 's early learning plan includes six key strategies to advance our goals and achiev e outcomes for children, families, professionals and communities: Enhance the District's Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS), Going for the Gold. Currently, the District's QRIS only applies to providers in the subsidy system. By revising its QRI S, the District will have a common method for assessing and communicating the level of quality in ALL publicly funded early care and education programs for children birth to age five. Expand Infant & Toddler Capacity and Quality. The District's universal pre-K program for all three- and four -year old children has resulted in dramatic increases in the participation of children with high needs in high quality pre -k.1 The District must now shift to increasing the availability and quality of programs serving infants and toddlers with the same sense of urgency and intentionality it had when it achieved its status as the nation's leader in public pre -k. Over the last three years, the District has invested nearly $18 million in new investments to build the supply of high quality infant and toddler child care for families who can least afford it. These resources have been targeted to increase the reimbursement rates to providers serving infants and toddlers in our child care subsidy program and improve child care f acilities to expand the supply of infant and toddler child care in the District by an additional 200 slots. Create Health and Early Childhood Education Linkages: The District has one of the highest rates of insured children in the country; as such the health care system is a critical partner in addressing the health, behavioral health and developmental needs of children in order to improve school readiness and later school success. In fact, during the infant and toddler years, 1 See LEARNDC for the 2015 Annual Pre -k report and for an archive of previous reports. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 144 child health practitioners often represent the only professional seeing the child and therefore are in a position to identify and respond to developmental concerns. There is a growing base of innovative practices and an emerging field of research and knowledge on the efficacy of early childhood primary care practice interventions that support school readiness goals, particularly when health practitioners are linked to early learning and development programs. Implement Pre -K to 3rd Grade Approaches. With universal access to pre -K, the District's public education system is truly a P -12, rather than a K -12 system - with the great majority of pre -k programs being delivered within elementary schools. As such, the District is poised to ensure that children's gains made in pre -K are sust ained in the K -3 grades in order to close the achievement gap. Research shows that intentional efforts must be implemented to promote pre-K to 3rd grade continuity. Improving our structure of school accountability to more explicitly incorporate children's progress during these critical years is essential. Develop and Utilize a Comprehensive Early Childhood Data System. The District will build on the foundation of our existing State Longitu dinal Education Data system (SLED) and the District of Columbia Access System (DCAS) to develop, manage and use data to improve the quality of the District's birth to five system and look at children's progress and outcomes over time. Using a common identifier, the data system will integrate data across multiple state departments and agencies including health, human services, education, and health care finance where appropriate. Using data in SLED and DCAS, the District will regularly generate information that is timely, rele vant, and access ible. Policymakers, early le arning and development programs and early childhood educators will use this data to continuously improve, make key decisions, and inform s parents and other community stakeholders about the status of early learning in the District . Produce citywide and neighborhood level school readiness data and maps. The District will implement the Early Development Instrument (EDI), a valid and reliable school readiness measure, in all pre-K 4 classrooms every three years. The EDI maps and data will represent childr en's health and development across multiple domains, overlaid with other data including risk factors and community assets. The EDI data will allow the District to make evidence -based decisions when targeting early childhood resources, conducting strategic planning (both internal and external to government), and tracking the impact of early learning policies and investments on child outcomes over time. 7.1.2 Check and describe which of the following specified quality improvement activities the State /Territory is investing in : Developing, implementing or enhancing a tiered quality rating system .

Describe . 7.2.2. Describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State/Territory will use to evaluate the State /Territory 's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in the State /Territory . The current Quality Rating System, Going for the Gold, is a tiered rate reimbursement system based on accreditation. T he purpose of this system is as follows: to identify and reward programs that attain accreditation improve the quality of child care in the District of Columbia encourage prov iders to participate in the subsidy system increase compensation for exceptional programs provide a vehicle for families to access information regarding high quality care for children. Although the \"Going for the Gold\" fulfilled most of the intended purp oses, a need to enhance and expand the current system was identified after the Pre -K Act was enacted and a three sector system of service delivery , DC Public Schools, public charter schools and community based organizations, was codified. DC's enhanced QRI S will provide a common measure of quality that will inform consumers and help target investments and planning across all three systems . The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) has devoted significant time to developing an enhanced QR IS. OSSE contracted with the BUILD Initiative and engaged the National Center on Quality in support of this work over the past two years . The enhanced QRIS is outcome focused and will be piloted in 2016 with the goal to begin full implementation in 2017. The framework includes Learning Environment, I n- seat Attendance (pre -K only), Child Outcomes and Continuous Quality Improvement. DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 149 7.3 Improving the S upply and Quality of C hild Care Programs and S ervices for Infants and T oddlers The CCDBG Act of 2014 included changes targeted at improving the supply and quality of infant - toddler care. Lead Agencies are encouraged to systematically assess and improve the overall quality of care infants and toddlers receive, the systems in place or needed to support and enhance the quality of infant and toddler providers and the capacity of the infant and toddler workforce to meet the unique needs of very young children, and the methods in place to increase the proportion of infants and toddlers in higher quality care. 7.3.1 What activities are being implemented by the State/ Territory to improve the supply and quality of child care programs and services for infants and toddlers ? Check all that apply and describe. Establishing or expanding high- quality community or neighborhood- based family and child development centers, which may serve as resources to child care providers in order to improve the quality of early childhood services provided to infants and toddlers from low-income families and to help eligible child care providers impro ve their capacity to offer high -quality, age -appropriate care to infants and toddlers from low -income families . Describe. The Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) received one of seven state level Early Head Start -Child Care (EHS -CC) Par tnership grants to provide high quality, comprehensive, early childhood development services to at -risk children in Wards 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8; the W ards demonstrating the most need and which have the highest at- risk populations. Through this initiative, O SSE developed a community -based Quality Improvement Networks (QIN) comprised of three neighborhood -based hubs that are responsible for providing comprehensive services and quality impro vement technical assistance to a network of child development centers a nd child development homes. These centers and homes have agreed to meet Early Head Start Program Performance Standards. All services will be full -day, minimum of 10.5 hours a day and full -year, at least 48 weeks. At least 50 percent of the project's enroll ment will be EHS -eligible children, and 100 percent of enrolled children will receive child care subsidies. This initiative will increase the supply of high -quality infant and toddler care in the District and supplement and enhance the quality of services provided to all children enrolled in the child care partner sites . As the first phase in a five -year program, the combined funding comprised of locally appropriate funds and federal assistance will provide high quality, comprehensive, infant and toddler de velopment services to 200 EHS -eligible children and reach a total of 4 40 low -income children in EHS -CC Partnership slots in the first year of the grant. The project will add child care capacity in the District by allowing existing child care providers that are selected to participate in the networks (Partner Sites) to convert existing child care subsidy slots to or add new EHS -CC partnership slots based on the physical capacity of the site and community needs. Federal funding covers technical assistance to enhance quality and instructional coaching for infant/toddler teachers in partner sites. Local funding will support the DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 150 provision of comprehensive services. The QIN will ensure more infants and toddlers and their families benefit from early, continuous, in tensive, and comprehensive child development and family support services meeting EHS standards. In addition to enhancing existing subsidy slots through this initiative, the District will add 1,000 new slots for infants and toddlers with local funding and c reate additional neighborhood -based QINs over the next five years Establishing or expanding the operation of community or neighborhood -based family child care networks . Describe. As part of the Quality Improvement Network (QIN), OSSE awarded a grant to a community based organization to serve as a hub and provide technical assistance and training and coordinate comprehensive services for a network of child development homes that primarily serve infants and toddlers. The hub agency supports ten child development home providers and continues to recruit home providers out of its existing partnerships established through the Licensing and Technical Assistance grant from OSSE. The hub is supporting the network in achieving Early Head Start quality in their p rograms. The hub provide s continuous job embedded professional development and coaching to the staff, comprehensive services, health services, support in nutrition and wellness, as well as support to engage families in the programs . Providing training and professional development to promot e and expand child care providers' ability to provide developmentally appropriate services for infants and toddlers . The QIN coaches and infant and toddler specialists are trained in the PITC coaching model and provide w eekly coaching and support to infant and toddler teachers. Providing coaching and/or technical assistance on this age group's unique needs from Statewide networks of qualified infant -toddler specialists . Describe. The District provides ongoing profess ional development opportunities for infant and toddler professionals. In FY15, the district conducted over 150 professional development trainings specific to infant and toddler teachers and administrators free of charge. The District also has approximate ly 100 OSSE approved professional development trainers that are certified in the infant and toddler development content area. Below are some of the infant and t oddler trainings that are offered annually: Social and Emotional Foundations of Early Learning (based off of CSEFEL); The DC Common Core Early Learning Standards; Addressing the Impact of Parental Incarceration on Children, Families, Schools and Communities; Preventing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome; Diapering A to Z; CLASS Trainings specifically fo r Infants and Toddlers; Stewards of Children; Adult and Pediatric First Aid; Nutrition for infants and Toddlers; Intentional Lesson Planning; Ages and Stages Questionnaire; Infants and Toddlers: Early Brain Development, Learning, and Mental Health; DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 151 Coord inating with early intervention specialists who provide services for infants and todd lers with disabilities under part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) The OSSE is the lead agency for the District's Early Interv ention (Part C) Program (DCEIP). The mission of the DC Early Intervention Program is to identify and serve infants and toddlers, birth through two (2) years, with developmental delays and disabilities and their families. As the single point of entry for infants and toddlers with suspected developmental delays an d disabilities from birth to the third birthday, DC EIP identifies and evaluates infants and toddlers with suspected developmental delays and provides high quality, age appropriate early interventi on services for eligible infants/toddlers and their families. DC EIP coordinates services in a caring manner that supports the culture an d meets the needs of families. OSSE incorporates the requirements under IDEA, Part C - Comprehensive System of Personne l Development (CSPD); monitoring and compliance; fiscal oversight; training and technical assistance; data collection and reporting; public awareness; procedural safeguards and policy development. In its overall administration of its early education and ca re prgrams, DCEIP maintains both in -house and contracted staff to provide child find; evaluation/assessments; direct early intervention services; and service coordination. DC EIP serves approximately 750 children and their families per year. Developing in fant and toddler components within the State's/Territory's QRIS . Describe. Developing infant and toddler components within the State /Territory 's child care licensing regulations . The licensing regulation s have standards that are specific to Infants and toddlers. Some examples include ratio, group size, indoor program space requirements, and general furnishing, food and nutrition, equipment and supplies requirements . Developing infant and toddler components within the early learning and development gu idelines . In a response to the evolution of the standards movement in early childhood education, the District of Columbia revised its early learning standard in 2012. The revised standard s have a continuum of learning and development expected of all young children from birth through third grade. They include alignment with the Common Core Standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics. They are also aligned with the Head Start Child Development and Early Learning Framework, thus ensuring that all child ren will receive the same standards -based instruction regardless of program.

Percentage of licensing staff completing competency -based training and staff development . DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 154 Results of provider surveys on the quality of monitoring visits and their satisfaction with the quality of available resources Number of provider trainings conducted and percentage of providers attending sessions 7.6 Evaluating and Assessing the Quality and Effectiveness of Child Care Programs and Services 7.6.1 One of the p urposes of the CCDBG Act of 2014 is to increase the number and percentage of low- income children in high -quality child care settings. Describe how the State/Territory measures the quality and effectiveness of child care programs and services offered in the State /Territory , including any tools used to measure child, family, teacher, classroom, or provider improvements, and how the State/Territory evaluat es how such programs positively impact children The District primarily relies on the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) as our measure of quality. In 2015, the District conducted CLASS observations in every preschool classroom receiving CCDF funds. Additionally, 209 infant and toddler classrooms that receive CCDF funds were also assessed using the CL ASS Infant and the CLASS toddler. The Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale -Revised (FCCERS -R) and the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale -Revised (ITERS -R) are also used to measure the quality of child care programs. OSSE will use the Early Deve lopment Instrument, a population based measure of school readiness to measure improvements in child outcomes. 7.6.2 Describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State/Territory will use to evaluate the State /Territory 's progress in improving the qua lity of child care programs and services in the State /Territory The following are a description of instruments used for program quality evaluation, teacher effectiveness observation and student outcome evaluation. 1) Program Quality Evaluation a. ITERS -R (Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale - Revised Edition) is an observation instrument designed to assess programs for children from birth to 30 months of age. It measures spatial, programmatic, and interpersonal features of the program environment. ITERS -R has 39 items that are organized into seven subscales: 1) Space and Furnishings , 2) Personal Care Routines , 3) Listening and Talking , 4) Activities , 5) Interaction , 6) Program Structure , and 7) Parents and Staff. Scoring of this instrument ranges from 1 (inadequate), 4 (minimal), and 7 (excellent). b. FCCERS -R (Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale - Revised Edition ) is an observation instrument designed to assess family child care programs conducted in a provider's home for children from infancy through school - age. It measures spatial, programmatic, and interpersonal features of the program environment. This instrument contains 37 items and seven subscales: 1) Space and Furnishings, 2) Personal Care Routines, 3) Listening and Talking, 4) Activities, 5) I nteraction, 6) Program Structure, and 7) DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 155 Parents and Provider and contains 43 items. Scoring of this instrument ranges from 1 (inadequate), 4 (minimal), and 7 (excellent). 2) Teacher Effectiveness Evaluation a. CLASS Pre -k: The CLASS Pre -K has nine subscales to assess classroom quality in terms of emotional and instructional climate and quality of teacher- child interactions, which includes classroom management and instructional supports for learning. Each subscale is rated on a 7 -point scale ranging from 1 or 2 (classroom is low on that dimension) to 6 or 7 (classroom is high on that dimension). b. CLASS Infant (CLASS -I): The CLASS -I includes one (1) broad domain of Responsive Caregiving and four (4) dimensions. In CLASS -I, Responsive Caregiving refers to specific teaching behaviors that include participation in shared experiences and play; attending quickly to infants' cues and needs; following infants' leads and expanding on them; monitoring infants' behavior and sounds; and engaging in back and forth communication exchanges. Responsive Caregiving acknowledges that infants each have their own preferences, interests, and needs. Teachers are more effective when they pay careful attention to infants as individuals and respond in a way that will best meet each infant's particular needs. This responsive Caregiving builds a foundation of trust and security and supports infants as they learn about and explore the world around them. c. CLASS Toddler (C LASS -T): The CLASS -T describes two (2) domains of Emotional and Behavioral Support and Engaged Support for Learning and eight (8) dimensions of teacher -child interactions that support children's learning and development. In CLASS -T, Emotional and Behavioral Support refers to specific teaching and behaviors that help children develop warm, supportive relationships, experience enjoyment and excitement about learning, feel comfortable in the classroom, experience appropriate levels of autonomy or independence , develop behavioral regulation, meet behavioral expectations, and fully participate in classroom activities. Engaged Support for Learning refers to specific teaching behaviors that include the facilitation of activities that enhance children's thinking, reasoning, and verbal skills, build their knowledge of the world, and encourage persistence, attention, and motivation. 3) Student Outcome Evaluation a. The Early Development Instrument (EDI) tool is an assessment that provides a population based measure of how young children are developing in neighborhoods in the United States. This information can be useful in improving policies, as well as, allocating resources and community level strategies to improve school readiness for children birth to 5 years old. The i nformation from EDI benefits teachers, schools, & communities in a variety of ways: a. Provides a community measure of school readiness that can be used to look back and assess how the early childhood community can better prepare children for school, as well as, look forward to inform how to address the needs of the incoming class of kindergarten students DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 156 b. Helps forge partnerships between schools and the broader community of early childhood stakeholders 7.7 Accreditation Support 7.7.1 Does the State/Territory suppor t child care providers in the voluntary pursuit of accreditation by a national accrediting body with demonstrated, valid, and reliable program standards of high quality? Yes, the State/Territory has supports operating State/Territory -wide Yes, the State/Territory has supports operating as a pilot or in a few localities but not State/Territory -wide No, but the State/Territory is in the development phase . No, the State/Territo ry has no plans for development If yes, identify all types of accreditat ion the State/Territory supports child care providers in achieving. 7.7.2 Describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State/Territory will use to evaluate the State/Territory's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and serv ices in the State/Territory 7.8 Program Standards 7.8.1 What other State /Territory or local efforts, if any, is the State/Territory supporting to develop or adopt high -quality program standards relating to health, mental health, nutrition, physical activity, and phy sical development? Please describe: The District has proposed new licensing regulations that incorporate key components of the Caring for Our Children Standards. This work has been funded through the Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems Grant through th e Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Additionally, with the passage of the District of Columbia's Healthy Tots Act (HTA) in 2014 , child development programs serving more than 50 percent children eligible for subsidy are required to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program . The HTA provides an additional enhancement to each meal as an incentive and o utlines standards for physical health and well -being. 7.8.2 Describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State/Territory will use to evaluate t he State /Territory 's progress in improving the quality of child care programs and services in the State /Territory Number of centers enrolled in CACFP CACFP monitoring Visits Licensing inspections Enhanced QRIS - continuous quality improvement DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 157 7.9 Other Qua lity Improvement Activities 7.9.1 List and describe any other activities the State/Territory provides to improve the quality of child care services and describe the measures relevant to this activity that the State /Territory will use to evaluate the State/Territ ory's progress in improving provider preparedness, child safety, child well- being, or entry into kindergarten . OSSE will partner with the Department of Behavioral Health to expand research -based mental health consultation to child development centers and homes. Children will be measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Deveraux Early Childhood Assessment. Teachers will have the opportunity to reflect on their own practice and will receive coaching support. 8 Ensure Grantee Program I ntegrity and Accountability Under CCDF, program integrity and accountability activities are grounded in S tate/Territory 's policies for implementing the CCDF program. For error rate activities, reviews are based on the State/Territory 's own CCDF policies. The CCDBG Act of 2014 made sweeping changes to the program requirements. With these changes, the State/Territory has an opportunity to change their own policies to reduce the burden for participants and staff as they build in safeguards to maintain program integrity. For example, the new law focuses on eligibility requirements at the time of eligibility determination and allows for a 12 -month period of eligibility before redetermination , which lessens the need for participants to continually provide documen tation . This , in turn , relieves the State/Territory from the burden of constantly \"checking\" on participants which can open the door for miscalculations, lost paperwork, and other errors. Lead Agencies are required to have accountability measures in place to ensure integrity and to identify fraud or other program violations. These accountability measures should address administrative error, including unintentional agency error, as well as program violations, both unintentional and intentional. Violations may or may not result in further action by the Lead Agency, including those cases suspected of and/or prosecuted for fraud. 8.1 Program Integrity 8.1.1 Describe how the State /Territory ensures that their definitions for violations have been modified, and program integ rity procedures revised to reflect new requirements. OSSE has hosted a number of Town Hall Meetings to share information on the reauthorization of the child care development fund block grant regulations. These meetings will con tinue through March 2016 to ensure that all community partners both public and private are informed of all aspects of the regulations and policy changes. Additional steps will include: Streamline and simplify current eligibility policies and procedures Regular training for ag ency staff and child care partners Monitor for compliance DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 158 OSSE is working with national and local experts to revis e current eligibility and licensing policies to align with new The CCDBG Act of 2014 to ensure program accountability and fraud reduction . 8.1.2 Describe how th e State/Territory ensures that all staff are informed and trained regarding changes made to its policies and procedures to reflect new CCDF requirements. Check all that apply. Issue policy change notices Issue new pol icy manual Staff training Orientations Onsite training Online training Regular check -ins to monitor implementation of the new policies. Describe OSSE conduct s regular feedback sessions with staff and providers to ensure full implementation of all policy changes . Other. Describe 8.1.3 Describe the processes the Lead Agency will use to monitor all sub -recipients , including those described in Section 1 such as licensing agencies, child care resource and referral agencies, and others with a role in adm inistering CCDF . The Lead Agency is responsible for ensuring effective internal controls over the administration of CCDF funds. Lead Agencies that use other governmental or non -governmental sub -recipients to administer the program must have written agreeme nts in place outlining roles and responsibilities for meeting CCDF requirements. Definition : \"Subrecipient means a non -Federal entity that receives a subaward from a pass - through entity to carry out part of a Federal program; but does not include an indiv idual that is a beneficiary of such program. A subrecipient may also be a recipient of other Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency (2 CFR 200.93).Two CFR Part 200, Subpart A provides additional information on contractors (which may be refe rred to as \"vendors\").The description of monitoring must include, but is not limited to, a description of the written agreements used, a schedule for completing the tasks, a budget which itemizes categorical expenditures consistent with CCDF requirements a nd indicators or measures to assess performance. Additional items for discussion may include: fiscal management, review of policies and procedures to ensure compliance with CCDF regulations, and monitoring/auditing contractors or grantees to ensure that el igible children are served and eligibility documentation is verified.\" OSSE monitors all CCDF sub-recipients. Written grant agreements or contracts are in place for all sub -contractors and/or sub -grantees that include deliverables and a detailed scope of work to ensure compliance with all federal and District laws, policies and regulations . OSSE requires all sub -recipients to participate in a post award conference that includes a review of all o f OSSE's financial and programmatic policies and procedures a s well as OMB circulars. OSSE's grants management unit hosts an annual conference for all sub -recipients. OSSE conducts annual onsite monitoring visits and program evaluations to all sub -recipients. Each program maintains records on file for a minimum pe riod of three years. These records DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 159 must be accessible at all times for review upon request by officials from the District of Columbia Government or the Federal Government. All on -site visits support efforts to maintain quality and ensure compliance with O SSE agreements, grants, MO U's, annual renewal issuances, OSSE 's quality tier reimbursement criteria, OSSE's internal policies and procedures, and the District's and CCDF regulations . OSSE has implemented the Enterprise Grants Management System (EGMS). The s ystem was designed to improve the management and administration of federal and local grants managed by OSSE. EGMS provides users with information on the status of project applications and awards of federal and state funds. EGMS offers grantees more conven ience with a centralized location to manage the following: Identify and apply to OSSE grants; Track milestones of the sub -recipient's grant from start to finish; and Submit electronic r eimbursem ent requests . The system has enhanced operational efficiencies, security arch itecture, central data storage and warehousing, increased transparency, workflow automation and performance accountability. OSSE's grants management and program staff review monthly invoices in EGMS to determine that all expenses are aligned with the grant ees' scope of work and approved budget. In addition, mid-and-year end reports are submitted to OSSE. These reports, along with onsite monitoring, provide a thorough review of the grantee's compliance with OSSE's approved work plan, budget, and performance go als. If corrective action is needed, grant monitors, along with the grantee, develop quality improvement plans to support compliance with the grant requirements . Fiscal Monitoring OSSE sub-recipients expending $ 750,000 or more annually in federal funds mus t comply with the Federal Office of Management and Budget OMB - A133 Single Audit requirements for non - profit organizations and the Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards' (GAGAS) which are the guidelines for the annual audit required by all for- profit organizations in receipt of $750,000 or more in federal funds. These organizations must submit an Independent Auditor's Report with the financial opinion of a Certified Public Accountant. Sub -recipients with income and revenues less than $ 750,000 annually must submit a financial review as conducted by a Certified Public Accountant with the corresponding notes and letter of opinion. Both financial reviews and audits must be conducted annually and should be submitted no later than nine months follow ing the close of the provider's fiscal year. Sub-recipients are required to submit monthly invoices that align with an OSSE approved budget. Sub-recipients that fail to comply with the terms of their grant will be required to return funds and will be barre d from participating in CCDF funded programs for a minimal of one year. Monitoring Licensing DC Draft CCDF Preprint for Public Comment DRAFT CCDF PREPRINT 160 The OSSE Child Care Licensing and Compliance Unit inspect all licensed child development facilities at least twice per year to ensure compliance with health and safety regulation s as outlined in DCMR 29 and in the CCDF Plan. Monitoring of the Monthly Attendance The Education Service Monitor shall in any instance where there is evidence that the provider has submitted fraudulent documentation with the intention o f obtaining payment from the District of Columbia, OSSE shall exercise the right to terminate the Child Care Subsidy Agreement for non -compliance and shall refer suspected cases of waste and fraud for investigation to OSSE's General Council and/or the Dist rict of Columbia's Office of the Inspector General and request termination of the agreement. When a provider has been terminated due to substantiated instance of fraud a provider will be designated as an Excluded Party pursuant to DC Code 2 -308.04 and the provider cannot solicit any contract with the District of Columbia Government for a period of thirty -six (36) months. Attendance is collected monthly and processed by the Attendance Coordinators. Attendance records may be audited at any time that discrep ancies are suspected. When underpayments or overpayments are suspected, the Education Services Monitor conduct reviews of the attendance by collecting recent pay statements and attendance reports along with the facility's attendance roster and reconciles and compares these documents for errors, underpayments, overpayments or errors in names, services provided, start date or termination date, excused or unexcused absences and number of days served. The Education Services Monitor discuss all findings with th e provider. In cases where there are substantial errors with the attendance the OSSE may impose sanctions such as Stop Placement Status or implement a corrective action plan. All suspected cases of fraud are forwarded to the OSSE's Office of the General Council. Eligibility Monitoring OSSE 's Child Care Eligibility Monitoring Unit has the primary responsibility to monitor all eligibility determinations completed by intake/eligibility workers at the DC's Department of Human Services/Child Care Servic e Division and the Community Based Level II Provider sites. Level II providers are community based organizations and sub -recipients that have agreements with OSSE to complete on -site eligibility determinations for their programs only. Eligibility records are selected for review to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information used in the eligibility determination process. A percentage of applications processed by Level II eligibility workers are monitored on an annual basis. To ensure timely eligibility redetermination, the Child Care Eligibility Monitoring Unit shares pending eligibility determination statistical report s monthly with the Level II Providers. After annual monitoring visits the Annual Eligibility Assessment Review Report of findings with expected corrective actions is issued and is share with Level II providers and DHS/CCSD. The Child Care Eligibility Monitor conducts follow up visits to verify that the corrective actions have been completed, if needed. 8.1.4 Describe the activities t he Lead Agency has in place to identify program violations and administrative error to ensure program integrity using the series of questions below. Program violations may include intentional and unintentional client and/or provider violations as defined b y the Lead Agency.
