Published | 4 min read The HPV vaccine is most effective when children take it before they reach a sexually active age, for protection later in life. Learn more about the virus and the vaccine to make an informed decision. The HPV vaccine or human papillomavirus vaccine is ideally administered before a child reaches a sexually active age to prevent the infection and spread of HPV. Governments and public health institutions usually recommend children get it before puberty as it works best before they might be exposed to the virus. HPV is a group of over 100 types of viruses. These viruses can cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth, and throat. It's also responsible for genital warts. Here are more facts about the vaccine and whether your child should take it. What Is the HPV Vaccine For? You could have contracted HPV at some point in your life and not even know it, as your body can fight the infection on its own. However, in some people, the infection will cause abnormal tissue growth, some of which can lead to cancer. If you have HPV, symptoms don't often show. Because of this, the virus is easily spread, usually through sexual contact. The HPV vaccine can help prevent infection and spread. Vaccinated people are less likely to fall ill even if infected. They are also less likely to infect their sexual partner. Of course, it's important to practice other safe sex practices, such as using condoms. Who Should Get the HPV Vaccine? The World Health Organization's (WHO) most recent recommendations as of December 2022 are: - A two-dose vaccine for girls and boys nine to 14 years old - A three-dose vaccine for girls, women, boys, and men 15 to 26 years old WHO considers girls as the primary target for vaccination. The secondary vaccination targets include boys and older women. What Is the TCM Perspective on HPV and the HPV vaccine?
