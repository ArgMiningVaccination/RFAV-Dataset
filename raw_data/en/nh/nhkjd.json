Gemstone Elixirs, derived from crystals as \"mineral\" medicine, can be traced back to the Han Dynasty (206 BCE) as a form of Taoist alchemy.

Gemstone Elixirs can help you discover your inner gifts, understand your life purpose, find a stronger sense of self, restore your self-worth, release negativity, release unconscious fears, strengthen the body's own chemical repair system, and be a direct path to healing. As we commit to love ourselves (flawed and beautiful), to heal our pasts and change our negative thoughts and behaviors, the effects we see are positive changes, better mental health, overflowing well-being and abundance of laughter and joy.
