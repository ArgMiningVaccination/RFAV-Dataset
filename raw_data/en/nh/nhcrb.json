We've got answers. Most of the medical world follows what are referred to as 'general guidelines' based on statistics to provide diagnoses and treatments that work for the majority of people. We created a proprietary DNA kit that reports on specific genetic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that our physicians have hand-selected based on their importance to health, wellness, and human potential. These SNPs affect blood vessels, nutrient absorption, nerve function, performance, fatigue, and many other functions. Our approach requires us to focus first on the entire system, so we start with your DNA. We sequence your DNA to analyze the genetic advantages, predispositions, and disadvantages that make up your human operating system. Knowing this code is critical to personalizing a plan to optimize your health. We ONLY share information with whomever the patient tells us. If an insurance company requests medical records, we contact the patient to authorize the release. In 2008, Congress passed the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) to prevent the unauthorized release of information. You can read more about that [HERE](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1073110518804243?journalCode=lmec).

Most of the medical world follows what are referred to as 'general guidelines' based on statistics to provide diagnoses and treatments that work for the majority of people. In Precision Medicine, we start with your DNA and an extensive lab panel (if purchased) to get a holistic picture of your health. With your results, we review genetic factors unique to you, as well as personalized interventions to turn certain genes on or off - we can turn \"on\" your good genes with certain lifestyle choices. We combine all of this into a personalized health plan just for you. Yes - we accept both HSA and FSA cards. It is important to note that we always recommend that our patients reach out to these entities directly, as guidelines vary. Wild Health has a partnership with Thorne supplements, in turn offering all of our patients a 25% discount on their products. We work very closely with Thorne and trust their process and standards, so we feel comfortable recommending them to patients. Your Health Coach, in partnership with your Physician, will discuss which supplements are best for you. "}
