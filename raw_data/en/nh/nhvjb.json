This document will act as a ready reference to answer questions that may arise during the course of a death investigation. It is not intended to be comprehensive. The mission of the Tennessee Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner (OSCME), operating under the Department of Health, is to create statewide consistency of high quality medi colegal death investigation and forensic autopsy services. The purpose of the office is to serve its fellow citizens by protecting the public's health and safety, participating in the criminal justice system and providing data for vital statistics. Tenn essee has a mixed medical examiner system of death investigation with the state office primarily responsible for providing guidelines and training for the county medical examiners and their investigators and collecting and maintaining records of deaths inv estigated. County medical examiners, along with their investigators are responsible for conducting death investigations in coordination with various professionals and providing an opinion as to the cause and manner of death. Five regional forensic center s provide forensic autopsy services for the county medical examiners. County medical examiners are uniquely qualified to investigate the deaths of individual citizens in their counties, not only because of their medical training, but also by virtue of the fact they usually live and work in the counties in which they serve. County medical examiners must maintain uncompromising honesty and integrity. They should be loyal to their community and their oath, regardless of any pressure they may receive from outside sources. The Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner is com mitted to providing support, education and training, and consultation to each of the county medical examiners and their death investigators in order to assist them in the investigation of deaths throughout the state. My staff and I hope this reference w ill be of help to the county medical examiners and their investigators. Julia C.

Weapons and illicit drugs should be documented, photographed, collected and secured by law enforcement prior to removal of the body. If sharps or other hazardous items are being transported with the body, please notify the investigator prior to transport. If gunshot residue testing or trace evidence collection is requested, place the hands in paper bags, sealing them securely around the wrists with tape. Label each bag with the name of the person placing the bag and the date and time the bags were placed. For ER and other hos pital deaths, a copy of the chart should be send with the body to the WTRFC. Admission blood/urine should also be procured and sent with the body. Any prescription medications should be identified, photographed and inventoried on the scene, then tagged as evidence. Otherwise, they should be sent to the WTRFC for inventory and disposal.

Death certificates will be completed by the WTRFC once the examination is complete. 14 Northe ast Tennessee Regional Forensic Center When sending bodies to the William L. Jenkins Forensic Center place a call to the investigator on call to notify the forensic center of bodies that are being sent for autopsy. The investigator on -call number is (423) 439 -6723; this line is manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. This call should be made while the county medicolegal death investigator/medical examiner is on scene and once the decision has been made that the body will be sent for autopsy. The William L. Jenkins Forensic Center investigator/forensic pathologist is also available to the county medical examiner/investigators in our jurisdiction for consultation and/or scene response 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. All bodies that are being sent for autopsy must have an identification tag bearing the decedent's name if known. If the body is unidentified, but a presumptive identification is available, the identification tag must be labeled as presumed to be (PTB) \"decedent's name\". If the body is truly unidentified, lab el identification tag as applicable \"unidentified\", \"unidentified female\" or \"unidentified male\". The body identification tag must also include the medicolegal death investigators legible signature and date and time identification tag placed. Do not remo ve shoes or socks to place this identification tag. All bodies sent for autopsy must be placed in a sealed body bag.

Ensure that body bag is sealed by either a pre -numbered seal or by gathering up the body bag at the zipper and taping around the gathered body bag. This tape must also be signed by the person sealing the bag, with the date and time the bag was sealed. Whenever possible the body must be placed in the body bag in the supine position; placing a body face down may produce artifact or distortion to facial features. Do not include excessive bedding over the body as this will cause decomposition to occur more rapidly. If sharps or other hazardous items are being transported with the body please notify the forensic center prior to receipt of body.

In addition to their other administrative, professional and technical duties, the deputy and assistant state medical examiners may lecture to medical and law school classes and conduct such special classes for county medical examiners and law enforcement officers and other investigators .\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-103(b) In the Absence of a County Medical Examiner: \"If the county legislative body fails to certify a county medical examiner for a county or if the county medical examiner resigns or is unable to fulfill the duties of the office during the interim between county legislative body sessions and a deputy has not been appointed by the county medical examiner, the chief medical exami ner shall have the authority to appoint a county medical examiner to serve until the next session of the county legislative body. \" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-104(b) Authority to Obtain Medical Records: \"An authorized post -mortem official acting under the control or d irection of the chief medical examiner or a county medical examiner or performing an investigation pursuant to a court order or an order of a district attorney general is authorized to obtain, upon written request, or may subpoena through the appropriate d istrict attorney general, all medical or hospital records maintained by individuals licensed under title 63 or by facilities licensed under title 68 that pertain to a case under investigation. \" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 - 7-117(a) COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINERS Each county has a county medical examiner (ME or CME) who is a licensed physician appointed by the county mayor and confirmed by the county legislative body. A county medical examiner may appoint another physician or physicians as deputy medical examiners to act in h is or her absence. If a county is unable to appoint a county medical examiner from their county, a physician from another county may assume this responsibility. If the county medical examiner cannot fulfill his or her duties, and no deputy has been appoi nted, the state chief medical examiner may appoint a licensed physician to act as the county medical examiner.

It is recommended that o nce nominated, the potential count y medical examiner would be prudent to negotiate compensation and support to be provided by county government. The county may provide for actual case -by-case compensation of properly completed investigations, but a monthly stipend can also be provided. Supp ort for services and materials such as computers, access to copier/scanner/fax equipment, telecommunications and storage for both paper and digital records, should also be negotiated prior to county legislative approval. \"If it is not possible to obtain an acceptance as a county medical examiner from a physician in a county, authority is given for the election of a county medical examiner from an adjacent or another county. A county medical examiner, when temporarily unable to perf orm the duties of the office, shall have the authority to deputize any other physician in the area to act as county medical examiner during the absence. If the county legislative body fails to certify a county medical examiner for a county or if the county medical examiner resigns or is unable to fulfill the duties of the office during the interim between county legislative body sessions and a deputy has not been appointed by the county medical examiner, the chief medical examiner shall have the authority t o appoint a county medical examiner to serve until the next session of the county legislative body.\" Duties and Responsibilities The primary responsibility of the county medical examiner is \"When a death is reported as provided in T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108, it is the duty of the county medical examiner in the county in which the death occurred to immediately make an investigation of the circumstances of the 20 death. The county medical examiner shall record and store the findings, and transmit copies according to t he death investigation guidelines developed by the Tennessee medical examiner advisory council.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-109 The ultimate goal of this investigation is to provide information to determine a truthful, logical, and scientifically unbiased statement of the cause and manner of death. The county medical examiner may issue the death certificate for deaths within their jurisdiction. The county medical examiner determines if an autopsy is needed and may \"order an autopsy on the body of any person in a case involving a homicide, suspected homicide, a suicide, a violent, unnatural or suspicious death, an unexpected apparent natural death in an adult, sudden unexpected infant and child deaths, deaths believed to represent a threat to public health or safet y and executed prisoners.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106 (a) \"The authority ordering the autopsy shall notify the next of kin about the impending autopsy if the next of kin is known or reasonably ascertainable. The sheriff or other law enforcement agency of the juri sdiction shall serve process containing such notice and return such process within twenty -four (24) hours.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106 (a) The county medical examiner shall issue permits as required by the county and/or state which are necessary for the dispositio n of a dead body (to include cremation permits). The county medical examiner may be called upon to issue a letter certifying that a decedent had no known contagious disease prior to transport of the body to a foreign country. The duties of a county medic al examiner can be quite time -intensive, as one must be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Therefore, when the county medical examiner is temporarily unable to perform his or her duties, any other physician in the area may be deputized to act as a county medical examiner during the absence. County medical examiners may also appoint medical investigators to assist them in the fulfillment of their duties, including ordering medicolegal autopsies, pronouncing death, and investigation of death scenes . A medical investigator (CMEI or MDI) shall be a licensed emergency medical technician (EMT), paramedic, registered nurse, physician's assistant or a person registered by or a diplomate of the American Board of Medico legal Death Investigators (ABMDI) approved by the county medical examiner to serve as medical investigator. \"The county medical investigator may conduct investigations when a death is reported, as provided in T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108, under the supervision of t he county medical examiner. The county medical investigator may make pronouncements of death and may recommend to the county medical examiner that an autopsy be ordered. However, the county medical investigator shall not be empowered to sign a death certi ficate. The county medical examiner 21 may delegate to the county medical investigator the authority to order an autopsy.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 - 7-104 (f) (3) \"County medical examiners and medical investigators shall be required to receive initial training and regul ar continuing education through the chief medical examiner and to operate according to the death investigation guidelines adopted by the department of health .\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7- 104(g) Notification of County Medical Examiner Tennessee Code requires that any death which is suspicious, unusual or occurs under unnatural circumstances is to be reported to the county medical examiner. The mandatory reporters of such deaths are listed as \"any physician, undertaker, law enforcement officer, or other person having k nowledge of the death .\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108. Specifically, the county medical examiner of the county in which the death occurred is to be notified in all cases of: 1. Death resulting from violence or trauma of any type; 2. Sudden death when in apparent good health; 3. Sudden unexpected death of infants and children; 4. Deaths of prisoners or persons in state custody; 5. Deaths on the job or related to employment; 6. Deaths believed to represent a threat to public health; 7. Deaths where neglect or abuse of extended care residents are suspected or confirmed 8. Deaths where the identity of the person is unknown or unclear; 9. Deaths in any suspicious/unusual/unnatural manner; 10. Found dead; or 11. Where the body is to be cremated. When determining if a death is reportable to the county medical examiner, keep in mind that many natural deaths should be reported, but ALL deaths in which the manner of death is NOT natural must be reported. Simply put, any death in which a discrete identifiable event or obje ct external to the decedent (e.g., methamphetamine, in the case of acute methamphetamine toxicity; the floor, in the case of a residential fall) is not natural. The interval elapsed between the time of the injury or poisoning event and death is irrelevant. Tennessee Code requires investigation by the county medical examiner of a fetal death occurring after 20 weeks' gestation or if the fetus weighs 350 grams or more without medical attendance at or immediately after the delivery, or when inquiry is require d. T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -3-504 Whenever law enforcement is involved in the investigation of any de ath the county medical examiner should also be notified. The county medical examiner should be notified if the death occurs outside a licensed setting such as a hospital or nursing home until it can be determined that a physician caring for the deceased is willing to certify the death. One of the services the county medical examiner can provide the community is to ensure all deaths are properly 22 certified either by a physician who is knowledgeable of the deceased's medical history or by themselves when other criteria for doing so are me t. If a body is to be cremated, the county medical examiner is to be notified and shall sign the permit for cremation. If the death falls within those to be reported to the medical examiner, the body should not be moved or embalmed until the county me dical examiner has been notified and determined if an autopsy or further investigation is necessary to determine the cause and manner of death. Tennessee does not have a \"24 -hour\" rule requiring hospitals to notify the medical examiner when a death occur s, unless they fall under unusual, unnatural, suspicious, or unexpected circumstances ( T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108 (a)) in which case the hospital is required to immediately notify the county medical examiner. The appendix contains a printable flyer for hospitals delineating specific deaths which must be reported to the medical examiner of the county in which death occurred. It is good practice for a county ME to establish with hospitals, nursing homes, hospice providers, first responders, and law enforcement in t heir areas when, how, and to whom notification is to be made. Timeliness of Notification and Examination The county medical examiner is to be notified immediately upon the discovery of death that legally requires his or her review. Deceased bodies canno t be moved without the county medical examiner's permission (T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108 (b)) except to preserve the body from loss or destruction or to maintain the flow of traffic on a highway, railroad, or airport. The county medical examiner may delegate this to an investigator as defined above who acts as the county medical examiner's agent. Because most Tennessee county medical examiners have their own practice or are employed by a hospital, clinic or group practice, which requires caring for patients comma nding immediate attention, they should strive to establish reasonable expectations within their jurisdiction as to when they will initiate the examination to comply within reasonable standards. The use of deputy county medical examiners and medical invest igators should ease the provision of timely scene investigation and examination of the body. Availability of the Medical Examiner There must always be a county medical examiner available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to receive calls for cases requi ring review. When the county medical examiner is not available, arrangements must be made with the deputy medical examiner or a willing county medical 23 examiner from another county to provide coverage. Appropriate notification protocols should be establishe d in the same manner as the clinical practice of medicine. Notification of Next -Of-Kin Often the next -of-kin have been notified of the death or are present at the death. If not, the medical examiner can help facilitate the notification process. The responsibility of notification of death rests with law enforcement; the responsibility of no tification of an impending autopsy rests with the county medical examiner. If the body is to be autopsied, \"the authority ordering the autopsy shall notify the next of kin about the impending autopsy if the next of kin is known or reasonably ascertainable. The sheriff or other law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction shall serve process containing such notice and return such process within twenty -four (24) hours ,\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106(a). The county medical examiner must make sure that the document contai ning the notice to the next -of-kin goes with the body to the regional forensic center. T.C.A. \u00a7 62 -5-703 defines next -of-kin in order of: 1. The attorney -in-fact pursuant to a durable power of attorney for health care. 2. The spouse of the decedent. 3. The decedent's surviving adult children. The adult child making the arrangements should make a reasonable effort to contact all other adult children and ensure agreement among those contacted on the choice for funeral arra ngements. 4. A parent of the decedent. 5. An adult sibling of the decedent. 6. An adult grandchild of the decedent. 7. The grandparent of the decedent. 8. A guardian of the decedent at the time of the decedent's death. Autopsy Authorization \"A county medical examiner may perform or order an autopsy on the body of any person in a case involving a homicide, suspected homicide, a suicide , a violent, unnatural or suspicious death, an unexpected apparent natural death in an adult, sudden unexpecte d infant and child deaths, deaths believed to represent a threat to public health or safety, and executed prisoners,\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106 (a). \"All autopsies [ordered pursuant to the postmortem examination act] must be performed at a facility accredited by the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME ).\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-105 In addition to notification of the next -of-kin, the county medical examiner must also notify the district attorney and the state chief medical examiner whenever he or she decides to order an autopsy. T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106 (a) 24 The county medical examiner may permit the removal of the cornea or corneal tissues from the body \"if a request is received from an authorized official of a not -for-profit corporation chartered under the laws of th e state, or authorized to do business in the state and certified by the \"Eye Bank Association of America to obtain, store and distribute donor eyes and eye tissues to be used for corneal transplants and for other medical purposes ,\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106 (b). A set of guidelines on when an autopsy should be authorized can be found under the Guidelines for Death Investigation - Determining When to Order an Autopsy section. Toxicology Specimen Processing and Reporting Appropriate samples (see Guidelines for Deat h Investigation - Collection of Toxicology Specimens ) of bodily fluid s and/or tissues should be obtained by the medical examiner for toxicological analysis unless the body will be sent for autopsy , in which case the collection will be performed at the time of autopsy. The method of collection and containers used should be guided by the lab chosen to provide analysis of the specimens. The lab should be provided with enough information about the case to guide the process of analysis. The lab chosen should be made aware of any suspected poisons or toxins involved in the case. Death Certification The medical examiner is responsible for completing the death certificate for cases investigated in accordance with state law. County medical examiners are not responsible for signing death certificates in cases not under their jurisdiction, though they ma y opt to do so if the certificate would not otherwise be signed. In such a case, the medical examiner will complete a Report of Investigation (ROI) by County Medical Examiner as well as the death certificate and file the ROI as required with the Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner. It is recommended that the death certificate for cases referred to the Regional Forensic Centers be completed by a forensic pathologist in order to protect the NAME accreditation of the facility and ensure the integrity of vital statistics. Public Relations and Interaction with Other Agencies County medical examiners are public officials; thus there is an expectation and demand from the general public and media for access to the public information generated by their inve stigations. A measure of availability, tact, diplomacy, and finesse will serve the county medical examiner well in this regard. When responding to calls or inquiries from the public or the media provide only brief factual information as is documented in the Report of Investigation. Do not render speculative opinions about the case. Statements and quotes should also be carefully worded such that the reporter clearly understands the content and intent of the medical examiner. 25 When law enforcement is inv olved in the investigation it is essential to verify information provided would not hinder their investigation before responding to media calls . The statistics and experiences generated by the medical examiner are of interest to and can be used to help ed ucate the general public about the role of the medical examiner on matters of public health. Speaking at civic clubs, schools, churches, and professional organization meetings provides a much -needed service to the community. Funeral homes are vital to th e death process and serve the interest of the families of the decedent who pay for their services. Developing a good working knowledge of and relationship with local funeral homes enhance s the services provided to grieving families. In order to facilitat e planning and preservation of the appearance of the body for showing, investigations and examinations should be completed in a timely fashion. Providing prompt completion of death certificates will assist the funeral directors in providing assistance to the families. Good funeral directors who understand the death investigation process can help allay the anxieties of families and can also provide valuable information to the county medical examiner. County Medical Examiner Procedures Once selected, all county medical examiners should establish their practice site and procedures. Listed below is a minimal list of procedures and protocols that the county medical examiner should implement: ESTABLISHMENT OF A LOCAT ION TO SERVE AS A PRACTICE SITE Each medical examiner should have a practice site. T his is usually the same location as his or her clinical practice. Personnel within the office must be aware of the duties taken on by the medical examiner. Location and contact information should be provided to the c ounty executive, local law enforcement, local health care facilities, and the state chief medical examiner. Care should be taken to perform the external examination in an area that is private and maintains the dignity of the decedent. External examinatio n should not take place in an open or exposed area within the view of the general public . APPOINTME NT OF A DEPUTY MEDICAL EXAMINER It is unreasonable to believe that the county medical examiner can perform the necessary duties at all times without any personal time. A qualified physician willing to cover in one's absence should be selected. Notification of this person's name and contact information should be provided to the county executive, local law enforcement, local health care facilities, and the state chief medical examiner . ESTABLISHMENT OF A LOCATION TO PER FORM THE FORENSIC INVESTIGATION This is usually the morgue of the county's main hospital or other suitable facility. Appropriate privileges or permission should be obtained prospectively. 26 ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFICATION OF THE COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER Usually the dispatch center of the local law enforcement or ambulance service can perform this function. However, the physician's own private answering service or the county hospital or adjoining county hospital's 24 -hour switchboard can suffice. These entities should be provided with all appropriate beeper and telephone numbers and an updated ongoing schedule of availability of medical examiner personnel. NOTIFICATION OF CRI TICAL PE RSONNEL OF THE ABOVE PROCEDURES Any physician, undertaker, law enforcement officer, hospital, outpatient facility, nursing home, treatment resource, clinic, district attorney, or other individuals having knowledge of deaths which may fall under me dical examiner jurisdiction, or in which the body is going to be cremated shall notify the county medical examiner. These entities should be provided with a general knowledge of notification protocols established above and the local standards of practice . Please see the appropriate portions of the death investigation section for information on establishing these policies. The appendices contain a printable document for easy reference for healthcare facilities to use when deciding if medical examiner notif ication is indicated. ESTABLISHMENT OF LOCAL MEDICAL EXAMINER PRACTICE It is prudent to establish with local hospitals, law enforcement, and funeral homes the medical examiner 's standards of availability for performance of duties. General criteria for vi sits of crime or death scenes, examination of bodies, ordering of autopsies, and reporting of findings are best established prospectively with all involved individuals. For example, knowledge of general guidelines regarding when a body found at 2:00 a.m. w ill be examined will allow funeral homes to counsel family members not familiar with medical examiner practice. Written procedures disseminated to the above establish the professionalism of the medical examiner. ESTABLIS HMENT OF THE INVESTIGATIVE TEAM The county medical examiner must establish procedures necessary to collect information needed for an investigation and coordinate it with local law enforcement personnel. The investigation can be done by the county medical examiner or designated to the medic olegal investigator (s) to assist with data collection. ESTABLISHMENT OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH A REGIONAL FORENSIC CENTER A relationship should be established with a regional forensic center to provide autopsy services by a board -certified or eligible path ologist for ongoing 24 -hour consultation and s ubsequent performance of medicolegally indicated autopsies. ESTABLISHMENT OF LABORATORY FACILITIES FOR P ROCESSING OF FORENSIC SPECIMENS The county medical examiner must establish a working relationship with a toxicology lab for collection, shipment, and processing of appropriate samples. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab will perform forensic drug and alcohol testing free of charge whenever 27 law enforcement is involved in the case. For cases requiring accelerated handling, arrangements with a private lab meeting forensic specifications for performance of tests and testimony may facilitate expeditious evaluation of cases. Since the use of a private forensic laboratory will involve an additional cost, the county medical examiner should consult with the agency providing funding for the office for approval. If an autopsy is to be performed, the specimen should and will be obtained by the pathologist performing the autopsy. ESTABLISHM ENT OF PROCEDU RES FOR CREMATION The medical examiner must be prepared to expeditiously handle authorizations for cremations as required under T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108. All deaths in which cremation is to be the final disposition of the body must be reported to the county med ical examiner in the county where the death occurred. Information on approval of cremation permits is provided under the \"Other Duties and Responsibilities\" section. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROCEDURES FOR DEATH CERTIFICATE AND TRANSIT PERMITS The health departm ent's policy and procedures for death certificate and transit permits should be obtained and understood. It is helpful to know the local registrar. The death certificate typically originates at the funeral home, and then is forwarded to the attending physi cian or county medical examiner to be completed and signed. From there the certificate is filed with the local registrar at the local health department and finally is filed with Vital Records at the Tennessee Department of Health. ESTABLISHMENT OF LEGAL HELP The county medical examiner should expect competent legal assistance through the county attorney for issues related to his or her official duties. The county medical examiner should also become acquainted with the local district attorney and feel com fortable in requesting professional assistance from that office in any investigations, especially with forensic issues for which the county medical examiner has direct responsibilities (i.e., disinterment, autopsy order). ESTABLISHMENT OF RECORDS SYSTEM, REPORTING, AND STORAGE A program of record maintenance, reporting, and retrieval should be established. Systems for dissemination to the general pub lic and collection of state mandated funds should be established. The \"Guidelines for Death Investigation \" section contains more specific information about record keeping. All deaths reported to the CME/CMEI should be recorded on a Report of Investigation (ROI).* \"When a death is reported as provided in T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108, it is the duty of the county medic al examiner in the county in which the death occurred to immediately make an investigation of the circumstances of the death. The county medical examiner shall record and store the findings, and transmit copies according to the death investigation guideli nes developed by the Tennessee medical examiner advisory council .\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-109 (a) 28 **If you are currently entering all investigative information into a form or database (DIDI, MediLog, ME Sheet, etc.) consistent with the State's ROI you may print the preliminary or final report of investigation and e -mail, fax, or mail to the OSCME as a substitute for the State's ROI form. (SEE MINIMUM INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS / COMPLETING THE ROI) The ROI may be submitted via postal mail to: Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner Andrew Johnson Tower - 7th Floor 710 James Robertson Parkway Nashville, TN 37243 The ROI may be submitted via fax number: 615 -401-2532 or email: OSCME.ROI@tn.gov . The ROI may also be entered directly and submitted electronically vi a the current OSCME data system, for which you must be granted access as a user. To register as a user call 615 -837-5039 or toll free 844 -860-4511. A copy of the \"Medication Log\" should also be included. A copy of the ROI should also be sent to the district attorney general if there is evidence of foul play and/or if in the county medical examiner's judgement an autopsy should be performed. The medical examiner must be prepared to expeditiously handle authorizations for cremations as required under T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108. All deaths in which cremation is to be the final disposition of the body must be reported to the county medical examiner in the county where the death occurred. Information on approval of cremation permits is provided u nder the \"Other Duties and Responsibilities\" section. The county medical examiner's office is responsible for maintaining copies of the records generated (ROI, Medication Log, photographs, Order for Autopsy, Autopsy Report, Toxicology Report , etc.) for each death investigated. A file should be created for each case (by case number, county number, etc.). COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER INVESTIGATORS Many, if not most, county medical examiners app oint county medical examiner investigators (also k nown as medicolegal death investigators or MDIs) to act as their \"eyes and ears\" at death scenes. A county medical examiner investigator must be a licensed emergency medical technician (EMT), paramedic, registered nurse, physician's assistant, or a person registered by the American Board of Medicolegal Death Investigators (ABMDI) and approved by the county medical examiner to serve as medical investigator. T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-104 (f) (1) 29 \"The county medical investigator may conduct investigations when a death is reported, as provided in \u00a738-7-108, under the supervision of the county medical examiner. The county medical investigator may make pronouncements of death and may recommend to the county medical examiner that an autopsy be ordered. However, the county medical investigator shall not be empowered to sign a death certificate. The county medical examiner may delegate to the county medical investigator the authority to order an autopsy.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-104 (f) (3) Both \"county medical examiners and medica l investigators shall be required to receive initial training and regular continuing education through the chief medical examiner and to operate according to the death investigation guidelines adopted by the department of health.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-104 (g) FORENSIC PATHOLOGISTS AND REGIONAL FORENSIC CENTERS All autopsies in cases in which medical examiner jurisdiction is assumed must be performed in a facility accredited by the National Associati on of Medical Exa miners (NAME) ( T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7- 105(a) ). There are five such facilities in the state, known as regional forensic centers (RFC's). The facilities are located in Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Johnson City. A county medical examiner may choose the facility to which he or she refers cases as long as the RFC agrees to perform the examination. Forensic pathologists are subspecialists, who after 4 years of medical school, undergo 4 to 5 years of residency training in pathology, followed by an intensive one -year fellowship in forensic pa thology during which forensic principles, advanced autopsy techniques and death certification are mastered. Upon receipt of a body on which an autopsy is to be performed , the pathologist should receive: (a) an order for the autopsy issued by either the co unty medical examiner or his or her investigator, district attorney general or the state chief medical examiner; (b) a copy of the Report of Investigation of the county medical examiner and, (c) a copy of any available medical records. After completion of the autopsy the pathologist or regional forensic center may bill the county for the service. The pathologist shall forward to the state chief medical examiner the order for the autopsy, a copy of the autopsy report (with any included drawings, narratives, toxicology reports, microscopic reports, etc.) and a claim -for-fee for filing the report with the office of the state chief medical examiner. A fter reviewing this information the state chief medical examiner shall approve the claim -for-fee for payment and properly file the documents. At the end of this process, the pathologist or regional forensic center must submit a copy of the autopsy report to the county medical examiner, the office of the state chief medical examiner and to the district attorney. 30 In summary, the pathologist is authorized by the county medical examiner to perform an autopsy upon a body that is subject to a post -mortem examination. The county medical examiner must communicate directly with the pathologist (wr itten or orally ) in order to provide clinical details. It is the duty of the county medical examiner to make clear to the pathologist what questions are to be answered. Without enough information about the circumstances surrounding the death prior to pe rformance of the examination, it is difficult and sometimes impossible for the pathologist to provide the best autopsy service. The pathologist must provide a report to the county medical examiner as soon as possible, using a standard autopsy format. In cases referred to a regional forensic center for examination, it is preferred that the forensic pathologist responsible for the case complete the death certificate in order to ensure the collection of accurate and consistent death stat istics and to prot ect the NAME accreditation of the regional forensic center. DISTRICT ATTORNEY GENERAL The District Attorney General is an elected Constitutional officer who is under an inherent duty to investigate, prosecute, and insure against all infractions of the public peace and all acts which are against the peace and dignity of the State of Tennesse e. As such, and pursuant to T.C.A. \u00a7 8 - 7-103, each District Attorney General has a duty to prosecute in the Courts of his or her respective district all violations of the state criminal statutes, including any and all cases of criminal homicide under T.C.A. \u00a7 39 -13-201, which is the unlawful killing of another person, and may be first degree murder, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, criminally negligent homicide, aggravated assault resulting in death, or vehicular homicide. In the performance of these prosecutorial duties and responsibilities, it is necessary in any homicide case for the District Attorney General to obtain evidence and put forth proof beyond a reasonable doubt regarding the facts, circumstances, proximate ca use, and manner of death of the homicide victim. Therefore, the District Attorney General will request and expect the County Medical Examiner to order an autopsy on the body of any person and give notice to the District Attorney General in cases involving a suspected homicide, suicide, any violent, unusual, unnatural or suspicious death, an unexpected apparent natural death in an adult, sudden unexpected infant and child deaths, deaths believed to represent a threat to public health or safety, deaths of pr isoners or persons in state custody, deaths on the job or related to employment, or deaths where neglect or abuse of extended care residents are suspected. T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-107 and T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108. The District Attorney General may order an autopsy \"in the absence of the county medical examiner or the failure of the county medical examiner to act. The authority ordering the autopsy 31 shall notify the next of kin about the impending autopsy if the next of kin is known or reasonably ascertainable. The sher iff or other law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction shall serve process containing such notice and return such process within twenty -four (24) hours.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106 The District Attorney General may be asked to petition a judge to order a disint erment of a body falling under medical examiner jurisdiction if the person was buried before an autopsy could be performed, or if disinterment will assist in a pending criminal investigation. Such petition may be made by a state or c ounty medical examiner or by a District A ttorney General in the district in which death occurred, or in which the injury leading to death occurred, or in which the body is buried . T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-107(a) \"Upon the presentation of the petition to the judge, the judge shall be auth orized to consider the petition and in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, either make or deny an order authorizing the disinterment and an autopsy to be performed upon the body of the deceased. The cost of disinterment and autopsy shall be paid by the state as provided in T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -1-104.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-107(b) Upon written petition by the District Attorney General supported by affidavit and/or testimony under oath from a law enforcement officer that the release of portions of a report of a cou nty medical examiner, toxicological report or autopsy report may seriously impede or impair the investigation of a homicide or felony, a court of record may order that such portions shall not be subject to disclosure as a public document and shall remain c onfidential, until the indictment and arrest of any and all suspects in the underlying homicide or felony , or upon the closure of the criminal investigation of the same by law enforcement. T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-110(d) A County Medical Examiner, through the appropriate District Attorney General, may obtain through judicial subpoena any and all medical, hospital, or other licensed facility records pertaining to a case under post -mortem investigation or examination. T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-117 LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES Law enforcement agents are frequently present at death scenes. The best, highest quality death investigations occur when law enforcement and medical examiner personnel work collaboratively and in concert wit h one another. The county medical examiner (CME) or county medical examiner investigator (CMEI) must take care to not disturb the scene, and to follow directions of law enforcement in negotiating their scene presence. Law enforcement should bear in mind that the body and personal effects are not to be disturbed or moved without the consent of the CME or CMEI/ MDI. Law enforcement maintains control over the scene; the CME or CMEI/ MDI maintains control over the body. 32 FUNERAL DIRECTORS The Board of Funer al Directors and Embalmers of the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance licenses and regulates funeral directors, embalmers and funeral establishments in Tennessee. The funeral director may be the first to receive a call about a death that has occurred, especially if prior funeral arrangements have been made. The funeral director (undertaker) is responsible for notification of the medical examiner of any death that meets the criteria set for th in T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108 (a) if the death has not alread y been reported by law enforcement or medical personnel. T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108 (b) states that whenever a death meets the criteria set forth by this part the body shall not be moved or embalmed without authorization by the medical examiner for the county in which death occurred . The funeral director is responsible for obtaining information from the family, completing the death certificate, and filing all completed death certificates and required permits (e.g., cremation permit, burial permit, and transit permit) with the registrar at the department of health of the county in which death occurred. The T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -3-502 (b) states, \"The funeral director, or person acting as funeral director, who first assumes custody of the dead body shall file the death certificate. The funeral d irector shall obtain the personal data from the next of kin or the best qualified person or source available, and shall obtain the medical certification from the person responsible for medical certification, as set forth in subsection (c).\" The death certificate should be filed within five (5) days of the death and prior to final disposition ( T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -3-502 (a ) (1)). The funeral director will complete the decedent's data based on information provided by the next of kin or other informant with knowledge of the decedent's personal information. Funeral directors and their personnel also provide grief counselling and often serve as a liaison between the medical examiner and the family. County medical examiners and their investigators should work closely w ith the funeral home chosen by the family as they may assist in the gathering of information and facilitation of communication between different agencies. 33 GUIDELINES FOR DEATH INVESTIGATION ESTABLISHING MEDICAL EXAMINER JURISDICTION If a death meets th e legal criteria for a reportable case as set forth in T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108 (a) the county medical examiner may establish jurisdiction. The county medical examiner will direct the extent of their jurisdiction based on the type, circumstances, and location o f death and the protocols established for their county. JURISDICTION DECLINED It is the county medical examiner 's decision whether to acce pt or decline jurisdiction of a death and proceed with an investigation , not the reporting individual, health care facility or law enforcement agency. Jurisdiction declined cases may be defined as: - Deaths that are reported to the CME/CMEI but do not meet the criteria for medical examiner jurisdiction set forth as reportab le by the T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108; and - the CME/CMEI declines to pursue the case any further and relinquishes death certification to another physician. If the CME/CMEI pursues additional investigation, such as going to the scene or reviewing medical records, e ven if another physician will certify the death, or certifies the death certificate it should not be considered a Jurisdiction Declined case . All deaths reported to the county medical examiner should be recorded on a report of investigation whether jurisdiction for the death was accepted or declined. The report should be maintained by the CME and submitted to the state chief medical examiner . (See Maintaining Records) DEATH SCENE INVESTIGATION OVERVIEW According to recommendations by the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) the medical examiner's investigation of a death must be autonomous and independent from law enforcement's investigation. Although independent, the medical examiner and on -scene law enforcement must work together wit h the common goal that all cases are investigated consistently and evidence is appropriately collected with the surety that it can be used in a criminal investigation if applicable. In lieu of the county medical examiner (CME) attending every death scene, the medicolegal death investigator (MDI) or county medical examiner investigator (CMEI), who serve as the eyes and ears of the medical examiner, can perform on - scene death investigations for deaths that fall under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner. 34 Deaths that are reportable to the medical examiner, per T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108, include but are not limited to: 1. Death resulting from violence or trauma of any type; 2. Sudden death when in apparent good health; 3. Sudden unexpected death of infants and children; 4. Deaths of prisoners or persons in state custody; 5. Deaths on the job or related to employment; 6. Deaths believed to represent a threat to public health; 7. Deaths where neglect or abuse of extended care residents are suspected or confirmed 8. Deaths where the identity of the person is unknown or unclear; 9. Deaths in any suspicious/unusual/unnatural manner; 10. Found dead; or 11. Where the body is to be cremated. Fetal Deaths: Any fetal death of three hundred fifty (350) grams or more or of twenty (20) completed weeks' gestation or more that occurs without medical attendance at or immediately after the delivery, or when inquiry is required as in the case of maternal trauma that led to the death (T.C.A.\u00a7 68-3-504 (c)). Scene Investigation a nd Accepting Jurisdiction It is recommended that the CME/CMEI go to the scene of the death whenever possible. An inspection of the scene, and the body within that environment, can be of importance both in determining if an autopsy is necessary and in est ablishing the cause and manner of death. In many smaller jurisdictions the CME/CMEI will be well known to local law enforcement agencies so formal introductions may not be necessary. This however may not be true statewide. It is best practice for the CM E to introduce themselves and their personnel (CMEIs, transport) to local law enforcement and other key officials in the county prior to arriving at their first scene . In 2011, the National Institute of Justice updated their protocol, Death Investigation: A Guide for the Scene Investigator . The guidelines were a collaboration of best practices throughout the forensic community, for medical examiner and coroner systems, and were recommended as a standard for consistent, thorough death scene investigation. The guidelines can be found in their entirety at the website listed below. http://www.nij.gov/topics/law -enforcement/invest igations/crime -scene/guides/death - investigation/pages/welcome.aspx The protocol as outlined consists of: a. Ascertain the essential facts preceding and the circumstances surrounding the death. Obtain personal medical, social, psychiatric, or criminal hist ory. 35 b. Photograph the body and the scene, document pertinent descriptive information, and establish identification. c. Record the names and pertinent information of witnesses present. d. Take custody of any evidence directly associated with the body with the exclusion of firearms, live ammunition, illicit drugs, or drug paraphernalia that may aid in the determination of the cause and manner of death. Ensure chain of custody. e. Take custody and document prescription medication using the Medication Log. Ensure medication that has been prescribed to the decedent does not remain at the scene. Death Notification The CME/CMEI should confirm with law enforcement that death notification has occurred, so that notification of medical examiner jurisdiction can be made under T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106, \" . . . The authority ordering the autopsy shall notify the next of kin about the impending autopsy if the next of kin is known or reasonably ascertainable. The sheriff or other law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction shall serve process containing such notice and return such process within twenty -four (24) hours.\" DETERMININ G WHEN TO REQUEST AN AUTOPSY To assist the county medical examiners, the following guidelines for determining when to order an autopsy have been established by the Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner. There are deaths in which an autopsy must be p erformed so that each county provides a minimum service and meets national standards. In other instances, while the recommendation is for autopsy, it is not required. County medical examiners must use knowledge of their county and their best judgement to establish policies and procedures. An autopsy must always be requested in the following cases: All cases of homicide or suspected homicide must be autopsied, including apparent \"accidental\" shootings. This includes homicide victims that may have lived for days, weeks, months, or years prior to succumbing to the injuries. All cases in which the manner of death is listed as \"Could not be determined\" must have an autopsy. Note that this refers to manner of death rather than cause of death. The cause of death is the anatomic abnormality which initiated the events which eventually led to death; the manner of death is the circumstances under which that abnormality occurred. All child and infant deaths in which there is no previously known diagnosis to rea sonably account for death must be autopsied. The diagnosis of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or 36 Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) requires an autopsy to exclude all other causes of death. Child abuse or neglect may also be difficult to detect an d document without a complete autopsy. Chronically ill or special needs children are at higher risk for physical abuse or neglect, and may have a combination of natural disease and physical injury which can only be adequately documented and determined thr ough autopsy. All deaths in prison, jail or correctional institution or police custody, or involving police intervention, in the presence or suspicion of injury must have an autopsy. Deaths of long -term prisoners or those in state custody who have well -documented disease processes known to cause death (e.g., cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus infection) do fall under medical examiner jurisdiction and at a minimum sho uld have an external examination with photography performed by the county medical examiner or his or her investigator. An autopsy is recommended in the following cases: All suicides unless the circumstances are very clear, no questions are pending, and t he family has no reasonable objection. A complete autopsy is recommended for all deaths resulting from opiate, illegal or illicit drug overdose (Rule 1200 -36-01-01), poison, or alcohol intoxication. All cases that involve drivers of a motor vehicle crash , unless it is a single motor vehicle accident or the injuries have been clearly documented radiographically or by a hospital stay. An accident victim who has had a hospital stay will most likely have ample documentation of injuries in the medical records . An autopsy may not provide any additional information, although it may be of benefit to test blood taken at the time of admis sion for common drugs of abuse. Deaths of celebrities or high -profile persons: The autopsy serves a public health purpose, and many questions or speculations arising after the death has occurred can be addressed if an autopsy has been performed. Deaths related to electrical/electrocution and lightning -related deaths, because the circumstances are often not straightforward, and be cause the external physical signs are very subtle or even undetectable. Burn victims or victims of smoke inhalation who are unidentified or who die at the scene of the fire should be autopsied. Questions arise as to identification of the decedent, time of death with respect to the time of the fire, and whether the death occurred before the fire started (the fire may be masking another type o f death, such as a homicide). Deaths related to exposure, such as hypothermia and hypert hermia. 37 Persons who die in their workplace from obvious injury should be autopsied. Many legal questions may arise as a result of such a death on the job, and deaths at the workplace or related to employment clearly fall under medical examiner jurisdiction (T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108 (a)). These cases should always be reported to Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration (TOSHA; 844 -224-5818; www.tn.gov/workforce/section/tosha ). Deaths due to a possible public health hazard, such as meningitis, when the disease has not been confirmed, should be autopsied. Deaths that may be related to failure of a consumer product should be autopsied, and if confirmed, a report made to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commissio n (800 -638- 2772; www.cpsc.gov ). The majority of deaths in any community are natural, and most deaths reported to and accepted for investigation by the medical examiner are due to natural causes. In cases where there is sufficient documentation of natural disease, an autopsy may not be needed. In most cases the death of a person of advanced age of apparent natural causes, with or without a known medical history and when non -natural factors have been ruled out, does not warrant a medical -examiner requested autopsy. An external examination and toxicology is usually sufficient. The cause of death in these instances usually may be certified as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This designation is intended to include deaths from atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular acc idents, ruptured aneurysms, and aortic or other vessel dissections. Although a complete autopsy might better define the specific nature of the immediate cause of death than history and external examination alone in such cases, determining the precise mecha nism of death is not adequate justification for the expenditure of public funds to perform a forensic autopsy. AUTHORIZING AN AUTOPSY The county medical examiner may order an autopsy on any person whose death falls under medical examiner jurisdictio n. That is, cases in which: 1. Death resulting from violence or trauma of any type; 2. Sudden death when in apparent good health; 3. Sudden unexpected death of infants and children; 4. Deaths of prisoners or persons in state custody; 5. Deaths on the job or related to employment; 6. Deaths believed to represent a threat to public health; 7. Deaths where neglect or abuse of extended care residents are suspected or confirmed 8. Deaths where the identity of the person is unknown or unclear; 38 9. Deaths in any susp icious/unusual/unnatural manner; 10. Found dead; or 11. Where the body is to be cremated. The county medical examiner may delegate the authority to a county medicolegal death investigator to order aut opsies. ( T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-104-(f)-3) When the county m edical examiner or investigator decides to order an autopsy, the county medical examiner or investigator shall notify the district attorney general and the office of the state chief medical examiner. The state chief medical examiner or the district attorn ey general may order an autopsy in such cases on the body of a person in the absence of the county medical examiner or if the county medical examiner has not ordered an autopsy. The law does not give the district attorney the authority to prevent an autops y that is ordered by the county med ical examiner or investigator. (T.C.A \u00a738-7-106) An autopsy may be ordered using the Report of Medicolegal Investigation form PH -4217, page 2, as shown below: An Order for Autopsy form PH -1907, shown below, may also be used to order an autopsy. However, county medical examiners are still required to submit the Report of Investigation form to the OSCME even when using the Order for Autopsy. 39 An autopsy may be o rdered over the objections of the next -of-kin of the decedent. Frequently, if a medical examiner or forensic pathologist explains to the family the necessity for autopsy and that autopsy will not delay funeral arrangements or disfigure the decedent, they w ill assent to the examination. However, if a family or next -of-kin persists in \"refusing\" autopsy, it may be prudent for the county medical examiner or forensic pathologist to offer to delay the examination for a reasonable (for example, 72 business hours) period of time, during which the family may petition for a court order preventing the procedure. IDENTIFICATION OF THE DECEDENT Identification of unknown bodies is an important function of the county medical examiner's office and should be considered a s important as determining cause and manner of death. Bodies should be identified using one or more methods that are widely recognized and accepted within the medicolegal community. If possible, identification should be determined prior to transport to a regional forensic center, but should be firmly established prior to release to a funeral home. If a body cannot be identified prior to transportation for autopsy, the tag placed on the body should indicate UNKNOWN MALE/FEMALE, COUNTY OF DEATH, and any other information routinely used by county medical examiner (CME) / medical examiner investigator (CMEI). If the CME/CMEI and/or law enforcement has a reasonable suspicion as to the identity of the decedent, that information should be included on the body t ag (presumed to 40 be OR believed to be . . .). How a decedent is identified should be documented in the CME/CMEI Report of Investigation (ROI). Identification of the decedent can be accomplished through use of one or more of the following methods: Visual/ Photographic Identification of the Deceased Visual identification is the most common method currently used, however visual identification alone is considered the least reliable method of identification. Identification of the body may be made by showing a member of the family, a friend, or an individual who knew the decedent well, either the body or a photograph of the body/face. This method should only be used when the decedent is visually recognizable. Information about the person making the identifica tion, to include name, address, contact phone number, and relationship to the decedent, should be documented. When a decedent is either positively or presumptively (tentatively) identified by a photograph from a driver's license or other official document s, it is encouraged that this document be sent with the body to the regional forensic center. CME(I)s should not use \"identified by family\" or \"known to law enforcement\" in their reports but should document with specific information who was the identifier and their contact information if questions arise in the future concerning the identification. While visual identification is the most common method used for positive identification, it has the greatest potential for error. Persons, even close family mem bers, can make errors in identifying a deceased body. Therefore it is best to include at least other circumstantial information such as \"decedent found in own residence, or vehicle\". Scientific Identification of the Decedent If the decedent is not readi ly identified by visual means, either due to decomposition or trauma, other scientifically recognized methods should be employed for positive identification. Alternative, accepted methods include fingerprints, antemortem dental records, ante mortem medical x -rays, or genetic (DNA) studies. Fingerprint Identification is an excellent method of identification as long as the person has a fingerprint record on file. Law enforcement records provide the most common sources for retrieving comparison finge rprints. The FBI fingerprint database contains a criminal file, a civil file for government employees, and a military file that covers the armed forces. When the decomposition process is advanced fingerprints may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Lo cal law enforcement or the regional forensic center may be able to provide assistance in printing difficult cases. Fingerprints for homicide, suicide, or suspicious cases should not be collected prior to autopsy as the process of fingerprinting may destro y evidence. If a county ME(I) is petitioned by local law enforcement to fingerprint the body prior to autopsy, the CME(I) should contact the regional forensic center and speak with the case pathologist to discuss specifics. 41 Dental Identification of an un identified body requires the presence of antemortem dental records, the written record, and dental x -rays (bite -wings, panoramic). The record of the known person can be compared to the dentition of the deceased for positive identification. As soon as it is suspected that dental identification may be required, a search for antemortem dental records should begin. Antemortem dental information should be forwarded to the regional forensic center performing the postmortem examination. Radiographic Identifica tion can be employed when antemortem x -rays are available and show remote skeletal fracture(s), unique skeletal anomalies, lesions, old and un -recovered projectiles, prior medical or surgical intervention and prosthesis. Antemortem x -ray information shoul d be forwarded to the regional forensic center performing the postmortem examination. If the body is not sent for autopsy the assistance of a local radiologist may be needed for this type of identification. DNA Identification can be used to establish the positive identification of a deceased person. Comparison can be made directly (for example, comparing DNA from the hairs contained on a hairbrush of a known person to a DNA sample obtained from the body), or by comparison with a relative's DNA. Specimen s considered suitable for DNA comparison include dried blood, hair with roots, tissue, bone marrow, and sometimes from teeth. Blood dried on DNA blotter paper or an FTA bloodstain card is the specimen of choice. Presumed Identification If positive ident ification cannot be made via visual or scientific means, then a presumptive or circumstantial identification may be possible. Circumstantial evidence may include, but is not limited to, ID on body, jewelry, scars, and tattoos , location of body within a re sidence or vehicle, and anthropological data. Circumstantial evidence must be carefully considered and, if you feel the circumstantial evidence is not strong enough to be sure of identify, you can prepare the death certificate with the qualifying phrase \"Presumed To Be\". UNKNOWN OR UNIDENTIFIED DECEDENT A body that is unidentified should never be cremated until a positive identification has been established. A body that is unidentified can be embalmed and buried, once information has been collected that may aide in future positive identification. The list of information includes, but is not limited to : height, weight, approximate age, gender, race (ancestry), hair characteristics (color, length, style, etc.), eye color, description and color photos of all tattoos, amputations, scars, and prosthetics, clothing record (items, colors, labels, sizes) to include color photographs, jewelry descriptions to include color photographs, street names or nicknames, fingerprints, dental exam with chart and dental x-rays, other x -rays (if indicated), DNA specimen(s), and anthropology consultation (if available and indicated). Copies of all 42 information collected should be maintained as a part of the permanent medical examiner record until identification has been est ablished. NAMUS (National Missing and Unidentified Persons System) is a national database that attempts to match unidentified bodies with missing person's reports. Each regional forensic center has a person who can enter the profile. Potential matches in the NAMUS database will be referred back to the center for confirmation. REPORT OF INVESTIGATION (ROI) The medical examiner Report of Investigation Form (ROI) should be completed by the county medical examiner (CME) or medical examiner investigator (CME I) for each death that is reported to the CME/CMEI, whether or not medical examiner jurisdiction is accepted. The ROI is the first record of the investigation of any death investigated by the CME/CMEI. The ROI form serves multiple roles in that it provid es a single location for all demographic information, scene investigation, and narrative summary information needed by the regional forensic center providing autopsy service, it is the order for autopsy, documents next of kin notification of autopsy, and i t is the record of the investigation to be sent to the OSCME to be maintained by the state. The ROI is a two page form that is largely self -explanatory and can be completed by either the CME or CMEI with all available information. The full, complete, a ccurate, and timely recording of information on this report and its accompanying forms (SUIDI, SUDCR, Medication log) is necessary for all stakeholders in the medicolegal death investigation system to perform their duties as assigned by law. (See Appendix C - Medical Examiner Forms) A signed copy of the form should be sent to the State Chief Medical Examiner's Office (OSCME) within 14 days of the date of death. This will allow the OSCME to review the deaths being reported throughout the state in a timely fashion. It should be emphas ized again that a copy of this report should be submitted to the OSCME for all deaths that are reported to the medical examiner, regardless of whether or not an autopsy is requested or jurisdiction accepted or declined. Address: Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner Department of Health, Andrew Johnson Tower, 7th Floor 710 James Robertson Parkway Nashville, TN 37243 Fax -2532 Electronic Submission: OSCME.ROI @TN.GOV 43 NOTE: If you are currently entering all investigative information into a form or database (DIDI, MediLog, ME Sheet, etc.) consistent with the State's ROI you may print the preliminary or final report of investigation and e -mail, fax, or mail to the OSCME as a su bstitute for the State's ROI form. A signed copy of the form should also be sent with the body to the regional forensic center and will serve as the order for autopsy. Autopsies are conducted under the authority of the county medical examiner or District Attorney General and require a signed form. The county medical examiner is required to maintain a record of all deaths reported to them as well as the archives of the previous county medical examiners from the jurisdiction. The county medical examiner s hould arrange the transfer of files to their successor, or if one has not been appointed, to the county government.

THE BASIC MEDICAL EXAMINER KIT A minimum of equipment is necessary to perform a scene investigation. The following items are recommended to be immediately available when a medical examiner call is received to assist with performing and documenting the scen e. The single most useful piece of equipment to have is a digital camera. Photography provides a permanent visual record that can be used to enhance the written scene description. Scene photographs should be submitted to the regional forensic center whe never a body is sent for autopsy. When possible, and appropriate, photos should include a scale and/or ruled measure. The CME/CMEI should not use their personal cell phones or tablets to document a scene or body. Personal cell phones or tablets can be h acked or, if not locked, photos or sensitive subject matter may be viewed by lay person(s) or unauthorized personnel. 48 Medical examiners may want to have the capability of obtaining specimens for toxicology collection at the scene for bodies not being sent for autopsy. Have available appropriate tubes for fluid and blood collection as recommended by the toxicology service used. The tubes should be stored appropriately and not expired. Other equipment could include: Portable laptop Blank forms: o Repor t of Investigation (ROI) o Sudden Unexplained Infant Death Investigation ( SUIDI ) o Sudden Unexplained Child Death Investigation Report ( SUCD IR) o Medication log Blank Paper (for notes or diagramming when indicated) Clipboard and Pens, Sharpie markers Clean, unus ed envelopes for possible trace evidence collection Writable tags for body (ankle or wrist) Body bags - clean and unused Numbered lock tag seals for body bag Clean, unused paper sacks for bagging hands (or feet) when indicated Roll of tape (masking tape) t o secure paper sacks over hands or feet Flashlight or penlight (with extra batteries) Thermometer to measure environmental temperature Six-inch ruler and/or ABFO Scale Metal measuring tape Personal Protection Equipment : o Disposable gloves o Mask (N -95 or better) o Face shield o Shoe covers o Apron, disposable gown, or jumpsuit o Hair cover Cotton or disposable sheet to wrap body to protect evidence when indicated Toxicology Supplies: o 20 cc to 30cc plastic syringe o Large bore needles o Sharps container o Various tubes f or fluid and blood collection (check with toxicology lab for preferences) 49 CONDUCTING AN EXTERNAL EXAMINATION The county medical examiner (CME) or county medical examiner investigator (CMEI), depending on the county protocols set for CMEIs, will be tasked with determining whether or not an autopsy is ordered for a case. At the scene or location of death prior to tha t determination, an external examination of the body may be performed. A visual external examination is not an autopsy. The extent of the external examination performed on scene should be dependent on whether or not an autopsy will be performed. Bodie s with associated evidence and clothing sent for autopsy should remain intact as when found, with minimal manipulation, to enable the forensic pathologist to make accurate and appropriate conclusions. The CME/CMEI should allow evidence associated with the body to remain intact unless the fragile nature of the evidence requires special handling or the CME/CMEI is petitioned by law enforcement for on -scene collection. Any exception should be addressed on a case -by-case basis and may require the CME/CMEI to contact the regional forensic center for consultation. Any manipulation, changes, additions, subtractions, or instrumentations made to the body, clothing, or associated evidence should be well documented in the Report of Investigation (ROI) submitted at t he time of autopsy. For a body not sent for autopsy, performing an external examination allows the CME/CMEI to document information necessary to certify the death certificate and release the decedent directly to the funeral home of choice. The CME/CMEI s hould perform a careful external inspection to document injury, evidence, or indicators of disease. The external examination should include, if possible, measurements of height and weight; a general description of the body; hair color; presence of facial hair; eye color; circumcision (male); tattoos; and external congenital anomalies. All body surfaces should be examined and photographed, if relevant. This may require manipulation or removal of clothing. Documentation of medical therapies, scars, marks, or injuries should be noted on the body diagram (see ROI). The external examination should include inspection of the surface of the eye orb, inner aspect of the upper and lower eyelids, inner aspect of the lips, and inside the mouth when possible. Rigor Mortis can be used as an indicator of time since death and can be estimated without undue manipulation of the decedent. Rigor is the stiffening (without actual contraction) of muscles after death and is due to a chemical process by which the actin and my osin fibers of the muscles are chemically cross -linked after death. The development and lysis of rigor mortis is slowed or hastened by many factors including ambient temperature, body mass, clothing, and health. Rigor mortis begins throughout the body at the same time but can be appreciated first in the smaller muscles of the fingers and hands, neck, jaw, and elbows. Rigor mortis is usually noted later in the larger muscle groups. A body, in general, will develop appreciable rigor within a few hours aft er death. The process will usually reach a maximum stage, or full rigor, between 12 and 24 hours and will then begin to lyse over the next 12 to 24 hours. When rigor is present, it may be \"broken\" by forcibly flexing or contracting the muscle, after whic h it 50 will move freely. The external inspection should include noting the intensity and distribution of rigor mortis, and whether it is appropriate for the position of the body. The location in which rigor is \"broken\" should be documented on the ROI. Onc e rigor mortis is \"broken\" it will not recur in the same location. Of note, early rigor is often broken during resuscitative efforts and may not provide an accurate time since death estimate. Livor Mortis is the discoloration (red/blue spectrum) of the b ody due to the settling of blood with the force of gravity after death. The presentation and development of livor mortis can be extremely variable and may be hard to appreciate in dark -skinned individuals. In general, in the immediate postmortem period, livor mortis is not fixed, meaning that if the body is repositioned, the distribution of lividity will change. Livor mortis will eventually become fixed and will not redistribute if the body is moved. To evaluate livor mortis, apply digital pressure to the area of lividity. If the livor blanches, then it is not fixed. As the postmortem interval increases, Tardieu spots, pinpoint focal areas of livor similar in appearance to petechiae or small purpura within areas of lividity may occur. The color and ap pearance of livor mortis can be dependent on the cause of death and time elapsed since death. For example, in the case of carbon monoxide poisoning, livor mortis may be cherry -red in the skin and the organs of the body. As livor progresses it will deepen in color and take on a marbled appearance, usually initially in the torso and upper extremities. Algor Mortis is the cooling of the body after death until ambient temperature is reached. In general, the body temperature will decline at a steady rate, and there are formulas for calculating the postmortem interval based on the body temperature. However, both exter nal factors and variables intrinsic to the body can have a significant effect on the rate of cooling introducing a large and incalculable margin of error. In most cases tactile perception of whether the body is hot, warm, cool, or cold is all that is requ ired. In those few cases in which a temperature reading should be taken, generally homicide cases where law enforcement has time sensitive questions about time of death or suspected hyperthermia cases, a rectal temperature reading should be obtained. A r ectal temperature should never be attempted in cases involving suspected sexual assault. It is neither necessary nor desirable to attempt to obtain a core temperature reading by inserting a thermometer into the liver or other organs. COLLECTION OF TOXICOL OGY SPECIMENS The collection of toxicology specimens is usually performed during the autopsy or external examination. Toxicology specimens may be collected at the scene, especially if the body is to be directly released from the scene to the funeral home . Toxicology specimens should not be collected if the body is to be sent for autopsy, as that is included in the process by the forensic pathologist, and doing so may introduce artifact to the body and potentially conflicting or confusing test results. Typical specimens collected by the regional forensic centers at autopsy will include blood, urine, bile, vitreous humor, and sometimes stomach contents, and/or tissues from the organs 51 (most commonly brain and liver). It is not possible to collect most of t hese specimens at the scene or during an external examination. Nor is it necessary. During an external examination at the scene blood, vitreous, and urine (if available) can be collected which will fulfill most toxicological requirements. Any drugs give n during resuscitation efforts in decedents who have been transported by emergency medical providers can complicate the interpretation of antemortem drug use using postmortem toxicology results. When possible, obtain any blood or urine specimens that may have been collected at the time of hospital admission. If the deceased has spent time in the hospital prior to death and is to be sent for autopsy, obtain admission blood and urine specimens if available. Most hospital labs, due to storage constraints, d o not keep specimens for more than a few days. Blood banks are required by the College of American Pathologists to retain specimens for ten days; if a decedent has been evaluated for a blood transfusion, the blood bank is the most likely source to provide antemortem blood for toxicology testing. Supplies A clean, unused, large bore needle with a clean, unused, syringe and various tubes are needed for specimen collection. It is important to have a conversation with your toxicology service concerning the t ype of tubes/ preservative acceptable for testing, as different labs have different abilities and requirements. Ask the toxicology service if coagulated or hemolyzed blood can be used for postmortem toxicology. Toxicological testing is usually performed on whole blood that is not clotted, so the test tubes will require some type of preservative that stabilizes the specimen. (For example, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation requests blood and vitreous fluid for toxicology testing be placed in grey top (sodium fluoride), tubes, and urine to be collected in a sealable, leak -proof, container without preservative). Specimens Blood is often the specimen of choice for detecting, quantifying and interpreting drugs and other toxicants. The best source of blood for toxicology is the femoral artery. Collect as much blood as possible, enough blood to fill several tubes. The second best source for blood is the subclavian vein, although subclavian blood may be contamina ted with pleural fluid. Blood should never be collected externally from the heart for toxicology testing, as the location makes it difficult to collect without contamination or dilution, and because the phenomenon of postmortem redistribution can confound the interpretation of toxicology results obtained from central blood. 52 Vitreous humor is the fluid within the eye and is a good specimen for toxicology (especially confirmation of blood alcohol level) because of its isolation from blood and other body flu ids that are more readily affected by postmortem changes, including redistribution. Vitreous humor can also be useful in measuring some of the pre -terminal electrolytes. Again, it is prudent to establish with the laboratory performing the testing the pref erred type of tube for electrolyte testing. Vitreous fluid can usually be collected from the eye up to four days post - death and can be collected from embalmed bodies where the eyes have remained intact. Vitreous humor can be obtained by inserting a needl e at the lateral margin of the eye and using gentle suction on the syringe to draw the fluid up. A slow, steady suction will allow the collection of the clear, colorless fluid, free of contaminants. One (1) to two (2) milliliters of vitreous should be ea sily obtainable from each eye. Urine is the most common sample used for drug testing in the living, but is not always available postmortem. Urine can be obtained by inserting a needle over the top of the pubic symphysis and aspirating (a suprapubic tap), or by catheterizing the patient. If there is urine in the bladder, it should be collected for toxicology. Urine samples can be used to screen for a relatively large number of drugs that could be cost - and sample -prohibitive using blood. Any positive res ult from urine screening should be confirmed by another method. POSTMORTEM TOXICOLOGY INTERPRETATION Most drug levels cannot be interpreted in the postmortem state in the same way as in the living. This is due to a number of factors, including the phenomenon of postmortem redistribution, in which drugs diffuse from areas of higher concentration to those o f lower concentration after the cessation of blood flow. Drugs may also decompose after death, or may be generated postmortem in the body after death (examples include ethanol and gamma hydroxybutyrate). The staff of the Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner is available for consultation by county medical examiners in the interpretation of postmortem toxicology results, as well as for any other concerns regarding medical examiner investigation of deaths, jurisdictional questions, and assistance in ce rtification of death. PRESERVATION AND COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE The County Medical Examiner / Investigator (CME/CMEI), in conjunction with law enforcement, should safeguard evidence directly related to medicolegal investigations. This evidence will genera lly fall into three (3) categories: medical examiner evidence, death scene evidence, and personal property. Personal property and evidence are important items in a death investigation. Evidence associated with the body must be protected and collected p roperly to ensure its availability if 53 needed for future evaluation and litigation. Personal property must be safeguarded to ensure its eventual distribution to appropriate agencies or returned to the legal next of kin. It is important to remember that wha t is evidence to be collected is different on a case by case basis, from law enforcement agency to law enforcement agency, and between regional forensic centers. Often facilities do not have a \"standard\" evidence collection protocol. It is the responsibi lity of the CME/CMEI to communicate with their local law enforcement agency as to their expectations at autopsy. At the Scene Evidence located at the scene of a death not directly in contact with the body, in general, is the responsibility of law enforce ment and should remain in their custody and control. The county medical examiner (CME) / investigator (CMEI) should cooperate with law enforcement's efforts to safeguard evidence. Death scene evidence which might be especially important to note in your r eport of investigation (ROI) would include suicide notes, illicit drugs, drug paraphernalia, weapons, and any item thought to be related to the cause of death (e.g., frayed electrical cord in suspected electrocution). Prescription medications located at the scene may be treated differently than other related evidence. In many jurisdictions, the prescription medication, prescribed specifically to the decedent, is collected by the CME/CMEI for documentation, inventory, and disposal. Prescription medicati ons, especially controlled substances, should be disposed of through safe, approved, methods. Many area pharmacies and police departments now have drug/pill drop boxes which are approved for disposal. Prescription medications, specifically prescribed for the decedent, should always be included in the medication inventory and should not be left at the death scene. Law enforcement should be aware that prescription medication removed from the scene goes through a disposal process. Depending on the prelimin ary cause and manner of death, the CME/CMEI may release the prescription medication, once documented, to law enforcement as evidence. Evidence associated with the body at a death scene, in general, will stay with the body and is under the control of, and is the responsibility of, the CME/CMEI. Law enforcement should cooperate with your efforts to maintain the integrity of the body and any associated evidence contained on the body until the body is transported to the regional forensic center if autopsy is requested. Evidence on the body which might be especially important for the case forensic pathologist could include, but is not limited to, clothing of known or suspected homicide victims, ligatures, or any evidence of medical intervention. It is recomme nded that a body sent for autopsy receive minimal manipulation. In some instances the hands, and/or feet, may need to be \"bagged \" (See Preparing a Body for Transport pg. 52). It is recommended that evidence such as fingernail clippings, scrapings, or other invasive types of evidence be collected at autopsy. 54 Gunshot Residue (GSR) Oftentimes law enforcement agencies will request GSR to be collected from the victim of gun violence. Due to changes with the policy of the TN Bureau of Investigation concerning gunshot residue, many forensic centers do not have the supplies necessary to collect GSR at autopsy. The CME/CMEI should speak with their local agencies and with the r egional forensic center where autopsy are performed to develop a protocol for their county. Fragile Evidence Many items could be placed into the category of fragile evidence and should be addressed by the CME/CMEI and law enforcement on a case by case ba sis. Items identified at the death scene as fragile, such as a hair or a spot of blood that would be destroyed or lost during transport, may be collected prior to the body being sent for autopsy. Any evidence removed prior to submission to the regional f orensic center should be documented with photography and the written record. The CME/CMEI may consult with the regional forensic center, or case pathologist, prior to any evidence collection at the death scene. Ideally, all cases of suspected sexual assa ult, where a death has occurred, will be sent for autopsy. A sexual assault specimen collection kit can be collected by the case forensic pathologist, at the time of autopsy, for submission by law enforcement to the crime laboratory. Chain of Custody The chain of custody is a chronological documentation or paper trail that documents the collection of, transfer, custody, testing, or disposition of any items considered evidence. The integrity of evidence and admissibility in court is predicated upon an un broken chain of custody. It is important to demonstrate that the evidence introduced at trial is the same evidence collected at the death scene, and that access was controlled and documented. Retain a copy of a signed chain of custody for the transfer of evidence either to the CME/CMEI, or from the CME/CMEI to the regional forensic center or law enforcement. Local law enforcement or the district attorney should have appropriate evidence transfer forms available. DISPOSITION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY Personal effects or valuables that are on the decedent fall under the same jurisdiction as the body. Pictures of the body as found, including clear views of jewelry and other valuables, provide documentation that can protect medical examiner personnel, law enforce ment, transport, funeral home personnel, and other family members if accusations of missing property arise. Property removed from the decedent, prior to transport to a regional forensic center or funeral home, and released to law enforcement, legal next o f kin, or others, should be accompanied by a receipt of the transaction. (Appendix C) This receipt will provide proof in case questions arise at a later date and should list the items released and be legibly signed by 55 both parties. Personal property coul d include clothing of decedents not sent for autopsy, jewelry, currency, wallet, purse, and/or other papers and personal items. Personal property would not include illicit drugs, controlled substances, or drug paraphernalia. A chain of custody form would suffice for this transaction. Note in the Report of Investigation (ROI) any property removed and released at the scene, especially if autopsy service is being requested. PREPARING A BODY FOR TRANSPORT Maintaining jurisdiction over the body allows the C ME/CMEI to protect the chain of custody as the body is transported from the scene to a regional forensic center for specimen collection and autopsy. Proper preparation of the body for transport is crucial in preserving the integrity of any evidence that m ight be associated with the body. When medical examiner jurisdiction has been assumed, every decedent should receive some form of identification tag listing known information such as name, date of birth, county of death, etc. Unidentified remains should be tagged as unknown male/female, county of death, date of death (or whatever verbiage is recognized and in use by the county). To maintain the integrity of chain of custody of the decedent, untagged bodies should not be transported to the regional foren sic centers. The body should be sealed in a clean, unused, body bag for transportation to the examination facility or regional forensic center if autopsy is ordered. Clothing and other personal effects that are on the body of the deceased should be left on the body and transported with the body. Sometimes the family or law enforcement will request removal of some or all of these items before transport. As the CME/CMEI you can be flexible but use discretion in following their wishes. Unless certain of the cause of death, these items may become important evidence in the future. Once the items are out of the control of the CME/CMEI, the chain of custody may be broken or evidence might be otherwise lost. Seal the body bag with a tamper proof, locking, seal (numbered plastic zip ties/lock) to ensure that the body has not been disturbed during transport and storage prior to examination. In cases of homicide, suspected homicide, or other suspicious deaths, the hands should be \"bagged\" in order to preserve e vidence. Use paper bags only (plastic does not breathe and moisture can develop inside of the bag and ruin any evidence that may be present). Secure the bags with tape about the forearms, wrapping tape at the level of the top of the bag without touching t he skin. Sometimes it may be necessary to bag the feet as well. When in doubt, bag the hands to preserve any evidence or suspected evidence during transport. For cases of homicide or suspicious deaths, wrapping the body in a clean, white cotton or dispo sable sheet is recommended. Minimal handling of the body in these cases is crucial for preservation of evidence. Emphasis should be on maintaining the body and associated evidence for collection in a proper facility where trace evidence can be more easi ly visualized and collected. 56 If ballistics, other weapons, or evidence are noticed within a wound, every effort should be made to preserve the evidence in situ for transport to the examination facility. In the event that there are multiple body parts, especially if it is believed that there may be more than one victim, each body part should be individually tagged and placed into a separate bag for transport. Do not attempt to match body parts on scene. MAINTAINING RECORDS \"The department of health is authorized and empowered to create and maintain a post - mortem examination division or service. The division or service shall have as its functions the investigation of certain deaths as defined in this part, and the keeping of full and complete records of all reports on investigations and examinations made pursuant to this part .\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-102 \"When a death is reported as provided in T.C.A. \u00a738-7-108, it is the duty of the county medical examiner in the county in which the death occurred to immediate ly make an investigation of the circumstances of the death. The county medical examiner shall record and store the findings, and transmit copies according to the death investigation guidelines developed by the Tennessee medical examiner advisory council.\" (T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-109(a)). Findings should be recorded on the report of investigation (ROI) form, or other investigative form approved by the department. A copy should be submitted within 14 days of the report of death to the Office of the State Chief Medi cal Examiner (OSCME) on every death reported to the county medical examiner, regardless of whether medical examiner jurisdiction is accepted, along with a Claim for Fee form (Appendix C). Not all cases occurring under the circumstances described within T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108 require an autopsy. For the explanation on criteria and necessity for ordering an autopsy (see Determining When to Request an Autopsy pg. 32) . If a decision is made to order an autopsy by either the CME/CMEI or the district attorney ge neral, the ROI can serve as the Order for Autopsy and should be sent to the regional forensic center with the body if autopsy service is requested. A copy of the form must also be sent to the OSCME. Following the completion of the autopsy report, the Reg ional Forensic Center / case pathologist will submit to the county medical examiner a copy of the autopsy report, including drawings as part of the autopsy report, narratives, toxicology reports, microscopic reports, etc. Following the completion of the a utopsy report the Regional Forensic Center / case pathologist will submit to the OSCME: A. Autopsy Report which shall include: 1. Autopsy Report 2. Microscopic description (if applicable) 3. Toxicology report (if applicable) 57 4. Microbiology report (if applicable) B. SUIDI or SUCDIR (if applicable) C. Claim for payment for professional services If these forms are not on file with the OSCME, then payment cannot be made. Upon receipt of the ROI information from the county medical examiner, the OSCME is responsible for the fo llowing: a. Maintaining the records b. Approving and sending the invoice to the TN Department of Health for payment to the county Upon receipt of the information from the pathologist / Regional Forensic Center, the OSCME is responsible for the following: a. Making sure that all necessary forms and reports have been received by the OSCME and making sure the forms are properly completed. b. Maintaining the records. c. Approving and sending the invoice to the TN Department of Health for payment. The county medical ex aminer is responsible for maintaining copies of the following forms for the county (ies) they serve: a. Report of Investigation form b. Order for autopsy (if applicable) c. Autopsy report including toxicology or other laboratory reports, if applicable and for subm itting copies of the ROI along with a copy of the medication log and any other supporting documents to the OSCME within 14 days of the report of death. If the body is sent for autopsy a copy of all documentation and reports should be submitted to the regi onal forensic center. Practice Area The practice area for the county medical examiner may be either the morgue, usually located in one of the community hospitals, or may be a funeral home. Similarly, the forensic pathologist will maintain a practice are a as prescribed in T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-105 (see Forensic Pathologists / Regional Forensic Center pg. 26). Each CME/CMEI / Regional Forensic Center must have a mechanism for maintaining records and a designated place to keep the records. For every contact the CME/CMEI has with a death, there must be a record completed. There must also be a means and a location to facilitate communication with the OSCME, case pathologist / Regional Forensic Center, and the many others with whom the county medical examiner must interact. 58 In the event the county medical examiner resigns or loses the position or dies, the records of such death investigations should be turned over to the county executive for storage until a new county medical examiner can be appointed. Public Access to Records Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a738 -7-110(c) states that the reports of the county medical examiners, toxicological reports, and autopsy reports shall be public documents unless restricted by court order (See T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-110(d)). The public can obtain these reports from the OSCME, the county medical examiner, or the Regional Forensic Center, depending on facility protocols. The OSCME and county medical examiner / Regional Forensic Center may charge a fee for copies of the autops y report, toxicology report, and ROI. The T.C.A. Open Records Act does not stipulate a fee for records but does advise the fee should be \"reasonable .\" T.C.A. \u00a7 10-7-503 (C)(i) Forms Several forms are required to be submitted to the Office of the State C hief Medical Examiner (OSCME). These forms will be case dependent but can include: 1. Report of Investigation by County Medical Examiner (Mandatory) 2. Order for Autopsy (if separate from ROI) 3. Autopsy Report (if applicable) 4. SUIDI or SUCDR (if applicable) 5. Medication log HIPAA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (1996) regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI), such as medical records, medication logs, and psychotherapy notes of an individual for 50 years fol lowing their date of death. 45 CFR \u00a7160.103 specifically permits the release of PHI by covered entities to coroners or medical examiners an d funeral directors (HHS.GOV, \u00a7 164.512(g)(2) without any signed consent or prior authorization of the decedent or ne xt-of-kin. Any coroner, medical examiner, or funeral director who receives PHI becomes an agent of the covered entity and cannot release the protected information except through the covered entity. 59 SCENE PHOTOGRAPHY Documenting a death scene photograp hically is an essential component of a death investigation. Scene photographs provide a detailed permanent visual record that others can refer to and interpret in the future. For the forensic pathologist good quality scene photographs can provide context to what they observe at autopsy. Photographs of the scene and body should be done in a systematic way so the CME/CMEI is less likely to miss something and so the end user can follow along more easily. The photographs should have a clear primary subject and limit irrelevant background information. This may require asking others at the scene to step out of the photograph. The CME/CMEI should photograph the scene as they find it. If the body or item of evidence has been moved prior to the arrival of the CME /CMEI, this should be documented in the written report. Overall, Midrange, and Close -up Composing scene photographs systematically into Overall, Midrange, and Close -up photos will improve the quality and amount of detail recorded. Well composed Overall, Midrange, and Close -up photographs should follow the CME/CMEI through the scene to the de cedent. Overall photographs should be taken to document the relationship of the scene to the surrounding environment and orient the viewer. Overall photographs can be taken of the outside of a residence, a nearby intersection, and from all four corners o f the room in which the decedent is found. Midrange or intermediate photographs establish a specific subject of interest and its context within the larger scene. Close -up photographs of a single item/subject provide an additional level of detail and shou ld be taken with and without a scale. Scene photographs of a deceased person are sensitive , confidential information and should be stored in a secure location. T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-110(c) Equipment For the CME/CMEI the digital camera is an essential piece of equipment for documenting the scene. The digital camera does not need to be a high end DSLR camera, a compact point -and- shoot will suffice in most situations. It is important the CME/CMEI know how to operate the camera they are working with and have knowle dge of good photographic technique. Extra batteries and storage disks for the digital camera are essential. A small scale or ruler is necessary for close up photography. It is not recommended to take or store scene photos on a cell phone. 60 SCENE SAFETY Blood Borne Pathogens As medical professionals the CME and CMEI should be aware of the risks at a scene when blood and bodily fluids are present. There are many blood borne pathogens that can be transmitted through contact with another person's blood o r body fluids that can contain blood borne pathogens including, but not limited to, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV. Most exposures are caused by a lack of universal precautions, whether the failure to properly use personal protective equipment (PPE), o r due to a sharp exposure. Investigators should utilize universal precautions at every death scene. Universal precautions are the practice to treat all human blood and bodily fluids as if they were known to be infectious. Examination of the body will of ten require the removal of items from pockets. The CME/CMEI should not reach into pockets or beneath the body where visibility is limited. Pockets should be carefully pulled inside out to expose any items they may contain. Uncapped sharps should be phot ographed and removed from the scene and placed into a safety container for disposal or into an evidence container. Uncapped sharps should never be transported inside of the body bag. In the case of an exposure to a first responder, law enforcement, or on -scene ME personnel the CME/CMEI may be requested to draw a blood sample for testing for blood -borne pathogens . If the body is to be sent for autopsy the request should be communicated to the regional forensic center. The release of results from such blo od work to the health officer for the exposed employee is covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Acco untability Act, HIPAA, 45 CFR \u00a7 164.512(b)(1)(v), Uses and disclosure for which an authorization or opportunity to agree or object is not requir ed. CULTURAL /RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES TO CONSIDER Tennessee is a multicultural society made up of many different ethnic, racial, and religious groups from around the world ; this is particularly true in more urban areas. Each of these groups has their own cultural traditions and customs related to death which can be in conflict with the work of CME/CMEI. Therefore to best serve families from these communities it is important the CME/CMEI have an understanding of the cultural diversity present in their jurisdiction and anticipate concerns family members may have regarding the handling of a body, delay of burial and attitudes concerning autopsy. Individual attitudes towards autopsy vary within and between religio us and cultural beliefs . Religious and cultural beliefs are often stated as reason s for opposing an autopsy; however , most major religions are accepting of autopsies , in particular those required by law. Early in the investigation the CME/CMEI should speak with family members to determine if they have any cultural or religious rituals or customs surrounding death or specific objections to the 61 investigation or autopsy. Prior to an autopsy being performed, the pathologist must be made aware if the family has questions, special request s, or oppose autopsy. In some cases the pathologist may be able to make some accommodations to meet all or part of a family's request. It is important to explain to the family why certain requests cannot be met. At all times families should be treated with respect and compassion. Reassure the family that the performance of the autopsy will not mutilate the body or prevent an open casket s ervice from being conducted. In many cases the family will withdraw their objection to the autopsy after the y have heard an explanation for the necessity of the autopsy to answer questions for the protection of the public's health, for the purposes of the criminal justice and legal systems, and for the family who may not realize they have questions until days, weeks, or even years later. If a family persists in refusing autopsy, consult the regional forensic center to which the body would be sent or the O ffice of the State Chief Medical Examiner. When an autopsy is warranted, but not performed due to the religious or cultural beliefs of the family, document the refusal, including the name and contact information of the person objecting, their reasons for d oing so, and the information they have received from law enforcement and/or ME personnel regarding the potential consequences . Make sure the investigating law enforcement agency and/or DAG is aware of, and in agreeance with, the decision of the county med ical examiner's office. In some communities in Tennessee, people may live their entire lives without contact with a healthcare provider and be buried without the use of a funeral director. In such situations, it is the responsibility of the county medical examiner to complete and sign the death certificate. If such ethnic or religious communities a re present in your jurisdiction, it is prudent to work with religious or community leaders to create policies that accommodate the ir cultural traditions while a llowing the CME/CMEI to fulfill his or her legal responsibilities . SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS: The following is not intended as an exhaustive listing or absolute authority, but simply as a guide for the CME/CMEI. Each case must be considered individually. Christianity: Catholics and most Protestant churches, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter -day Saints and Christian Scientists, do not forbid the performance of an autopsy. Judais m: Orthodox and Conservative branches may object to an autopsy and may follow strict requirements to have the body buried within a short time frame. If an autopsy is allowed, specialized techniques may be required. Often Reform and Reconstructionist sects will allow an autopsy if they see it as an opportunity to help save another life either by organ or tissue donation or because of the opportunity the autopsy provides for learning. However, this may 62 vary greatly even within the same sect, therefore is always best to speak directly with the family and make an attempt to accommodate their specific wishes. Islam : The practice of performing an autopsy is not automatically forbidden in Islam. The Islamic principle of consideration of human welfare justifies autopsies in most cases. Specific rituals of which the CME/CMEI should be aware include: The eyes and mouth are to be closed and the limbs straightened; The deceased should be buried as quickly as possible; and The clothing should be removed by a person of the same gender. Amish and Mennonite: The Amish and Mennonite communities do not forbid the performance of an autopsy, but may request the body be returned to the family as quickly as possible. Most will allow transport of the body in a motorized vehicle. Jehovah's Witnesses: Jehovah's Witnesses believe th at the soul dies with the body, but may object to autopsy based on the belief that the body as a creation of God should not be disturbed. Buddhism: Autopsy is not forbidden by Buddhists. Hinduism: After death, the limbs should be straightened and the eyes closed. Religious jewelry or sacred threads should not be removed from the body. Autopsies are not forbidden. 63 SCENE INVESTIGATION / SPECIFIC CASE GUIDELINES DEATHS WITHIN HEALTH CARE FACILITIES Hospital Deaths Many deaths that are reported to the county medical examiner/investigator (CME/CMEI) come from health care facilities. In larger counties with multiple hospitals, specialized treatment centers, and level one trauma centers, patients will frequently be transported directly from an out of county incident or transferred from a local hospital or emergency department. For the majority of Tennessee counties there are usually fewer than two medical centers, while some do not have one at all . \"The notification of death shall be directed to th e county medical examiner in the county in which the death occurred .\" T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108 (a) The first decision point for the county medical examiner receiving a report of death occurring in a healthcare facility is to determine the probable manner of dea th. In cases of death in persons with a medical history of a disease process which could reasonably account for death and there is no non -natural process contributing in any way to the death, the physician treating the patient for that disease should comp lete and sign the death certificate. However, if the patient has not been seen or treated in the physician's practice within the four months prior to death, the clinician may by statute refuse to sign the death certificate. Emergency room physicians are also empowered to sign death certificates in apparent natural deaths. The chief medical officer of the facility in which the death was pronounced may be held responsible for certification of death in cases which clearly do not fall under medical examiner ju risdiction, yet the practicing physician refuses to sign the death certificate. When a death occurs in a nursing home or long -term care facility, it is rarely reported to the county medical examiner. If a person dies while in a nursing home or care facil ity they are under the care and supervision of a physician, even if the physician was not there at the time of the death. The death is considered \"attended\". If no non -natural factors contributed to the admission or death the attending physician has the responsibility of death certification. Care must be taken when eliciting the history of the terminal illness from the reporter of death. Admission to a hospital, nursing home, or long -term care facility does not automatically determine jurisdiction for de ath certification. For example, the deaths of many elderly people are the result of a gradual decline in health following a hip fracture. A good rule of thumb is to ask oneself, \"Did this person return to their pre -injury level of function prior to death? \" If the answer is no, the manner of death cannot be considered natural. In these instances, the county medical can decline to take custody of the decedent but, to ensure that the death certificate is appropriately certified as an \"accident\" should assume that responsibility. T he best method to preserve the integrity of death statistics is for the county medical examiner to sign and complete the death certificate based on medical records review and/or the history provided by the reporter. 64 Rarely is a sce ne response necessary in deaths occurring in healthcare facilities. One notable exception is in cases of sudden unexpected deaths of infants or children, in which caregiver and witness interviews are best carried out in concert with law enforcement at both the scene in which the child was found ill or unresponsive and at the hospital. Protocols between the county medical examiner, healthcare facilities, emergency medical services, law enforcement, and the district attorney's office should be clearly establi shed in advance. The county medical examiner should reach out to facility administrators, risk management, or chief medical officers and provide them with the relevant sections of the Tennessee Code. The Appendix contains a flyer developed by the OSCME whi ch may be distributed to healthcare facilities detailing cases in which the county medical examiner must be notified. After the county ME or MDI has been notified and has ruled that the death does fall under medical examiner jurisdiction, he or she has se veral choices regarding the next most appropriate course of action. For example, order an autopsy and relay relevant scene and medical findings to a regional forensic center; review medical records without examining the body and issue a death certificate; perform an external examination of the body, with or without ancillary testing; or order toxicology testing on an admission blood specimen in a person who dies in a healthcare facility hours or days after an acute drug intoxication, with or without examini ng the body. If medical examiner jurisdiction is accepted for a death occurring in a healthcare facility and an examination by the county medical examiner and/or a forensic pathologist at a regional forensic center is planned, all medical therapies should be left in place in the body unless removal is expressly permitted by the medical examiner or investigator. This practice minimizes the possibility of confounding therapeutic artifact with inflicted injury. CHILD AND INFANT DEATH INVESTIGATIONS Tennessee Code Annotated, \u00a768 -1-1101 to 1103, the Sudden, Unexplained Child Death Act, defines and directs the investigation into child and infant deaths in Tennessee. The county medical examiner shall investigate the circumstances surrounding any death of an infa nt or child in which the medical history does not document a previous diagnosis of natural disease that could account for the death. Very often there will be multiple agencies involved in a child death investigation, increasing the logistical challenges s urrounding an already complex investigation. Also contributing to the difficulty of the investigation are the high emotions associated with an infant or child death and possible multiple scene locations (e.g., at the hospital and where the child was disco vered unresponsive or ill). When the CME/CMEI is notified of the death of an infant or child within a healthcare setting, he or she should ascertain prior or ongoing law enforcement or child services (DCS) involvement with the family or caregivers. Infor mation provided by these agencies about circumstances prior to admission or transport to the hospital can direct the investigation and determination of jurisdiction for legal purposes. Hospital response by the CME/CMEI is dependent on circumstances of dea th and medical examiner jurisdiction. If the CME/CMEI accepts jurisdiction for the death, and initiates an investigation, the location of death pronouncement is where the 65 investigation should initiate. However, if injury occurred at another location or t he infant or child was found unresponsive at another location, that scene should also be investigated. In cases due to trauma, the investigation focuses on correlating the history of how the injury was reported to have occurred to the findings at the sc ene, the child's developmental abilities, and the injuries identified at autopsy. A high degree of suspicion for child abuse should be maintained, as evidence of external trauma on the body is often minimal to none. All hospital records, including radi ology, laboratory, and any consultation reports, should accompany the body to the regional forensic center for review by the case pathologist. Antemortem blood samples taken at the time of hospital admission should be acquired if available. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), a subtype of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID), is defined as a death in a child below the age of one year whose death occurs suddenly and unexpectedly, with no known or apparent cause, and which remains unexplained after the performance of a complete investigation, including a thorough scene investigation, review of medical history, and an autopsy. Neglect versus failure to thrive due to natural causes can be difficult to discern based solely on autopsy findings, except in ex treme cases. Determination of neglect often entails investigation into the home environment, health of siblings, and reviewing the medical chronology of growth and medical interventions. CME/CMEI interviews with family, caregivers, etc. should be complet ed in conjunction with law enforcement's investigation. Two fillable reporting forms, the SUIDI (Sudden Unexplained Infant Death Investigation) and SUCD (Sudden Unexplained Child Death Investigation) are available on the website: https://www.tn.gov/health/article/office -of-the-chief child/infant death, and completing the SUIDI or SUDC, consider the following: Attend all scenes (emergency room, home of decedent, etc.) in partnership with law enforcement. Obtain medical and social history of decedent. Locate medical records for both decedent and mother, inc luding labor / delivery, prenatal care records, well baby records, pediatrician/vaccination records, and newborn metabolic screening results. Document any history of Child Protective Services involvement with the family. 66 Be familiar with developmental milestones of infants and children and at what age or stage of development these occur. Remember some children achieve some of the milestones earlier than others. Review of pediatrician records is important. Consider whether the explanations, history, a nd information obtained from caregivers, mother, father, significant other of parents, and grandparents, etc. are all consistent, and whether they corroborate with the clinical history and findings of how an injury occurred. Caregivers should be interviewe d separately. Consider whether any injuries on the child corroborate with the findings at the scene. Scene photographs and diagrams can be very important. Document any evidence of drug or alcohol abuse at the scene. In cases of failure to thrive, docum entation of medical consultations and follow -up should be recorded. Presence or absence of formula or food in the cabinets, refrigerator, or freezer should be documented. Infants can be significantly more sensitive to infections, toxins (carbon monoxide ), and environments than older children and adults. The proximity of the infant to heating sources should be noted. Perform a doll re -enactment, preferably as soon as possible after the death. Photographs should be taken to document the doll re -enactmen t and should include images of the position of the child when last seen alive and when found. In a possible SIDS/SUID/SUCD investigation, the bedding should be examined along with the sleep surface, and a complete history of sleep position, bed sharing, r ecent illnesses, and/ prior sibling death(s) documented. \"All emergency medical technicians and professional firefighters shall receive training on the handling of cases of sudden, unexplained child death as a part of their basic and continuing training r equirements. The training...shall include the importance of being sensitive to the grief of family members .\" T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -1-1102 (c) The course Prevention Through Understanding: Investigating Unexpected Child Death , is available through Middle Tennessee Sta te University in conjunction with the TN Department of Health, TN Department of Children's Services that a \"certified child death pathologist\" must perform any autopsy on an infant or child under the authority of the postmortem act. The child death pathologist is a board -eligible or board -certified forensic pathologist who agrees to follow the autopsy protocol for child death investigation as prescribed by the state chief medical examiner. At a minimum, the autopsy and report should include: 67 Complete external examination; Radiographs of the body prior to autopsy in cases of sudden unexpected d eath in infants; Complete autopsy, defined as at a minimum: o In situ examination and removal and dissection of organs from the cranial cavity, neck, thoracoabdominal cavities, and pelvis; Completion of a written narrative autopsy report, which must include: o descriptions of pertinent positive and negative external and internal findings; o external and internal injuries; o a review of organ systems, including histologic examination of major organ systems; o a summary of case findings or list of diagnoses, in cluding review of medical record; o opinion regarding cause and manner of death; and o completed Sudden Unexplained Infant Death Investigation (SUIDI) reporting form or Sudden Unexplained Death of a Child (SUDC) reporting form as is appropriate for the age of the decedent These guidelines are based on the Forensic Autopsy Performance Standards issued by the National Association of Medical Examiners, which can be accessed below: https://netforum.avectra.com/public/temp/ClientImages/NAME/684b2442 -ae68 -4e64 -9ecc - 015f8d0f849e.pdf LIVE BIRTH VS FETAL DEATH A Report of Fetal Demise is to be filed in cases of spontaneous intrauterine fetal demise, meaning the fetus was born without any signs of life, if the body weighs 350 grams or more or is of 20 completed weeks of gestation or more. If a stillbirth as defined above occurs outside a medical institution, the physician in attendance at or immediatel y after the delivery shall prepare and file the report. However, if there is no medical attendance at or immediately following delivery, the county medical examiner shall investigate the cas e and file the report . T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -3-504 For induced terminati ons of pregnancies, regardless of gestational age or fetal weight, the physician in charge of the termination shall file a report with the office of vital records. However, medical examiner involvement is not required in such cases . T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -3-505 If signs of life are present at birth but the baby subsequently dies, both a birth certificate and death certificate are to be filed with the office of vital records. 68 Disposition of Fetal Remains Authorization for final disposition of a dead fetus, requires a cremation permit only if the fetus meets the definition and criteria listed above. Below 350 grams and/or 20 weeks the remains are considered products of conception and do not require a Report of Fetal Demise nor a cremation permit. T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -3-506 APPARENT NATURAL DEATHS AT HOME A natural death occurring at home in which the decedent has been seen by a physician within the last four months for the condition resulting in death does not fall under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner. A natural death is a death caused exclusively (100%) by disease or age . A natural death where the decedent has a documented medical history and a physician willing to certify the death is not a medical examiner case, and may not require a scene visit (jurisdiction dependent) unless there are suspicious or unusual circumstances. Personal physicians should sign the death certificate of persons who die at home if they have been under prior medica l treatment for a disease or condition capable of producing death, such as a cardiac arrhythmia or myocardial infarct occurring in a patient with coronary artery disease or hypertension. An a pparent natural death occurring at home when there is no physic ian who attended the decedent in the past 4 months, the decedent was not under hospice care, the death is unexpected, or when there is no available medical history may require a scene investigation. Many of these cases may be able to be released directly to the funeral director from the deceased person's home if examination of the body and investigation of the scene can exclude the possibility of any trauma or other factor that would make the death unnatural. The CME/CMEI should be sensitive to the grief and sometimes shock the family of the decedent may be experiencing and conduct the investigation without adding to the family's grief if possible. UNNATURAL DEATHS AT HOME Deaths at home that are not exclusively due to natural causes will almost always require an investigation by the CME/CMEI of the county in which the death occurred. Examples would include homicides, suicides, accidents, drug overdoses, and combinations of natural and unnatural causes of death. It is frequently very difficult for a pat hologist performing an autopsy on a body with injuries to draw a final conclusion without an adequate investigation. A thorough scene investigation is the forensic pathologists' equivalent of a medical history. 69 EXTRAORDINARY/HIGH -PROFILE DEATH INVESTIG ATIONS Extraordinary or high profile death investigations present special challenges for the CME/CMEI. Examples of extraordinary or high profile deaths include deaths in mass shootings , deaths resulting in mass casualties , terror -related fatalities, deat hs of elected public officials or celebrities, deaths in custody or police -related deaths. These types of deaths can generate a great deal of outside scrutiny and media attention. CME offices should have policies and plans in place to ensure they are able to effectively manage these investigations. A high -quality comprehensive investigation and autopsy are necessary in these cases. There can be high interest among members of the media in extraordinary or high -profile deaths. CME/CMEI's are public official s; thus there is an expectation and demand from the media and general public for access to the public information generated by their investigations. A measure of availability, tact, diplomacy, and finesse will enhance the professionalism of the CME/CMEI an d promote the objectivity and reliability of the CME to the community. Cooperation with local law enforcement is essential in preparing effective communication with the media. Statements and press releases should also be carefully worded such that the reporter or editor clearly understands the content and intent of the CME/CMEI. CMEs must not forget that they ar e appointed by the county mayor and subject to confirmation by the county legislative body, both of which are political in nature. These offici als by nature of their position must try and please their constituents. It is prudent to assist these individuals in explaining cases brought to their attention and not interpret their questions as personal attacks. Many commissioners will defend their CM E/CMEI once they understand the details of the investigation. HOSPICE DEATHS The death of a patient while under the care of a hospice program, where the decedent has been under long -term care for a chronic terminal illness, does not automatically fall u nder the jurisdiction of the medical examiner. Often in these cases the attending physician or hospice medical director has previously agreed to certify the death after the patient expires. A registered nurse within a hospice program may make the actual de termination and pronouncement of death of a hospice patient. (T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -3-511) The medical examiner is not a death pronouncement or death certification service for a hospice within that community. If this type of death is reported and the investigation does not reveal any non-natural factors that may have contributed to the death (for example, remote trauma), the death does not fall under medical examiner jurisdiction. In cases where Medical Examiner jurisdiction is declined a Report of Investigation (RO I) form should be completed. Check the Jurisdiction Declined box at the top of the ROI form, enter the decedent's basic demographic information, death pronouncement information, medical history, and cause of death information (manner is always natural). If 70 there are any questions about the manner of death then the case should be further investigated to determine the manner as in similar non -hospice deaths. SPECIFIC CASE GUIDELINES All-Terrain Vehicles (ATV) The increased popularity of all -terrain vehicle (ATV) use in recent years has resulted in a rise in related accidents and injuries. Reconstruction of these types of accidents poses a unique challenge due to their nature and the lack of data available to i nvestigators. Information provided by CME/CMEI is instrumental in the investigation of ATV accidents, especially if other investigative agencies are unable to accurately reconstruct the accident. The involvement of the CME/CMEI at the scene of an ATV acc ident is similar to that of a motor vehicle accident. Again, the main duty of the CME/CMEI is the evaluation and documentation of injuries sustained by the collision and the gathering of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident. Whe n investigating an ATV collision, consider the following: - Was the operator or passenger(s) of the ATV wearing a helmet or protective clothing or safety restraints (if applicable)? - What were the road (trail) conditions? (visibility, weather, etc.) - What type of roadway or trail was the individual operating on? Was the trail maintained? - What was the direction of travel for the vehicle(s)? - What was the operator's experience level? - Are there any signs of alcohol/drug use? - Were there any passengers? How many passengers is the vehicle rated for? - Was the vehicle pulling anything (sprayer, yard cart, a trailer for rock or dirt, etc.)? - If the accident occurred on the roadway, was the vehicle rated for highway use (lights, turn signals, etc.)? - Does the ATV have any roll bars, seatbelts, other safety features? - What is the year, make, model, and serial number? Consumer Product Safety Commission may need to be notified. Blunt Force Injury The scene investigation of death due to blunt force injuries is a very important adjunct to the autopsy. Blunt force injuries (contusions, abrasions, lacerations, and fractures) result from a 71 blunt object impacting the body or when the body impacts a surface causing injury. A death related to blunt force trauma may occur in a variety of settings, such as falls, motor vehicle accidents, or assaults . When investigating a death due to blunt force injuries, consider the following: - Is trauma from impact with a moveable object, or a fixed object such as a wa ll? - Document the size, shape and nature of the moveable object including any artifact found on the object. - Are there blunt objects present at the scene that could have been used as a weapon or associated with the death ? Document their location relative to the body. - Does the object have fresh or dried blood on it, describe? - Does the body of the decedent display any obvious pattern injuries? - Is there a large pool of blood around the decedent? Estimate volume. - Is the blood in several locations? Are there d roplets that may represent cast -off? - Is the weapon still at the scene? Any suspected weapon should be collected as evidence by law enforcement. The case forensic pathologist may request to view the suspected weapon at the time of autopsy . When collect ing and transporting the weapon, it is imperative that it is handled carefully and correctly to preserve any latent prints and/or DNA evidence. Carbon Monoxide Carbon monoxide or \"CO\" is a colorless, odorless gas that results from incomplete combustio n of materials containing carbon. CO is produced when you burn fuel in cars, small engines, furnaces, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, and in house fires. A deceased individual found within a closed space in a vehicle with the motor running may be readily i dentified as a CO poisoning. The more subtle cases, possibly due to a faulty heating system or an improperly vented gas generator, can be harder to diagnose and investigate. In cases where the CO levels are high and considered lethal (in the range of ap proximately 50% to 80% saturation), pink or cherry red livor mortis becomes noticeable on the external examination. Lower carboxy hemoglobin concentration , however, can be lethal in individuals who are more susceptible. The very young, the very old, and i ndividuals with cardiac and pulmonary disease fit into the categor y of susceptible individuals. Investigators should not enter the scene until professional personnel have assessed the safety of the environment through utilization of a carbon mono xide moni tor, if appropriate. 72 In deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning, consider the following: - If the individual is in a motor vehicle, is the ignition on? Could the vehicle be restarted? Is the gas tank empty? Is the vehicle in a garage with the door closed? Is there stuffing around the garage doors? Is an apparatus connected to the tailpipe? Are there any vehicle defects to the exhaust system, holes in floorboard or firewall? - Were resuscitation efforts (CPR ) performed ? - Are any of the indicators of suicide present, such as a suicide note, comfort items, beverages, previous suicide attempts o r threats, history of depression, financial or marital difficulties, etc.? - If the individual is found in a residence, is the heater on? Does the heater involve combustion? Is the residence in need of repairs, including the gas appliances or heater? Are any pets dead? Is there an attached garage with a running vehicle? - Is there a charcoal barbecue grill in a confined space near the decedent? - Is there evidence of medications, drugs, or alcohol at the scene that may indicate the individual had increase d susceptibility to carbon monoxide poisoning? - Testing for carbon monoxide in the blood at autopsy remains the most reliable and efficient way to determine whether a fire victim died from smoke inhalation. - An apparent carbon monoxide death may represen t a homicide; thorou gh investigation is essential. Consumer Product Related Deaths A death scene that involves a product that may have caused or contributed to a death of an individual should be documented and reported to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the OSCME. It is recommended that an autopsy be performed on such cases. The CPSC is an independent federal regulatory agency that was created in 1972 by Congress in the Consumer Product Safety Act. In that law, Congress directed the Commission to \"protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with consumer products.\" Examples of common products that should be reported include toys, ATVs, bicycles, cigarette/charcoal lighte rs, cribs, fireworks, mattresses, portable generators, pack -n-plays, etc. 73 Visit www.cpsc.gov and click on the tab titled \"Regulations, Laws & Standards\", Voluntary Standards\" for an alphabetized list of product categorie s. The OSCME is a resource for consultation, as well. When investigating a death involving a consumer product consider the following: - Did the product contribute to or cause the death? - Does this product fall under the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Co mmission's jurisdiction? - Who is the manufacturer, and what is the model brand name and serial number of the product? - Is the product available for examination? If so, where is it located? To report an unsafe consumer product or a product -related death: The CPSC can be contacted at www.cpsc.gov . Contact information is: U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 4330 East West Highway Bethesda, MD 20814 Phone: (800) 638-2772; 504-0025 Hours: Monda y-Friday 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Messages can be left anytime A report can be filed electronically with the CPSC at www. saferproducts.gov To make a report, c lick on the green tab titled \"Report an Unsafe Product.\" For item #1, select \"Medical Examiner and Coroner\" from the dropdown box. Complete the required fields and submit per the instructions. Prior to completing a CPSC report, it may be necessary to create an account (no cost). Have the case information ready for reference to assist in answering the questions required on the report. Decomposed Remains In cases of decomposed bodies, the same basic principles of scene investigation apply. However, the decomposition may present additional challenges to the investigation. Identification of injury may be difficult and proper identification may require scie ntific methods. Most decomposed bodie s will need to be autopsied. The rate of decomposition changes are dependent on a number of factors, including environmental temperatures and humidity, as well as factors unique to the individual, and can 74 be highly variable from one case to another. Thus, it is well advised to be extremely cautious or simply avoid offering estimations of time since death. Instead, document pertinent facts that would help estimate the postmortem interval, such as the time the indivi dual was last seen alive and found dead. Attempt to determine and document the last collected mail or newspaper, last financial transactions, last phone call or text message, or last social media posting. While the time frame may be variable the body w ill go through some typical changes during the decomposition process. Early in the decomposition process, the superficial layers of the skin may slough off from the body producing \"skin slippage.\" \"Marbling\" is a green/purple discolored branching pattern due to decomposition of blood within dilated subcutaneous blood vessels. Green/black discoloration of the skin will begin. Gas producing bacteria can cause the abdomen and other areas to be distended, which is termed \"bloating.\" Brown or red decomposit ion fluid (\"purge\") may exude from the nose and mouth. In drier climates, the skin may become dark and dried resulting in \"mummification.\" In cool wet environments, fatty acids in the body convert to soaps, forming a white or tan waxy substance called \"a dipocere.\" After several weeks to months, the remains are reduced to the skeleton. Since less may be learned from a decomposed body at autopsy, circumstantial evidence from the scene becomes important both in the investigation as well as identification . However, confirmation of the identity with scientific methods such as fingerprints, antemortem clinical radiographs, or dental comparison is often necessary. It should be determined whether there are antemortem fingerprints on file. The most recent den tal X -rays should be obtained as soon as possible and sent to the pathologist/investigator. In the event that there are no dental records, medical X -rays revealing fractures or anomalies may be utilized. As a last resort, personal effects such as toothbr ushes, hairbrushes, combs, and used feminine hygiene products can be submitted for use in DNA analysis. Consider the following when investigating a decomposed body: - Document the scene environmental information; temperature, clothed/unclothed, position of body, wet/dry, direct sun/shade, etc. - Document the degree of decomposition. - Are blowflies or maggots present? - Is there evidence of postmortem insect or animal s cavenging? - Is the residence secured and valuables intact? - Is there a history of depression, suicide attempts, or threats? - Are medications at the scene appropriate for the prescribed doses? Complete a Medication Log. - Note the last time the individu al was last seen alive. 75 Drowning The diagnosis of drowning is based on the circumstances surrounding the death in combination with the absence of any contradictory findings at autopsy. Information gathered at the scene is crucial to the correct determ ination of drowning as the cause of death because findings at autopsy are often minimal and non -specific. A complete autopsy is recommended in cases of suspected drowning. The following should be considered in the investigation of drowning deaths: - Is it logical that the decedent was in the water? - Do scene findings and findings on the body make sense with the history (wetness of body, injuries or lack of injuries, postmortem changes, etc.)? - How was the body found? Floating? Submerged? How deep is the water where the body was recovered? - Could the decedent swim? How well? Was there a life guard? - Did the decedent have a history of seizures or cardiac conditions? Is there a family history of sudden death? - What is the type of body of water? L ake? Pool? River? What are the conditions of the water, including temperature, waves, and currents? Document weather at the time (electrical storms, etc.). - What factors are present that could contribute to injuries or artifacts on the body (marine li fe predation, boat activity, etc.)? - If the drowning is in a pool, are there lights or other electrical equipment that should be checked by an electrician? - Is there a pool suction filter system? Where was the body found in relation to the components of the system? - Had the decedent participated in any type of sport or activity such as jumping from a diving board or water skiing? - What was the decedent wear ing at time of incident (personal floatation device, swimming suit, etc.)? - How did the decedent get to the body of water (car, walk, pool ladder, etc.)? Drug Related The diagnosis of drug overdose requires that drugs be detected, identified, and quanti fied in the body (preferably blood, but in some cases tissue may acceptable when blood or other fluids are not available). An autopsy should be performed on all suspected drug intoxications. Toxicological analysis of appropriately obtained specimens shou ld be sent to a laboratory that is properly accredited (i.e., by the American Board of Forensic Toxicology) and that will perform 76 confirmation testing on all positive specimens. Hospital laboratories perform drug screens only, designed for triage of medic al diagnoses, and are not the most appropriate for evaluation of forensic cases. In cases of prescribed medication overdose, the toxicology testing can be greatly expedited if specific drugs can be identified from scene investigation. Document any medi cation found at the scene on the Medication Log form; information on this form is important in the work -up of overdoses. In presumed overdose deaths, consider the following: - In evaluation of medications found at the scene, to who are they prescribed ? The date(s) of the prescription(s), the quantity prescribed, and the number remaining should be catalogued. - Is the residence secured? Is there evidence of a struggle? - Is there a history of drug or alcohol abuse? - Is there drug paraphernalia at the scene? If so, send it with the body. The pathologist may want to send the paraphernalia for toxicological testing. - Are there needle marks or track marks on the extremities? - Are any of the indicators of suicide present (suicide note, previous suicide attempts or threats, history of depression, financial or marital difficulties, etc.)? - Are there indicators of remedy revival such as ice packs or the decedent having been placed in the shower or bathtub? - Is there paint or glue on the hands or at the s cene (huffing)? Are cans of compressed air (keyboard cleaner) near the body? - Complete a Medication Log by listing all medications, including herbal or alternative remedies and over -the-counter medication. - If sending for autopsy, check with Regional F orensic Center to determine if medications should be sent with the body. Elderly / Dependent Adult Unexpected or unattended death of dependent adults and the elderly requires a complete death investigation. Although the majority of these cases are natural deaths, other non -natural conditions must be excluded. Autopsy is recommended whenever the manner of death is in question. Types of elder or dependent adult abuse include physical abuse, sexual abuse, financial exploitation, psyc hological abuse, and neglect. The investigation of the death of a dependent adult should include a complete scene invest igation with inquiry as to the degree of dependence of the decedent, understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the 77 caretaker(s), analysis of the living conditions with review of the decedent's activities of daily living, and evaluation of the dece dent's access to food and proper shelter. The scene should be documented by photographs, and in some instances, scene re -creation. Evaluate the role of the caretaker(s), their capabilities, and resources. Determine the degree of the decedent's indepen dence. Self-neglect may complicate interpretation of scene and physical findings. Individuals who can make their own decisions have the right to refuse care and transport to a medical facility for care. Questions concerning the need for autopsy or oth er concerns should be directed to a forensic pathologist. In addition to what is asked for on the ROI form, consider the following: - With whom did the decedent live and what is their relationship? - Has there been a recent change in living conditions or caretaker? - What is the condition of the residence? - Are utilities in working order? - Did the decedent have access to food and drink? If yes, by what means? - Where, how, and how regularly did the decedent eat? Who prepared the meals? - Where did the decedent sleep? Describe condition of decedent's clothing and bedding. - Was the decedent able to communicate and have access to computer or telephone? - Was the decedent diagnosed with dementia or ot her cognitive impairment? - Does the decedent have a physical disability? If yes, describe. - Did the decedent require the assistance of a wheelchair, walker, cane, eyeglasses, or hearing aids? Were they available to the decedent? - Who managed the decedent's finances? - Were any unemployed adults living with the decedent? - Is there a history of law enforcement or Tennessee Department of Human Services/ Adult Protective Services involvement? - Is there a history of domestic violence involving the decedent? Environmental Exposure Autopsy is recommended in cases of suspected hypo - or hyperthermia. The findings at autopsy in cases involving both extremes of temperature can be supportive, but not necessarily diagnostic, of the role o f those extremes in the death. Therefore, the diagnosis depends on history and scene investigation, combined with autopsy findings. 78 Invasive documentation of body temperature is not recommended, although documentation by external methods can be helpful . Confer with the forensic pathologist before checking core or rectal temperature. In cases of hypothermia, documentation of weather conditions and exposure of the individual is very important. An autopsy can rule out most other natural disease and tr auma. Similarly, hyperthermia also relies on environmental conditions and evidence that the individual was exposed to high temperatures. Testing of the vitreous fluids during autopsy can support the diagnosis of dehydration. Documentation of body tempe rature using a rectal thermometer in cases in which sexual assault is not suspected can help support the diagnosis. When investigating exposure deaths consider the following: - Is the individual properly clothed for the conditions? Paradoxical undress ing is sometimes seen in cases of hypothermia. - Is there a psychiatric history? - Is there evidence of drug or alcohol use? - Is the individual homeless? - Is there evidence of a struggle? - Is there a significant past medical history that would make the individual more susceptible to environmental conditions? - What were the high and low temperatures during the interval that the decedent might have been exposed to the environment? - What is the immediate temperature in the environment? Has the heat in th e residence recently been turned off? Fire Deaths involving fire should be treated as suspicious until proven otherwise. Most deaths are the result of an accidental fire. But, some fires have also been started to conceal a prior crime, such as homicide or burglary. Some fires have been set as a means of suicide. Contrary to the destructive nature of fire, a lot of information can be gained by performing a thorough scene investigation and autopsy. Medical examiners and investigators MUST work closely with the assigned fire investigator. When a death occurs associated with fire, there are two active investigations occurring at the same time. There is an origin and cause of fire investigation and there is also a death investigation. The medical examiner must await the opinion of the fire investi gator as to how the fire started to determine the manner of death. All fire -related deaths should be autopsied with skeletal x -rays performed as needed. Toxicological analysis for the presence of alcohol, drugs, and carbon monoxide should be performed. A majority of deaths from fires are due to smoke inhalation. Testing for carbon 79 monoxide in the blood will confirm the diagnosis. Depending on fuel load and contents being burned, hydrogen cyanide may also be tested in the blood. A major issue in an y fire death is confirmation of identity of the decedent. By interviewing the NOK and other witnesses, information concerning the decedent's medical and social history may give clues to information that can be used to positively identify the decedent. Va luable information that needs to be collected for every fire death to help with identification includes: Name and location of decedent's dentist. Name and location of decedent's primary medical provider. History of any prior arrests to help locate fingerp rints on file. Description of the decedent's tattoos, scars, marks, piercings, clothing or jewelry. If information concerning the above items is very limited, then with the assistance of law enforcement, the collection of buccal swabs of the decedent's im mediate biologically -related NOK may be necessary to perform DNA analysis. If the use of an accelerant is suspected in starting a fire, clothing should be collected at the time of autopsy, and submitted for the detection and analysis of ignitable and fla mmable liquids. When investigating fire related deaths consider the following: - Can the body be visually identified or will scientific or circumstantial methods need to be employed to confirm identity? - What are the circumstances of the fire (hence m anner)? Investigation by the fire investigator is needed for this determination. - Are there physical or medical impairments that would hinder the individual from escaping the fire? Were there structural alterations to the home or car preventing escape ( bars on windows, doors locked, etc.) - What is the location and position of the body in the house, car, etc? Document the position of the body at the scene. - Examine area around and under body for weapons, gasoline cans, lighters, etc. Gunshot Wounds Investigations of firearm deaths are in essence a collaboration of scene investigation, ballistics and autopsy findings. From the autopsy, it is often possible to determine an estimated range of fire, potential for an intermediate target and trajectory r elative to the body in the anatomic position. Ballistics can help determine the weapon that was used to fire the fatal bullet. Scene investigation then must fill in all the gaps to determine the sequence of events that led up to the fatal shooting. 80 Keep in mind when examining the body of a gunshot wound victim, determining wounds of entrance and exit may be difficult in certain cases, especially without the benefit of cleaning the wound, good lighting, etc. It is all right to be unsure, just note the general location, and autopsy will determine the type of wound. Avoid classifying the wound (e.g., \"entrance gunshot wound,\" \"graze wound,\" etc.) Instead, describe the wound (e.g., \"circular defect to chest,\" \"linear gaping defect to the neck,\" etc.). Avoid touching or manipulating the wound. Do not clean the wound. Do not take possession of any firearm at the scene or send a firearm with the body. Ensure law enforcement secures and takes possession of any firearm found on scene. When moving the body for external examination or placing into a body bag, ensure projectiles do not fall from the decedent's clothing or possible exit wounds. When investigating gunshot wound deaths consider the following: - Document the type and caliber of firearm. - Do the number of casings found at the scene correlate with the number of entrance wounds and/or recovered bullets at the scene? - Based on witness accounts, room dimensions, blood stain patterns, etc. is there an estimated range of fire? - In cases of suici de: Where is the weapon in relation to the body? How many spent casings are in the cylinder or on the floor? Was the weapon owned by the decedent? Was the decedent familiar with the suspected firearm? Are there any known mechanical defects to the fire arm? Does there appear to be a contact gunshot wound? Is the entrance wound in a location that could be reached by the decedent? Was the decedent right - or left -hand dominant? - In cases of homicide: Are there multiple gunshot wounds? Are multiple shooters/weapons involved? Is there an intermediary target? - Cover the hands with paper bags and secured with tape prior to transport? - Does evidence of medical intervention exist? If so, ensure medical devices are not removed. - Were clothes removed? If so, every effort should be made to retrieve the clothing and transport them with the body so that they may be examined by the pathologist at the time of autopsy. Hanging The overwhelming majority of hanging deaths are suicides. Accidental hangings can occur at work, but the more common \"accidental\" hangings are due to sexual asphyxia. The presence of an escape mechanism in the case of a male decedent with pornographic ma terial nearby could indicate a sexual asphyxia death. Though it is very difficult to hang someone against their will, 81 special circumstances that should make the investigator suspicious of a homicide include an extremely intoxicated individual (i.e., BAC i n coma range), female with history of domestic abuse, or evidence of a struggle. Hangings can take place in any position (e.g., fully suspended, standing kneeling, seated, etc.) and at any height. The body does not have to be fully suspended. Transpor t the body to the morgue with the ligature remaining around the neck and send any remainder of the ligature with the body. The ligature should not be removed unless there is any possibility of resuscitation. If it is necessary to remove the ligature for this reason, the ligature should be preserved. This is best done by cutting the ligature away from the knot at the suspension point and securing the ends with string. The usual indicators of suicide still apply: Absence of signs of a struggle. Suicide note or suicidal ideation. Previous suicide attempts. History of depression, stressors, or substance abuse. Consider the following when investigating a hanging death: - Are the grooves and marks in the neck consistent with the way the body is s uspended? A horizontal or downward sloping groove on the lateral neck could indicate the possibility of ligature strangulation. - How is the body suspended? Fully or partially suspended? Are livor patterns consistent? Measure the height of the feet fro m the ground and the height of the structure supporting the ligature from the ground. Document any furniture or boxes that may have been used as a platform. - Are there any scratch marks around the ligature to indicate a struggle? - Is there an escape mec hanism, pornographic material, or previous markings where the ligature was secured (scratches on structural beam) to indicate sexual asphyxia? - Has the body been cut down prior to arrival of CME personnel? If so, it is imperative to interview the person who found the body in order to document suspension information discussed above. If the person is obviously dead, do not cut the ligature from the supporting structure until photographs have been taken and the scene documentation is complete. Homicide Homicide is defined for medical examiner purposes as a death directly caused by the action of another person or a death that occurs during the commission of a felony. The death should 82 stem from some kind of deliberate or purposeful action, but intent to ca use harm or death need not be present or proven for the medical examiner to rule a death as a homicide. Even this seemingly simple appearing category can become controversial for the medical examiner. Homicide, for the purposes of the medical examiner, is a medico -legal administrative ruling that may or may not equal murder. While all murders are homicides, not all homicides are murders. A team approach is the preferred method when investigating a homicide. Several law enforcement personnel may be presen t at the scene, so it is imperative that cooperation is exercised. Obtain permission before entering a scene and practice scene preservation. Ensure law enforcement personnel are aware of the arrival and departure of medical examiner personnel. In the case of a homicide in which the cause of death is relatively obvious, the investigation concentrates on determining the course of events that led up to the death. Evidence is collected; the scene is diagramed, measured and photographed. The CME/CM EI on the scene should identify the major areas of external trauma, document body position, and provide basic information for postmortem interval estimation from rigor and livor mortis. In homicide scene investigation, it is very important to accurately d ocument scene findings and circumstances in an objective manner. It is also important to refrain from documenting speculative or inferred findings or information. Bullet entrance and exit sites can be difficult to determine even in the well-lit and contr olled setting of the morgue. It is especially difficult in sub -optimal conditions at the scene. Do not guess. Since an autopsy will be performed, do not measure wounds or handle the body any more than necessary. The suspicious death is made more difficult because the cause of death is less likely to be straightforward. The general rule is to treat the death as if it was a homicide. Collection of evidence, photographs, diagrams, etc. is still performed. The adde d burden in these ambiguous cases is to consider multiple possibilities for cause and manner of death and immediately incorporate that into the scene investigation. With all homicide or potential homicide investigations, consider the following (some of these answers will be attainable through discussion with the investigating law enforcement agency): - Have the circumstances and events (as they are understood at the time) leading up to the death been documented? - Have the specific types and numbers of weapons as they are known been documented? Examples might include number and type of ammunition casings or recovered bullets at the scene, types of possible blunt instruments present at the scene that could have been used as a weapon or associated with th e death (bat, fire extinguisher, etc.). - Is there evidence of the body having been moved? Be sure to ask whether the body has been moved. 83 - Is livor pattern consistent with body position? Had EMS moved the body to initiate resuscitative measures or conf irm death? - Describe possible blood at the scene. What are the dimensions, quantities, and the location relative to the body? Is there possible blood on clothing? - Is there evidence of a struggle? Examples might include knocked over furniture, possibl e defensive wounds of the hands, or broken fingernails. - Has the body been inspected for trace evidence? If there is trace evidence that could be damaged or lost in transport, collect it and document specifically from where on the body or clothing it was recovered. - Has another investigating agency or emergency medical personnel removed or collected any clothing? If so, this should be documented and every effort should be made to have the clothing available for examination by the pathologist at the time of autopsy. - Are the hands or feet covered in paper bags prior to moving the body into the body bag? In-Custody Death The County Medical Examiner must be notified of all in -custody deaths . T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-108. Deaths that occur while a person is being pursued, apprehended, or incarcerated by law enforcement or involve medical detainees are usually considered high profile cases. These deaths require thorough and objective investigations in order to prove or disprove public scrutiny, family members' con cerns, and questions raised by the media. These cases have a high likelihood for civil and criminal litigation and they often have the potential for creating allegations of police or institutional misconduct. Any in -custody death that is other than nat ural should be sent to and autopsied by a forensic pathologist. Questions that usually arise in these types of deaths include: - Was excessive force used during restraint of a combative person? - Was a prisoner/patient beaten or otherwise abused? - Were suicidal precautions adequate given the decedent's history? - Was a prisoner/patient abused by other inmates? - Were the physical complaints of an inmate/patient attended to? - Was the quality of medical care adequate? - Is there a way to prevent deat hs like this in the future? 84 Many of these questions can be answered following the performance of a thorough death scene investigation, forensic autopsy with toxicology, and collaborating with other investigative agencies. The duties of the CME/CMEI i n investigating in -custody deaths should include the following: Visit the scene (jail cell, prison yard, patient room, etc.) where the incident occurred, even if the decedent was removed and taken to a local hospital. Document the scene through photog raphs and scene sketches with dimensions. Obtain copies of reports from police, the institution (jail, prison, etc.), EMS reports, time logs, statements from fellow inmates/patients, and any hospital/medical records of the decedent. Ascertain the deced ent's location, position, actions, and the timing of actions leading up to the death. If the decedent was removed prior to arrival, request officials who were present at the time of the incident or when the decedent was found to reenact what was observed . If a conducted electrical weapon (Taser, etc.) was used by law enforcement to help subdue the decedent, leave the barbs in place. If the barbs need to be removed for medical care or for other reasons, circle in permanent marker the location of the bar bs, and initial and date the areas. Obtain copies of any police car dash cam videos, police body camera videos, and/or jail, prison and institutional videos documenting the scene and incident. Leave any clothing and other personal effects on the body, as they are considered evidence. Leave any ligatures in place, unless attempts are made to start life -saving procedures . Do not disturb any knots along the entire length of the ligature. Ascertain any antemortem (admission) specimens immediately for t oxicological analysis. If death occurred in a jail, prison, or mental health institute, obtain copies of any and all recent patient logs, medication administration logs, incident reports and medical records pertaining to the decedent. Examine the body and document rigor mortis, livor mortis, and any trauma to the body. In cases where drug -induced excited delirium is expected, a rectal temperature should be taken immediately (consult forensic pathologist performing the autopsy before doing so). Also, note the room or environmental temperature. Place and transport the body in a labeled and sealed body bag. Remember... Avoid speculation and forming of premature conclusions. In all in -custody death cases, there should be prompt responses to inquiries; even if only to tell those inquiring that the case is pending the outcome of an investigation. It is considered best practice to have an independent law enforcement agency prov ide unbiased investigative services in these matters. The TBI may be brought into the investigation, but only at the request of local law enforcement or the county attorney. 85 When investigating in -custody deaths, always remember to take into consideratio n underlying natural disease, prior alcohol or drug ingestion, hidden trauma that occurred prior to incarceration, induced trauma while in -custody, drug -induced excited delirium, psychosis, and deaths resulting from use of restraint procedures. Institut ional Deaths Institutionalized adults may not be under the care of a physician and the death may fall under the jurisdiction of the county medical examiner. In Tennessee, the death of a person committed or admitted to a state mental health institute, a s tate resource center, a state training school, or other comparable institution, should be reported to and investigated by the county medical examiner. In addition to issues commonly investigated, particular concerns may arise with regard to the institutio n and their practices and processes involving care. Consider the following for these investigations: - Was the facility secure or non -secure? - Did the decedent have any recent visitors just prior to death? If yes, who were the visitors? - Immediately o btain copies of medical records, observation, and medication logs from the facility. - Secure and obtain video/security camera recordings from the facility (indoor and outdoor), if available. - Describe clothing and living conditions of the decedent. - Describe the degree of cleanliness and orderliness of the facility. - Note any use of restraints with other residents, as well as the decedent. - Inquire about use of any procedure(s) or equipment to restrain the decedent (has the equipment been removed?) - Was the institution/facility staff cooperative or evasive? Do they have concern for the decedent? - What levels of training and education do care providers have? What certifications do they have? - Is the institution or facility licensed? If yes, by who an d is licensing current? Obtain copies of the most current inspection record. - Has the institution or facility been reported to Tennessee Department of Mental Health & Substance Abuse Services in the last few years? If so, describe any founded and unfounded reports. 86 Motor Vehicle The involvement of the county medical examiner at the scene of a motor vehicle collision should be part of a team approach with law enforcement. It is the duty of the law enforcement agency to reconstruct the scene or accident. The main duty of the medic al examiner is the evaluation and documentation of injuries sustained by the collision. Evaluating injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision requires the ability to recognize and distinguish between blunt and sharp force trauma. These are the two m ost common types of injury that occur in all types of motor vehicle accidents. Blunt force injuries sustained by occupants of a motor vehicle can be complex to interpret. Many victims of motor vehicle accidents, particularly drivers, should be autopsied. This is especially relevant when the collision is the result of illegal activity, collision in the course of employment, or when the cause of the accident is unknown, as well as when the cause of death is not externally obvious. An effort should be made to correlate injury patterns diagnosed at autopsy with object(s) impacted in or on the vehicle. When investigating a motor vehicle collision, consider the following: - Who was the driver of the vehicle? In some cases, the distinction is not clear. S ome impaired or at -fault drivers have been known to report a deceased passenger as having been the driver. - What were the road conditions (visibility, weather, etc.)? - What type of roadway (concrete, asphalt, gravel, dirt, mud, etc.)? - What type of traf fic controls were in use (stop sign, electric signal, yield sign, etc.)? - What was the speed limit? What was the speed of surrounding traffic? Was there sudden congestion or stop -and-go traffic? - What was the direction of travel for the vehicle(s)? - Is there evidence of alcohol/drug use? - Were seatbelts in use? - Was the decedent extricated from the vehicle? - Was decedent ejected from the vehicle? - Did airbags deploy? - Was there evidence of distraction, such as a phone? Natural The investigation of natural deaths serves multiple purposes. However, foremost in priority in the scene investigation is to confirm that the death is really natural. Then information is collected to determine whether the death meets medical examiner jur isdiction and if so, whether an autopsy is warranted. In an unexpected and sudden death, especially in a young individual with no past medical history, an autopsy should be performed. The scene 87 investigation should focus on confirmation of identification , examination of the body, and the collection of the decedent's medical, social, and family history. Natural death investigations should consider the following: - Was the death witnessed or unwitnessed? - Is there any trauma to the body? - If found at home, was the residence secured? Signs of forced entry? Evidence of a struggle? - If at work, what was the decedent doing at the time of death? Are there any potential dangers (potential electrical contacts, etc.) in the vicinity? - Is there significant family or medical history? If so, what is that history? - Are the medications present with the decedent appropriate in numbers for the prescribed dosage? To who are the medications prescribed? - Any recent complaints about pains or illnesses? - Is the b ody decomposed? If so, autopsy may be necessary to confirm identification of decedent. - Is there a history of domestic violence? If an individual is found deceased outside a healthcare setting (e.g., home, yard, etc.), then that individual's death is deemed to have been \"unattended.\" A medical examiner or investigator should respond to the scene, perform an investigation, and complete the investigative form or ROI. Remember, the point of investigating apparent natural deaths is to confirm the death i s indeed natural. The subsequent investigation will determine whether an autopsy is required. If a person died while in a healthcare setting and they were under the care of a healthcare provider (e.g., emergency room, hospital inpatient, nursing home, h ospice, etc.), the death would be considered \"attended.\" If this type of death is reported and the investigation reveals no non -natural factors that may have contributed to the death, the death then does not meet medical examiner criteria. The Report of M edicolegal Death Investigation form should be completed. The death certificate should be completed by the physician responsible for the patient's care. Occupational / Farm An occupational fatality is any fatal event that occurs at work, including death on a farm. The decedent may be an employer, employee, or self -employed person, farmer, or family member helping with a business. Any death, natural or otherwise, that occurs during work will fall under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner. Many fact ors can contribute to the cause of death of an individual on the job (thermal, electrocution, drowning, etc.). These deaths should be reported to and investigated by the CME. 88 Employers are required to report any on the job death the Tennessee Occupatio nal Safety and Health Administration (TOSHA) at (800) 249-8510 . This information is used to research and identify common hazards in workplaces and on farms. In deaths that occur on the job, consider the following: - Where was the decedent found with r eference to any equipment in the area? - Was the decedent moved by anyone? Who? - What safety gear is generally required for working around this particular machinery or equipment? Was the proper equipment in use and secured properly? - What was the decedent supposed to be doing at the time of the incident? - Was the incident observed? - Was the decedent performing a task he/she was trained to do? - Were safety precautions posted in or around the machinery or equipment? Were precautions being followed? - What was the decedent's medical history? - Was any other person injured? - Was there thought to be any medication, drug, or alcohol involvement? - What was the current work schedule? Was the decedent working long hours or overtime that w ould cause fatigue? - Was this the usual type of work for the decedent? Were any unconventional shortcuts utilized that would be considered dangerous? Any involved equipment should be documented, including the year, make, model, and serial number for C onsumer Product Safety Commission report. In some circumstances, the equipment should be sent with the decedent for autopsy the forensic pathologist should be consulted in this regard. Pedestrian / Bicyclist The CME/CMEI should work closely with law enf orcement during these investigations. Vehicular crashes involving pedestrians/bicyclist can often be reconstructed with considerable accuracy by knowing characteristics of the person and the vehicle involved in the collision. Victims of pedestrians/bicycli st struck by motor vehicle s should be autopsied. When a pedestrian /bicyclist is struck by a motor vehicle there may be transferred paint, plastic, glass, or imprints from the suspect vehicle to the decedents clothing, skin or bicycle. Pedestrians will com monly have blunt force contusions and crushing injuries of their legs, torso, and buttocks. An autopsy will help to provide information on whether the vehicle was braking or not at the time of impact and may correlate injury patterns with the suspect vehic le. When investigating a pedestrian fatality consider the following: 89 - Was the pedestrian walking, standing or lying on the road at the time of the collision? - What was the direction of travel of the vehicle? Of the pedestrian? - For a bicyclist note the direction of travel and final position of the bicycle. - Were the vehicles brakes being applied at the moment of impact? - Did the driver see the pedestrians/bicyclist prior to the collision? - Is there evidence from the vehicle on the body or clothing of the decedent, such as paint or grease? - Is there evidence that the pedestrian was thrown up onto the vehicle (broken windshield, etc.)? - Are there probable impact sites on the vehicle? - Where did the pedestrian end up relative to the vehicle? Was he/she moved? - What type of clothing was the pedestrian wearing? Were high visibility/reflective clothing worn? - Did the vehicle stop at the scene? Are charges pending against the driver of the ve hicle? - If a bicyclist, were they wearing a helmet? Was the helmet damaged? Reflective clothing? - If at night, was the bicycle equipped with front and rear lights/reflector? - Was the bicycle using a bike lane? - How badly was the bicycle damaged? Suspected Se xual Assault In cases of suspected sexual assault, it is critical to preserve evidence on the body. In order to do so, additional steps taken at the scene include: -the hands should be placed in paper bags secured around the wrists; -oral or rectal te mperature should NOT be taken; -manipulation of the body should be kept to a minimum; and -the body should be wrapped in a clean white sheet prior to being placed in the body bag for transport. If a CME/CMEI wishes for a sexual assault kit to be collected, it is paramount that this be relayed to the regional forensic center when the death is initially reported to them to avoid inadvertent loss of evidence. If law enforcement wishes to retrieve fragile evidence from the body at the scene (e.g. a h air grasped in the hand; a paint chip on the clothing), the item to be collected should first be 90 photographed as it was found on the body, then placed into a sealed evidence container with proper documentation of chain of custody. The regional forensic center to which the decedent is sent is the best location for the collection of hair and body fluids from the decedent. It is not appropriate to perform an examination for sexual assault at the scene. The clothing is considered evidence and should remain as it is on the body for transport. The sexual assault kit typically consists of swabs to collect fluid from the mouth, anus, and vagina or penis; glass slides made using those swabs; pulled and combed head and pubic hairs; a blood sample from the deced ent; and clippings and scrapings of the fingernails. These are collected by the forensic pathologist at the regional forensic center and appropriately handled and stored. Law enforcement may then submit the kit for analysis to a laboratory, again with strict documentation of the chain of custody. Skeletal Remains The medical examiner should become involved any time there is a discovery of skeletal remains. It must be determined whether the skeletal remains are human or non -human; seek assistance from a forensic pathologist, forensic anthropologist, or someone with experience in analyzing human and non -human skeletal remains in making this determination. In addition, it must be ascertained whether the skeletal remains are of medicolegal significance. Pre historic bones and anatomical teaching specimens are generally not in the interest of law enforcement or the medical examiner. The location of the remains and any artifacts associated with them can be helpful in the determination of medicolegal significan ce. The Regional Forensic Center in your area should be contacted if skeletal remains are determined to be human or su spected to be human and can assist with making arrangements for anthropological assistance, scene recovery and interpretation of human remains, as may be appropriate. When investigating skeletal remains consider the following: - An anthropologist may be available for consultation, identification of remains/burial site, and collection or excavation of the remains. - The scene must be def ined and documented. This could be confined to a single burial or cover a large surface scatter of skeletal remains. - Systematic and comprehensive search techniques must be utilized to ensure maximal evidence recovery. - Construction of a grid will assis t in the systematic excavating and documentation of the area. 91 - Articles of clothing (buttons, zippers, man -made fabrics, etc.) and personal artifacts should be sought. - Soil samples under fairly intact remains should be collected for potential toxicology testing. - Document the location of a retrieved bone or piece of evidence photographically and by mapping, or scene sketch with measurements referenced to the location of at least two permanent fixtures, such as a large boulder, roadway, or telephone pole . - Bones may be brittle, and should be cushioned and packaged with care for transport. - Aerial photography may also be employed when human skeletal remains are found. This technique is used to document surface terrain / topography and the scene's relati onship to the surrounding area and environment. Sports Related Sports related deaths usually occur sudd enly and without warning and are almost certainly unexpected. These deaths usually occur in young and/or healthy individuals and therefore should be autopsied. When investigating a sports related death, consider the following: - What type of sport was the decedent involved in? - Was the sport played indoors or outdoors? - Describe the playing surface. - If outdoors, describe the weather. - Was the accident or injury caused by an instrument or piece of equipment used by the decedent or another player? - Did the death occur while in contact with another player? - If safety equipment is required for this sport, describe in detail, and indicate whether the decedent was dressed appropriately at the time of incident. - What was the level of experience of the decedent in this sport? - Was the decedent ever injured previously in this or any other sport? If yes, were they seen and released by a physician to continue activity? Specify dates and injuries. - What is the school or team policy for post -injury re -entry? - Was the decedent taking any medication, either legal or illegal? - Was the decedent taking any homeopathic or natural supplements, using steroids, or consuming high -energy sports drinks? - If this is a water sport, refer to section on drowning for further information if needed. - Was protective clothing or gear used? Obtain make, model, and description. 92 Stab Wounds The scene investigation of stab wounds is a very important adjunct to the autopsy. Some stab wounds do not necessarily injure a vital organ (e.g., a leg or arm i s stabbed). The volume estimate of blood at the scene due to blood loss from the decedent can be very helpful. When investigating a stab wound death, consider the following: - Are there defensive cuts on the upper extremities? - Are there multiple superficial hesitation marks on the wrists or around the fatal wound? - Is there a large pool of blood around the decedent? Estimate volume. - Is the blood in several locations? Are there droplets that may represent cast -off? - If ther e was emergency medical intervention, were clothes removed and were stab wounds altered or sutured (did the thoracotomy incision go through a stab wound, was a stab wound used for a chest tube insertion site, etc.)? Obtain all medical records that documen t the intervention and the location of the original wounds. Every effort should be made to retrieve the clothing and transport them with the body so that they may be examined by the pathologist at the time of autopsy. - Is the weapon still at the scene? If so, it should be collected as evidence either by law enforcement or by the medical examiner and brought to the autopsy. When collecting and transporting the weapon, it is imperative that it is handled carefully and correctly to preserve any latent prin ts or DNA evidence. - Cover the hands with paper bags and secured with tape to preserve evidence prior to transport? Suicide Suicides can be the most difficult and time -consuming cases facing the medical examiner. The strong emotions based on religious and moral objections to suicide combined with the loss of a loved one can make it very difficult for a family member to accept the determination of manner of death as suicide . In addition, some homicides may be staged to appear as suicides. Therefore, careful and complete investigation in the beginning can save a lot of trouble and time in the end. Determining the manner of d eath as suicide relies on implicit evidence the individual had the means and intent to kill themself. It should be understood that a \"suicide note\" is found in only a minority of all suicide deaths. Additionally, evidence that contradicts the manner being suicide should be sought. Consider the following when investigating a presumed suicide: 93 - Is there evidence of a struggle (room disarray, knocked over furniture, etc.)? - Is the building or room secure? Document presence or absence of locks on doors and windows. Did police have to break in to gain entry into the room or building? - Are weapons near the body? Document the position of any weapon in relation to the body. - Is there a past psychiatric history? Be specific about recent versus remote his tories of depression. Was the individual ever treated for depression or other psychiatric illness? - Have there been any previous suicide attempts or threats? Method? Look for linear scars or hesitation marks on the wrists for physical evidence of previ ous suicide attempts. - Is there a social history of financial difficulties, marital problems, poor work or school review, or anniversary of the death of a loved one? - Is there a suicide note? Suicide notes may not necessarily be in the immediate vicinit y or same address as the body. Consider the location of suicide notes on electronic devices, such as computers or cell phones. Be sure to make a copy of the note to retain. If necessary, the signature and writing may be compared with other known documen ts. - Examine and photograph the hands. Bag the hands at the scene if necessary to preserve evidence. - In the case of an overdose, are there paraphernalia or prescription medicine containers? Send paraphernalia with law enforcement so that the contents c an be tested. Document all prescription drugs and determine whether pills remaining are appropriate for the prescription. Complete a Medication Log. OTHER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES CERTIFICATION OF DEATH General Considerations Death certificates are the source of data for regional, state, and national mortality statistics and are used to allocate funding for scientific research, direct public health efforts, and assess the efficacy of preventative initiatives. In addition, a completed death certific ate is required before a body can be buried or cremated, and is necessary for survivors to collect insurance benefits, transfer property, and the like. Erroneously completed death certificates may result in denial of payments to the decedent's heirs. Cer tification of death by the county medical examiners and treating physicians should follow the guidelines established by the Tennessee Department of Health and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The NCHS keeps statistics on all deaths that o ccur in the Unit ed States. 94 Tennessee law dictates that the \"physician in charge of the patient's care for the illness that resulted in death\" in non -medical examiner cases complete and sign the death certificate if that physician had treated or evaluated t he deceased within the four months prior to death. This holds true even if that physician was not physically present at the time of death. Of course, a treating physician may also certify deaths of patients which occur more than four months after the deced ent was last seen by him or her. Supervising physicians are responsible for certifying natural deaths of patients treated by nurse practitioners or physicians' assistants under their supervision, even if the physician never treated the patient. Failure to comply can result in disciplinary action by the Board of Medical Examiners. Treating physicians, including consultants (e.g., cardiologists, oncologists) and emergency room physicians, may also certify death given knowledge of the medical history of the deceased. Completion of the death certificate is the final act of care a treating physician can deliver to a patient; avoid ance or failure to do so in a timely, accurate manner will cause undue distress to surviving family members. The medical certificati on of death is to be completed within 48 hours of pronouncement of death. Physicians acting in good faith when completing death certificates are immune from civil suit . T.C.A. \u00a7 68-3-513 County medical examiners are responsible for complet ing the medical certification of death for cases falling under medical examiner jurisdiction as detailed in T.C.A. \u00a7 38-7-108(a), as well as for natural deaths in which the treating physician refuses to sign a death certificate because more than four months h ave elapsed since the decedent was last evaluated by him or her. The county medical examiner is not responsible for certifying deaths in cases in which a treating physician has failed to arrange coverage for clinical responsibilities while on vacation and is not to be used as a death certification service for natural deaths which do not fall under medical examiner jurisdiction. In Tennessee, the date and time of death are determined by the date and time in which death is pronounced. That is, if a person i s discovered in a state of advanced decomposition, the official date and time of death will be when death is officially pronounced and should not be estimated or otherwise approximated based on postmortem changes. Similarly, the place in which a body is f ound dead is to be listed as the place of death, even if the fatal injury or event occurred elsewhere. In cases in which a person is pronounced brain dead, the date and time of brain death is the official date and time of death. T.C. A. \u00a7 68-3-501 et seq. The medical certification of death may only be amended once on a death certificate by the county medical examiner or the physician who originally certified death. To do so the physician or county medical examiner must file a notarized affidavit with the Tennessee Office of Vital Records (sample affidavit included in Appendix C). Cause of Death versus Mechanism of Death The cause of death statement is used to indicate the medical cause of death and should list the anatomic disease(s), injury or injuries t hat caused death. The cause of death and the 95 mechanism of death, the physiologic process leading to death, are often incorrectly used interchangeably on the death certificate. Mechanisms of death are not specific to any given disease process. For exampl e, the mechanism of death for a person who is shot in the head may be exsanguination or hypoxic brain injury or ventricular dysrhythmia; the cause of death is simply gunshot wound of the head. A middle -aged cystic fibrosis patient may die with septic shoc k or right heart failure or a mucus plug; however, the underlying cause of death is correctly listed as cystic fibrosis. Many, if not most or all, cases of \"aspiration pneumonia\" occur in neurologically compromised patients; in this population, the diseas e process causing the neurologic impairment should be listed as the underlying cause of death (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer's type; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; cerebrovascular accident due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). According to the Ce nters for Disease Control and Prevention, the below -listed diagnoses should not be listed on a death certificate as the underlying cause of death. If listed in Part I, an underlying cause of death must follow. Abscess Abdominal hemorrhage Adhesions Adult respiratory distress syndrome Acute Anemia Atrial fibrillation Bacteremia Bedridden obstruction Brain injury Brain stem herniation Carcinogenesis Carcinomatosis Cardiac arrest Cardiac dysrhythmia herniation Chronic bedridden state Cirrhosis Coagulopathy Compression fracture Congestive heart failure Convulsions Decubiti Dehydration Dementia (when not otherwise specified) Diarrhea Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy Dysrhythmia End stage liver disease End stage renal disease Epidural hematoma Exsanguination Failure to thrive Fracture Myocardial infarction Necrotizing soft tissue infection Old age Open (or closed) head injury Pancytopenia Paralysis Perforated gallbladder Peritonitis Pleural effusions Pneumonia Pulmonary arrest Pulmonary edema Pulmonary embolism Pulmonary insufficiency Renal failure Respiratory arrest Seizures Septic shock Shock Starvation hematoma Subarachnoid Ventricular tachycardia Volume depletion97 Tennessee Death Certificate: Medical Certification of Death Manner of Death The manner of death represents the county medical examiner's opinion as to which category the death best fits into and is based on the circumstances surrounding the death. The manner of death is an objective assessment of the event(s) lea ding to death based upon facts of the individual case and the professional experience of the county medical examiner and should not be construed as a moral or ethical judgement of the decedent by the certifier. The medical examiner should follow consisten t policies rather than change them to fit individual case circumstances. The five options for completion of the manner of death in Tennessee are Natural, Accident, Suicide, Homicide, and Could Not Be Determined. Pending Investigation, a sixth option on th e Tennessee death certificate, should be considered only a temporary assignment of manner and should be changed as soon as the case investigation is complete. It is not necessary or appropriate to choose \"Pending investigation\" if the only information unavailable at the time of certification is whether criminal charges will be brought in a given case. That is, if death is due to injuries clearly inflicted by another person, even if in a case of self-defense or justifiable homicide, the death should be cla ssified as Homicide regardless of prosecutorial intent. All deaths should be classified as to manner, and only one manner of death is to be chosen. 98 Natural Natural deaths are those due exclusively (100%) to disease and/or the aging process. A death in which a discrete, unnatural act contributes in any way towards the death, regardles of the interval elapsed between the event and demise, cannot be considered a natural death. In general, if death is a result of a combination of natural disease and non -natural factors, preference is given to the non -natural factors in determining manner of death (e.g. cerebral hemorrhage associated with acute cocaine abuse). Deaths due to chronic substance abuse (e.g. endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser; cirrhosis in an alcoholic) in which a single or discrete intoxication event cannot be identified as directly leading to death are classified as natural. Accident Accident is defined as an unnatural death resulting from an inadvertent chance happening. Motor vehicl e fatalities are considered an accident unless the driver deliberately uses the vehicle as a weapon or as a means to commit suicide. Classification of motor vehicle fatalities as accidents is done in the interest of uniformity for vital statistical purpos es and bears no relation to the presence or absence of criminal charges arising from the motor vehicle fatality. Specifically, even in instances of driving while intoxicated, reckless driving, or hit -and-run fatalities, when the driver bears criminal resp onsibility, the county medical examiner should still classify such deaths as accidents in the interest of uniformity. Such a classification will not preclude criminal prosecution or civil charges. Deaths due to acute drug intoxication or alcohol poisoning, in the absence of evidence specifically supporting the conclusion of the manner of death being homicide or suicide, should be classified as an accident. This is done as the presumed common intent to become intoxicated is not the same as having intent to die. The fatal outcome was unintentional. The National Center for Health Statistics assigns ICD -10 codes to death certificates for vital statistics. As such, it is important to list each drug f elt to be contributory to death on the death certificate [e.g., \"acute combined drug toxicity (heroin, alprazolam, and ethanol)]\" for improved data collection. Use of \"toxicity\", \"intoxication\", \"overdose\", \"ingested\", \"injected\" or \"inhaled\" wi ll be assigned a statistical code indicating that the event was non -natural. In contradistinction, the terms \"abuse\", \"addiction\", \"dependence\", or \"use\" without other indication of an acute poisoning event on the certificate will be coded as natural. Suicide Suicide is defined for medical examiner purposes as a death from self -inflicted injury with some form of explicit or implicit evidence of intent to harm oneself. The burden of proof need not be \"beyond any reasonable doubt\" but should be \"more likel y than not\". 99 Death cases involving so called \"games\", such as \"Russian Roulette\" can be highly controversial as the legal view of intent may differ from that of the medical examiner. The Merriam -Webster Dictionary defines \"Russian Roulette\" as \"a danger ous game consisting of spinning the cylinder of a revolver loaded with one cartridge, pointing the muzzle at one's own head, and pulling the trigger\". These types of \"games\" are most often ruled suicide because the act of placing a loaded gun to the head and pulling the trigger is a volitional act that carries a high risk of death and implies \"subintent,\" an understanding of the probable consequences. Homicide Homicide, for the purposes of the medical examiner, is simply \"death at the hands of another\" that may or may not have criminal liability attached to it. In other words, homicide does not equal murder. The intent to cause death need not be present or be proven for the medical examiner to rule as homicide. While all murders are homicides, not all ho micides are murders. At controversy are deaths at the hands of law enforcement which may result from the discharge of a firearm or physical restraint used to subdue. These cases as should be classified as homicides. Could Not Be Determined Could not be determined should be a category that is rarely used and reserved for those cases in which an exhaustive investigation, including forensic autopsy, has been performed. An effort to develop sufficient information to classify an unnatural death as homicide, suicide, or accident should be made in every death case. If there is little available information about the circumstances surrounding the death, or the known information equally supports more than one manner of death, then it can be appropria te to use could not be determined. This category should not be used for cases that are controversial in an attempt to avoid a dispute or publicity caused by a more appropriate ruling on manner. Pending Investigation This temporary category should be use d for cases where the results of the investigation, autopsy, and/or laboratory studies are not quickly available. This will fulfil the T.C.A. requir ement that a death certificate be filed within five (5) days of death and will allow the next of kin to arr ange burial or cremation, and to begin the legal and administrative routines when a death occurs. After completion of the investigation, a Delayed Report of Diagnosis - Death, with the actual cause and manner of death, should be promptly completed and fil ed with the health department of the county in which death occurred.

Notification of death is usually performed by law enforcement and, often, prior to the medical examiner's involvement with the case. However, there are circumstances in which the medical examiner can facilitate the notification process. The medical examiner must make sure that documentation of the notice to next of kin accompanies the body to the regional forensic center if autopsy is requested. T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-106(a) st ates, The authority ordering the autopsy shall notify the next of kin about the impending autopsy if the next of kin is known or reasonable ascertainable. The sheriff or other law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction shall serve process containing such notice and return such process within twenty -four (24) hours. T.C.A. \u00a7 62 -5-703 defines next of kin in order of: 1. A person designated by the deceased in a written document executed during such persons lifetime; 2. Decedent's spouse; 6. Decedent's extended family (grandchildren, grandparents); 7. The guardian of the decedent at the time of death, if one had been appointed; or 8. Any other person authorized or under obligation to dispose of the body. ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATIONS The Role of the CME and CMEI in Donation Medical examiners and investigators play a crucial role in the donation process. It is estimated that as many as 70% of potential donors, fall under medical examiner jurisdiction. While not require d to do so under the T.C.A. , the medical examiner or investigator may have a direct impact on donation by referring deaths that occur outside of a hospital to Tennessee Donor Services or Mid -South Transplant Foundation. In doing so, they enable all Tennesseans to have the opportunity to participate in tissue and eye donation. It is the position of the National Association of Medical Examiners and the Scientific Working Group for Medicolegal Death Investigation that the procurement of o rgans and/or tissues for transplantation can occur in almost all cases falling under their jurisdiction without a negative impact to the goals of medicolegal death investigation. The Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) in Tennessee are committed to co llaborating with medical examiner to ensure that all requirements for a medicolegal investigation are met while honoring the donation decisions of individuals and their families. OPOs in Tennessee will 107 work directly with county medical examiner offices to develop procedures to ensure that medical examiner needs are met while still preserving the opportunity for donation. What organs/tissues can be donated? Organs that can be donated for transplantation include the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, and small intestine. Tissue that can be donated for transplant includes corneas, bone, tendon, skin, veins, and heart valves. What are the eligibility criteria for tissue donation? Criterion for tissue donation eligibility changes frequently due to ch anges in tissue processor requirements and regulations. What may rule out donation today may not rule out donation tomorrow. Tissues can be recovered up to 24 hours after death when the body is cooled within 12 hours. For more information on donation re fer to the Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act T.C.A . \u00a7 68- 30-101. To contact Tennessee Donor Services http://tds.dcids.org , and Mid -South Transplant Foundation visit http://midsouthtransplant.org UNCLAIMED BODIES For the purposes of this section, \"unclaimed\" and \"unidentified\" are not equivalent terms. Unclaimed decedents are those whose identification is known , but next of kin is either unknown, unable to be located, fail or refuse to make arrangements for final disposition. Unidentified decedents are those whose identity cannot be established by medical examiners or law enforcement. Deaths in which \"the identity of the person is unknown or unclear\" be reported to the county medical examiner. T.C.A \u00a7 38-7-108 Medical Examiner Cases Disposition of a decedent whose death was accepted under medical examiner jurisdiction is the responsibility of the county medical examiner in which death occurred or was pronounced . If the body is unclaimed after investigation by the county medical examiner, the body may be cremated or decently buried as directed under T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -4-113 which requires \"(1) proper notice gi ven in accordance with \u00a7 68 -4-103 (b)(2); and (2) the body is held for the time period provided in \u00a7 68 -4-103 (c)\". 108 If the body is unclaimed after investigation by the medical examiner investigator, it may be cremated or decently buried using funds from the county treasury or the proceeds of the sale of property found with the body . T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -5-118 The chief m pursuant to T.C.A. \u00a7 38 -7-102, OSCME, in order to promote medical and surgical science, shall direct the disposition of unclaimed dead bodies of persons who die in any charitable or penal institution, or are to be buried at public expense, except those of honorably discharged veterans. \"(a) The chief medical examiner, upon receiving the bodies or notification of the availability of the bodies as provided in this chapter, shall distribute them among the medical, dental and anthropo logic institutions of this state regularly chartered and in active operation as prescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 68 -4-102 - - 68-4-109, and shall not give, sell or deliver any body to any other person, firm, society, association or corporation; (b) Bodies shall be distrib uted by the chief medical examiner to the institution that is closest to the location of the body and that has indicated a current need for bodies for the purposes authorized by this chapter.\" T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -4-104 \"(12) In the absence of any person listed i n subdivisions (1) -(11), any other person willing to assume the responsibilities to act and arrange the final disposition of the decedent's remains, including the funeral director with custody of the body, after attesting in writing that a good faith effor t has been made to no avail to contact the individuals listed in subdivisions (1) -(11)\". T.C.A. \u00a7 62 -5-703 Unidentified remains should not be cremated. Non -Medical Examiner Cases A decedent whose death does not meet the criteria as set forth in T.C.A.\u00a7 38 -7-108 for medical examiner jurisdiction does not automatically become a medical examiner case if they remain unclaimed by next of kin or if next of kin are unable to be located. T.C.A.\u00a7 68 -4-101 provides that if a person dies in a medical facil ity or public institution, and the next of kin are unavailable, unknown, or fail or refuse to summon an undertaker, after eight (8) hours have elapsed since death, the medical facility or public institution may do so. If the body remains unclaimed by the next of kin for 96 hours or more the institution is to notify the Office of the State Chief Medical Examiner. The OSCME may make a demand for the body, decline to make a demand for the body or direct the body to be embalmed. The OSCME is responsible for reasonable compensation of the funeral home or embalmer in this circumstance. If the OSCME fails to direct that the body be embalmed within 72 hours of notification, then the body may be cremated or buried as directed by T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -4-113. The expense f or burial or cremation is the responsibility of the institution where death occurred. 109 Veterans Honorably discharged veterans, who are unclaimed by next of kin or whose next of kin is unable to be located, regardless of the circumstances or jurisdiction of death, shall be interred as directed by the commissioner of veterans services, or the commissioner's representative, superseding other provisions of T.C.A. \u00a7 68 -4-102 - - 68-4-109. National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUS) The National In stitute of Justice's National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUS) is a national central database and resource center for missing persons, unclaimed persons, and unidentified decedents. NamUS is a free online system that can be searched by anyo ne including medical examiners, coroners, law enforcement and the general public (NamUS.gov). NamUS consists of three separate databases that are automatically cross -matched for similar cases or matches and can be searched by anyone including the general public. The Missing Persons database contains information that can be entered by anyone including t he families of missing persons. The Unidentified Persons database contains information entered by medical examiner personnel for persons who, after the investigation, remain unidentified. The Unclaimed Persons database contains information entered by med ical examiner personnel for person who are identified but next of kin is unknown or not located prior to disposition. Medical examiner personnel who register for NamUS should register for all three (3) databases . For a decedent sent to a Regional Forensi c Center for autopsy, consult with the RFC NamUS representative concerning case entry into the database. A decedent not sent for autopsy can be registered by the RFC NamUS representative or OSCME personnel. County medical examiner personnel who wish to register for NamUS should contact: Amy Dobbs - Regional Systems Administrator National Missing and Unidentified Persons System ( NamUS 38 -7-101 to 201 38-7-101.

(a) A county medical examiner may perform or order an autopsy on the body of any person in a case involving a homicide, suspected homicide, a suicide, a violent, unnatural or suspicious death, an unexpected apparent natural death in an adult, sudden unexpected infant and child deaths, deaths believed to represent a threat to public health or saf ety, and executed prisoners. When the county medical examiner decides to order an autopsy, the county medical examiner shall notify the district attorney general and the chief medical examiner. The chief medical examiner or the district attorney general ma y order an autopsy in such cases on the body of a person in the absence of the county medical examiner or if the county medical 114 examiner has not ordered an autopsy. The district attorney general may order an autopsy in such cases on the body of a person in the absence of the county medical examiner or the failure of the county medical examiner to act. The authority ordering the autopsy shall notify the next of kin about the impending autopsy if the next of kin is known or reasonably ascertainable. The sheri ff or other law enforcement agency of the jurisdiction shall serve process containing such notice and return such process within twenty -four (24) hours. (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), if a request is received from an authorized official of a not - for-profit corporation chartered under the laws of the state, or authorized to do business in the state and certified by the Eye Bank Association of America to obtain, store and distribute donor eyes and eye tissues to be used for corneal transplants, for rese arch and for other medical purposes, the county medical examiner may permit, at any time, the removal of the cornea or corneal tissue from the body of a deceased person in accordance with title 68, chapter 30, part 1.
