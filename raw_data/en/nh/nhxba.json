Hepatitis B is the world's most comm on serious liver infection. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that atta cks liver cells and can lead to liver failure, cirrhosis (scarring) or cancer of the liver late r in life. Hepatitis B is transmitted through blood, unprotected sex, use of unsterile nee dles, and from an infected mother to her newborn during the delivery process. It is no t transmitted casually through the air or superficial social contact. Approximately 90% of healthy adul ts who are exposed to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) recover on their own and develop protective antibodies. However, 10% of infected adults, 50% of infected children, and 90% of infected babies are unable to get rid of the virus and develop chronic infection. These people need furt her evaluation by a liver specialist or doctor knowledgeable about hepatitis B. Am I at risk for a hepatitis B infection? Health care workers who come into contact with human blood, blood products, or potentially infectious bodily fluids are at an increased risk for exposure to the hepatitis B virus. How can I protect myself as a health care worker? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all health care workers, emergency personnel, and other individuals who are exposed to blood or body fluids on the job, should be vacci- nated against hepatitis B. The vaccine is safe and effective and can protect you for a life- time. The vaccine is given in three doses ov er a 6 month period (0, 1, and 6 months). It is recommended that health care workers have their hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) level tested 4-6 weeks after completion of the se ries, to make sure that they have built up protection against HBV. Once a blood test shows that a health care wo rker is protected, the CDC does not recommend routine antibody testing or vaccine boos ters. However, each health care institution may have its own hepatitis B vaccine prot ocol. If a person does not develop the protective antibodies after completion of the vaccine series, then the entire se ries should be repeated (wit h antibody testing 4-6 weeks after completion of the additional second series). What if I am exposed to the virus? For unvaccinated individuals who think they have been exposed to hepatitis B, it is recommended t hat they speak to their doctor about \"post- exposure prophylaxis\" as soon as possible. If the source of the exposure is known to be positive for hepatitis B, then the exposed person should receive the first dose of the vac- cine and one dose of HBIG as soon as possible ( within 24 hours if possibl e). After that, the remaining 2 doses of the vaccine can be given 1 and 6 months after the first dose. About one-two months after the vaccine series is comp leted, it is a good idea to get tested to de- termine whether the person developed protective antibodies. If the hepatitis B status of the source is un- known and the exposed person is unvaccinated, it is recommended that they begi n the hepatitis B vac- cine series as soon as possible.

The test that is used to help y ou understand your hepatitis B status is called the 3-part hepatitis B blood panel. This is a simple 3-par t blood test that your doctor can order. Only one sample of bloo d is needed. The 3-part panel c ontains the following information: 1) Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) - this tests di rectly for the presence of hepatitis B virus. It should be negative if there is NO virus present. 2) Hepatitis B surface Antibody (HBsAb or anti-HBs) - this tests for the production of protective antibodies against the hepatitis B virus. This blood test should be posi tive if the protective antibodies are produced in response to either vaccination or re covery from a natural infection. 3) Hepatitis B core Antibody (HBcAb or anti-HBc) - th is antibody does not provid e any protection, but only refers to a part of the virus itse lf. A positive test result may indi cate whether a person has been exposed to the hepatitis B virus or not. This test must be interpreted in rela tion to the above 2 test results. Tests Results Interpretation Recommendation When you get your test results, request a written copy so that you fully understand what tests were ordered and the actual results of each. Be sure to have your doctor cl early explain the results so that you fully understand your situation. Visi t our website at www.hepb.org/SDWLHQWV\u0012\\RXUBbloodBtests for more information.
