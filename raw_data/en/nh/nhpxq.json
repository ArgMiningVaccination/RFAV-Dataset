Her blood count was low, and her blood pressure was high. But no matter how many times she returned and no matter how many tests she took, they could find nothing wrong. She insisted that she had chronic fatigue syndrome, at a time when the medical profession did not generally accept that as a real condition. Doctors said the problem was stress. It was only after she had developed breast cancer and had a mastectomy that Mrs. Telberg, of Sag Harbor, decided that the doctors had let her down. \"While they kept telling me it was all in my head, my immune system was weakening to the point that I got cancer,\" she said. At that point, even as she began chemotherapy, Mrs. Telberg saw a doctor who practices \"alternative medicine\" and was put on a regimen of intravenous Vitamin C. Mrs. Telberg said she had sailed through her chemotherapy with no problems and within a few weeks felt more energy than she had enjoyed in years. Survey by New England Journal Mrs. Telberg is one instance in what appears to be a growing number of Long Islanders who are seeking alternative treatments as adjuncts to their regular family physicians' diagnoses and treatment. According to a study of 1,539 Americans by The New England Journal of Medicine -- the first study of its kind -- 34 percent of those questioned said they had used at least one unconventional therapy in 1990 for complaints like backaches, anxiety and headaches. Those people, in fact, made more visits to providers of unconventional medicine than to primary-care physicians. The cost of the treatments totaled $13.7 billion, with one-fourth covered by insurance or governmental sources. One of the most widely used \"alternative\" approaches, chiropractic, which is based on the theory that disease is caused by interference with nerve function and manipulates the joints to restore normal nerve function, has moved from a perception of semiquackery to respectability. New York State began licensing chiropractors in 1965. Third-party insurers began reimbursements for treatment about 20 years ago. Other forms of \"alternative\" medicine have not achieved that degree of acceptance, and the medical establishment remains skeptical of many of the treatments. The study for The New England Journal of Medicine found that most customers of unconventional therapies were upper-income educated whites between 25 and 49. Most had sought treatment for their problems from medical doctors, but 72 percent said they had not informed their medical doctor that they had done so. The study's definition of unconventional treatment was rather broad, but limited to 16 commonly used interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in hospitals. The methods included chiropractic, massage, herbal medicine, megavitamin therapy, acupuncture and homeopathy, which is based on the theory of like-cures-like in small doses. Although many doctors of traditional medicine recognize some alternatives like biofeedback, they are slow to embrace the wider spectrum. \"I'm not a hard-liner,\" said Dr. Daryl Altman, an allergist and medical director of the Food Allergy Center in Lynbrook. Dr. Altman who is also a spokeswoman for the 27,000-member Medical Society of the State of New York, said she regularly recommended relaxation techniques and nutritional therapy for her patients, treatments that are sometimes considered alternative. But, she added, there are other treatments that are so far out that she fears that they could be dangerous. \"My concern is that alternative medicine is not held to the same standard as traditional treatments,\" she said. \"Which means doing double- blind studies, using placebos for some patients and not for others and holding these practitioners up to peer review. It's the type of scientific scrutiny that kept Thalidomide out of this country.\" Tending to Needs Dr. Altman agreed that The New England Journal of Medicine study suggested that many patients believed that their doctors were not dealing well with their psychological and social needs and that was an area that needed to be addressed. \"Alternative practitioners are very good at making people feel warm and good,\" she said. \"They're saying to these patients: 'You're not crazy. I understand. I care.' \" But, Dr. Altman added, \"Sometimes they're validating things that are not true.\" She said she did not doubt that many alternative methods worked, but reiterated, \"Prove it.\" On Long Island the growing appeal of alternative medical treatment can be seen in a variety of areas, the growing number of practitioners, their extensive advertising, the number of users, heightened interest in training for the fields and even, some people say, in the increasing number of health-food stores, which provide a forum for those dissatisfied with traditional treatments. Instruction in Syosset One example of growth is the New Center for Wholistic Health Education and Research in Manhasset, which outgrew its headquarters and moved to a larger building in Syosset. Among its services are training in massage therapy, which began in 1981 with 25 students. In the last three years enrollment has doubled, from 150 to 300. Students who complete the course are eligible for licensing by the state. The center also offers courses in herbal medicine and holistic training for nurses and is also the first in the state to be approved to teach acupuncture. The president of the center, Steve Schenkman, is also chairman of the State Board of Professional Licensing for Massage Therapy. He said many people were confused by what is alternative therapy, who has to be licensed and what treatments are regulated by the state. Essentially, Mr. Schenkman said, a person is licensed to \"touch,\" which might mean chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy or other licensed procedures and may practice alternatives under that umbrella. For example, reflexology, an ancient Chinese and Egyptian technique in which the feet are considered to be maps of the entire body, is not in itself a licensed procedure. But other licensed practitioners can incorporate reflexology in their practice. Mr. Schenkman said, however, there were many people practicing reflexology or similar healing who are not licensed. If they say they are providing medical treatment, he said, they are technically breaking the law. That does not necessarily mean that the people are not qualified, Mr. Schenkman continued. Many may have had extensive training in other states where such treatments are licensed, Mr. Schenkman said, adding: \"If they do not fall under the licensing law, find out if they belong to a national organization. If they do, they at least meet the requirements of their profession.\" Chiropractic medicine is an example of how attitudes have changed, said Dr. Robert Hoffman, executive officer of the New York State Chiropractic Council, which has 4,000 members. \"It was only in 1965 that chiropractors were licensed by New York,\" Dr. Hoffman said, adding that the change followed a suit against the American Medical Association. Chiropractors do not see themselves as alternative practitioners, Dr. Hoffman said, but as a bridge between traditional medicine and alternatives. Many chiropractors recommend other alternative therapies. \"Chiropractic is not a treatment in itself,\" he added. \"It's a life style that follows certain laws to health and well-being.\" Following closely is acupuncture, for which the state changed its licensing requirements. Previously only medical doctors could be certified to practice acupuncture. But in the last year the state has begun to license acupuncturists who had completed more than 4,000 hours of training. According to the state, Long Island has 37 licensed acupuncturists plus 54 who are also licensed medical doctors. Nine dentists are certified to practice acupuncture, and more are going through the licensing process. Acupuncture has been particularly effective in pain control, and many patients who seek it have tried many other treatments. \"Most of my patients have had problems for four or five years,\" Dr. Maxima Chua of Smithtown said. \"They come to me when nothing else has worked.\"With a Variety of Approaches Trained in surgery and acupuncture in the Philippines, Dr. Chua studied anesthesiology when he moved to the United States. About 12 years ago he began to incorporate acupuncture into his practice to manage pain, adding herbology and homeopathy to complement it. Dr. Chua said an alternative practitioner approached a patient as a whole rather than working on a particular ailment. \"Patients may have been treated for something by their doctors, but something is missing, maybe another condition that was not diagnosed,\" he said. Dr. Chua said in his experience most insurers would reimburse patients for acupuncture used to manage pain. They will not, however, pay for the treatment if it is for unapproved purposes. Dr. Serafina Corsello, a physician who was trained in Italy but who has practiced here for 32 years, has concentrated on alternative medicine for 20 years. For some patients in her office in Huntington Dr. Corsello uses chelation therapy, a procedure used since the 1950's to remove lead from the blood. Studies suggest that chelation also reverses symptoms of hardening of the arteries. Dr. Corsello said that many doctors who practiced alternative medicine have had great success with chelation therapy, but that insurers do not recognize it as a treatment and refuse to pay for it. \"My patients are blackballed,\" Dr. Corsello said. \"As soon as the insurance company sees my name on the top of the form they deny payment.\" Removal of Lead From Blood Dr. Corsello has been named to the new Office of Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. She said she hoped that through the office treatments like chelation would be recognized as valid alternatives for certain patients with coronary diseases. The new agency is one more indication that alternative medicine may be coming into its own. Among the longtime advocates who are heartened is Dr. Robert Atkins, \"Dr. Bob\" on \"Design for Living\" nightly on WOR-AM. Dr. Atkins succeeded his mentor, Carlton Frederick, on the long-running -- more than 40 years -- program. He has written five books, including \"Dr. Atkins's Diet Revolution,\" which has sold more than 10 million copies, and is the founder and executive director of the Atkins Centers for Complementary Medicine.'We're Not Even Trying' His early books were radical in their approach to nutritional therapy and were embroiled in controversy. Dr. Atkins said he was pleased people today were migrating from conventional medicine, although one cannot do without the other. \"Doctors can't know everything,\" Dr. Atkins said. \"But in this country we're not even trying. We're teaching them to become ultraspecialists, so that what we have are more and more doctors who know less and less.\" Dr. Atkins is also president of the Foundation for Advancement of Innovative Medicine, a group that has been focusing on freedom of choice and patients' rights to choose and have health coverage for whatever treatments they believe will work for them. \"Various traditions run throughout history,\" Dr. Atkins said. \"It's only in the 20th century, when medicine came under the control of the pharmaceutical industry. that these traditions fell by the wayside. Now we're looking at outcomes. We do what works.\"Advice From the State What most often confuses people about alternative medicine is trying to define it. \"The New Age Community Resource Guide\" lists more than 24 types of alternative therapies. Some are licensed by the state. Most are not. A spokeswoman for the State Health Department, Faith Schottenfeld, advises patients to employ caveat emptor. \"If you're practicing medicine without a license, that's criminal,\" she said. \"But what's medicine and what isn't? That's the gray area.\" Furthermore, Ms. Schottenfeld said, a license does not necessarily mean that the practitioner is good. Ask around, she added, and conduct background research and use judgment. \"People spend more time reading labels than they do selecting a doctor,\" she said. \"They think the state is always there looking out for their welfare. But that's not the state's job. It's a shared responsibility, particularly when you get into alternatives. You should be a "}
