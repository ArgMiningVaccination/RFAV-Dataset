Sympt om Management: A successful antiviral response w ould see the inf ection limited to the upper airway, as is the case clinically with the majority of viral inf ections in healthy individuals. Should such a response be decient, then predominantly upper -airway viral infections, may spread to the lo wer airways, causing lo wer respirator y symp toms and an e xacerbation of symp toms of whee ze, and dyspnea in predisposed individuals. The mainstay in management of c orona viral inf ections has been supportiv e care, nutrition and pre venting secondar y inf ections in the absenc e of any antiviral agent or vac cine. In the initial phases of inf ection where there is upper respirator y tract involvement, several home remedies can be tried as prescribed in naturopathy .
