Because of lack of regulation of the traditional medicine sector, these products have proliferated. This study aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae , a commercial traditional immune booster, using various models of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Methods: Immunosuppressed, mitogen-, and various doses of uMakhonya\u00ae and incubated for 24 h. The treated and control samples were analyzed for cytotoxicity, secretion of 12 different inflammatory cytokines, soluble interleukin-2 r eceptor (sIL-2R) levels, uMakhonya\u00ae induced cytotoxic all three with IC 50values 500, and 487.91 g/mL for (PG-S. )-stimulated PBMCs, respectively. UMakhonya\u00ae at 100 and 10 g/mL induced a significant ( p< 0.05) increase in the secretion of IL-1 ,I L - 1, IL-6, IL-10, tumor factor d PHA-stimulated PBMCs. In the same samples, there was a significant increase ( p< 0.05) in sIL-2R concentration, which correlated with an increase in the secretion of inflammatory cytoki nes. In PBMCs stimulated with PG- S. aureus ,uMakhonya\u00ae at doses of 100 and 10 g/mL significantly ( p< 0.05) suppressed and TNF- .P G - S. aureus- stimulated PBMCs also showed a significant decrease ( p< 0.05) in sIL-2R concentration when compared to control samples. UMakhonya\u00ae insignificantly ( p> 0.05) decreased NO levels in PBMCs after PG- S. aureus stimulation. Conclusions: These results showed that uMakhonya\u00ae can induce both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects depending on the initial stimuli applied to immune cells.

Suppliers of traditional medicine include retail muthi (herbal) shops, pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufac- turers, herbal hawkers, and herbal wholesalers [1]. Many of the traditional medicine manufacturers do not con- form to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards [2]. Commercial products based on traditional know- ledge have not only tapped the traditional theories of tonics but also have other added claims such as immune enhancing properties and antimicrobial activities defined as per the Western biomedical concepts. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has also fueled the demand, with many pa- tients using the so-called immune boosters that are sold commercially [3, 4]. The increased use of herbal plants and traditional medicine formulations necessitates devel- opment of a mechanism for rapid evaluation of the me- dicinal applications of these products. Plant-derived immune tonics are widely used as a sup- plement for maintenance of health. African tonic plants are used to reduce fatigue, improve general health (dur- ing or after illness), lower stress, and cleanse the blood [5]. Based on their reported immunomodulatory effects, plant-derived compounds have emerged as prime thera- peutic options in recent times, leading to their rigorous scientific examination to determine efficacy and safety [6]. Immunomodulation is a very complex theme, related to many diseases, with many targets for drugs, and therefore may present with many modes of action [7]. Modulation of the immune system denotes any change in the immune response; this may involve induction, ex- pression, amplification, or inhibition of any phase or part of that response [8]. Complex mixtures of traditional medicinal herbs thought to have immunomodulatory effects are a fixture of ATM and may include several compounds that exhibit activity against different targets or may even have synergistic effects [7]. Numerous in vitro methods have been developed to evaluate the modes of action of these potential immunomodulators [9]. Selection of proper immune cells from suitable im- mune organs allows for the understanding of the mode of action of immunomodulation [10]. Novel cell receptors and signal transduction molecules produced by immune cells have been identified and these regulate the host response to invading microorgan- isms. Research has been focused on finding compounds and substances that can modulate the biologic immune response and enhance the host 's ability to resist disease [11]. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the immuno- modulatory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae , a widely used herbal immune booster in South Africa, by using various models of human PBMCs. In an earlier study, thistraditional medicine was shown at non-cytotoxic doses is not a chemoattractant but is able to significantly induce chemokine secretion in LPS stimulated and unstimulated THP-1 monocytes. The increase in chemokines secretion may involve activation of the NF- signal transduc- tion pathway [12]. We developed three different models of PBMCs representing normal replication (PHA stimula- tion), immunosuppression (cyclosporine-treated), and in- fection (PG- S. aureus stimulation) of immune cells in order to analyze uMakhonya\u00ae cytotoxicity and its effects on inflammatory cytokines, receptor levels, and nitric oxide (NO) secretion. The interest in such a product and in the thousand other similar commercial products is made relevant by their use by patients with a variety of ail- ments, most of them related to HIV infection and AIDS. These products, based on traditional knowledge, have be- come synonymous with boosting the immune system to fight opportunistic infections. [4]. Methods Preparation of uMakhonya \u00ae formula UMakhonya \u00aeformulation Index (NAPPI) Code: 710345 -001) were a gift from the owner of the traditional medicine formulation, Mr. Victor Ndlovu. This product is formulated by combining five different plant extracts. The herbal plants are listed on the pack- aging of the formula sold in supermarkets, and each 5m Lo f uMakhonya \u00aecontains 90 mg mg men- thol (produced by Lamiaceae family, mostly those of the Mentha genus), 0.3 mL Psidium guajava liquid extract (guava, Myrtaceae family), 0.08 mL 0.06 Uncaria tomentosa (cats-claw tincture, Rubiaceae family), all ex- tracted in of uMakhonya \u00ae using gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are provided as additional data. The formulation is listed with the Medicines Control Council (MCC) of South Africa and exclusive rights are reserved. It was manufactured by UMakhonya Natural Health Products (Pty) Ltd (Pinetown, South Africa). At the manufacturing phase, the plants were mixed proportionally in a 25-l tank and then ex- tracted using tap water by boiling the tank overnight. The extract was then cooled, filtered once with steel sift followed by removal of finer particles using a sifting net, and then packaged into 1- and 5-l containers. To prepare the extract for in vitro studies, the liquid extract was further sterile-filtered and then freeze-dried to powder. The powdered plant material was then reconstituted at 10 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and this was further sterile-filtered using 0.22 m filters. This stock solution was then serial diluted toNgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 16:300 Page 2 of 12working concentrations of 1000, 500, 100, 50, and 10 g/ mL using complete culture media (CCM). Endotoxin con- tamination was measured using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) QVL-1000TM(Lonza, USA) with a sensitiv- ity of 0.1 endotoxin units (EU) per mL (supplementary data, Table 1). Polymyxin B sulfate (10 g/mL) was added to reduce the immunostimulatory effects due to endotoxin contamination. The recommended dose of uMakhonya \u00ae according to the packaging is about 150 mL per day of the liquid concentrate. This volume equated to about 800 mg of freeze dried material [12]. Cell culture Normal human whole blood was carefully layered onto equal amounts of Histopaque 1077 and then centrifuged at 600 gfor 30 min at 25 \u00b0C. After centrifugation, the buffy coat layer containing PBMCs was isolated and washed twice in 5 mL PBS (300 gfor 20 min at 25 \u00b0C). The final pellets were re-suspended in complete culture media at 1 \u00d7 106cells/mL and then different models of PBMCs were prepared according to Leung et al., [13] with some variations. Briefly, the PBMCs were stimu- lated with either PHA/PG- S. aureus or immunosup- pressed with 20 g/mL of cyclosporine for 2 h. Without eliminating the stimulation or immunosuppressive effect of cyclosporine, the cells were aliquoted to 6-well plates and treated with uMakhonya\u00ae at doses ranging from 1000 g/mL to 10 g/mL at a ratio of 1:1. The treated PBMCs were then incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5 % CO 2 and 95 % humidity. At the end of the incubation period, the cells and their supernatants were used for further experiments. Cell viability assay The luminescent cell viability ATP assay kit from Pro- mega uses recombinant luciferase to catalyze the follow- ing reaction: ATP + d-Luciferan + O 2Oxyluciferan + AMP + PPi + CO 2+ Light (560 nm). When ATP is the limiting component in the reaction, the intensity of the emitted light is proportional to theconcentration of ATP. Based on these principles, the levels of ATP in PBMCs stimulated with either PHA/PG- S. aur- eusor immunosuppressed with 20 g/mL of cyclosporine and treated with doses of uMakhonya \u00aewere analyzed according to manufacturer instructions. Cyclosporine (20g/mL) was used as a positive control for cytotoxicity against immune cells. Briefly, a sample (100 L) of 24 h treated/control cell suspension was pipetted into three dif- ferent wells of a white opaque 96-well plate. The working CellTiter-GloTMReagent (cat number: G7570) was pre- pared immediately before use and was added to the wells with treated cells at 100 L per well. The plate was agi- tated on a plate shaker for 2 min at 150 gand incubated in darkness for 10 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation period, the plate was loaded into the luminometer and the relative light units (RLU) of the sam- ples were measured. Background signals of cell culture media and uMakhonya \u00aedoses (negative control) were subtracted from each average read. A dose response curve was also generated for the ATP levels using RLU versus different concentrations of samples. The cell viability assay was done in triplicate and repeated three times before the follow-up is designed to be used with supernatants from treated cells or with serum from whole blood. For the purpose of this research, inflammatory cytokines were analyzed from supernatants of treated models of PBMCs and control samples. Each kit included a 96-well plate coated with antibodies for the various chemokines in the microarray. Each row of the plate from 1 to 12 repre- sented a single cytokine in the following order: IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17 ,i n t e r f e r o n gamma (IFN- ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- ), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM- CSF). The kit had negative and positive controls. Each sample was assayed in duplicate. The ELISA analyses were performed according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, incubation of the Table 1 Measurement of nitrite radicals as a measure of the levels of nitric oxide secretion in PBMCs stimulated with PG- S. aureus (100 g/mL) and treated with various doses of uMakhonya\u00ae . Treatment of stimulated PBMCs with various doses of uMakhonya\u00ae did not effect a significant increase ( p> 0.05) in NO secretion when compared to untreated, PG- S. aureus -stimulated-only and a significant increase ( p> 0.05) in NO secretion when compared to PG-stimulated plus cyclosporine-treated samples Untreated PBMCs PG- S. aureus PG-S. aureus plus Cyclosporine PG-S. aureus plus uMakhonya\u00ae (g/mL) NO concentration ( M) 100 50 10 1 9.21 10.12 10.24 standard error of the meanNgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 16:300 Page 3 of 12samples in the 96-well plates allowed the captured anti- bodies to bind to their specific protein of interest. Cyclo- sporine-treated, PHA-, and PG- S. aureus -stimulated samples treated with uMakhonya\u00ae (100 and 10 g/mL) and untreated control samples were analyzed. After re- moving the unbound protein with wash buffer, biotinyl- ated detection antibodies (50 L) were added to the wells to bind to the captured analyte. Following another wash, an avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 L) was added. The wells were again washed and the colorimetric substrate solution was added, developing to a blue color in direct proportion to the amount of protein analyte present in the initial sample. The color development was stopped by adding the stop solution, and the absorbance was read at 450 nm with reference at 570 nm in a micro- plate reader as per manufacturer instructions. Secretion of cytokines was measured in duplicate and two independent experiments were done. IL-2 receptor ELISA Analyses of human soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels were carried out using the IL-2 Receptor Human ELISA Kit from ABCAM\u00ae (England) and done according to the provided protocol. Briefly, samples (100 L each) of supernatants from PBMCs treated with different doses ofuMakhonya\u00ae plus standards of known IL-2 receptor concentrations and control samples were pipetted into separate wells and incubated with biotinylated monoclo- nal antibodies specific for sIL-2R (50 L) for 3 h at room temperature. This was followed by the addition of strep- tavidin peroxidase enzyme (100 L). After incubation for 30 min and washing to remove the unbound enzyme, a substrate solution (100 L) was added, which produced a colored reaction. The intensity of this colored product is directly proportional to the concentration of sIL-2R present in the samples. The enzyme-substrate reaction was stopped by quickly pipetting 100 L of sulfuric acid. The results were read immediately on a Zenyth200 spec- trophotometer at 450 nm as the primary wavelength and 610 nm as the reference wavelength. The experiments were done in triplicate and repeated twice per dose. Nitric oxide secretion The Griess reagent system from Promega (USA) was used to measure nitrite (NO 2), which is one of two pri- mary, stable, and nonvolatile breakdown products of NO. To perform the assay, 50 Lo fs u p e r n a t a n t sf r o m peptidoglycan-stimulated and control PBMCs were plated in triplicate on 96-well plates. The samples were left to equilibrate to room temperature after which 50 L of Sulf- anilamide Solution was dispensed to all experimental sam- ples and incubated for 10 min at room temperature away from light. Then, 50 Lo f N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) solution was dispensed to allsample wells and the plate incubated for another 10 min at room temperature, again protected from light. Absorb- ance was then measured within 30 min on a Zenyth200 plate reader at 540 nm. Nitrite standards were included as part of the samples and were used to draw a reference curve. All samples and standards were done in triplicate and the experiments were repeated twice. Statistical analysis Data analyses were done on Microsoft Excel to obtain descriptive statistics. The IC 50for cytotoxicity and differ- ent levels of significance within the different treated groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA ) and the differences between the treated cells, the untreated cells, and the negative control samples were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 5) soft- ware with the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. Differences with p0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Cell viability In all three models (cyclosporine-suppressed, PHA- stimulated, and PG- S. significant ( p< 0.05) cytotoxicity at high doses (1000 to 500 g/mL) while the effect of lower doses (100 to 10 g/mL) was not significant ( p> 0.05). The cytotoxicity of the high doses of uMakhonya\u00ae was significantly greater ( p< 0.05) than that of the immuno- suppressive drug cyclosporine (Fig. 1). The IC 50values of 512.08, 500, and 487. 91 g/mL were recorded for immunosuppressed, PHA-stimulated, and PG- S. aureus - stimulated PBMCs, respectively. Further experiments were performed with lower doses of uMakhonya\u00ae ran- ging from 100 to 10 g/mL, which did not show signifi- cant cytotoxicity. Cytokine secretion assay In the immunosuppressive model, the effects of uMakhonya\u00ae doses (100 and 10 g/mL) on the secretion of 12 inflammatory cytokines over 24 h in PBMCs pre- treated with cyclosporine (20 g/mL) for 2 h were ana- lyzed. uMakhonya\u00ae significantly increased ( p< 0.05) ,I L - , IL-6, and TNF compared with cyclosporine-only treatment. Secretion of IL-2, which is the target of suppression by cyclosporine, did not signifi- cantly increase after the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae (Fig. 2). Overall, the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae stimulated the secre- tion of inflammatory cytokines. In the mitogen-stimulated model, the immunomodula- tory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae were analyzed at doses 100 and 10 g/mL on the secretion of 12 inflammatory cytokines over 24 h in PBMCs pre-treated with PHA (20g/mL) for 2 h. UMakhonya\u00ae significantly increasedNgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 16:300 Page 4 of 12(p< 0.05) the secretion of significantly affected ( . 0 5 ) by the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae compared to that observed after PHA plus cyclosporine treatment (Fig. 3). Similar to the immunosuppressive model, the mitogen-stimulated model exhibited increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines after the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae . In the infection model, the immunomodulatory effects ofuMakhonya\u00ae were analyzed at doses of 100 and 10g/mL on the secretion of 12 inflammatory cytokines over 24 h in PBMCs pre-stimulated with PG- S. aureus (100 g/mL) 0.05) after the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae compared to that in PG- S. aureus -treated samples. IL-2 secretion was not significantly affected when compared to that in con- trol samples. Secretion of only IL-1 and GM-CSF in- creased ( p< 0.05) after the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae to samples stimulated with PG- S. aureus (Fig. 4). Unlike the immunosuppressive and mitogen models, overall the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae suppressed the immunostimula- tory effects of PG- S. aureus on the secretion of inflam- matory cytokines. IL-2 receptor ELISA Soluble IL-2 receptor levels were analyzed in order to find out whether their levels correlated with the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in the three different PBMC models. In immunosuppressed andPHA-stimulated samples, the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae significantly increased ( p< 0.05) sIL-2R levels when compared to untreated and cyclosporine-suppressed samples (Fig. 5a-b). This correlated with the overall pro- inflammatory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae on cytokine secre- tion. In PG- S. aureus -stimulated the addition ofuMakhonya\u00ae caused a significant decrease ( p< 0.05) in sIL-2R level when compared to samples stimulated with PG- S. aureus only. The highest dose of uMakhonya\u00ae (100 g/mL) was more effective ( p< 0.05) at reducing sIL-2R in PG- S. aureus -stimulated samples than cyclosporine (Fig. 5c). The decrease in sIL-2R levels in PG- S. aureus -stimulated samples also correlated with the overall anti-inflammatory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae on cytokine secretion in the same model. Nitric oxide secretion Treatment of PG- S. aureus -stimulated PBMCs with various doses of uMakhonya\u00ae did not effect a significant change (p> 0 . 0 5 )i nN Os e c r e t i o nw h e nc o m p a r e dt ou n t r e a t e d , PG-S. aureus -stimulated only and PG- S. aureus -stimulated plus cyclosporine-treated samples. While stimulation of PBMCs with PG- S. aureus caused a slight increase in NO secretion when compared to unstimulated cells, the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae caused a non-significant decrease in secretion (Table 1). Discussion In this study, we investigated the in vitro immunomodu- latory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae , a widely sold SouthFig. 1 The cytotoxic of effects of uMakhonya\u00ae on three different models of PBMCs, immunosuppressed, PHA-stimulated, and S. aureus peptidoglycan (PG-S. aureus )-stimulated In all three models, uMakhonya\u00ae induced significant ( p< 0.05) cytotoxicity at high doses (1000 to 500 g/mL) while the effect of lower doses (100 to 10 g/mL) was not significant ( p> 0.05). The IC 50values of 512.08, 500, and 487. 91 g/mL were recorded for immunosuppressed, PHA-stimulated, and PG- S. aureus -stimulated cells, respectively. Further experimen ts were performed with lower doses ranging from 100 to 10 g/mL, which did not show signif icant cytotoxicityNgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 16:300 Page 5 of 12African immune booster product based on ATM know- ledge. uMakhonya \u00aeimmune booster, according to the product labeling, is indicated to improve one 's immune system. It also claims to cleanse the blood and to control diabetes, high blood pressure, pneumonia, shingles, ul- cers, and hemorrhoids. The results of this study showed that uMakhonya\u00ae is significantly cytotoxic to PBMCs at high doses (Fig. 1) with IC 50values of 512.08, 500, and 487. 91 g/mL recorded PHA-s- timulated, and PG- S. aureus -stimulated PBMCs, respectively. This is indicative of in vivo toxicity at ex- cessively higher equivalent doses. The recommended dose of uMakhonya \u00aeaccording to the packaging is about 150 mL divided into three separate doses per day. This volume equated to about 800 mg of freeze dried mater- ial. Although it would be difficult to extrapolate the in vitro results to a full human physiology, this recom- mended dosage seems minimal to cause any adverse toxic effects. uMakhonya\u00ae at non-cytotoxic dosesranging from 100 to 10 g/mL were shown to stimulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increase sIL-2R levels in immunosuppressed and PHA-treated PBMCs (Figs. 2 and 3). However, this product showed anti-inflammatory effects by significantly decreasing in- flammatory cytokines and sIL-2R levels in PG- S. aureus - stimulated PBMCs (Figs. 4 and 5c). Many advances have been made recently in the understanding of the func- tioning of the immune system. Whether immunomodu- lators enhance or suppress the immune response can depend on a number of factors, including dosage as well as route and timing of administration. This response can also depend on the mechanism of action or site of activity [11]. Therefore, in choosing research models to study immunomodulators, a careful and precise process must be followed in order to ensure that the results of such research reflect the absolute nature and mecha- nisms of action of the compounds in question. uMakhonya\u00ae demonstrated that its mode of actionFig. 2 Effects of uMakhonya\u00ae at doses of 100 and 10 g/mL on the secretion of 12 inflammatory cytokines over 24 h in PBMCs pre-treated with cyclosporine (20 g/mL) for 2 h. UMakhonya\u00ae cyclosporine-only treatment. Secretion of IL-2, which is the target of suppression by cyclosporine, did not significantly increase after the addit ion ofuMakhonya\u00aeNgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 16:300 Page 6 of 12depends on the type of stimuli applied to an in vitro im- mune system and that these effects are dose-dependent. Cytokines are redundant secreted proteins with growth, differentiation, and activation functions that regulate and determine the nature of the immune re- sponses [14]. Therefore, altering cytokine expression and targeting their receptors may offer therapeutic potential [15]. The addition of uMakhonya\u00ae antagonized the im- munosuppressive effects of cyclosporine and potentiated the cell proliferation effects of PHA by increasing the se- cretion vulgaris ), pri- marily stimulates T cell proliferation and it has a slight effect on B cells. This lectin stimulate blastogenesis of T lymphocytes by interaction with CD2 to stimulate the production of IL-2 and IFN- [10]. For this study it was observed through repeated stimulation of PBMCs that proliferative effect of PHA normally peaks after 48 h of stimulation. But the design of the studies necessitated that the stimulation be standardised along with that of immunosuppression with cyclosporine and stimulationFig. 3 Immunomodulatory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae at doses of 100 and 10 g/mL on the secretion of 12 inflammatory cytokines over 24 h in PBMCs pre-treated with PHA (20 g/mL) for 2 h. UMakhonya\u00ae was not significantly affected ( p> 0.05) by the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae compared to that observed for PHA plus cyclosporine treatmentNgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 16:300 Page 7 of 12with peptidoglycan. Therefore the stimulatory effects of PHA on cytokines are not reflected in the inflammatory cytokines secretion but the sIL-2R assay effects of PHA. Immunostimu- lants are envisaged to enhance the body 's resistance to infection by acting through both the innate and adaptive immune responses [9]. There was a significant correl- ation between the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and the increase in sIL-2R concentration in both immunocompromised and mitogen-stimulatedPBMCs treated with uMakhonya\u00ae . In vitro cellular acti- vation has been observed to lead to not only the synthe- sis of cell-associated IL-2R but also a soluble form of the receptor, which could be found in cell-free supernatants. The generation of sIL-2R is not a result of cell death and the rate of release of this molecule is in proportion to its cell surface expression [16]. The association between the increased levels of sIL-2R and immunostimulation has been demonstrated in various inflammatory diseases in vivo. Siedler et al., [17] showed that patients withFig. 4 Immunomodulatory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae at doses of 100 and 10 g/mL on the secretion of 12 inflammatory cytokines over 24 h in PBMCs pre-stimulated with PG- S. aureus (100 g/mL) (p< 0.05) after the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae compared to that in PG- S. aureus -treated samples. Secretion of IL-2 did not show a significant change when compared to control samples. Secretion of only IL-1 and GM-CSF was increased ( p< 0.05) by the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae to samples stimulated with PG- S. aureusNgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 16:300 Page 8 of 12chronic liver disease (CLD) had significantly elevated serum sIL-2R levels compared with controls and this was associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IFN , or IL-6, and chemokines. The shedding of sIL-2R may also limit the responsiveness of immunecells to IL-2 stimuli, thereby averting any risk of an excessive immune response which can lead to inflam- matory disorders [18, 19]. In healthy individuals, this immunostimulation may serve as a prophylactic, while in immunocompromised individuals, it may act as anFig. 5 Soluble IL-2 receptor levels in supernatants of cyclosporine-immunosuppressed aureus ( C)P B M C s treated with uMakhonya\u00ae doses (100 and 10 g/mL) over 24 h. In immunosuppressed and PHA-stimulated samples, addition of uMakhonya\u00ae significantly increased ( p< 0.05) sIL-2R levels compared to untreated and cyclosporine-suppressed samples. In PG- S. aureus -stimulated samples, the addition of uMakhonya\u00ae caused a significant decrease ( p< 0.05) in sIL-2R level when compared to samples stimulated with PG- S. aureus only. The highest dose of uMakhonya\u00ae (100 g/mL) was more effective ( p<0.05) at reducing sIL-2R in S. aureus -stimulated samples than cyclosporineNgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 9 of 12immunotherapeutic [9]. Immunomodulation using trad- itional medicinal plants can be used as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, conventi onal therapy for a variety of diseases, especially when host defenses have to be activated under the conditions of impair ed immune response [20]. It was also determined that this traditional medicine had non-significant levels of end otoxin contamination at 1.8 endotoxin units (EU/mL) (additional files, Table 1). The endotoxin levels were removed by addition of 10 g/mL of polymyxin B sulphate to ensu re that the assessed immune effects are directly as a result of uMakhonya \u00ae. Pre-treatment of PBMCs with secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 4). Peptidoglycan is a component of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial cell walls and is a functional lipopolysaccharide (LPS) analog. It there- fore possesses potent pro-inflammatory properties in vitro including the induction of IL-1 and TNF [21]. The addition of uMakhonya\u00ae to the stimulated PBMCs significantly decreased the concentration of pro- inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1 and TNF . The anti-inflammatory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae correlated with the significant decrease in sIL-2R levels in supernatants of PG- S. aureus -stimulated PBMCs (Fig. 5c). These anti- inflammatory effects are in contrast to its intended use, which is aimed at stimulating the immune system in response to infections. Alternatively, these anti- inflammatory effects may serve to control the immune response during bacterial infections because during in- fection, peptidoglycan recognition drives both cell- autonomous and whole organism defense responses [22]. In vitro studies have shown that the overall pharmacological and therapeutic effects of medicinal plants often do not derive from a single compound but from several compounds generating synergistic activity [15]. In this study, we have demonstrated that this ex- tends to formulations of multiple medicinal plants. Such findings have led some researchers to propose that multi-component pharmacological agents that target multiple sites affect the complex physiological response more favorably than drugs that act on a single target [15]. Herbalists have known for centuries the benefit of using a combination of herbal remedies such as uMakhonya\u00ae , (single extracts from medicinal plants and combined extracts of different plants) in switching on the body 's defense mechanisms and self-healing and pro- tective processes [23]. There are limited studies on the immune effects of the five medicinal plants that make up uMakhonya\u00ae but the available data show that the majority of these medicinal plants possess anti-inflammatory effects. Chondrus crispus is indigenous to the Northern Hemisphere and is the only medicinal plant extract known to induce an in- flammatory response in vitro and in animal models.Seaweeds are not only rich in polysaccharides, minerals, and certain vitamins but they also contain bioactive sub- stances such as proteins, lipids, and polyphenols. These bioactives are known to possess potent antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties [24 -26]. C. crispus has antiviral properties and is said to be particularly use- ful for dislodging mucus [27]. C. crispus and its resultant component from the extract, carrageenan, are known to be potent inflammatory agents in rodents and stimulate mice immune cells to produce TNF in response to bac- terial LPS [28, 29]. Artemisia afra is used traditionally to treat respiratory ailments and fever in combination with Lippia javanica , suggesting its immune enhancing po- tential. Decoctions of A. afra are taken as blood purifiers for acne and boils. This combined with the apparent ability to reduce stress may confer upon A. afra the sta- tus of an immune tonic [5, 30]. Uncaria tomentosa (cat 's claw) is a medicinal plant from the Amazon forest in South America with a long tradition of use in the treat- ment of a wide range of diseases including arthritis, gas- tritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, and cancer [31, 32]. A study on human volunteers given Uncaria tomentosa at 350 mg daily caused a small increase in their white blood cell counts. A follow-up clinical trial where 250 -350 mg of formulated U. tomentosa was given in- creased leukocyte count over six weeks in healthy volun- teers [33]. Cat 's claw is a remarkably potent inhibitor of TNFproduction. The primary mechanism appears to be immunomodulation suppression of TNF synthe- sis [34]. Psidium guajava (guava) is an important food crop and medicinal plant in tropical and subtropical countries. Different parts of this plant are used widely in traditional medicine practices worldwide [35, 36] .Many pharmacological traditional uses [37 -39]. In addition to tobacco, menthol is used in a variety of products such as foods, topical therapeutic preparations, and oral hygiene and dental formulations [40]. Menthol has been shown to have an- algesic and related anti-inflammatory activities by its ef- fect on transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8), Kappa receptor stimulation, and inhibition of voltage gate sodium chan- nels [41]. The complexity of active compounds produced by the medicinal plants constituting uMakhonya\u00ae may therefore explain the differences in response in the three PBMCs models used in this study. Peptidoglycan is also a pot ent activator of indu- c i b l en i t r i co x i d es y n t h a s e( i N O S )a sp a r to fi t si n vitro pro-inflammatory effects. Activation of the iNOS by PG leads to increased production of NONgcobo and Gqaleni BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2016) 16:300 Page 10 of 12[42, 43]. The measure of nitrite as a reflection of NO concentration in PG- S. aureus -stimulated PBMCs showed that treatment with uMakhonya\u00ae caused a non-significant reduction in NO secretion when compared to other stim- ulated cell samples (Table 1). In terms of the concentra- tion of NO secreted by PBMCs, Jacob et al. [44] showed that the amount of NO released from unstimulated PBMCs cultured from control blood samples measured using the Griess reagent system in the culture superna- tants Oa t2 4h and 48 h, respectively. These values are comparable with the results obtained in this study. NO is a physiological mediator produced by many cells involved in immunity and inflammation. NO is subsequently oxidized to nitrite and nitrate, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that mediate most of its immunological effects [45]. Therefore the re- duction of nitrite by may reflect its antioxi- dant effects. The oxidant scavenging properties may also explain anti-inflammatory effects of uMakhonya\u00ae in PG-S. aureus -stimulated PBMCs. The five herbal medi- cines constituting uMakhonya\u00ae have all been shown to possess potent antioxidant properties in separate experi- ments [33, 46 -49]. Immunostimulants, as uMakhonya\u00ae is purported to be, can be used both by healthy individuals and persons with impaired immune systems. In healthy individuals they are expected to act as prophylactic agents and in individuals with impairment of the immune response as immunotherapeutic agents [9]. A study on the immunomodulatory effects of goldenseal and Astragalus extracts showed that herbal medicines may function to moderate symptoms associated with overactive pro- inflammatory responses, with each having a distinct subset of modulatory effects on cultured macrophages [50]. This may provide a possible explanation for the observed pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of by uMakhonya\u00ae doses under different physiological stimuli. The potential uses of immunomodulators in clinical medicine include treatment of immunodeficiency caused by AIDS and suppression of immune response in autoimmune disease [10]. Conclusions This study showed that uMakhonya\u00ae is significantly cytotoxic to PBMCs at high doses. uMakhonya\u00ae was also shown to stimulate the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and to increase sIL-2R levels in PBMCs immunosuppressed with cyclosporine or mitogen- stimulated with PHA. In PG- S. aureus -stimulated showed pressing sIL-2R levels in treated samples. uMakhonya\u00ae also de- creased the amount of secreted NO in PG- S. aureus -stim- ulated PBMCs. There is an urgent need for further studies on the mechanisms of action of uMakhonya\u00ae and other similar products being sold in supermarkets andpharmacies in South Africa. Standards must be developed to determine the types of plants that can be used in medi- cinal products based on traditional knowledge. This is highlighted by the use of plants in uMakhonya\u00ae that are not indigenous to South Africa such as C. crispus andU. tomentosa , and the use of regulated substances such as menthol.
