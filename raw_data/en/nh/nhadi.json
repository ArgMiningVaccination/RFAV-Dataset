Today's Advantage, Tomorrow's Promise:Alberta's Vision for the Future presents the government's vision for the province in the next 20years, together with the values of Albertans thatsupport this vision. The vision builds on three themes- people, preservation and prosperity- and introducesfour strategic opportunities to helpachieve the Leadingin Learning; Competing in a Global Marketplace; andMaking Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work andVisit. Today's Opportunities, Tomorrow's Promise: A Strategic Plan for the Government of Albertafocuses on and supports the vision. It describesAlberta in the year 2025 and expands on the fourstrategic opportunities or \"pillars\" to realize thisvision. 2006-09 Government of Alberta Business Plan is linked to the fiscal plan and aligns with the longer-term strategies in the 20-year strategic plan. Thethree-year government business plan is publishedannually and lays out the government's goals andstrategies and the measures necessary to track results. The 2006-09 government business plan is focused on ensuring that Alberta keeps pace with its projectedeconomic growth, while sustaining its social andnatural advantages. It outlines a \"work order\" thatincludes eight Top Priorities to manage growth andsets clear expectations for results in each of thesepriority areas.2006-09 Ministry Business Plans are published annually and cover a three-year planning period.These plans support both the 20-year strategic planand the government's three-year business plan. The vision and these key plans are aligned to ensure that all of government is \"pulling together\" towardshared goals.

But neither Albertans nor their government are prepared to be complacent. The government is focusing on its long-termvision for Alberta, sustaining close alignment with the directions in the 20-year strategic plan and addressingboth opportunities and challenges in its ongoing three-year government business plans. BUILDING ON SUCCESS In 1993, Albertans faced some tough choices. Theeconomy was not performing to its potential and thegovernment was spending more than it could afford.Red tape and regulations were hurting business andgovernment had become too big. Albertans told theirgovernment to take action and government listened. Alberta has entered its second century in an enviable position, with a strong economy, no debt and anunparalleled quality of life. Enormous achievements have been realized: The economy has grown strongly and steadily. Alberta's outstanding economic growth hascreated over 400,000 new jobs in just 10 years. The province currently is experiencing surpluses due to high oil and gas revenues and hasdeveloped a plan that will ensure over 75 per centof its 2005-06 surplus will be invested inendowments for future generations and in thepriority areas that matter most to Albertans:education, health, infrastructure and theenvironment. Personal and business taxes are lower. Alberta is moving forward on the Third Way which focuses on new and innovative ways toensure a high-quality, accessible and affordablehealth system for future generations of Albertans. Alberta made a commitment at the start of its centennial year that advanced education would bea top priority, and the government introduced theAccess to the Future Act . This legislation will make Alberta's advanced learning system a leaderin Canada. Regulations have been streamlined and government has become more effective, efficientand adaptable. Communities, individuals and stakeholders now want and expect to be full participants in governing theprovince. Future-shaping events such as the PublicConsultation on a Debt-Free Alberta, the Premier'sRoundtable on Family Violence and Bullying,Unleashing Innovation in Health Systems - Alberta'sSymposium on Health, A Learning Alberta -Dialogue and Directions, and Water for Life:Alberta's Strategy for Sustainability have directlyinvolved individuals, communities and stakeholdersin planning Alberta's future in priority areas. The Government of Alberta also has forged partnerships with communities to find local solutionsto critical issues. From consultation on policy orlegislative changes to community engagement,through such means as community justicecommittees, economic development authorities andtourism councils, community participation is part ofeveryday life across our province. In a global environment that is challenging and chaotic, we must recognize and build on theaccomplishments of the last decade, not rest on them. Today's Advantage, Tomorrow's Promise envisions Alberta as a place where all Albertans can realizetheir full potential, where we work together asstewards of Alberta's natural beauty and resources,and where sustained economic growth leads tocontinued prosperity and realized opportunity.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 6KEEPING ALBERTANS' VALUES IN MIND The government's vision for Alberta fully recognizes the desire of its citizens to maximize their ownachievements and potential as they take advantage ofAlberta's opportunities. Success requires a strongfoundation, a strength of purpose and a clear sense ofAlbertans' values. The values that provide a strong foundation to the vision and the government's 20-year strategic planare: Albertans' strong belief in the freedom to pursue personal success; Albertans' recognition that their right to self- determination is balanced by their responsibility totheir family and to the greater community; Albertans' pioneering, entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to take risks and embrace newtechnologies; and Albertans' desire for the freedom to control their own lives and their rejection of unnecessary rulesor red tape. WORKING TOGETHER Individuals, communities, non-profit organizationsand businesses all have an important role to play inachieving the vision for Alberta in close collaborationwith the Alberta government. Government leadership provides the framework - the fiscal, economic, social and regulatory policies thatwill position Alberta to respond to opportunities andaddress challenges. Government leadership alsopromotes Alberta's interests and secures benefits forAlbertans as an equal partner in a strong, unitedCanada. THE VISION - ALBERTA IN 2025 What do Albertans want their province to look like in20 years? Which social and demographic trends andwhich opportunities, risks and hurdles will determinethe type of Alberta we live in by 2025? Alberta in 2025 will be a province of four million people, slightly older on average than today'spopulation and more diverse. It will be a provincewhere: People are free to realize their full potential and personal choice is the only limit to opportunity; Government and industry are responsible stewards of the province's abundance of natural resources; People feel safe in their homes, on their streets, in their communities and at work; The economic fundamentals of the province are strong and the tax system is designed to promoteindividual entrepreneurship and the transformationto a knowledge-based economy; The economy has shifted toward a knowledge- based approach, with research, technologydevelopment and value-added products having amuch larger part in the province's prosperity; Essential public services such as health and education are contemporary, accessible andaffordable, and individuals have a role to play inusing these services responsibly; The potentially vulnerable in society, including seniors, children and people with disabilities havethe support they need to live in dignity, achievepersonal satisfaction and independence, andcontinue to contribute to the betterment of theprovince; Albertans are able to enjoy the province's unspoiled natural areas and wide variety of arts,cultural and recreational opportunities; Aboriginal Albertans have achieved a socio- economic status equivalent to that of otherAlbertans; The province's small towns, farms and ranches are a vital part of Alberta. Rural communities, likelarge urban communities, are vibrant and growing; The province is a full, participating partner in Confederation, and the views of Albertans arerespected by the federal government; and Municipalities and the provincial government work in a fair partnership to serve theirconstituents. This picture of Alberta in the future captures the values of Albertans - values that have shaped theprovince and its unique place in Canada over theprevious century.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 7THE VISION'S THEMES - PEOPLE, PRESERVATION AND PROSPERITY Alberta's vision, Today's Advantage, Tomorrow's Promise, is centred on the themes of people,preservation and prosperity. People are at the heart of the Alberta Advantage. Alberta's vision rests on the belief that Albertans areour province's greatest resource and that their abilityto realize their potential is the cornerstone of theprovince's future. This requires personal and community resourcefulness to meet challenges, and support fromgovernment where needed. It requires valuing thediverse gifts that all Albertans bring to theircommunities. Preservation means maintaining an environment that is unsurpassed in the world while ensuringsustainable economic growth. Albertans place a highvalue on the preservation of a clean, healthy, naturalenvironment, where the unique beauty of Alberta isprotected for future generations to enjoy. Prosperity is essential to maintaining and improving Albertans' overall quality of life. Today's Advantage,Tomorrow's Promise is a vision to ensure economicgrowth that is unmatched in Canada and NorthAmerica and that ensures individual Albertans haveopportunities to work and succeed. The vision isbased on sound management and sustainabledevelopment of our natural resource-based economy. Ultimately, however, Albertans will measure our prosperity as a province by more personal and lesstangible outcomes - the strength and well-being ofour families, communities and society. ACHIEVING THE VISION The vision is achieved through four strategicopportunities or \"pillars\" outlined in the 20-yearstrategic plan - Unleashing Innovation, Leading inLearning, Competing in a Global Marketplace, andMaking Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work andVisit. Unleashing Innovation focuses on Alberta becoming a world leader in innovation, research, developmentand commercialization of new ideas.Leading in Learning means making sure Albertans have the opportunities they need to learn, adapt anddevelop new knowledge and new skills. Competing in a Global Marketplace is about creating a business environment that is recognizedaround the world as an excellent place to do business. Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit is where these strategies translate into a superior quality of life for Albertans. Today's Advantage, Tomorrow's Promise is the Alberta government's vision of an Alberta forAlbertans - a vision developed by listening toAlbertans. It is a vision of unmatched economicprosperity. It is a vision about unleashing the talentsof individual Albertans. It is a vision aboutmaintaining a clean and healthy environment. And itis a vision where all of these combine to create anexceptional quality of life.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 8AN ARRAY OF OPPORTUNITIES: A THEME OF SELF-RELIANCE Alberta is Canada's high-energy province. It leads the nation in nearly all economic indicators and is theideal destination for Canadian families who arelooking to start new careers, open new businesses andrealize their dreams. For Albertans, economic success is not an end in itself. Albertans look at economic strength as a keyto achieving their personal goals and to sustaining theadvantages afforded by good health, strongcommunities and education systems, low taxes, and ahigh level of personal freedom and autonomy. While financial well-being is the anchor of prosperity, other dimensions of family, social, spiritual andphysical well-being are essential to fulfill humanaspirations. For this province, a strong economy isnot merely about numbers on a spreadsheet. It is alsoabout opportunity and success. Alberta is blessed with an abundance of natural resources that have contributed to its economicfortune. But Alberta's success is built on more thangeography. The vital ingredient in Alberta's successstory is the hard work and dedication of the peoplewho make up the province - people who dedicatethemselves to continuous improvement forthemselves, their families, their communities andtheir province. Albertans expect their government to create an environment in which they can maximizeopportunities. For them, government's job is not todo the work for them; it is to let them do the workthemselves. Albertans call this self-reliance, and it isa principle that has shaped this province and itspeople for more than a century.This commitment to self-reliance should not be confused with a lack of caring - for neighbours or forthe province as a whole. Albertans believe that allcitizens have the right to maximize their personalopportunities and the responsibility to help those whoneed help. Self-reliance does not mean that there are not important expectations for government. Albertans expect their government to provide a framework for success through fiscal, economic,social and regulatory policies that createopportunities. They also expect that government willwork in partnership with Albertans, municipalities,First Nations, M\u00e9tis settlements, businesses andothers to build Alberta together. They expect that government will help lead the development of the tools for the 21 stcentury economy - tools such as research, innovation and thedevelopment and commercialization of technology.They expect their government to provide the properinfrastructure needed for growth and prosperity and toprotect the environment so that Albertans have safewater, air and land today and tomorrow. Public officials should fund basic services fairly, avoid big government and manage public dollarswisely. Over the next 20 years, the government intends to ensure the province matches or exceeds its record ofsuccess over the previous decade. That is why it hasdeveloped this long-range plan. The plan expands onthe province's vision for the future and lays out ideasto realize Alberta's abundant opportunities and toaddress its fundamental challenges. THE PLAN Just over 13 years ago, in 1993, the province faceddeficits and mounting debt, complex and unnecessaryregulatory systems and a government that hadToday's Opportunities, Tomorrow's Promise: A Strategic Plan for the Government of Alberta Today's Opportunities, Tomorrow's Promise is a strategic plan that lays out a course for the Alberta government for the next 20 years. It identifies four strategic opportunities or \"pillars\" for Alberta to maximize its potential,and suggests a number of specific strategies to take advantage of those opportunities.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 9become too big. Albertans and their government developed a plan to eliminate the deficit, pay downthe debt, remove taxes and regulations that impairedbusiness competitiveness, and refocus the role ofgovernment from direct intervener to partner andfacilitator. Today's opportunities are different than those of 10 years ago, and with a solid plan and a commitment tofollow it, Albertans and their government are buildingon the foundation created over the past decade. The plan is based on four strategic opportunities or \"pillars.\" Each opportunity is presented separately,but they are interrelated. Each complements theother, and success in seizing one opportunity will leadto success in achieving the others. Opportunity 1: Unleashing InnovationOver the past 10 years, Alberta's economic growth has been unparalleled. Fuelled by higher-than-expected oil and natural gas prices, annual economicgrowth has been strong and consistent. While natural resource-based industries will continue to play a vital role in the provincial economy formany years to come, the province cannot continue torely on high natural resource prices forever. In order to achieve exceptional growth, Alberta's economy must expand from its natural resource base,enhance the value of manufactured goods andbusiness services and venture boldly into bio-technology, the life-sciences, nano-technology andother research and development opportunities. The Alberta government has developed Securing Tomorrow's Prosperity to achieve the economic goalsof the strategic plan. It is a market-driven, value-added strategy with a long-term vision to upgradeprimary resources, expand manufacturing, developbusiness services and foster knowledge-based sectors.It also is focused on the growth of a competitive andinnovative value-added and business servicesindustry. Achieving the New Economic Promise: A Knowledge-Based Approach Fostering a knowledge-based economy means building more value into our traditional goods andservices in order to achieve greater returns frominternational exports.It means using technology to make the most effective use of limited resources and to get the best value andreturn for Albertans. It also means building onAlberta's strong base of information technology andlife sciences to develop and produce new knowledge-based products. Over the past decade, the provincial government has made great strides toward encouraging a broadereconomic base. The elimination of needlessgovernment regulation has positioned Alberta as abusiness-friendly province. Alberta's strong fiscalposition and favourable personal and corporate taxrates have transformed Alberta into Canada'seconomic powerhouse. Our 21 stcentury society, composed of Albertans with roots all over the globe, provides yet anotheradvantage - windows to the world. The results have been impressive.Many large companies have invested and expanded operations in the province over the last decade, andAlberta has been cited as the province in which tolocate small businesses. The province's service andretail sectors have shown remarkable growth andstrength. Alberta companies, large and small, aretrading and providing services all over the world.Alberta's labour force is the most productive inCanada. Great strides have been made, but there are further opportunities. To ensure that Albertans benefit fromthese opportunities over the next 10 years, theGovernment of Alberta plans to invest up to five percent of its annual budget in support of its innovationagenda, as dollars are available. The Alberta of 2025 will require an innovative and productive workforce to keep a strong and changing economy vibrant. With this in mind, government hasworked closely with a broad range of stakeholders todevelop a new Workforce Strategy. This strategyfocuses on a broad range of initiatives to inform,attract, develop and retain a diverse and productiveworkforce for Alberta. This strategy will examine ways to promote full participation in the labour market. For example, theprovincial government, in partnership with industry,Aboriginal communities and other jurisdictions, willdevelop new strategies to help Aboriginal people train2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 10for, enter and stay in the workforce and participate fully in the economic opportunities of the province. The Alberta government also will take steps to attract skilled workers from outside the province, guided bya made-in-Alberta immigration policy. Governmentalso needs to ensure that immigrants to Alberta getfull recognition for the professional qualificationsthey bring with them in order for them to make thegreatest possible contribution to the province. One area where more opportunities are available is in the field of technology development and commercialization . Alberta's low business taxes have encouraged businesses to invest in the province.The availability of research funding means thatsignificant new technologies are consistently createdin Alberta. Alberta must further develop its capacityfor research, and bridge the gap between basicresearch and applied technology. Often, breakthroughs discovered in Alberta are developed elsewhere. Recognizing this, the Government of Alberta has developed the Accelerating Innovation in Albertastrategy. Its focus is to encourage innovative Alberta-based companies to develop technologies and convertthem into saleable products in Alberta. This willrequire innovation and collaboration amonggovernments, research institutions, entrepreneurs andbusinesses. Another factor in spurring technology commercialization is the availability of venture capital . The Alberta government will work with the technology sector and the investment industry toidentify and implement competitive mechanisms andframeworks to encourage investment and increaseaccess to venture capital within the province. Focusing on Our StrengthsTaking a knowledge-based approach will help Alberta's economy grow. But Alberta's traditionalstrengths in energy, agriculture, forestry and tourismcannot be forgotten. The Alberta government has made great progress in encouraging the development of the province'straditional resource-based industries. The tax and royalty systems have spurred record investment in Alberta's oil sands. Alberta's naturalgas resources have been upgraded through the expansion of the province's petrochemicalmanufacturing base. Research initiatives, businessrisk management tools and disaster assistanceprograms contribute to the viability of the agriculturalsector. Alberta's oil sands are the second-largest deposit of proven oil reserves in the world, next to Saudi Arabia.The orderly development of these reserves is vital toAlberta's future economic prosperity and key to astable, secure supply of energy for North America inthe 21 stcentury. The provincial government will ensure its tax and royalty structures return fair returns to Albertanswhile encouraging oil sands expansion. The government also will continue to increase its investment in research aimed at more innovative andefficient ways of extracting oil from the oil sands; forexample, technology that reduces the use of naturalgas in oil sands production processes. The Alberta government also will stimulate new petrochemical investment by working with industry todevelop new feedstock supplies through integrationwith oil sands upgrading and processing. Another vital resource to Alberta is natural gas . Though abundant, Alberta's natural gas reserves arenot unlimited. Albertans must find ways to improvenatural gas recovery and use natural gas moreefficiently and effectively. Toward this end, the government will actively encourage the extraction of coal bed methane - avaluable source of natural gas in coal, but one that ismore difficult to extract. Natural gas in coal has thepotential to offset declining conventional natural gasreserves, just as oil sands production is offsetting thedecline in production of Alberta's conventional oilreserves. The Alberta government also is considering further investments in research to turn carbon dioxide into amarketable product. Development of newtechnologies and the construction of a carbon dioxidepipeline could mean that carbon dioxide becomes avaluable resource in the extraction of conventional oilor natural gas in coal. Such uses also would reducegreenhouse gas emissions from Alberta's oil sands.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 11The government will focus its efforts to ensure the northern natural gas pipeline can meet the demand fornatural gas required to operate Alberta's oil sandsproduction capacity. Alberta also is fortunate to hold vast amounts of high-quality coal . The government will continue to invest in and promote research into making Alberta'salready clean coal into an even more environmentallyfriendly source of energy. The Alberta government has been a leader in the use of green power , having obtained 90 per cent of our power requirements for provincial governmentbuildings from green power commencing January 1,2005. Following this lead, the government willdevelop measures to encourage private-sectorinvestment in green power technologies. Finally, the government will help the forestry and agriculture industries expand the value-added component of these industries and provide customerswith high-quality, safe and nutritious foods and value-added forest products. For example, through its LifeSciences Strategy, the government is building on theprovince's research and innovation strengths in keysectors such as agriculture, energy, environment,forestry, health, and information and communicationstechnology. Using Natural Resources WiselyOver the past two decades, great strides have been made to take advantage of Alberta's natural resourcesfor the benefit of all Albertans. Development of theoil sands has created an enormous supply ofincreasingly economical oil that Alberta exports to theworld. Alberta's natural forests have been harvestedin a sustainable and environmentally responsible way.The province's landscapes support increasingrecreation and tourism. With finite resources, Albertans must make sure that these resources always are put to the best possiblelong-term use. Toward this goal, the provincial government will ensure that the province's land base is used as effectively as possible, recognizing traditional anddifferent possible users, for the benefit of allAlbertans. The government, in consultation withAlbertans, will develop a comprehensive land useframework for the province.There are limits to Alberta's available water supply. Our quality of life and economy require a long-termapproach to water management ; therefore, the Government of Alberta is implementing acomprehensive water strategy. Water for Life:Alberta's Strategy for Sustainability advances awatershed approach to water management. Thisstrategy encompasses a broad range of tools to ensurereliable, quality water supplies to maintain healthyaquatic ecosystems over the long term, as well as asustainable economy. Alberta's conventional oil and gas reservoirs have significant volumes that can be extracted usingenhanced recovery techniques. To obtain the mostfrom our finite resources, the provincial governmentwill develop an enhanced recovery strategy to extendthe life of these resources. Overall, a thriving Alberta economy requires a system in which the competition for finite resources isalways decided in favour of Albertans as a whole.The provincial government is responsible for ensuringthat competing interests are managed for the benefitof all Albertans. Opportunity 2: Leading in Learning At the heart of self-reliance, and of any person's success, is his or her desire to learn. Whether theyare in school, learning on the job, or volunteering intheir communities, Albertans desire to learn andimprove. And, they want the opportunity for theirchildren to be the best they can be. Albertans knowthat education is the best investment they can make inthe future. Government's role is to ensure an excellent, accessible and affordable learning system that meetsthe needs of learners, society and the economy.Participation in education is a shared responsibility oflearners, parents, stakeholders, the general public andthe government. The learning system must supportthe development of the province's human capital toensure Alberta is a leader in the knowledge-basedworld. Albertans know that investment in education, and supports to ensure children's readiness to learn, is adirect investment in the province's future. Forgovernment, the goal for the basic education systemis to give students of all ages the opportunity toachieve their full potential.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 12The Alberta government is continuing work on government-supported recommendations fromAlberta's Commission on Learning. The report hasprovided guidance and direction to government andthe Kindergarten to Grade 12 education system in order to ensure that the system meets the needs of allAlberta students and is affordable, with sustainablefunding over the long term. For many people, formal education does not end with grade 12. Alberta is among Canada's leaders when itcomes to the proportion of the population that pursueslifelong learning opportunities. Alberta has increased investment to expand learning opportunities and create more spaces at Alberta'suniversities, colleges and technical institutes, and hasheld public dialogues on future directions in advancedlearning. These dialogues have resulted in a newvision and framework to guide the development ofAlberta as a learning society where individuals canreach their potential. Education helps individuals achieve their goals. Equally important is the fact that education helps theprovince prosper. These new strategies will help tomake Albertans competitive in the global market andensure full participation in Alberta's communities. Opportunity 3: Competing in a Global Marketplace Because Alberta is a major exporter of goods and services, an important strategy for the government isto ensure reliable export markets . Alberta individuals and companies export their goods andservices across Canada, North America and the world. Seamless access to the United States, Alberta's largest and most important trading partner, is essential. Alberta will work with the federal government to examine the feasibility of a customs union with theUnited States. A customs union would result incommon border practices, harmonization of tradepolicies and regulations, and an end to the use oftrade remedies within North America. A customsunion would strengthen Canada's overall traderelationship with the U.S. and reduce interruptions toAlberta's access to U.S. markets.The Alberta government also is committed to maintaining and improving its relationship with theU.S. An Alberta office has been established inWashington, D.C. to ensure Alberta's interests arepromoted within the U.S. It also is important to strengthen partnerships within Alberta and Canada. The Alberta government willdevelop effective partnerships to expand trade andbuild a stronger investment climate. Protecting what Albertans achieve is vital to stimulating continued economic strength. Alberta isan important member of Confederation. Albertans areproud Canadians who believe strongly in theircountry. But Alberta's interests are not always takeninto account by the federal government. Federalprograms and policies sometimes have a negativeeffect on Albertans and the Alberta economy. The provincial government will continue to work to ensure Albertans are treated fairly withinConfederation. The province will work with other provinces to ensure that the federal government respects provincialjurisdiction and does not take measures that wouldhurt Alberta's economy or Albertans' quality of life.This includes ensuring regular First Ministers'meetings with the federal government, provincialparticipation in international negotiations that affectprovincial interests and working toward a Triple Esenate. The government also will work to ensure that external influences do not jeopardize Alberta's ability tobenefit from its invaluable natural resources, such asoil, gas and coal. The Alberta government willconsider carefully all measures that could be taken toensure provincial interests are protected withinCanada and abroad. Alberta's agriculture industry, a cornerstone of Alberta life for many years, is under pressure fromvarious sources. Generally declining commodityprices will continue to put pressure on all sectors ofthe industry. Market access in the face of bovinespongiform encephalopathy (BSE) disease has causedsignificant harm to Alberta's beef industry. Theseimpacts, combined with severe weather and dryconditions, continue to threaten this sector.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 13The Alberta government will combat the forces negatively affecting the agriculture industry through avariety of measures. Specifically, the governmentwill work to ensure access to foreign markets bystrengthening relations with the U.S. and by ensuringAlberta's meat inspection processes are the best in theworld. Expansion of the province's meat-processingindustry is important to ensure that beef products arepackaged in Alberta before being shipped to exportmarkets. The Alberta government also will ensure its water and land use policies allow the industry to prosper. It willcontinue to invest in research directed at improvingthe efficiency of agricultural operations and ensurethat value-added products are exported at theirhighest development potential. Alberta's forestry industry is facing external pressure due to U.S. countervailing duties. The Albertagovernment is committed to strengthening relationswith the U.S. in order to resolve current issues andavoid future problems. The government also will promote tourism development through its comprehensive land usepolicy and by informing Canada, North America andthe world about Alberta's spectacular touristdestinations. A leading economy requires leading public infrastructure and transportation . Modern infrastructure and transportation systems are essentialto attract investment and skilled workers. Efficientelectric transmission lines and oil and gas pipelines,well-equipped health facilities, good schools andpost-secondary facilities, high-quality water systemsand safe and modern roads are key factors to a strongeconomy. The government will continue to work with local governments, economic development authorities,industry and others in the community to ensureinfrastructure and transportation systems supporteconomic and demographic growth. The government will continue to place a priority on planned, stable capital expenditures through the useof these mechanisms. This includes making fundsavailable for timely maintenance and preservation ofour capital assets and taking advantage of newapproaches to funding capital projects, such as public-private partnerships. Alternative financing optionswill be used only if they make economic sense and ifthey get new infrastructure and transportation onstream efficiently and quickly. In order to remain globally competitive, Alberta must also work towards continued improvement inproductivity . A competitive tax system, improvements in workplace health and safety,positive labour-management relationships, thedevelopment of new technologies and the removal ofunnecessary legislative impediments will enhance theproductive competitiveness of Alberta industry. The Alberta government will continue to support an environment in which small businesses can succeed. This means keeping taxes low and eliminatingunnecessary rules and regulations. Albertans -always innovative, always willing to take risks - willdo the rest themselves. Opportunity 4: Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit Albertans have come to expect high-quality social programs and services, and the Alberta governmentremains committed to providing them. Over the next 20 years, Albertans and their government will face some significant challenges inimproving upon the high-quality services Albertansexpect. For example, the real cost of providing quality health care will continue to grow. Over the past 10 years,per capita health care costs have outpaced inflationand economic growth. As the population ages,pressures on health and related services, including thecost of new drugs and technologies, are expected toincrease. Albertans know that constantly pouringgreater and greater amounts of money into health caredoes not guarantee the sustainability of the system; infact, it threatens it. Similarly, the costs of providing Alberta students with a quality education and support services to childrenand families also are rising. Government must make sure that its revenues are sufficient to meet the costs of these programs andmust take steps to keep these programs affordable andsustainable without sacrificing quality. Innovationwill play an important role in improving services forAlbertans.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 14Ensuring Adequate Revenue The Alberta government has taken some steps over the last decade to make sure adequate revenues are inplace to fund programs and services. The Sustainability Fund was created to cushion spending plans against revenue volatility, resulting inimproved predictability in program funding from yearto year. Most importantly, paying down the provincial debt has freed up funds for programs and services - fundsthat otherwise would have gone to debt-servicingcosts. But the potential for a decline in natural resource royalty revenues means that the Alberta governmentmust take additional steps to ensure revenues areadequate to meet Albertans' expectations. TheAlberta government will continue to monitor the taxregime and set out fiscal policies with the temporarynature of resource revenues in mind. Improving Services for Tomorrow's AlbertansTo ensure Albertans can continue to enjoy the level of services that are currently provided and enhanceservices in other areas, innovative ways of fundingand delivering programs and reducing costs, wherepossible, are required. The Alberta government has taken significant steps to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and economiesof program and service delivery over the past 10years. For example, administrative costs for healthcare have been streamlined significantly. Providingsome publicly funded health services in modern,private clinics rather than in expensive hospitalsettings, coupled with new drugs and technologies,has improved patient service. Programs such as theHealth Link and primary care initiative provide newways for Albertans to access health services quickly. The provincial government also has improved service delivery through the development of a well-educated,service-oriented, innovative and motivated publicservice. But even with these improvements, new methods of program delivery and funding are required.Government must maintain responsibility for settingpolicy and monitoring outcomes to ensure the desiredresults are achieved. Programs should be deliveredby those best able to deliver them effectively andefficiently, whether government, the private sector,non-governmental organizations or partnership amongthese parties. Health care . Alberta's health care system has undergone a number of changes in the past 10 years.Regional health authorities, health providers andcommunity partners have worked together to improveaccess, streamline services, open up new approachesto care and respond to the needs of Alberta's fast-growing population. The government has committed to a Third Way to further evolve the health system for the future. This is why Alberta hosted an international symposium on health. Unleashing Innovation inHealth Systems: Alberta's Symposium on Healthbrought some of the world's leading experts in healthsystems innovation to Alberta to present their ideas tohealth system leaders, providers and stakeholders. There is no single solution to the challenges of our health care system. Instead, it is important to moveahead with hundreds of ideas and improvements thatmeet patients' needs and make a positive difference inthe health of Albertans. As a step in this direction, the Alberta government will evaluate alternative ways to finance programs notcovered by the Canada Health Act , such as long-term care and prescription drugs, and explore cost-sharingapproaches to a wide range of services. Working withhealth care providers, the government is promotinghealthy living and wellness and making services moreefficient and accessible for all Albertans. As well, there is an important emphasis on recognizing the impact of health research andtechnology on the community as an economic driver- as a benefit, not just a cost. Services to Alberta's children are not only an important service to those in need, they are also aninvestment in the human potential of the province.Getting a healthy start in life is critical to the successof Alberta's children and the realization of Alberta'svision for 2025. The Alberta government will continue to place a priority on children's services, especially thoseservices that are designed to enable children to2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 15succeed at learning. A significant focus will be placed on programs that promote early childhooddevelopment and other prevention strategies tosupport families in promoting the optimaldevelopment of children. Overcoming barriers to success at an early age will help children achieve and help society avoid the costof lost potential. Community partnerships provideleadership in helping young Albertans succeed. Helping those in need is essential to Alberta's success. More importantly, Albertans want to be surethat fair and compassionate programs are availablefor those who need some support. Barriers to full participation in the province's economic and community life can result in limitedopportunities and contribute to poor health status.Children from low-income families may not enterschool ready to learn. Aboriginal children andcommunities may require support to ensure the gap isclosed between the socio-economic status ofAboriginal and non-Aboriginal Albertans. Childrenfrom new Canadian families may face literacychallenges as well as a lack of training in English as asecond language. Persons with disabilities andseniors may face financial challenges, lack access toaffordable housing or lack the necessary supports forindependence. The Alberta government will encourage initiatives that assist families and support children to realizetheir potential, enhance the participation of Aboriginalpeople in the Alberta economy, and ensure thatseniors and Albertans with disabilities enjoy adequateincomes and the supports necessary for independence. Continuously Improving Quality of LifeThe stimulation of Alberta's economic growth will enable the province to fund essential services, whichin turn helps create a high quality of life. However, quality of life is more than a growing economy and good social programs. It is also aboutpeople being able to realize their dreams, feeling safein their homes and on their streets, knowing theirnatural environment is protected, and being enrichedby cultural, sport and recreational opportunities intheir neighbourhoods.The Alberta government is committed to makinginvestments in all of these factors that contribute tothe overall quality of life for all Albertans. Strong municipalities are an essential part of a strong Alberta. The provincial government willcontinue to work toward enhancing its relationshipswith its local governments. Ensuring that the rolesand responsibilities of local governments are welldefined means that municipalities can continue to beresponsive to the needs of their communities andremain financially strong and viable. Vibrant rural communities also are essential to the province's economy and overall quality of life. TheAlberta government will implement its RuralDevelopment Strategy, A Place to Grow, that assuresdynamic rural communities where families,individuals, organizations, businesses andgovernments are contributors to the growth,prosperity and quality of life of Albertans. Alberta SuperNet provides an electronic highway to hundreds of communities, making it possible forbusinesses and individuals in rural areas to competeglobally. Health services and educationalopportunities will be enhanced by new technologies. The economic opportunities of the Calgary-Edmonton corridor can be distributed more widely withappropriate infrastructure and transportation. Safe communities are critically important to the well-being of Albertans and their children. TheAlberta government will continue to invest inAlberta's communities to make them among thesafest in North America. Government will focus onthe continued reduction of violent crime byimproving its commitment to policing and gettingtougher on those who commit violent offences. The Alberta government has committed to an integrated, community-based approach to preventingand responding effectively to family violence andbullying. The Premier's Roundtable on FamilyViolence and Bullying has developed a strategy thatwill improve the capacity of communities to respondto one of our province's most serious social issues. Itproposes solutions that focus on families, schools,communities and regional collaboration. 2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 16The government is taking strong action to tackle the issue of crystal methamphetamine. Initiatives willinclude a focus on prevention, increasing theavailability of addictions services and legislativeresponses. The government will play a leadership role in establishing a more responsive justice system byfocusing on preventative strategies, expanding theavailability and scope of dispute resolution optionsand using technology to facilitate access to justiceservices. The Alberta government will help build safer communities by involving the communitiesthemselves, along with the private sector, families andindividuals. It also will continue to pressure thefederal government to take tough positions againstviolent crimes and those who commit them. Safety is not limited to protection from crime. Albertans need to feel safe in their homes, at workand at play. To provide this assurance, thegovernment supports programs and initiatives forsafety standards, injury prevention and safety on ourstreets, promoting partnerships wherever possible. World events have highlighted a need to provide security from threats of a global nature. The Albertagovernment will continue to focus on mitigating,preparing for, responding to and recovering frommajor emergencies and disasters at the provincial andlocal levels. The government will continuedevelopment of a world-class security and emergencypreparedness framework for the province. Aclean natural environment and a vibrant cultural mosaic are other key components of ensuring a high quality of life. This includes ensuringAlberta's natural areas remain unspoiled andprotecting the quality of Alberta's air, lakes andrivers. The Alberta government will place a priority on Alberta's quality natural environment by developing aframework for maintaining its existing natural areas.The implementation of the government's new waterstrategy will provide for the continued high quality ofAlberta's lakes, rivers and streams and also willaddress water conservation challenges.The Alberta government also will develop strategies that encourage innovative solutions on climate changeand ensure a balanced and sustainable approach togrowth and industrial and resource development. Alberta's vibrant, artistic and cultural mosaic not only enriches the lives of all Albertans, but also opens thedoors to more international trade opportunities. TheAlberta government will continue to value theprovince's artistic and cultural diversity by providingsupport for community needs. Albertans value their personal and economic freedoms . Over the past 10 years, the provincial government continuously has reviewed its programs,policies, regulations and legislation to ensure it is notinterfering needlessly in the lives of Albertans. Thisrequires a continuous commitment to reviewprograms and end government involvement in areasthat can be better delivered by others. Government also must ensure that it does not waste time and resources in providing services that shouldbe the responsibility of individual Albertans. To that end, the Alberta government will continue to review its regulatory systems to ensure that Albertansare not over-regulated and businesses can continue tothrive. If it finds laws or rules that make no sense, itwill abolish them. CONCLUSION: BUILDING ON ALBERTANS' SELF-RELIANCE This plan for Alberta's future is based on a truly Albertan characteristic - a dedication to strongindividuals within strong communities. The Alberta government is committed fully to the values and vision on which this plan was built. This plan was developed with advice from people from across the province. The government willcontinue to work with Albertans, including the privatesector, communities and non-governmentalorganizations, to refine the plan in order to ensure itcontinues to reflect the changing environment inwhich Albertans live. 2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 172006-09 Government of Alberta Business Plan The 2006-09 Government of Alberta Business Plan is focused on ensuring that Alberta keeps pace with its projected economic growth and becomes an even better place to live, work and raise a family. This three-year government business plan advances the four strategic opportunities of the government's 20-year strategic plan: Unleashing Innovation; Leading in Learning; Competing in a Global Marketplace; and MakingAlberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit. people from other parts of Canada and the world every year. At the same time, rural Albertans areemphasizing the need for vibrant rural communitiesand a stronger, more resilient agricultural sector. Thegovernment is addressing these priorities through APlace to Grow, its Rural Development Strategy.Alberta has committed to advance learning for allAlbertans as a cornerstone to building the innovative,knowledge-driven economy we need to sustain futureprosperity in all parts of the province. Finally, Alberta is poised to affirm its place in Canada and in the world as an innovative, entrepreneurialleader. From breakthroughs in medical research totechnological advances in new and emerging sectorsto job growth, Alberta's successes contribute to astronger Canada in diverse and exciting ways. To take full advantage of Alberta's opportunities and to meet its challenges, the government has outlined a\"work order\" focused on eight Top Priorities over thenext two years. These priorities are: Building and Educating Tomorrow's Workforce; Improving Alberta's Health System - The Third Way; Building Infrastructure for Our Future; Using and Respecting the Land; Building Aboriginal Self-Sufficiency; Saving Lives and Reducing Injury on Alberta's Highways; Reviewing Tax Policy; and Protecting People's Private Information.The three-year government business plan provides actions for these eight Top Priorities and outlines the14 goals and supporting strategic priorities set for the2006-09 planning period. The 2006-09 government business plan positionsMANAGING OUR GROWTH AND SECURING OUR FUTURE The 2006-09 government business plan addresses the significant opportunities and challenges facing theprovince over the next three years. For one, Albertais expected to continue enjoying the strongesteconomic growth of any province in Canada. Theannual rate of growth is projected to average aroundfour per cent over the next three years. There are over$120 billion in capital projects planned or in progressin Alberta. While this level of economic activity iscontributing to population growth and the highquality of life in Alberta, it also generates growinglabour shortages and puts pressures on ourenvironment and infrastructure. Managing thisgrowth is the most significant challenge facing theprovince. Secondly, the province can expect further surpluses driven by higher energy revenues. However, energyprices remain volatile and it is difficult to know todayhow much additional revenue will be available in thefuture. If we want our children to enjoy the quality oflife we have now, we must manage these surplusresource revenues in a responsible manner. That iswhy over 75 per cent of the 2005-06 surplus wasinvested in the future. The province will continue toset aside a significant portion of each year's surplusfor endowments to support long-term priorities thatwill benefit Albertans for generations to come. It isalso investing in infrastructure, education, health andother current priorities identified by Albertans. Thesestrategic investments in roads, schools, hospitals andother capital projects are critical for Alberta'scommunities now and for the future. Thirdly, the social fabric of Alberta is changing. Our population is aging. Alberta is becoming moreurbanized and more culturally and ethnically diverseas the province's advantages attract thousands of2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 18Alberta to make the most of its economic, social and natural advantages. It is a plan for strategicmanagement of our province's growth and a plan forsecuring its future. FOCUS OF THE THREE-YEAR PLAN: EIGHT TOP PRIORITIES The Government of Alberta has outlined eight Top Priorities as the focus of the 2006-09 governmentbusiness plan. Although each of these prioritiescontributes significantly to the achievement of one ormore of the 14 goals outlined in the business plan,each is aligned only with the goal to which it is moststongly related. These priorities will be achievedthrough close collaboration and cooperation across anumber of ministries. Building and Educating Tomorrow's Workforce (Aligns with Goal 1) Alberta is facing a number of demographic trends - an aging population, low birthrate, urbanization, andslowed interprovincial migration - all of which areaffecting our ability to meet the labour force demandsof a rapidly growing economy. Projections suggestAlberta will face a shortage of 100,000 workers overthe next ten years. Alberta must cultivate and attractpeople with the skills to meet diverse needs in orderto sustain its future economic growth. Actions Develop and approve a refocused and coordinated labour force development strategy that addressesemerging and critical labour needs. Implement the Access to the Future Act to enhance the quality of advanced learning opportunities andto encourage more innovation in the advancedlearning system. An Access Advisory Council willbe established and the first earnings from theAccess to the Future Fund will be distributed. Implement recommendations from A Learning Alberta Forum with a focus on improvingaffordability, accessibility and quality of learningopportunities for adult Albertans. Improving Alberta's Health System - The Third Way (Aligns with Goal 5) While Albertans value the health care they receive, providing timely access to quality health services isincreasingly challenging. The growing cost of the health system also needs to be addressed. ImprovingAlberta's public health system is a priority for thegovernment, with a focus on enhancing accessibility,quality and sustainability and improving the overallhealth status of Albertans. Actions Develop a child and youth wellness strategy to address the health, well-being and mental health ofchildren. Increase the availability of addictions services and take specific and targeted action to tackle thecrystal methamphetamine problem. Develop and implement a common pharmaceutical framework to control spiraling drug costs andincrease coverage. Develop and implement strategies to improve the quality of long-term care. Develop recommendations for an insurance program that considers coverage of continuingcare, prescription drugs and other non-emergencyhealth services. Implement a province-wide electronic health record that provides diagnostic imaging testresults. Building Infrastructure for Our Future (Aligns with Goal 14) Population growth and a booming economy are challenging the province's public infrastructure. Thebacklog in infrastructure maintenance needs to beaddressed. A comprehensive plan to address existinginfrastructure needs and future investment ininfrastructure is key to supporting future economicgrowth. Actions Develop a 10-year comprehensive capital plan to address existing deferred infrastructuremaintenance and future investment in newinfrastructure projects. Complete the CANAMEX Trade Corridor to support increased north/south trade. Improve the Fort McMurray highway corridor to address public safety and traffic capacity. Construct Calgary and Edmonton ring roads.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 19Using and Respecting the Land (Aligns with Goal 1) Urbanization, population growth and a strong economy have combined to increase pressure on andcompetition for use of Alberta's natural resources.Effective management of the competing interests ofsurface and sub-surface development, agriculturalproduction, urban settlement, watershed management,recreation and preservation of natural beauty andwildlife habitats is critical to Alberta's high quality oflife and continued economic prosperity. Actions Develop an Alberta Land Use Framework for effective management of competing land useinterests. Continue to implement the Water for Life Strategy to support a healthy and sustainable water supplyfor communities, for the environment and forAlberta's economic well-being. Improve monitoring and reporting and provide better access to reliable information on ourresources and environment. Promote research, development and commercialization to improve extraction,upgrading and refining of Alberta's hydrocarbonresources and reduce environmental impacts. Position Alberta as a leader in adapting and integrating clean coal technology to provide anenergy source to produce electricity, heat,hydrogen, fuels, chemical feedstocks, and in thefuture move CO 2to support enhanced oil recovery, with near zero or minimal environmental impactson land, air and water. Building Aboriginal Self-Sufficiency (Aligns with Goal 7) Alberta's Aboriginal, First Nations and M\u00e9tis peoples are the fastest-growing demographic group in theprovince. Aboriginal people have a key role to playin Alberta's economic prosperity as well as indetermining the future direction of their communities. Alberta is currently involved in self-government negotiations with the First Nations and the federalgovernment. Alberta's negotiators are committed toensuring the best interests of all Albertans are servedin this important process. At the same time, there isno clear regulatory regime on reserves to regulate economic and resource development. Thisdiscourages much-needed investment in on-reservedevelopment. Clarity in this area is needed toimprove opportunities for Alberta's Aboriginalcommunities on reserve. Actions Implement a framework to guide provincial participation in self-government negotiations withthe federal government and First Nations. Establish regulatory mechanisms to enable economic activity on reserve. Saving Lives and Reducing Injury on Alberta Highways (Aligns with Goal 10) The societal cost of traffic injuries and fatalities, including health care, policing, property damage andlost work, is very high. In 2003 alone, trafficcollisions in Alberta claimed 385 lives and caused26,426 non-fatal injuries. The Government of Albertais making Saving Lives and Reducing Injury onAlberta Highways a priority because traffic collisionscan be prevented. Saving lives and preventinginjuries will benefit thousands of families,communities and businesses in all corners of theprovince. Actions Develop and implement a Traffic Safety Plan, which provides a coordinated approach for thedevelopment of new strategies, includinglegislation and increased enforcement. Through coordinated leadership, specifically address issues such as traffic safety, drivereducation and licensing, enforcement, technologyand sustainable funding. Reviewing Tax Policy (Aligns with Goal 8) Various tax policy options have been considered over time in order to ensure Alberta's tax system remainscompetitive. Tax policy decisions need to balancecompetitiveness with the need to ensure that the taxbase is sufficient to support the province's programs. Action Build on results of the current tax review to ensure tax competitiveness, economic efficiency, fairnessand revenue stability. 2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 20Protecting People's Private Information (Aligns with Goal 10) As governments, citizens and businesses increasingly seek greater coordination, integration and automationto improve service delivery, all reasonable measuresmust be taken to ensure personal information ismanaged with the highest standards of security. Action Develop a government-wide strategy to ensure personal information entrusted to government ismanaged to ensure privacy and security. These eight top priorities comprise a clear and concise \"work order\" and the government will beaccountable to Albertans for making significantprogress on these eight priorities in the 2006-09business plan. BEING ACCOUNTABLE TO ALBERTANS The Government of Alberta Business Plan is anongoing three-year plan that is part of thegovernment's commitment to be open andaccountable to the people of Alberta. The Government Accountability Act requires that the government annually publish a three-yearconsolidated fiscal plan that includes a three-yearconsolidated capital plan for the government and athree-year government business plan. The Actalso requires that the government annually publish theresults of its performance against the performancemeasures targets established in the three-yeargovernment business plan and to explain significantvariances from the targeted results. Performance results for the 2006-09 government business plan will be published in the Measuring Upreport released as part of the 2006-07 Government ofAlberta Annual Report at the end of June in 2007. Core Businesses and Goals The 2006-09 government business plan has 14 goals that are broad statements of what the government istrying to achieve in each of its core businesses andwith its capital investment. The government's corebusinesses encompass its principal areas ofresponsibility and are linked to one or more of thegovernment goals. They provide a functionalbreakdown of the work the government does forAlbertans and are the primary categories for allocating budgetary resources. The core businessesare summarized in the Expense by Core Businesstable and Core Businesses Key in the Appendix. The goals should not be considered in isolation. Progress toward one goal often results in progressbeing made toward other goals. Furthermore, thegovernment cannot achieve the goals alone. Thegovernment works in partnership with other levels ofgovernment, communities, businesses, industry, andnot-for-profit sectors toward the achievement ofAlberta's goals. Each of the government's goals provides information about the government's priorities for the next threeyears and what resources will be used in workingtoward the goal. The information is presented in thefollowing sections: What it means; Three-yearstrategic focus; Link to plans; Whatit costs; and Measures. What it meansEach goal includes a \"What it means\" section that describes the goal from the government's perspectiveand provides context for the goal statement. It alsodirects readers to related goals in cases where thegovernment's work toward achieving the goal affectsprogress toward other goals in the three-yeargovernment business plan. Three-year strategic focusThe \"Three-year strategic focus\" section summarizes the government's strategic priorities for each of thegoals. Strategic priorities are major initiatives that the government will undertake during the next threeyears, over and above ongoing program and servicedelivery responsibilities, to address significantopportunities and challenges related to the goals.Although more than one ministry is usually involvedin working to address a strategic priority, only thelead ministry (or ministries) is shown. More detailedinformation is available in the three-year businessplans of the ministries that are linked to the strategicpriorities. 2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 21These strategic priorities include the eight Top Priorities that are the focus of the 2006-09government business plan. Although the TopPriorities support more than one of the 14 goals, eachis listed only under the goal to which it is moststrongly related. Link to ministry business plansEach goal has a \"Link to ministry business plans\" section that lists the ministries that contributefinancially to achieving the goal. The Expense byGoal by Ministry, 2006-07 Estimate table in theAppendix provides a breakdown of ministries'planned spending for the government goals. Additional information about the work government is doing to achieve its goals is provided in the three-year business plans of the ministries that are linked toeach goal. Ministries indicate how their business plangoals relate to and support the government goals inthe \"Link to the Government of Alberta StrategicBusiness Plan\" section of their three-year governmentbusiness plans. Ministry business plans are anintegral part of the Government of Alberta StrategicPlan and are published in the Business Plans volumeof the Budget. What it CostsThe \"What it costs\" section for each goal shows the annual provincial spending directed at achieving thegoal. The first 13 goals are linked to thegovernment's 2006-09 Fiscal Plan through theexpense by function (core business) breakdown of thegovernment's spending. The Expense by Goal tablein the Appendix summarizes the planned spending forthe first 13 goals over the next three years. Goal 14 has a different perspective than the other goals. It is the government's goal for its investmentin the province's infrastructure, which providesessential support for achieving all of thegovernment's goals. Goal 14 is linked to thegovernment's 2006-09 Capital Plan that includes thetotal value of capital being acquired or directlysupported by the provincial government. The CapitalPlan includes spending from across the government'score businesses in the form of grants to localauthorities, as well as investment in provincialgovernment-owned capital and the value of projectsbeing alternatively financed.Measures The \"Measures\" section of each goal includes two groups of measures: societal measures andperformance measures. Societal measures track broad social and economic trends in the province. These measures areinfluenced by numerous factors that are outside ofgovernment and should be viewed as measures of theprovince's well-being, taking into account all of theinfluencing factors both within and outside of theprovince. The efforts of individual Albertans, business and industry, communities, not-for-profit groups and otherlevels of government also play an important role incontributing to the province's well-being andinfluence the results of societal measures. To showthe recent trend for these provincial measures of well-being, societal measures are presented in the businessplan with five years of results and the desired resultsthat indicate progress toward the goal. Performance measures track what the government would like to achieve in making progress toward thegoal. These measures are presented in the businessplan with the last actual results and targets for each ofthe three years of the plan. Targets for performance measures are established based on what the government would like to achievegiven previous results, budgeted resources and theexpected effects of significant factors that influencethe results for the measures. Results for performancemeasures, including a discussion of the effects ofsignificant factors, will be published in the 2006-07Measuring Up report. Taken together, the societal and performance measures help the reader to assess the current well-being of the province with respect to the goals andwhether the government's overall initiatives areeffective in contributing to achievement of the goalsin the short-term and over time.2006-09 GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN 22Unleashing Innovation What it means Sustainable economic growth and prosperity are essential to maintaining and improving Albertans' overall quality of life.

[Original Signed]Pearl Calahasen, Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development March 1, 2006 THE MINISTRY The Ministry is comprised of the following: the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, which consists of First Nation and M\u00e9tis Relations, Land and Resource Issues, and Strategic Services; the Northern Alberta Development Council, a council of northerners, reporting through an MLA Chair to the Minister; and the M\u00e9tis Settlements Appeal Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body, established by the M\u00e9tis Settlements Act , to resolve disputes pertaining to land, membership and surface rights.BUSINESS PLAN 2006-0962ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09VISION An Alberta that includes the full participation of self- reliant Aboriginal and northern Albertans in the province'sopportunities and prosperity.MISSION Through collaboration with other ministries, Aboriginalgovernments and organizations, industry and other partners,enhance Aboriginal well-being and self-reliance, clarifygovernment and Aboriginal roles and responsibilities, andadvance the economic and social development of northernAlberta. LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development is committed to the Government of Alberta's Strategic Business Plan's vision,which includes an Alberta where \"Aboriginal Albertans have achieved a socioeconomic status equivalent to that of otherAlbertans .\" Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development supports Government of Alberta Business Plan Goal 7 - The well-being and self-reliance of Aboriginal communities and people will be improved. The Ministry contributes to the following strategic opportunity of the government's 20-year strategic business plan: Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit. The Ministry supports the goal and contributes to the strategic opportunity by building on the strength and vitality ofAboriginal and northern communities, and enhancing their social and economic well-being. SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES 1. Aboriginal participation in the economy . Aboriginal youth are the fastest growing segment of the Alberta labour force at the same time that industry is facing skilled labour shortages. It is critical to close the gap in education both onand off-reserve, through enhanced public and post-secondary education and innovative training solutions. With thesupport of industry and government, Aboriginal youth could fill positions in trades, administrative and professionalcareers. Enhanced education, training, and business development opportunities will result in self-reliant people andstrengthened communities, which are ready and willing to take advantage of economic opportunities. 2. First Nation relations . Respectful relations are based on understanding the role of the Treaties and the responsibility of the Crown to First Nations. In recent years there has been a tremendous increase in interest among First Nationgovernments to work with the Government of Alberta. This creates opportunities for the development of newgovernment-to-government partnerships including initiatives to increase First Nations participation in the economy andinitiatives to improve the effectiveness of programs and services for First Nations people. Improved relationships withFirst Nations will also facilitate economic partnerships between government, First Nations and industry. 3. M\u00e9tis Settlements . M\u00e9tis Settlements are unique land-based governments that exist only in Alberta. Statutory payments made under the M\u00e9tis Settlements Accord Implementation Act , which have contributed to the costs of local programs, services and infrastructure on the eight M\u00e9tis Settlements, will conclude in March 2007. While theSettlements have made significant progress toward greater self-reliance, consideration of strategies to continue thatprogress is required. The Ministry will work with the M\u00e9tis Settlements General Council to examine potentialapproaches to further enhance governance and self-reliance.63 ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-094. M\u00e9tis relations . Alberta has responded proactively and collaboratively to court decisions which have found that M\u00e9tis people, in certain circumstances, have constitutionally protected rights, including the right to harvest wildlife.Discussions regarding the renewal of the Alberta/M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta Association Framework Agreement provide anopportunity to explore new strategies to enhance the participation of M\u00e9tis people in the economy and to address othersocial issues. 5. Land management and resource development . Alberta's consultation policy regarding the management and development of public lands commits the Crown to consult on matters pertaining to Aboriginal and Treaty rights.Coordination of land and resource management is critical to maintaining Alberta's position within the global economy.An appropriately resourced consultation policy will improve decision-making by balancing interests and applyingleading practices. Implementation of this policy through the development, with other ministries, First Nations andindustry, of operational guidelines, will promote certainty for all parties. The timely completion of traditional usestudies and the incorporation of traditional environmental knowledge are crucial elements to successful implementation. 6. First Nations governance and regulatory frameworks . The Government of Alberta's Aboriginal Policy Framework recognizes in principle the inherent right of self-government and commits Alberta to participate in the development ofself-government agreements, if invited to do so by the federal government and First Nations. The negotiation andimplementation of self-government agreements offers an opportunity to re-empower First Nations communities andresolve long-standing service delivery and jurisdictional issues, including efforts currently underway to developmechanisms to remove barriers to economic activity on First Nations reserves. There are significant potentialimplications for Alberta, and the Ministry is taking the lead in developing appropriate frameworks for, and coordinatingprovincial participation in, discussions regarding First Nations governance and regulatory frameworks. 7. Clarify federal, provincial and Aboriginal roles and responsibilities . Jurisdictional gaps, uncertainty and unclear roles and responsibilities continue to impact the delivery of services to Aboriginal people, especially across reserveboundaries. Through increased collaboration across governments - including the proposed First Ministers' Meeting onAboriginal Issues, the Alberta-Canada-Aboriginal Partnership Forum and the Alberta Chiefs' Fiscal Table - developcreative strategies and partnerships to overcome specific federal-provincial jurisdictional barriers. 8. Advancing northern development . Northern Alberta's abundant natural resources are the driving force behind the Alberta economy. Northern Alberta comprises 60 per cent of the province but contains less than ten per cent of theprovince's population. The Ministry will coordinate the development of strategies that recognize the north's uniqueneeds and opportunities. Pan-northern transportation, infrastructure, housing and other social concerns must beaddressed to realize the full potential of northern growth corridors benefiting the whole Alberta economy.64ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of external and internal challenges, the strategic priorities described below have been identified.

It is people and their ideas, creativity, knowledge and wisdom that willsecure the prosperity, economic growth and healthy communities needed to improve the quality of life for Alberta's citizensand advance us into the 21st century. Advanced Education's mission is to help Albertans acquire the learning, work and life skills they need to achieve their full potential to the benefit of themselves, their communities and the economy. The following opportunities and challenges areconsidered significant in that they could impact the Ministry's ability to achieve its mission and goals. Advanced Educationexamines these challenges and opportunities to determine the strategic priorities, strategies and initiatives to support anadvanced learning system that focuses on quality, accessibility, affordability, diversity and collaboration. Globalization The world is increasingly dynamic and interconnected. This changing geo-political contextincludes rapidly growing Asian economies with increasing demand for resources andcompetitive, skilled workforces. The Alberta government works to maintain reliable exportmarkets, keep Alberta companies and citizens competitive, develop the future supply ofskilled workers and ensure the full participation of all of its communities in the economy. Inthe changing geo-political context, this means Alberta and its advanced learning system willcontinue to be influenced by international competition for foreign direct investments,learning opportunities and high value-added industries as well as the need for a highlyskilled, knowledgeable and creative workforce. Building Community Capacity throughCollaborationThere is growing recognition that affordable, accessible, high quality and innovative advanced learning is a key to facilitating and securing social prosperity, economic successand a knowledgeable and healthy citizenry. To accomplish this, the Ministry must continueto build strong community capacity through collaboration with stakeholders and partnersincluding community-based educators, public and private post-secondary institutions,literacy groups, students, Aboriginal educators and leaders, business and industry, andimmigrant and disabled communities and other under-represented groups. This collaborationwill focus on expanded and locally relevant regional access through the strategic applicationof technology, expansion of degree granting capacity and providing the tools necessary toallow all learners to succeed. Diversification of the EconomyAlberta must sustain a globally competitive economy for the future. This is an economy that adds value across its traditional resource sectors as well as new and emerging sectors such aslife sciences, nanotechnology, environmental and information technologies and value-addedmanufacturing. At the same time, Alberta must support learning in the arts and humanitiesto foster the creativity that drives truly innovative societies. The advanced learning systemplays a key role in developing and supplying this capacity. Sustainability of the Advanced LearningSystemIt is a government priority to ensure Alberta's advanced learning system provides affordable learning opportunities, increased access to those opportunities, seamless transitionsthroughout the system, more research support and the flexibility learners need to pursue theircareer aspirations. To do this, the Alberta government will need to build on the high qualityadvanced learning foundation we currently have with strategic investments in needs-basedstudent assistance and debt-repayment mechanisms, human resources, facilities, equipment,technology and other supports.73 ADVANCED EDUCATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Public Values and ExpectationsAlbertans value their learning opportunities and recognize their personal role in obtaining them. They believe in an advanced learning system where financial need is not a barrier tolearning, one which is fiscally responsible and accountable for results. Albertans also want asystem that improves continuously and responds to diverse learner needs and considers theirinput to decisions impacting the advanced learning system. In the face of these expectations,there is a greater need to communicate complex issues and demonstrate the return oninvestment in advanced learning. Information and CommunicationsTechnologyTo succeed in a knowledge-based economy, Albertans need information and communications technology that is integrated into life long learning. The advanced learning system facesongoing opportunities and challenges to expand and build technology knowledge and skillsinto learning experiences, using the most effective and efficient technological innovationsavailable. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 The Ministry has identified strategic priorities to support the Government of Alberta Strategic Business Plan and respond to the significant opportunities and challenges influencing Advanced Education's ability to achieve its mission and goals for2006-09. 1. Building and Educating Tomorrow'sWorkforce Linkage: Goals 1 and 2Alberta's economic strength depends on a knowledgeable citizenry and a highly skilled workforce. This requires a learning system that gives learners the opportunities and tools tosucceed and excel. To enable the advanced learning system to meet the learning goals ofAlbertans and support a vibrant and growing economy, Advanced Education will co-lead aGovernment of Alberta top priority and work with partners and stakeholders on strategiesthat support the Leading in Learning strategic opportunity of the Government of Alberta's 20-year strategic plan. The strategic and policy directions from A Learning Alberta will also support this strategic opportunity. This will help Albertans build the learning, work and lifeskills they need to achieve their aspirations and maximize their potential to the benefit ofthemselves and all Albertans. Advanced Education will work toward taking Alberta's advanced learning system to the next level in a way that ensures it is affordable, accessible and of the highest quality. 2. Access for All Learners Linkage: Goals 1 and 2People are the key to Alberta's future prosperity. The success of adult learners depends upon their ability to make smooth transitions to, within and from the advanced learning system.Enhancing these transitions, along with increasing access to learning opportunities, will helpAlbertans achieve success in the advanced learning system and the labour market. It is particularly important to ensure that under-represented groups have access to advanced education opportunities. Collaborating with stakeholders to improve First Nations, M\u00e9tisand Inuit learner success is a priority for Advanced Education. Advanced Education willalso ensure high levels of awareness among students and their parents of advanced educationopportunities. There will also be a focus on expanded regional and community access through the strategic application of technology, expansion of degree granting capacity within the system,clarification of roles relative to communities and provision of the tools necessary to allowlearners to succeed. Increasing access to learning opportunities will generate returns for Albertans for years to come.74ADVANCED EDUCATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-093. Affordability for All Learners Linkage: Goals 1 and 2Ensuring Albertans have access to learning opportunities requires that those opportunities be affordable to learners and their families. Advanced Education will continue to work with thefederal government to ensure assistance levels support the cost of learning and that debtlevels are manageable. It must also be recognized that advanced education brings with it a substantial return on investment to both the individual and society. Our policies and programs must ensure thatfinancial need is not a barrier to learning. These policies and programs also must beresponsive to the increasingly diverse needs of learners and leverage high rates ofparticipation among all Albertans, including Aboriginal learners, rural Albertans, immigrantsand those that are socio-economically disadvantaged. Affordability for all learners must address the priority of the system for assurance of inclusion. 4. Quality and Innovation in the AdvancedLearning System Linkage: Goal 1Maintaining the quality of advanced learning is a priority for Albertans. The quality of the advanced learning system underpins the ability of the system to meet the needs of learners,society and the economy. The achievement of national and international standards is a key component in maintaining and measuring quality. Advanced Education is actively involved in cross-ministry, inter-provincial and international collaboration that will lead to increased standards ofperformance. Some of the current priorities for this collaboration include literacy,Aboriginal education, system capacity and high standards of excellence in the delivery ofdegree program opportunities. Additionally, in collaboration with Innovation and Science, Advanced Education will support innovation and knowledge development within the advanced learning system, and providesupport for centres of excellence and the transfer of knowledge to industry. 5. Post-Secondary Infrastructure Linkage: Goal 1Advanced Education will collaborate with Infrastructure and Transportation to enhance the infrastructure of Alberta's public post-secondary system to facilitate delivery of high-qualityadvanced learning opportunities throughout the province. This includes expansion,modernization and functional renewal of post-secondary facilities and equipment within thecontext of a 10-year strategic capital plan. Advanced Education has identified two core businesses that are the ongoing key responsibilities of the Ministry. Within each core business is a goal with specific outcomes that describe the end results the Ministry wants to achieve in fulfillingits mission. Advanced Education has identified strategies for 2006-09 that support the two ministry goals and government's20-year strategic plan.

[Original Signed]Doug Horner, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development March 7, 2006 THE MINISTRY The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (AFRD) consists of theDepartment of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Agriculture Financial ServicesCorporation (AFSC). The Ministry is also responsible for the Office of the Farmers'Advocate; Irrigation Council; Agricultural Products Marketing Council; and Alberta GrainCommission.BUSINESS PLAN 2006-0982AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09VISION Growing Alberta farms, processors, and all other agricultural businesses along with vibrant ruralcommunities.MISSION To enable the growth of a globally competitive, sustainableagriculture and food industry through essential policy,legislation, information and services in partnership withvibrant rural communities. LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN Agriculture, Food and Rural Development contributes to Goal 1: Alberta will have a diversified and prosperous economy,under the key opportunity of Unleashing Innovation. The Ministry contributes to this goal by facilitating the growth of theagriculture industry through several programs and functions, including implementing the Agriculture Growth Strategy andthe Six-point Recovery Strategy. The Ministry also works to secure a stronger future for rural Alberta throughimplementation of the Rural Development Strategy. The Ministry contributes to Goal 14: Alberta will have a supportive and sustainable infrastructure that promotes growth and enhances quality of life, under the Capital Plan. This is done by providing cost-shared funding to Alberta's 13 irrigationdistricts to rehabilitate the districts' water conveyance infrastructure, supporting municipalities to develop water/wastewaterinfrastructure for agricultural processing and administering funding under the Municipal Industrial WastewaterInfrastructure Program. The Ministry also contributes to Goal 8: Alberta will have a financially stable, open and accountable government, under the key opportunity of Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit. This contribution is made by servicing the debtincurred by the Agriculture Financial Services Corporation (AFSC) in providing service to its clients. SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES The Ministry will continue to partner with industry and other governments as we support the industry in strengthening itsposition globally in its recovery from the longer-term impacts of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and successiveyears of drought and ongoing cost competitiveness issues. The erosion of equity resulting from these events increases theneed for innovative long-term solutions to mitigate these types of risk. These events, combined with the opportunity togrow the value-added industry, will continue to result in revisions to Ministry programming in 2006 and in future years,ensuring the industry is poised to grow and diversify beyond its pre-BSE strength. The Agricultural Policy Framework (APF) continues to impact the strategic direction in this plan. The objectives of the five chapters of the APF are linked to the goals in this plan. Negotiation of the next phase of the Framework will requireongoing effort in partnership with industry to allocate resources for the implementation of components of the strategy.Opportunities to appropriately align Alberta's policies and processes with national and international developments andopportunities, such as food policies, environmental goods and services and biowaste management will need to be explored.CORE BUSINESSES Core Business 1: Facilitate Sustainable Industry GrowthCore Business 2: Enhance Rural SustainabilityCore Business 3: Strengthen Business Risk Management83 AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Strategies for rural development, growth and research and development are at various stages of implementation. These initiatives will continue to impact the future direction of the Ministry and its programming in 2006 and beyond. Current conditions in the agriculture and food industry clearly demonstrate the susceptibility to inherent risks such as poor weather, declines in global commodity prices and exchange rates, and changes in the overall economy. While the Ministry'sstrategic direction is outlined, it is acknowledged that from year to year, changes must be made to accommodate specificdevelopments. Monitoring of world trade issues, including food policy challenges and the associated impacts on legislativeand regulatory frameworks will require ongoing management. The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Alberta (IFASA) is a collaboration among the Alberta Research Council, the University of Alberta and AFRD. IFASA will enable internationally recognized, multidisciplinary research programs,which have critical mass, to be built, strengthening Alberta's applied research and technology commercialization capacity.

These programs undergo national technical review and are implemented by producers with help from their provincialcommodity groups. Implementation by producers may be voluntary or mandatory depending on the commodity. 2HACCP is an acronym, which means Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point. HACCP is a system, which identifies, evaluates, and controls hazards, which are significant for food safety. Measure has changed to reflect new provincial programs and standards. 3Written and auditable food safety preventative programs will be implemented in a stepwise fashion in Alberta licensed dairy foo d processing facilities. This approach considers a need to mitigate risk in a voluntary environment and industry's capability toimplement. The strategy would see implementation of a recall program in all facilities in 06/07, followed by a comprehensive a llergen program in 07/08 and sanitation/pest control in 08/09. These programs are consistent with the Alberta HACCP Advantage.87 AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Strategies 3.1 Support and conduct applied/adaptive research and evaluations to develop economically sound, environmentally friendly beneficial management practices for relevant areas of crop and livestockproduction and agricultural processing. 3.2 Transfer integrated technology and knowledge to assist the industry in becoming more environmentally sustainable, including provision of support for adoption of environmental farm plans. 3.3 In consultation with the industry and other involved ministries, provide guidelines, standards, regulations and legislation for environmental performance requirements to sustain the quality ofAlberta's soil, water and air. 3.4 Monitor the effect of the agricultural production and processing industry on soil and water quality. 3.a Percentage of producer survey respondents who have adopted improved environmentallysustainable agriculture practices (formalevaluation every three years; next survey to beconducted in 2006/07 and reported in June2007). 53 (2003-04)58 58 58 3.b Number of producers provided with specific training and technical support to enabledevelopment of environmental farm plans. 1968 (2004-05)400015000160001Performance Measures Last Actual (year)Target 2006-07Target 2007-08Target 2008-09 Note: 1Targets reflect a cumulative growth of 1000 per year.

Services to Alberta's children are not only an important service to those in need; they are an investment in the human potential of the province. Children's Services' core businesses and goals are aligned with and give support to theGovernment of Alberta Strategic Business Plan in Goal 4 - Alberta's children and youth will be supported in reaching their potential . The Ministry is committed to achieving the Government of Alberta Strategic Business Plan by supporting Opportunity 4 - Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit. The Ministry works to achieve its vision throughjoint initiatives with community partners. Children's Services' strategic directions supporting the government's businessplan are: prevention - a healthy start and supports for children to learn, grow and succeed; preservation - a safe nurturing family environment for children; protection - a safety net to protect vulnerable children in need; and partnerships - a community to help families raise their children. CORE BUSINESSES: Promoting the development and well-being of children, youth and fam ilies.Keeping children, youth and fam ilies safe and protected.Promoting healthy communities for children, youth and fam ilies. KEY PROGRAM AREAS: Preventative supports for children, youth and families - Prevention of Family Violence and Bullying - Parenting Resources Initiative - Early In tervention - Child Care - Youth In Transition - Family Support for Children with Disabilities - Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Initiative - Family and Community Support Services Preserving families at risk Protecting children and youth in need - Protec ting Children from Sexual Exploitation - Child Intervention Services - Child and Youth Advocate Building resources for community based service delivery - Community Initiatives - Child and Family Research - Alberta's Promise - Delegated First Nations Agency a nd M\u00e9tis Community Initiatives - Aboriginal Suicide Initiative - Children and Youth with Special/Complex Needs Initiatives - Community Incentive Initiative - Youth Forums and Youth Network Initiatives Prevention Preservation & Protection Partnerships 94 CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES The following opportunities and challenges are key drivers that will impact the Ministry's ability to achieve its goals. Children's Services considers these drivers when establishing initiatives and strategies to support the development ofresilient children, youth and families. Changing social, demographic and economic factors influence both the needs of Alberta's children and the expectations of the public to provide these services. The reality of finite resources creates a challenging environment to ensure that allAlberta's children have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Opportunities exist to move beyond treating symptomswith child protection to a greater focus on prevention and preservation solutions. Intervening Early The new Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act has created the opportunity to provide families with preventative services before they reach a crisis. The new Act will see families receiving services earlier and reduce the number ofchildren who then need to come into care of the government. The Family Support for Children with Disabilities programprovides supports that preserve and strengthen families, and reduce the possibility that they will need to access crisisintervention services. Family Violence and Protection of Children Family violence and the protection of children is a significant concern to the Ministry. Canadian children and youth underthe age of 18 accounted for 21 per cent of victims of physical assault and 61 per cent of victims of sexual assault, whilerepresenting approximately 20 per cent of the population. The 2003 Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuseand Neglect found that 70 per cent of the substantiated cases of emotional maltreatment were related to exposure to familyviolence. In 2004-05, 5,791 adults and 5,115 dependent children were admitted to the 28 contracted women's sheltersacross Alberta. The rate of reported spousal violence continues to be a priority concern to Albertans. Approximately one in 10 children have bullied others. As many as 25 per cent of children in grades four to six have been bullied, and 14 per cent of children aged 11 to 16 are victims of bullying. Studies have found bullying occurs once every25 minutes in the classroom and even more frequently on the playground. In the majority of cases, bullying stops within 10seconds when peers intervene or do not support the bullying behaviour. New technology and cyber-bullying exacerbatesthis dynamic by providing more opportunities for bullying and shielding the identity of the bully. Impacts of Substance Abuse Health Canada estimates that nine in every 1,000 babies born in Canada have Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disorder, whichincludes a range of birth defects and brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol. It is estimated that over alifetime, each individual with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disorder will need about $1 to $1.5 million in special care andsupport services. Proposed legislation to prevent children's exposure to drugs is one way the Ministry will lessen the impacts of substance abuse on children. The increasing incidence of methamphetamine production labs and marijuana grow-ops in houses wherechildren live pose serious risks to children. The full extent of the impact of exposure on children is still to be determined,as are best treatment methods. Child Sexual Exploitation Sexual exploitation of children is a global issue that impacts a vulnerable sector of society. Incidents of child pornography,internet luring and the involvement of youth in prostitution are increasing as communications technology has made accessto children and youth by perpetrators much easier. Working with other ministries and the justice system, strategies toprevent exploitation of children are being developed and implemented.95 CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Importance of Early Years The ability of children to fully reach their potential is influenced by what happens during their early years of development.Children aged 0 to 5 years is a growing segment of Alberta's population so programs and services directed at young childrenwill expand to serve the growing needs. Designing early learning and child care programs and services that meet the needsof young children and Alberta families is one way the Ministry supports children to reach their full potential. Through theFamily Support for Children with Disabilities program, supports are provided early on to children with disabilities to assistin meeting their developmental needs. Families with children ages 6 to 12 years need access to programs and services that support their ongoing development. Many families needing care for their children before and after school require access to quality programming and supports.Working with our municipal partners, strategies to build a seamless continuum of child care and parental supports are beingdeveloped and implemented. Aboriginal Children The Aboriginal population is growing faster and is younger than the non-Aboriginal population. Aboriginal children have ahigher representation in the Ministry child protection caseload than non-Aboriginal children. The result is higher costs anduse of services for this population. Significant cross jurisdictional issues regarding federal government funding support for Aboriginal children and families results in service gaps that contribute to poorer outcomes for this population. Early intervention, prevention and familyenhancement programs are not supported by federal funding, which increases the likelihood of First Nations children beingremoved from their homes and coming into government care. The federal government, despite research that indicates thebenefits of this approach, has been slow to respond with supports for Early Childhood Development, Early Learning andChild Care programs on-reserve. Federal funding for on-reserve children with disabilities and their families does notprovide supports comparable to those received by other Alberta children. Improving outcomes for Aboriginal children, youth and families is a concern for the Ministry. Creating partnerships with Aboriginal communities to enhance relationships and build practice and service protocols will facilitate effective andculturally appropriate services to Aboriginal children and families. Impact of Prosperity The strong economy in Alberta provides families with stable incomes and opportunities to prosper. With economicprosperity many young families with children are moving to Alberta, particularly urban areas. Pressures on changingcommunities pose challenges for communities to build and maintain strong support systems for children, youth and families.In urban areas challenges include anonymity of families and the complexities of making services known and accessible.Rural communities face challenges of inadequate resources to offer needed services to children and families in remote andsparsely populated areas. The Ministry is taking advantage of innovative technologies and the SuperNet to enhance services to children and families across the province, and to create opportunities for collaboration and coordination of case management teams in their workwith children and their families in the Child and Family Services Authorities. One impact of prosperity is a labour shortage of skilled service providers to provide support to families and children (i.e. respite providers, aide support, child care workers, rehabilitation workers). Partnering with government and agency partnersto meet these resource challenges is critical. Strategies related to recruitment, retention and succession planning of ministr y staff would also be implemented.96 CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through a review of external and internal challenges, the Ministry has identified the strategic priorities described below. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. The Ministry will continue to implementstrategies aimed at improving the continuum of services designed to produce better results for children, youth and families.The Ministry will ensure all re-investment opportunities include a focus on producing better outcomes for Aboriginalchildren. 1. Improve the range and impact of preventativestrategies Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5Children's Services will undertake reviews of Family and Community Support Services programming and contracted agencies to ensure that communities have the capacity toeffectively respond to the needs of families and children preventing or reducing thenumber and severity of incidents requiring more intensive protection services. 2. Improve the outcomes for children in care or in needof specialized services Linkage: Goals 1, 3 and 4Children's Services will examine the drivers that result in youth repeatedly coming into care and develop options to improve their outcomes; fully operationalize the Family Supports for Children with Disabilities Act andChild, Youth and Family Enhancement Actby 2006; undertake a review and recommend adjustments where required; continue to develop and implement more targeted case management strategies in the regionaldelivery system; and identify and pursue options to ensure necessary supports areavailable for successful transition of youth to their independence. 3.

Phased implementation of the ParentLink Centre framework will continue, building on existing resources and evaluation ofthe framework. Implementation of an accreditation system for Alberta child care centresand family day home agencies will continue to assure child development environmentsare appropriate. The Alberta government will also continue to provide parents thesupport they need when choosing the right child care for their children. 4. Implementation of new ministry legislation Linkage: Goals 2 and 3Children's Services will pursue high priority needs of families and youth through a new Drug-Endangered Children Act and amendments to the Protection Against Family Violence Act andSocial Care Facilities Licensing Act. 5. Develop leadership and governance capacity Linkage: Goals 1, 4 and 5Children's Services will work within the Ministry and with other ministries and regional delivery agencies and boards, to increase collaboration to ensure high priority needs ofchildren and youth are met and to strengthen the fit of existing policy, programs andservices for children and youth. Solutions to the challenges of rural and remote deliveryof services will also be pursued, through such initiatives as the Rural DevelopmentStrategy.97 CHILDREN'S SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Children and youth will have a healthy start in life and the supports they need to reach their potential1GOAL ONECORE BUSINESSES, GOALS, STRATEGIES & PERFORMANCE MEASURES Core Business One: Promoting the development and well-being of children, youth and families Strategies 1.1 Lead the implementation of the Strategy for the Prevention of Family Violence and Bullying action plan to support individuals, families, communities and governments to work together towards an Alberta freeof family violence and bullying. 1.2 Implement a Bullying Prevention initiative in response to the Alberta Roundtable on Family Violence and Bullying. 1.3 Support quality child care by enhancing the Child Care Accreditation Program to provide additional funding for staffing supports and quality improvements. 1.4 Work with municipalities to enhance training standards for child care professionals providing out of school care and to develop a seamless continuum of program supports for families requiring before andafter school care. 1.5 Enhance cross-sector capacity to respond to the needs of children and youth with special and complex needs and their families by improving coordination and access to services and supports. 1.6 Continue to support youth in transition (ages 13 to 22) by enhancing access to mentoring opportunities through coordination of services and supports to youth. 1.7 In collaboration with other ministries and government agencies develop guidelines and resources to implement prevention strategies aimed at preventing Fetal Alcohol Spectrum disorder and substanceabuse. 1.8 Work with municipalities and M\u00e9tis Settlements to strengthen the capacity of Family and Community Support Services Programs to promote, design, integrate, deliver and assess outcomes of servicesdelivered to children, youth and families, mandated under legislation. 1.9 Introduce a continuous improvement process for ongoing implementation of the Family Support for Children with Disabilities legislation. 1.10 Implement strategies based on stakeholder input to ensure that families of children with disabilities are provided information about supports and services available to them and their children. 1.11 Enhance child care that helps parents and families give their children the best possible start in life, including overcoming circumstances that put them at risk, and give their children the support they needto reach their potential.What it means The Ministry recognizes the importance that the first six years of a child's life play in terms of setting thefoundations for children to learn, grow, and reach their potential.

MISSION Preserving and celebrating our natural and cultural heritage,protecting human rights and fostering libraries,volunteerism, sport, recreation and the arts. LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN Many of Community Development's programs support the broader goals of the Government of Alberta's Strategic BusinessPlan and, in particular, contribute to making Alberta the best place to live, work and visit. The following chart summarizesthe Ministry's key support for the government's goals. the Francophone Secretariat. The Ministry also includes the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission and the following reporting entities: Alberta Historical Resources Foundation Historic Resources Fund Government House Foundation Wild Rose Foundation Human Rights, Citizenship and Multiculturalism Education Fund Alberta Sport, Recreation, Parks and Wildlife Foundation Alberta Foundation for the Arts The essential elements of each of these entities' strategic plans are integrated within this consolidated Ministry business plan. CLIENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS The Ministry's key clients are the residents of urban and rural communities across Alberta. As well, services are provided tothe visitors of provincial parks and recreation areas, historic sites, museums and interpretive centres. CommunityDevelopment also has a broad range of stakeholders who work closely with the Ministry to help realize its mandate.

Government of Alberta Goals and Strategic OpportunitiesMinistry Services Goal 10: Alberta will be a fair and safe place to work, live and raisefamilies Strategic Opportunity: Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Workand Visit Preventing discrimination and promoting the benefits of diversity and multiculturalism through developing policies, resolving and adjudicatinghuman rights complaints and promoting understanding of Alberta's humanrights legislation through awareness initiatives and educational resources.107COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES Service expectations are driven by Alberta's thriving economy, population growth and changing patterns in the demographics of its residents and visitors. The public is keen to have accessible and affordable outdoor recreationalopportunities as evidenced by the 8.5 million visits to provincial parks and recreation areas each year. While visitors enjoyAlberta's parks, they would like to see the facilities repaired and upgraded. We also need to balance the enjoyment of theseprovincial parks and recreation areas against the need to protect and preserve Alberta's natural heritage and ecologicaldiversity. There has been growth in the importance of the technology and knowledge sectors. The use of technology will enhance the delivery of our programs and services. New technologies will allow us to optimize the presentation of Alberta's history byenabling access to Alberta's historical resources through the Internet. There are also increasingly high expectations for up-to-date exhibits and services at provincial historic sites, museums and interpretive centres, which attract an average of900,000 visits annually. Albertans want ready access to information in a timely manner. This has resulted in increasingly complex demands within the public library and archival systems. Alberta's libraries in rural and urban communities are Service Alberta InformationCentres and, with the full implementation of the Alberta SuperNet, will be linked electronically to the rest of the world.Currently, over 30 million items are borrowed from libraries each year and this is expected to increase. In the past, communities have thrived with support from their local volunteers. However, the pool of volunteers is limited by an aging population, increasingly busy lifestyles and concerns with liability issues. A voluntary sector framework isunder development to facilitate closer cooperation and collaboration between the government and the voluntary sector toaddress issues such as recruitment challenges and liability insurance. Given Alberta's diverse population, human rights issues are becoming increasingly complex. Generally, there is a growing need for programs and services to protect Albertans from discrimination and to contribute to building a more inclusive andrespectful society. Albertans are becoming increasingly conscious of their quality of life and are aware of the importance of an active and healthy lifestyle. In 2004-05, 83 per cent of adult Albertans participated in sport and recreational activities. It is impera tive that communities have the capacity to offer a diverse range of physical and social leisure activities in order to attract andGoal 12: Albertans will have the opportunity to participate in communityand cultural activities and enjoy theprovince's historical resources andparks and protected areas Strategic Opportunity: Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Workand Visit Managing and preserving a network of provincial parks and protected areas that represents the diversity of the province's natural heritage. Operating a network of provincial heritage facilities and preserving cultural and natural resources of significance to Alberta. Acquiring and preserving significant private and government records and making them available for research and interpretive purposes. Fostering libraries, the voluntary sector, sport, recreation and the arts. Goal 14: Alberta will have a supportive and sustainableinfrastructure that promotes growth andenhances quality of life Goal 14 supports the Capital Plan Upgrading water and sewage systems in provincial parks and recreation areas. Renewing infrastructure in provincial parks and recreation areas, historic sites, museums and interpretive centres. Supporting the government's commitment to maintain and develop government owned and supported infrastructure by monitoring centennialprojects to their completion.108COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 The strategic priorities described below have been identified through the Ministry's review of environmental factors, including our external and internal opportunities and challenges. These are in addition to the important ongoing coreactivities of the Ministry and are of primary importance in focusing the Ministry on achieving its goals: 1. Infrastructure Renewal Linkage: Goals 1 and 2Renew infrastructure for provincial parks and recreation areas, historic sites, museums and interpretive centres. This will be addressed by expanding our capacity to address Alberta'sgrowing population, repairing or replacing damaged or deteriorating facilities andequipment, upgrading water and sewage systems in provincial parks and recreation areas aspart of the Water for Life Strategy, and modernizing our exhibits and developing ourcollections to reflect new areas of interest. Centennial projects will also be monitored totheir conclusion to ensure their intended legacy is delivered to Albertans. 2. Community Capacity Building Linkage: Goal 3Strengthen community resources in support of libraries, the voluntary sector, sport and recreation and the arts. This will be addressed by supporting rural sustainability, developinga voluntary sector framework, addressing recommendations from the Alberta Sport Plan,furthering the Active Living Strategy and introducing an inclusive cultural policy. 3. Inclusive Communities Linkage: Goal 4Foster equality, support the reduction of discrimination and barriers to full participation in society and support the development of inclusive communities and workplaces. This will befurthered by addressing increasing volumes in human rights caseloads, emerging workplaceissues related to accommodating disabilities, and developing strategies to support theinclusion and integration of immigrants and ethnic and racial groups into Albertacommunities and workplaces. Comprehensive and effective legislation, education andenforcement are also critical to supporting the protection, inclusion and participation of allAlbertans. 4. Using and Respecting the Land Linkage: Goal 1Participate in the development of a land use framework for effective management of competing land use interests to preserve Alberta's high quality of life and continuedeconomic prosperity. A vital component of this framework will be an Alberta approach tobiodiversity and landscape management to maintain the province's natural advantage.retain residents. This is a particular challenge for smaller rural communities where partnerships may be required to ensure resources are available in each region of the province. There are also growing needs in the arts. For example, 88 per cent of adult Albertans feel the arts are important in contributing to the overall quality of life in their communities. As well, nine out of ten adult Albertans attend or participa te in arts or cultural events each year, yet Alberta's per capita public funding for the arts sector is one of the lowest in Canad a.

LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLANEconomic Development receives advice from a number of advisory bodies. The two major advisory bodies are: the AlbertaEconomic Development Authority and the Strategic Tourism Marketing Council.

Link to strategic opportunities in the 20-year strategic plan Economic Development also contributes to the attainment of the Government of Alberta 20-year strategic plan, Today's Opportunities, Tomorrow's Promise: A Strategic Plan for the Government of Alberta , through the following strategic opportunities:Strategic Opportunity 1 - Unleashing innovation Creating the environment and infrastructure that enables knowledge and technology to invigorate our traditional economic strengths and to create new economic opportunities. Strategic Opportunity 3 - Competing in a Global Marketplace Ensuring reliable export markets. Building on Alberta's economic cornerstones, such as oil and gas, agriculture, forestry and tourism. Continuing to keep taxes low.119 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES Opportunities Alberta leads Canada in economic performance and future growth prospects. Economic growth over the past decade hasprovided Albertans with the most enviable record in Canada in terms of job creation, average family income, standard ofliving and lowest overall tax burden. New opportunities for value-added service and supply industries and technologiesrelated to the energy sector, along with increasing international trade opportunities and tourism development initiatives, helpto balance future economic growth in the province. More than $100 billion in major capital projects are under construction or planned for Alberta over the next few years. Most of this investment is being driven by the energy sector, which is creating significant new opportunities for value-addedservice and supply industries and development of new technologies, particularly in the non-conventional oil and gas sectors(i.e., oil sands, coal bed methane). Opportunities in international trade and investment initiatives will help to support sustainable economic growth in Alberta. The government will continue to manage the implications of a dynamic international environment in order to build allianceswith key decision makers, attract investment and export Alberta products and services to new and existing markets. Growthin new and emerging global economies such as China and India present future prospects to grow and diversify investmentsources and export markets, while still nurturing our strong ties with the U.S. In addition to trade and investment opportunities, people from across Canada and beyond are attracted to Alberta for its quality of life and world-class tourism. Increasing demand for tourism experiences including Aboriginal, agri- and eco-tourism creates new opportunities for the province. Additional tourism funding, supported by Alberta's Tourism Levy, willassist in the development of tourism products and services in these areas. The Aboriginal community, together with a newlyestablished Aboriginal Tourism Advisory Council, will guide the development of Aboriginal tourism in the province. Challenges Continued economic growth and innovation in a variety of sectors positions Alberta as a strong global player as theprovince advances into its second century. Effective management of growth in key areas will help to ensure that Albertanscan continue to live in a prosperous province and enjoy a high quality of life. However, the magnitude of investment inenergy and a number of other sectors is creating major challenges for Alberta in terms of skill shortages, infrastructurepressures and balancing economic growth over the longer term to ensure that Alberta's economy does not becomeincreasingly dependent on, and vulnerable to, the cyclical nature of the commodity energy sector. Providing Skilled Workers - Continued growth in a variety of sectors, changing demographics and tightening labour markets place increasing demand for a skilled and knowledge-based workforce across the province. A skilled and highlycompetent workforce is key to maximizing our current economic opportunities and to creating new ones. The Ministry isdeveloping an immigration marketing strategy to attract and retain skilled immigrants to Alberta. The Ministry will alsocontinue to deliver the Provincial Nominee Program. Strengthening the Rural Economy - Strong rural/regional economies are the foundation for strong rural communities. Encouraging a stronger future for rural Alberta by promoting economic and community development are key areas forgrowth. Economic Development supports the Rural Development Strategy and its efforts to strengthen rural communities and their economies. The Ministry further supports rural development through increased emphasis on tourism marketingand development in rural communities.120ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-090 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180ConnectivityStudent AchievementE ducation AttainmentManufacturing Labour &D IntensityR&D Inte ns ityAbove Average Below Average Jurisdiction Average = 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180Capital IntensityUnemployment RateManufacturing Output Grow thE mployment Growth Real GDP per capita growthPer Capita GDPAbove Average Below Average Jurisdiction Average = 100 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 The Ministry has identified the following key strategic prioities in addition to its important ongoing activities: 1. Managing Growth and ProsperityEconomic Development works with other government ministries and stakeholders to address Alberta's economic challenges. This approach is focused on managing the challenges ofeconomic growth now and over the long-term, and encouraging development that is sharedacross Alberta, based on regional strengths. Within this framework, Economic Development has three priorities:Improving Infrastructure and Transportation Links - Alberta's continued growth depends on many factors including sufficient infrastructure (e.g., post-secondary and health facilities) and efficient transportation links to get goods to marke t. Economic Development continues to partner with other government departments, including the Ministry of Infrastructureand Transportation, to address industry's business needs. Maintaining a Globally Competitive Business and Tax Environment - Alberta maintains its position as a business- responsive environment by supporting a low rate, broad-based tax regime. The challenge for government is to maintain itscompetitive position in order to continue to attract new industry and business development. Innovation Capacity and Performance - Improving Alberta's innovation capacity is critical to supporting the province's long-term economic competitiveness in a global economy. Economic Development continues to encourage innovation andproductivity through Securing Tomorrow's Prosperity , the province's long-term market-driven value-added strategy that encourages the creation of higher value-added jobs, goods and services. Benchmarking shows that by most economic indicators, Alberta has been Canada's top performer and an above average performer compared to some of the strongest U.S. and European performers, as shown in Chart 1. However, as shown inChart 2, Alberta's innovation performance lags behind its U.S., European and Canadian competitors. Chart 1 : Economic Indicators Chart 2 : Innovation Indicators Source: Benchmarking Alberta in the Knowledge-Based Economy (Economic Development) December 2005Source: Benchmarking Alberta in the Knowledge-Based Economy (Economic Development) December 2005121 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7and 8 Securing Tomorrow's Prosperity: The Ministry continues to expand and implement value-added strategies that foster additional economic wealth creation opportunities. Economic Development's long-termmarket-driven value-added strategy, Securing Tomorrow's Prosperity, encourages innovation and productivity and the creation of value-added jobs, goods and services. Efforts are focused on adding value to priority sectors with the highest potential for growth, enhancing industry capacity and development and improving productivity throughinnovation and technology adoption. Efforts to enhance Alberta's competitive advantagefocus on pursuing tax policy and other mechanisms that improve access to equity capital andensuring effective and efficient transportation systems reach global markets. For example,the Ministry is developing an immigration marketing strategy to attract and retain skilledimmigrants to Alberta as well as working with stakeholders to promote opportunities withinAlberta's refining and petrochemical industry. Rural and Regional Development: The Ministry supports the Rural Development Strategy , which is a government approach to building vibrant and sustainable rural Alberta communities. Economic Developmentcontinues to implement strategies to develop and market business opportunities in ruralAlberta. Initiatives within the strategy seek to facilitate the building of businessrelationships among firms, Aboriginal communities and stakeholders; develop and delivertools necessary to support economic and community development in rural Alberta; andstrengthen the capacity of community economic development across the province. TheMinistry further supports rural development through tourism marketing and development inrural communities. International Strategy: Economic Development manages the implications of a dynamic and changing internationalenvironment in order to build alliances, attract investment and economic immigrants, andexport Alberta products and services to new and existing markets.

VALUES PRINCIPLES Respect Integrity Trust Openness CaringStudent Centred The highest priority of the education system is the success of the student. Accessible Every student in Alberta has the right of access to a quality basic education consistent with the student's needs andabilities. Collaborative Kindergarten to Grade 12 education, which provides the foundation for lifelong learning, best occurs when partners andstakeholders work together to provide a holistic approach and asupportive environment.

The Ministry has considered these factors in the context of identifying strategic priorities andstrategies that will ensure high quality learning opportunities, excellent student outcomes and Ministry support forcontinuous improvements to the education system. Sustaining a high quality education system goes hand in hand with addressing values and increasing expectations of Albertans. The increasing diversity of student needs requires various learning approaches, technology holds manycomplexities and our global environment is interdependent. Each of these factors contributes to opportunities for thesystem to be responsive, flexible, adaptable and innovative. Sustaining a HighQuality EducationSystem The Alberta education system continues to move toward its vision of The best Kindergarten to Grade 12 education system in the world , which will help individual students to become active lifelong learners and contributing members of society. The province is already recognized nationallyand internationally for its excellent education system. Alberta students have consistently ranked atthe top in national and international tests. They have placed among the best in the 2004 SchoolAchievement Indicators Program science assessment and the 2003 Programme for InternationalStudent Assessment. Alberta's priority on education and a high level of investment have contributedto its high quality system and corresponding level of student achievement. Programming such as arevised social studies curriculum that reflects the needs of students in the 21st century, new languageprograms, daily physical activity and expanded access to technology are a part of Alberta'sinvestment. All partners and stakeholders have a shared responsibility to find ways to sustain andstrengthen the system. Each needs to help balance competing fiscal, human resource and policypriorities with rising public demand for choice, flexibility and adaptability. Public Values andIncreasingExpectations Albertans value learning opportunities and understand that everyone - from parents to students, thecommunity, business, government, teachers and administrators - has an important and cooperativerole to play in public education. A strong education system supports every student, instils positivevalues and promotes diversity and respect. Increasingly, the public expects Alberta to have aneducation system that is among the best in the world - a system that responds to diverse studentneeds, is fiscally responsible, accountable for results and improves continuously. Albertans believethat everything in the basic education system must start and end with children and youth. Theybelieve that all children should be ready to learn when they start school and have opportunities tosuccessfully complete high school. Albertans also believe that all students, including students withspecial needs, should have access to optimum learning environments and opportunities for success. Goal 14: Alberta will have a supportive and sustainable infrastructure that promotes growth and enhances quality of life. The Ministry's key focus is on addressing school infrastructure needs. Government of Alberta 20-Year Strategic Plan Through strategies identified in this business plan, the Ministry of Education supports the achievement of the Government of Alberta's 20-year strategic plan, in particular, the Leading in Learning strategic opportunity and the Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit strategic opportunity.134EDUCATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of external and internal challenges, the strategic priorities described below have been identified. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. 1. Success for All Students Linkage: Goals 1 and 2Today's Alberta classrooms include a rich and diverse mix of students. The Ministry, Government of Alberta partners, and stakeholders must continue to work collaboratively tocreate the necessary supports to ensure that every student succeeds. A strong foundation isrequired so that children are ready to learn when they start school and continue learningthroughout their school years. Effective transitions are needed throughout the educationsystem from Kindergarten to Grade 1, on to high school completion and into post-secondary/trades/apprenticeship programs or the world-of-work. The learning environment mustacknowledge children's varied backgrounds and provide access to quality programs for allchildren, including children who are at risk. Alberta's centralized, high quality curriculum;flexible programs for children with special needs; programs in different languages; optionsfor various learning pathways; and effective use of technology - all offered within a safe,positive and caring environment - will contribute to students achieving success. Theprovince's highly skilled teachers play a vital role in student achievement, using effectiveteaching practices and programming that meet the needs of all students. ChangingDemographics Alberta's social foundation is being shaped by changing demographics. As a whole, the studentpopulation is declining, particularly in some rural and remote areas, while there is increased growthin the Aboriginal population, students with special needs and immigrant students. Demographicshifts and the changing social structure, including an aging population, are generating competitionfor public resources, which impacts on the sustainability of the education system. Challenges inareas with declining populations include limited access to a broad range of programs for students andprofessional development opportunities for teachers. Influences ofTechnology Technology has given Albertans the capacity to access learning opportunities at any place, any timeand in a variety of ways. Increasingly, technology plays a central role in education, enabling newapproaches to teaching and learning. Students must be prepared to understand, use and applytechnology in effective, efficient and ethical ways. Sound instructional approaches, coupled with theappropriate use of technology, will help to prepare students to be successful in a knowledge-basedsociety. Strong leadership and wise decision-making at both the provincial and local levels isnecessary to realize the opportunities for effectively using technology in education and to encourageinnovation. Impacts ofGlobalization The increasingly dynamic global environment and its growing complexity present uniqueopportunities and challenges for Albertans. Alberta's curriculum must help students participate fullyin a global society. Competitiveness in a knowledge-based economy depends on preparation ofstudents to reach higher levels of educational attainment. High school completion and the transitionto post-secondary studies are important contributors to success in the workforce. Students mustacquire the skills that enable them to participate, innovate and take advantage of the economic andcultural opportunities that globalization provides.135 EDUCATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-092. Enhancing Effective Relationships Linkage: Goal 3The Ministry of Education has a history of successful collaboration with educators, students, parents, stakeholders, partners and other organizations.

[Original Signed] Greg Melchin, Minister of Energy February 28, 2006 THE MINISTRY Alberta owns 81 per cent of the province's mineral rights. The Ministry of Energy managesthe development of these resources on behalf of the people of Alberta, within the province'sframework for sustainable resource and environmental management. The Ministry of Energy consists of the Department of Energy (the Department), the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, and the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB). The Department manages the development of provincially owned energy and mineral resources by industry and the assessment and collection of non-renewable resource revenuesin the form of royalties, freehold mineral taxes, rentals and bonuses. The Departmentpromotes development of Alberta's energy and mineral resources, recommends andimplements energy and mineral related policy, grants rights for industry exploration anddevelopment and establishes and administers fiscal regimes and royalty systems. BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09144ENERGY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09VISION Alberta is a global energy leader, using its world class knowledge, expertise and leadership to develop the vastenergy resources of the province and to market theseresources and abilities to the world.MISSION Optimize the sustained contribution from Alberta's energyand mineral resources in the interests of Albertans. ALBERTA'S ENERGY VISION Alberta Energy introduced a new Vision for Alberta's energy resources in 2005. This Vision is about the future. It is aboutwhat Alberta has yet to achieve with its vast energy resources and expertise. This Vision will establish Alberta as a globallyrecognized energy supplier and increase the production and export of value-added hydrocarbon based products. As globalenergy leaders, Albertans are positioned to sustain their high quality of life through new opportunities and long termbenefits from their energy resources. Our new Vision is about delivering on the expectations of Albertans as owners of theirenergy and mineral natural resources by maximizing opportunity in the global energy market place. LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN The Ministry of Energy is committed to the Government of Alberta's strategic business plan. The key linkages andcontributions of the Ministry to the Government of Alberta (GOA) goals and key opportunities are highlighted below: GOA Goal 1: Alberta will have a diversified and prosperous economy. Strategic Opportunity: Unleashing InnovationThe Ministry promotes expansion of production from Alberta's oil sands, enhanced processing and energy transportationinfrastructure, increased recovery of conventional oil and natural gas, development of unconventional gas and better highervalue uses of our energy resources. In partnership with industry, the Ministry supports technological innovation thatenhances resource development while addressing environmental concerns. Combined with maintaining a competitive andstable fiscal and regulatory regime, these features continue to make resource development in Alberta competitive andattractive to industry investment. GOA Goal 8: Alberta will have a financially stable, open and accountable government. GOA Goal 11: The high quality of Alberta's environment will be sustained.Strategic Opportunity: Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and VisitThe Ministry manages the development of provincially owned energy and mineral resources by industry and the assessmentand collection of non-renewable resource revenues from the development of these resources. In 2004-05 non-renewableThe Department's resource portfolio includes natural gas, conventional oil, oil sands, petrochemicals, electricity, coal and minerals. Unlike other energy commodities, conventional crude oil royalties are paid with \"in-kind\" product. The AlbertaPetroleum Marketing Commission accepts delivery of the Crown's royalty share of conventional crude oil and sells it atcurrent market value. The Commission's operations are fully integrated within the Department and funded by the Crown. The EUB is an independent, quasi-judicial agency of the Government of Alberta with responsibility to regulate Alberta's energy resource and utility sectors. While the EUB reports to the Minister of Energy, it makes its formal decisionsindependently in accordance with statutes and various regulations. The Board's operations are jointly funded by the Crown(43%) and by industry (57%). The EUB has delegated the authority for management of the abandonment and reclamationof oil and natural gas sites deemed by the EUB to be orphans to the Alberta Oil and Gas Orphan Abandonment andReclamation Association. The EUB Chairman has governance responsibility for the Market Surveillance Administrator(MSA), which monitors Alberta's electricity market to ensure it operates fairly, efficiently and in an open competitive manner.145 ENERGY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09resource revenues collected by the department totaled $9.74 billion dollars, accounting for approximately one-third of the revenue in the provincial budget. The Ministry regulates the development and delivery of energy resources in Alberta. Itestablishes standards for the safe and reliable operation of energy facilities while having regard for social, economic andenvironmental effects, including resource conservation. The energy industry is a cornerstone of Alberta's economy and quality of life. The contribution of the energy and mineral sectors to provincial revenues will continue to support having no provincial sales tax, low personal and corporate income taxrates, and the provision of priority programs and services on which Albertans depend. Energy and mining exports accountfor 62 per cent of Alberta's total exports and about one-quarter of Alberta's GDP. Nearly one in every six workers, or about300,000 Albertans, are employed, directly or indirectly, in the Province's energy sector. Albertans also have the highestdisposable income per capita in the country; a significant benefit of the employment opportunities generated from the energysector. Prosperity can be sustained by integrating energy and mineral production with value-adding industries, encouragingthe application of new technologies, increasing awareness, learning and training opportunities and maintaining highenvironmental standards. SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES Opportunities: Alberta's Energy Supply - Alberta has a vast and diverse supply of natural resources. Huge non-conventional oil sands and natural gas in coal resources complement our existing large conventional resource base. Abundant coal reserves offerexpanded opportunities for increased exports as well as value-added processing, electricity generation and gasification.Future energy development in Alberta must build on the strengths of these resources, employing integrated strategies thatmaximize synergies and value-added opportunities for the benefit of Albertans. Growing Global Markets - For the past 10 years the United States has been the principal consumer of Alberta's energy products, but new global markets are emerging. World economies are growing rapidly and rising demand for energy isaccompanying this growth. China and India are emerging as significant drivers of global economic growth and energydemand. Growing global demand means new market opportunities for Alberta's energy products and expertise. Alberta's Competitive Energy Advantage - Alberta provides an attractive energy investment climate supported by a policy and regulatory environment that provides a high level of certainty while protecting the public interest. Alberta has superiorenvironmental technology and a large petrochemical and pipeline infrastructure, which encourages future development. Ourworkforce has world-class expertise, knowledge, and experience in developing energy resources - it's a leader in \"EnergyKnow How\". Others beyond its borders respect and seek Alberta's energy expertise. Albertans excel in energy exploration,development of world-scale energy projects, research, energy training, energy-related financial assessment and practices,energy infrastructure planning and building, energy policy and governance. Alberta provides a highly developed financialinfrastructure of head offices, major branch offices and financial centres related to resource development. Value Added - Taking raw energy resources and refining and upgrading them to produce a diversity of products that can be sold for higher value in the world marketplace can greatly expand work and business opportunities for Albertans. Albertahas the potential to be a world leader in the upgrading, refining and transforming of hydrocarbons into the vast array ofmarketable products that are so much a part of modern living. Challenges:Fair Share, Changing Prices and Economics - In 2004-05, the Department of Energy collected the second highest revenues ever from the development of Alberta's energy and mineral resources. Over the past five years, energy resource146ENERGY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09revenues have contributed, on average, 33 per cent of Alberta government revenues. Global energy commodity prices have reached new highs driven largely by strong economic growth. Energy companies are benefiting from record revenues.Albertans expect to receive a fair share of the profits and relief from rising energy prices. The department will continue toreview its royalty regimes, considering new price and economic conditions, to ensure they capture both a fair share ofprofits for Albertans while also attracting the investment needed to sustain future energy development and governmentrevenues. Access, Regulation and Public Support - Record commodity prices and growing worldwide recognition of the size of Alberta's undeveloped energy resources have increased investor interest in Alberta. Industry exploration and developmentset new records in 2004 accompanied by record levels of investment, with $24.7 billion invested in Alberta's upstream oiland gas industry. Urbanization, population growth and a strong economy have combined to increase competition for the useof Alberta's limited land base. Increased industry activity also means increased public concern with safety, levels ofdevelopment and environmental protection. Albertans must be confident that the regulations and policies related to safety,energy development, access, and environmental standards and protection are effective, reasonable and consistently applied.Regulatory processes are being challenged to review an increasing number of applications and to inspect both existing andnew operations. Improving delivery of government regulatory processes for all parties will be needed while maintainingAlberta's high environmental and safety standards. Effective management of the competing interests of surface and sub-surface development, agricultural production, urban settlement, watershed management, recreation and preservation ofnatural beauty and wildlife habitats is critical to sustained economic growth and quality of life for Albertans. Research and Innovation - Seventy-three per cent (73%) of Alberta's conventional oil and 57 per cent of its natural gas remains in the ground because we lack technology to extract it. A renewed emphasis on energy research and development iscrucial to developing these resources. Similarly, new technologies offer the potential for expanded use of Alberta's abundantcoal resources for power generation, coal gasification and industrial feedstocks. Alberta must continue to support anintegrated industry and government approach to research, development and technological innovation. Infrastructure - Increasing economic activity and population growth in Alberta, combined with pressures on existing public infrastructure and the need for new infrastructure to support development of Alberta's energy resources, will place pressureon all levels of government and industry. Labour Demands - Developing, attracting, and retaining the human talent required to meet the challenges and opportunities associated with the development of Alberta's energy resource potential requires special attention. Alberta's oil and gasindustry is performing at record levels and has been having difficulties obtaining the experienced talent required to meetlabour demands for new major oil sands projects and traditional oil and gas exploration and development. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of external and internal challenges, the strategic priorities described below have beenidentified. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. 1. Alberta's Integrated Energy Strategy Linkage: Goals - AllThe Ministry will lead the development of an integrated energy strategy to further develop and promote Alberta as a global energy leader. Working with other government departmentsand industry, Alberta Energy will identify strategies and specific initiatives that build onAlberta's energy advantages to diversify and increase energy production, strengthen value-added development, expand markets for Alberta's energy products and improve energyinfrastructure (pipelines, electricity transmission, and Ministry information systems thatsupport crucial business operations).147ENERGY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-092. Access for Resource Development Linkage: Goals 2, 3, 4, and 6The Ministry will focus on working with industry and the public to maintain access to energy and mineral resources, while also working with other land users to resolve access anddevelopment issues. 3. Sustainable Resource and EnvironmentalManagement Linkage: Goals 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6The Ministry will partner with Environment, Sustainable Resource Development, other ministries and stakeholders to develop a Sustainable Resource and EnvironmentalManagement (SREM) Framework which will achieve an outcome-based managementsystem, integrated sustainable resource and environmental management policies, andstreamlined regulatory processes. In particular, the Ministry will focus on upstream oil andgas development as well as policies for the long-term development of the oil sands. Streamlining delivery of government regulatory processes and reducing costs of regulatory requirements for all parties will be needed while continuing to maintain Alberta's highenvironmental and safety standards. Industry compliance with regulations and standards andprotecting public safety will remain priorities for the Ministry. Albertans must be confidentin the regulations and policies related to safety, energy development, access, andenvironmental standards and protection. 4. Public Awareness and Understanding Linkage: Goals - AllIn order to support future energy development, Albertans need to be confident that energy resources will continue to be developed and managed in a responsible manner. The Ministrywill work with industry and educators to increase Albertans' awareness of their energy andmineral resources, the opportunities for future development and the economic significance ofthe energy and mineral sectors, today and in the future. We will also increase Albertansawareness of responsible industry practices used to access and develop the resource, andadvances in resource development technology and environmental management. 5. Using and Respecting the Land Linkage: Goals 2, 3, 4, and 6Alberta Energy is working with other ministries to develop a comprehensive land use framework for the effective management of competing land use interests in order to preserveAlberta's high quality of life and continued economic prosperity. The Ministry will alsopromote research, development and commercialization to improve extraction, upgrading andrefining of Alberta's hydrocarbon resources and reduce environmental impacts, and willpromote the development of clean coal technologies and use of CO 2for enhanced oil recovery. Core Business 1: Securing Benefits for Albertans - Secure Albertans' share and benefits from energy and mineral resource development. Core Business 2: Resource Development - Ensure Alberta's energy and mineral resources remain accessible, competitive and attractive to investment and development. Core Business 3: Energy for Albertans - Ensure Alberta consumers have a choice of reliable and competitively priced energy. Core Business 4: Regulation of Energy Development by the Energy and Utilities Board - Regulate the development and delivery of Alberta's energy resources and utilities services in a manner that is fair, responsible andin the public interest.CORE BUSINESSES, GOALS, STRATEGIES & PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Ministry has four core businesses. The first three Core Businesses are the responsibility of the department while thefourth is the EUB.148ENERGY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Optimize Albertans' resource revenue share and benefits from the development of their energy and mineral resources over the longterm1GOAL ONECore Business One: Securing Benefits for Albertans Strategies 1.1 Continue to review the department's royalty regimes, mineral taxes, rentals and bonuses, and recommend changes needed to address changing economic circumstances and opportunities. 1.2 Continue to provide clear communication to industry with regard to filing information and accurate reporting. 1.3 Directly develop, manage and support, in-house, those department information management systems that are critical to ensuring Albertans continue to receive their share of resource revenues. What it means Albertans receive their share of energy and mineral resource development through royalties, rentals andbonuses paid by industry and collected by the Ministry. Alberta's resource development system isdesigned to capture a fair share of industry revenues from the development of provincial resources, whileensuring industry retains sufficient revenue to continue to invest in the future development of theseresources. On average, over the past five years energy revenues accounted for 33 per cent of governmentrevenue. Other benefits from a strong energy industry include jobs, business opportunities, investmentand innovative technologies and research.

Alberta maintains competitive fiscal andregulatory regimes that are intended to attract industry investment and ensure that Albertans, the resourceowners, benefit from resource development. Predictability, certainty, stability and a well-developedinfrastructure are all features that make Alberta's resource development system a strong competitor forindustry investment. The Ministry is the principal advocate nationally and internationally for Alberta'sinterests and rights to access, develop and manage energy and mineral resources.149ENERGY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Strategies 2.1 Work in partnership with Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development to implement improved upstream oil and gas policy and regulatory integration that results in regulatory processes thatare effective, efficient, timely and less costly. Contribute to the development of a provincial land useframework as part of an improved sustainable resource and environmental management framework. 2.2 Lead Alberta's strategic participation in regional, national and international energy initiatives, promoting energy trade, agreement on North American electric reliability standards, provincial participation ininternational energy discussions and negotiations, and improved access to international markets. 2.3 Advocate for optimal tolls, tariffs and access to existing and new pipelines and wires that transport Alberta energy resources to North American markets. 2.4 Develop and implement strategies that will maximize benefits to Alberta from northern gas development.2.5 Work with other departments and stakeholders to implement the provincial action plan on climate change, with a focus on CO 2sequestration, a CO2pipeline network and energy efficiency in the energy sector.

In the future, new sources of energy will be developed to ensure Alberta has a continued supply of energy to meet growing Alberta and global demand.New energy sources represent the future, or the \"next Alberta\", and include expanded oil sands production,clean burning coal technologies, natural gas in coal and the development of alternative energy sources(wind, hydro, biofuels). There is also \"another Alberta\" waiting to be developed through technologies,such as CO 2injection, that improve the recovery of existing conventional resources remaining in the ground. Diversification of energy sources will be largely market driven and, therefore, Alberta's energyresources must remain competitive in the broader global energy market to ensure their development.Maintaining resource access is essential for future energy development. The Ministry works within theprovince's framework of sustainable development to maintain or enhance resource exploration anddevelopment opportunities in a responsible manner that protects the environment and public safety. Strategies 3.1 Develop strategies for the long-term appropriate development of the oil sands with a vision of achieving production of three million barrels per day by 2020. 3.2 Expand our natural gas reserves by encouraging research and exploration in tight sands and shale gas areas that have not received sufficient evaluation to date. 3.3 Coordinate the implementation of approved recommendations to enhance regulatory processes and policies for the responsible development of natural gas in coal.150ENERGY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Use an integrated approach to energy development to expand value- added energy development in Alberta4GOAL FOUR What it means The Ministry encourages industrial integration and increased value-added resource upgrading in Alberta. Extracting the most value from our energy resources by moving up the value chain from raw products toprocessed consumer end-products secures additional benefits for Albertans. The oil sands provide thepotential for new refining capacity, and for growing a petrochemical industry based on petroleum.

LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN Alberta Environment is committed to achieving the Government of Alberta's Strategic Business Plan that sets out a visionof a vibrant and prosperous province where Albertans enjoy a superior quality of life and are confident about the future forthemselves and their children. The key linkages between the Ministry of Environment's 2006-09 Business Plan and theGovernment of Alberta's (GOA) Strategic Business Plan are highlighted below. GOA Strategic Business Plan Goal 11: The high quality of Alberta's environment will be sustained - The Ministry of Environment contributes to this goal by ensuring Albertans have a safe and sustainable supply of water and by takingeffective action on climate change. The Ministry is also taking a leadership role in working with other ministries and keystakeholders to develop and implement sustainable resource and environmental management. Ensuring that Alberta hasoutcome-based management systems, integrated policies and streamlined regulatory processes is a strategic priority for theMinistry. The Ministry is committed to providing Albertans with exceptional leadership and service. GOA Strategic Business Plan Goal 14: Alberta will have a supportive and sustainable infrastructure that promotes growth and enhances quality of life - The Ministry of Environment is linked to this goal as effective and sustainable infrastructure is essential to sustaining the high quality of Alberta's environment. Government owned and supportedinfrastructure is key to ensuring Albertans have effective water management facilities and infrastructure. The Ministry iscommitted to working with partners to ensure Albertans have the effective infrastructure required to sustain Alberta'senvironment. GOA Strategic Business Plan Strategic Opportunity: Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit - Safe and adequate supplies of water, clean air and land, together with healthy, vibrant communities are the foundations of a highquality of life and form the core of the Ministry of Environment's 2006-09 Business Plan. Our three business plan goalsand related strategies are closely aligned with the goals and commitments to Albertans in the Government of AlbertaStrategic Business Plan, of which a clean natural environment is a key component. Our commitment to sustainable resourceand environmental management and the use of innovative approaches and strategies to achieve better outcomes for air,water and land supports the government's plan. VALUED BEHAVIOURS The Ministry's values are reflected in our corporate and individual behaviors. They define how we treat our stakeholders,clients, partners, the public and each other. Respect - We trust each other, respect the opinions of others, and others respect us. Knowledge - We value informed decision-making based on clear problem definition, appropriate context, and shared information and analysis. Continuous Learning - We acquire new skills that increase our capacity for improvement and innovation, and our ability to achieve corporate and personal goals.Shared Responsibility - We work collaboratively with others to achieve environmental goals. Integrity - We follow through on our commitments, providing reliable and ethical service. Leadership - We model the way forward while encouraging and enabling others to be leaders.159 ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES The Ministry of Environment is working collaboratively across government and with stakeholders to take a strategic systems approach to protecting and managing the environment. This approach focuses on sustainable resource andenvironmental management with the following five key elements: A high-level, government-wide vision for the environment with common goals, outcomes-based management systems, and integrated resource and environmental policies and strategies with coordinated implementation across ministries; A place-based approach that facilitates a cumulative approach to environmental decision-making and management practices, and integrates varying demands on resources; Shared responsibility for the environment with industry, communities, organizations, other governments, the public and the academic-scientific-technical community; Utilization of a more comprehensive, flexible set of regulatory and non-regulatory tools and incentives to encourage, support and reward effective environmental performance; and Continuous improvement in environmental performance and accountability. The Ministry's approach to sustainable resource and environmental management is required to effectively respond to increasingly complex environmental challenges and risks. These include: Public Expectations: Albertans value their environment for the ecological, economic, recreational and social benefits it provides. They expect a safe and sufficient supply of water, clean air and productive land. Albertans also expect theirgovernment to effectively manage and protect the environment as a legacy for future generations. They want greaterparticipation in shaping government policy and in delivering the programs that affect the quality of their lives. Water: There is increasing pressure on water usage and services fuelled by rapid economic and population growth in Alberta. The pressures include intensity of water use, water scarcity and management in flood situations requiringecosystems protection, conservation of water and its efficient use. Surveys indicate that preferred solutions are onesthat enhance the capacity of the local community to deal with its issues. The Ministry sees an opportunity to fullypartner with citizens in stewardship and watershed planning activities through partnerships such as watershed councilsand watershed stewardship groups. Climate Change: Public awareness of the need to respond to climate change continues to grow. Albertans have been leaders on this issue, and we must continue to contribute to solutions and influence national and international climatechange policy. Our leadership in research on cleaner energy, carbon capture and gasification of coal is important on aglobal scale. Site Decontamination/Reclamation: There is a growing concern over the decontamination and reclamation of industrial sites and the associated liability. Albertans are looking to their government to ensure clean up of allcontaminated sites, as they do not want to be left accountable for reclaiming industrial sites. Environmental Hazards: Recent significant environmental incidents, such as the major flood in southern Alberta and the spill incident at Wabamun Lake, emphasize the need for the Ministry to assess and manage environmental riskseffectively to reduce the incidence of environmental hazards, and ensure that systems are in place to respond in a timelyway when they occur. Albertans expect their government to act decisively when such incidents occur to ensure that thehigh quality of the environment is restored and maintained. 160ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of environmental factors, the following strategic priorities have been identified. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. 1. Water Linkage: Goals 1, 2 and 3Albertans have a safe and sustainable supply of water With its partners, the Ministry of Environment leads effective management of the qualityand quantity of our water resources and ensures healthy aquatic ecosystems. The Ministry'spriority is to implement the provincial water strategy, Water for Life: Alberta's Strategy for Sustainability . 2. Climate Change Linkage: Goals 1 and 3Alberta takes effective action on climate change The Ministry, in partnership with other governments, industries and communities, workstoward innovative and practical long-term solutions. Our priority is to implement theprovincial climate change plan, Albertans & Climate Change: Taking Action , including: A focus on technology solutions; and Strategic investments that help Alberta respond to climate change while developing a competitive economy. 3. Using and Respecting the Land Linkage: Goal 1Alberta has an effective provincial land use framework The Ministry is working with other ministries to develop a comprehensive provincial LandUse Framework for the effective management of competing land use interests to preserveAlberta's high quality of life and continued economic prosperity. We will work with otherministries to demonstrate resource conservation, resource recovery and waste reduction andpromote the restoration of contaminated sites to productive use. 4. Sustainable Resource and EnvironmentalManagement Linkage: Goals 1, 2 and 3Alberta has outcome-based environmental management systems, integrated resource and environmental policies, and streamlined regulatory processesThe Ministry is committed to continuously improve Alberta's environment by workingcollaboratively with Sustainable Resource Development, Energy, other ministries andstakeholders for improved sustainable resource and environmental management including: Developing shared outcomes; Integrating policies within and across ministries, media and sectors; Delivering efficient and effective services to Albertans; Enhancing Albertans' awareness, understanding and wise use of the environment by providing reliable and accessible environmental information and education; and Reducing regulatory duplication.Effective environmental management also requires performance measurement, riskmanagement and program evaluation to demonstrate progress to Albertans in achievingenvironmental outcomes and goals. Environmental Outcomes: The quality of the environment is affected by the environmental practices and behaviours of individuals, communities, industry and governments. The legislative mandate for natural resources and the environmentis distributed among provincial ministries and other levels of government. Achieving desired environmental outcomeswill therefore require the public and stakeholders to assume a shared responsibility for the environment, and ministriesand governments to take coordinated action to achieve desired environmental outcomes. We will create awareness andeducate Albertans to accomplish behavioral change.161 ENVIRONMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Alberta's environment is clean and safe1GOAL ONECORE BUSINESSES, GOALS, STRATEGIES & PERFORMANCE MEASURES Core Business One: Assuring Environmental Quality The Ministry ensures that the environment is clean and safe for current and future generations of Albertans.

The development of a long-termstrategic communications plan, that encourages the use of effective communications practices and cross-governmentcoordination, will help government achieve that goal. Managing growth to secure Alberta's future prosperity is a central focus of long-term planning. Alberta's growing economy and population are creating challenges in the areas of labour supply, infrastructure development and land use, as well as insocial programming areas such as health and traffic safety. These challenges demand ongoing, effective and coordinatedcommunications strategies to reach a growing and increasingly diverse audience across the province and, in the case ofsome issues, on a national and international stage. The Public Affairs Bureau will continue to make optimum use of its cross-government structure in order to coordinate communications for major initiatives that involve multiple ministries, and will work closely with the Policy CoordinationOffice to help ensure effective communications surrounding the government's long-term planning. An increased focus onproviding government with research and advice on public trends and opinions will also ensure government's long-term plansand strategies reflect public needs and expectations. Existing central services such as the Government of Alberta homepage, Alberta Connects and new communications vehicles such as the Alberta SuperNet and other e-communicationssources will also provide increased options for delivering information and collecting feedback. Expanding on existingadvertising programs will build on Albertans' awareness and understanding of government initiatives, decisions andpriorities, and enhanced communication with government employees will help to quickly deliver information to as wide anaudience as possible. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 The Public Affairs Bureau is linked to all of the Government of Alberta's Eight Top Priorities. After a review ofenvironmental factors, the following have been identified as particular key areas of focus for the Public Affairs Bureau'scommunications efforts. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Public Affairs Bureau.

LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN179FINANCE BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES The elimination of Alberta's accumulated debt has put the government on a more solid financial foundation and provided more fiscal flexibility. Maintaining a strong and sustainable financial position remains challenging nonetheless: Non-renewable resource revenue, which accounts for about one third of the Alberta government's total revenue, is unpredictable and volatile. Energy prices can swing dramatically due to unpredictable world events, such as politicalconditions in the Middle East or severe weather in North America. The potential implications of the Kyoto protocol onresource revenue are also not yet known. Alberta's resource revenue will be affected by the move from conventional to non-conventional oil sands, where the royalty return is not as high. As well, certain tax structures, like income trusts, reduce tax revenue to the province. Addressing spending pressures in health care, in particular, is very challenging for all governments in Canada. An aging population and new medical technologies and drugs are putting upward pressures on health costs. Citizens arealso demanding better access and shorter wait times, which places additional pressure on health spending. Because of Alberta's rapid growth, there are major infrastructure funding pressures. Building infrastructure today will result in operating cost pressures in the future. Making decisions regarding allocation of large unexpected increases in revenue in a debt-free situation is not typical for governments. It is very difficult to deal with the high expectations that have been created. The challenge with respect to savings is to manage our cash and investments prudently, balancing cash requirements with the higher returns of high quality, longer-term investments. Pension plans will be affected by an aging population. In addition, recent investment performance of pension plans have resulted in significant funding shortfalls. Recognizing pressures on pension plans will enable stakeholders to collectivelywork on reviewing pension plan regulations and governance, helping to ensure pension plans are sustainable. The Ministry faces challenges in regulating and fostering Alberta's capital market. Investor protection has to be balanced with the ability of firms to raise capital. It is also necessary to guard against unnecessary duplication of regulation toensure capital formation in Canada is not adversely affected, while preserving the ability to respond to regional needs. The frequency and severity of recent natural disasters have resulted in greater demands for loss prevention and emergency services. This has also contributed to significant increases in the costs of property and casualty insurance, as well asshrinkage in insurance coverage. The challenge for the Government of Alberta is to manage risk prudently withoutinhibiting innovation.180FINANCE BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of environmental factors, the following are strategic priorities for Finance. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. 1. Fiscal Framework Linkage: Goal 1 Review the government's fiscal framework to ensure that it positions Alberta well for the future. 2. Tax Policy Linkage: Goals 2 and 3 Build on the results of the current tax review to ensure tax competitiveness, economic efficiency, fairness and revenue stability. Reviewing Tax Policy is one of the eight toppriorities in the 2006-09 Government of Alberta Business Plan. 3. Investments Linkage: Goal 4 Develop Alberta Investment Management to: Better meet the needs of investment clients, including government endowment funds and public sector pension funds. Improve effectiveness while promoting a culture of highly informed and risk-aware decision-making throughout the organization. Seek to enhance investment returns for all government and pension funds and ensure risks present in the funds are those believed to lead to superior returns. 4. Securities Regulation Linkage: Goal 8 Ensure that an effective and efficient securities regulatory system is available in Alberta that meets the needs of Alberta's business and investors. Lead and actively promote the development and implementation of an effective and efficient system of securities regulation in Canada. 5. Pensions Linkage: Goals 6 and 9 Lead the consultation with public sector boards and stakeholders to review the current governance arrangements for public pension plans. Work with other jurisdictions across Canada to streamline private sector pension standards laws.181FINANCE BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09A financially strong, sustainable and accountable government1GOAL ONECORE BUSINESSES, GOALS, STRATEGIES & PERFORMANCE MEASURES Core Business One: Fiscal Planning and Financial Management Strategies As part of ongoing advice provided to Treasury Board on all fiscal planning matters, the following strategies will be of particular significance over the next three years: 1.1 Ensure budget and capital planning processes are fully integrated to support decision-making.1.2 Support the review and ongoing development of Alberta's fiscal framework.1.3 Manage the financing of capital requirements, including assessing the Government of Alberta's costs and risks of both traditional and alternative financing methods. 1.4 Continue to work on expanding the government reporting entity for reporting purposes, which could include health authorities, schools and post-secondary institutions. What it means Strategic fiscal planning and prudent economic forecasting are required to meet today's priorities andsustain essential programs and services over the longer term. The Fiscal Framework supports soundfiscal planning, to help deal with revenue volatility and maintain balanced budgets. It includes a three-year government fiscal plan; a Sustainability Fund to cushion ongoing operating and capital spendingplans from volatile revenue and fund the costs of emergencies and disasters; a three-year Capital Plan,funded from current-year revenue, the Capital Account and alternative financing arrangements. Finance will continue to coordinate the government's legislated commitment to be accountable to Albertans through publishing the Government of Alberta three-year consolidated fiscal and businessplans, quarterly fiscal updates and annual performance reports, including audited financial statements, asrequired by the Government Accountability Act . 1.a Alberta's Credit rating AAA AAA AAA AAA 1.b Percentage of Albertans who feel that the Government of Alberta provides adequate financial information to the public (based onthose surveyed who expressed an opinion) 1 55% Note: 1 Reflects revised wording for the survey question that was developed and implemented in 2005-06. Last actual results are based on previous wording.182FINANCE BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Revenue programs are administered fairly, efficiently and effectively 3GOAL THREE Strategies 3.1 Rewrite fuel tax legislation to modernize the program and its administration. 3.2 Work with stakeholders to improve service and promote self compliance through the use of information technology upgrades. 3.3 Identify and address program areas where there is high risk of non-compliance.What it means The design and administration of Alberta's tax and revenue programs contributes to the strategic priority of ensuring a fair and competitive tax environment in Alberta and maintaining Alberta's tax advantage.Collecting revenue fairly means that all taxpayers and claimants are treated equally under the law andwith respect; efficiently means obtaining measurable value for money spent; effectively means that lossesdue to tax evasion are kept to a minimum. To meet this goal, the Ministry designs tax and revenueprograms, collects revenue owing to the province, administers tax and revenue laws, makes payments ofrefunds and rebates, and provides information to stakeholders, taxpayers and claimants. In addition, itprovides expertise and advice to other ministries on initiatives with revenue implications.Note: 1Data for this measure is provided by the federal government and may change as work progresses on the new equalization framework .A fair and competitive provincial tax system2GOAL TWO Strategies 2.1 Introduce changes to the tax system as required by government direction following the tax review. 2.2 Continue to monitor Alberta's tax competitiveness, economic efficiency, fairness and revenue stability.What it means Alberta's tax policy of low overall rates on a broad tax base promotes strong economic growth. Taxes provide revenue that government needs to fund programs and services. The tax system must be fair andpromote self-reliance. Alberta taxes must also be competitive with those in other provinces and countriesin order to attract the investment, jobs and skilled workers necessary to keep our economy performingwell. Alberta has a low single-rate personal income tax, the lowest tax on gasoline of all provinces andno general payroll tax. Alberta is the only province without a general capital tax or retail sales tax. Areview of the Alberta tax system was undertaken in 2005-06 to evaluate whether the low-rate, broad basepolicy continues to be the best approach for Alberta's economy. 2.a Provincial tax load for a family of four Lowest in CanadaLowest in CanadaLowest in CanadaLowest in Canada 2.b Provincial tax load on businesses1Second Lowest in CanadaLowest in CanadaLowest in 2006-07Target 2007-08Target 2008-09183FINANCE BUSINESS PLAN 2006-093.a Ratio of amounts added to net revenue to costs of administration1 9.6:1 2008-09 What it means Finance is responsible for the investment of the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, endowment funds and other government funds. Finance is also responsible for investing on behalf of the public sectorpension plans. Pension boards are responsible for setting public sector pension plan investment policiesfor their funds and monitoring performance within defined objectives and constraints. Finance isresponsible for setting the endowment funds investment policy.

Opportunities exist in 2006-09 to apply resources and technology to improveservice delivery in many areas of the Ministry. Key challenges expected to influence the Ministry in the coming yearsinclude: Awareness: The desire to make Albertans more aware of the services offered by the Ministry will be a continuing challenge. Increasing client awareness will be a key focus, particularly with respect to the Utilities Consumer Advocate.The Ministry endeavours to ensure that Albertans' service delivery expectations are met through Service Alberta, especiallyin terms of how and when they want to access services. These access needs, however, must be carefully balanced with theneed to ensure the security and integrity of information. Security and Privacy: As personal information security and privacy breaches become more common in society, Albertans' expectations of government safeguarding their personal information increase. For this reason, the Government of Albertahas made Protecting People's Private Information one of its eight top priorities for 2006-09. Government Services willcontinue to play a leading role in developing policies and procedures to secure and protect the personal information ofAlbertans. The Ministry will continue to work with registry agents, outsourced service providers and law enforcementagencies to improve the security of systems, documents and handling processes. In addition, the Ministry will ensure thatprovincial privacy legislation is kept current and will remain vigilant that American legislation, such as the USA Patriot Act, does not have a negative impact on Albertans. Registries Renewal: The renewal of the Ministry's existing systems for the Personal Property, Land Titles and Motor Vehicles registries continues to be a critical factor in positioning Government Services to meet growing demands forservices and increased security needs. Legislative Renewal: Government Services continues to be responsible for an extensive portfolio of legislation, consisting of at least 35 acts and 70 regulations that must be kept current and responsive to emerging issues. Some of the acts andregulations the Ministry is examining, in response to emerging issues, relate to the protection of personal information, realestate and fair trade.The Ministry's programs and services and the information contained in its registries indirectly contribute to other Government of Alberta goals. For example, in support of Justice's Maintenance Enforcement Program, the Ministry restrictsnon-custodial parents from accessing registry services if they have refused to comply with child-support obligations.205 GOVERNMENT SERVICES BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 The strategic priorities described below have been identified through the Ministry's review of environmental factors.

The maintenance and timely renewal of registry systems is critical to ensuring the Ministrycan continue to meet customer expectations and provide quality information and services throughgovernment offices, online access and a province-wide network of more than 220 private registry agents. A comprehensive legislative and accountability framework is also important in supporting service delivery and ensuring the security and integrity of data and operational processes. To promote thisintegrity, resources are directed to ongoing security improvements as well as investigations ofinappropriate access. Given the ever-changing business, social and technological environment, it isimportant that legislation remains current in meeting the needs of Albertans. As well, the Ministry mustdefine service standards, evaluate performance and pursue continuous improvement initiatives for alldelivery channels. Strategies 1.1 Continue renewal of the registry systems to ensure business goals are supported effectively. 1.2 Provide support to traffic safety programs through education, advocacy, system changes and strategic policy review as required. 1.3 Undertake initiatives to validate and secure information held within the Ministry's registries.1.4 Continue to implement enhanced compliance and accountability mechanisms that promote excellence in private agent service delivery. 1.5 Increase compliance audits on account holders who perform searches on the Motor Vehicles registry.1.6 Investigate emerging issues such as fraud and identity theft.

Financial information is consolidated in the attached Ministry Statement of Operations. A summary of progress on this business plan will be reported in the 2006-07 Annual Report forAlberta Health and Wellness. A more detailed description of Alberta's health system can befound on our website at: www.health.gov.ab.ca/ .BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09216HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09VISION Albertans are healthy and live, work and play in a healthy environment.MISSION Provide leadership and work collaboratively with partners tohelp Albertans be healthy and respond to opportunities andchange. Support individuals, families and service providers in making the best decisions about their health. LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN The Health and Wellness business plan is aligned with and supports the \"Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work andVisit,\" strategic opportunity of the Government of Alberta 20-year strategic plan. The Health and Wellness business planlinks to the government business plan through: Albertans will be healthy (goal 5). Alberta will have a supportive and sustainable infrastructure that promotes growth and enhances quality of life (goal 14). SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES The Government of Alberta regards the health and well being of Albertans as the most important resource for the future.The Alberta government is committed to working towards providing Albertans with the best and most responsive publichealth system in Canada. Alberta is embarking on a Third Way in health care delivery to improve quality and access and toincrease choice. This made-in-Alberta approach to health care renewal focuses on evolving our health system byunleashing innovation, challenging the status quo and charting a new course. The Third Way is an evolving process withinitiatives and innovations created at local, regional and provincial levels and by all service providers. On July 12, 2005, the government unveiled a package of thirteen renewal initiatives called \"Getting on with better health care\". These initiatives include innovations in priority areas such as access, continuing care, wellness, mental health,primary care, children's health, pharmaceuticals, electronic health records and rural health. Challenges Opportunities Population Growth and Changing Demographics:Currently 10 per cent of Alberta's population is 65 years ofage and over and this percentage is expected to increase to13 per cent by 2016 and 20 per cent by 2030. Alberta hasone of the youngest populations in Canada. Yet, the effectof aging contributes approximately 1 per cent to annualhealth expenditure growth, but the larger cost driver is theexpansion of services provided to seniors. Additionally, Alberta's population is shifting from rural to urban centres and the province has one of the highestpopulation growth rates of approximately 1.5 per cent peryear.Foresight and Innovation: Demographic shifts are predictable and we are preparing for the needs of the futurewhile addressing the needs of today. Through innovativetechnology such as Telehealth and the Critical Care Linewe are better able to meet the needs of rural and remotecommunities. Alberta's excellent health care contributes to our longer life expectancy. We have an opportunity to implement avariety of innovative care options for frail elderly andfragile people in collaboration with government ministries,health authorities and other stakeholders that will benefitAlbertans over the next 20 years.217 HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Challenges Opportunities Emerging Technologies and Pharmaceuticals: Technological change is a major cost escalator in Canada'shealth systems accounting for an estimated one quarter ofhealth expenditure growth. Promising results from clinicaltrials into new drugs creates expectations of public funding.Collaboration: We will work with health authorities, health care providers, and federal, provincial and territorialcolleagues to support a consistent, evidence-basedapproach for the evaluation of technology andpharmaceuticals. This approach will consider clinicalbenefits, cost effectiveness and ongoing benefits to patientsand the health care system. The role of government is to evaluate new emerging technologies and pharmaceuticals and ultimately decidewhich of these will be publicly funded. We will alsoexplore and evaluate the extent of drug insurance coverage,including pharmacare, to ensure all Albertans have accessto quality pharmaceutical services. Workforce Shortages: A quality health system requires an adequate supply of competent and progressive health careworkers. The workforce is aging, with 20 per cent ofRegistered Nurses over the age of 50. In addition, the workenvironment is continually changing and workers need tocontinually acquire new skills. Recent medical graduatesand female physicians are demanding greater work / lifebalance and are working fewer hours than physicians did inthe past, which increases the number of physicians neededto serve Alberta's population. New medical graduates are choosing to specialize instead of entering family practice which is contributing to a shortageof primary care physicians. Rural communities continue to face difficulties in attracting and retaining an adequate supply of physicians and otherhealth workers.Partnerships: Continue to work with post-secondary institutions, the health authorities and professionalassociations on plans and initiatives to educate, recruit,remunerate and retain the needed health workforce. Primary care initiatives are providing new incentives for family physicians and giving them an opportunity to workin multi-disciplinary teams. New regulations under theHealth Professions Act will allow allied health professions to work to their full scope of practice. Work with stakeholders to address workforce issues through the rural physician action plan. The plan seeks totrain and attract physicians to serve rural Alberta. Quality of Health Services: Quality improvement and patient needs are a matter of concern to local, regional andprovincial health system leaders. Safeguards andmechanisms to anticipate and prevent adverse events suchas medication and technical errors must be strengthened.Culture of Quality: Develop supportive, organizational, professional and legal environments to encourage thereporting of adverse events and the prompt implementationof corrective action. The rapid and accurate transmission of health information is part of the answer and tools such as the AlbertaElectronic Health Record can improve the quality andsafety of patient care.218HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Challenges Opportunities Health Spending: Health spending balanced with an accessible quality health care system. Health care spendinghas been increasing 2-3 times faster than the provincial realGDP growth rate.Accountable Spending: Achieving health system sustainability requires cooperation and compromise on thepart of governing authorities' system managers,professional associations and bargaining units. Byleveraging the unique contributions of various partners, byensuring the best use of Alberta's knowledge andintellectual capital, and by developing innovative ways ofdelivering services, we will gradually bring healthexpenditures in line with anticipated funding. Public Health Risk: The capacity to deal with known (e.g., SARS, West Nile virus) and unknown emergent publichealth risks (e.g., pandemic influenza).System Readiness and Flexibility: Enhance capacity to respond to public health risks through plannedcollaboration with health authorities, providers and federal,provincial, territorial and municipal governments. Aboriginal Health: Alberta's growing Aboriginal population has a variety of health challenges. Delivery ofhealth services to remote or isolated Aboriginalcommunities is a challenge as is the provision of culturallyappropriate services within the health care system.Investment: Continue to implement and expand strategies to improve Aboriginal health services in collaboration withAboriginal leaders, health authorities, service providers,and provincial and federal governments. Mental Health: One in five Canadians is affected by mental illness during their lifetime. The overall prevalenceof mental illness in Canadian children and adolescents atany given point in time is about 15 per cent. Mental illnesscan have a significant economic impact on individuals, theirfamilies, the health care system as well as the workplaceand broader social system.Collaboration: Collaborate with health authorities, service providers, and ministries to support regionalimplementation of the Provincial Mental Health Plan. TheMental Health Innovation Fund will improve mental healthservices in the province and improve patient access.Partners are addressing gaps in child and adolescent mentalhealth services. Support the inter-departmental familyviolence prevention initiatives. Addiction: Addictions affect all Albertans. Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in Alberta, and it is the drug mostcommonly associated with acute and chronic health andsocial problems. However, multiple drug use, new orunfamiliar drugs and increased gambling opportunities areof concern, particularly among youth.Investment and Collaboration: Continue to provide province-wide addiction services for Albertans. AADACwill lead the collaborative implementation of the AlbertaDrug Strategy, enhance provincial adolescent treatmentservices, and continue to partner with stakeholders toenhance services to those with addiction and mental healthproblems. Child and Youth Health: Previously, chronic diseases were primarily evident only in adult populations, but theincidence in child and youth populations is rapidlyincreasing, along with the associated costs to Albertans.Children who have health issues are more likely to strugglewith the same issues when they become adults.Prevention: Addressing the health problems of the younger generation constitutes a sound investment for thefuture. New government programs will address unhealthybody weight, developmental problems, sexuallytransmitted infections and tobacco use. Another priorityincludes finding ways to limit children's access to sexualand violent content on the internet.219 HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 The Ministry's strategic priorities for the next three years have been identified. These priorities are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. 1. Better health care - the Third Way Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5and 6Alberta is embarking on a Third Way in health care delivery to improve quality and access and to increase choice. In fostering new ideas and approaches, we are encouraging everyone tolook for practical ways to make services more efficient, responsive and accessible to thosewho need them. The following actions identify innovative new approaches for the delivery ofhealth services: Goal 6 Health policy - We need an overall health policy that focuses on wellness and personal responsibility, defines what services are included in the publicly-funded health system, guidesour decisions and sets clear priorities. Goal 3 Access and efficiency - While people get immediate care when there is an emergency, this may not be the case for non-emergency situations. Work to streamline the processes, get rid ofbottlenecks and speed up access to important health services is underway. Goal 1, 2 and 3 Wellness and injury prevention - Encourage Albertans to take greater personal responsibility for their own health and wellness. By choosing healthier lifestyles, Albertans will be able toprevent or delay the onset of chronic conditions. Healthy eating and active living, combinedwith decisions that reduce personal health risks, will improve quality of life and long-termhealth outcomes and decrease demands on the health system. Immunization is one of the mostcost effective medical interventions to prevent diseases. Strategies to improve immunizationrates in Alberta are necessary to eliminate/reduce vaccine preventable diseases in our province. Goal 1 and 2 Children's health - It makes good sense to make children's health a top priority. We need to take action to improve the health of all children and especially those who are at risk - whetherthose risks involve violence in their communities, homes or schools, exposure to drugs andalcohol, unhealthy lifestyles, or not being immunized against common childhood diseases.Specific action will be taken to respond to the risks and harm associated with crystalmethamphetamine abuse. Goal 3 Access to mental health services - One in five Albertans will be affected by mental illness during their lifetimes. The nine regional health authorities are developing their own plansbased on the Provincial Mental Health Plan. Commencing with the 2006-09 planning andreporting cycle, health regions will provide specific information about mental healthperformance and outcomes. Goal 6 Electronic Health Record-Alberta Netcare - The Alberta Netcare system is absolutely essential for moving ahead on a whole range of initiatives in the health system that will resultin better care, better decisions and safer health services. For Albertans, it means an end torepeat tests and the security that when they have a health problem, the people who are treatingthem have access to a complete picture of their health.220HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Goal 4 Primary health care - A comprehensive, coordinated approach to primary health care that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Multi-disciplinary team delivery ensuresAlbertans get the right provider and the right services at the right time. Goal 6 Legislation and regulations - Legislation and regulation changes need to be made to expand choices for Albertans and remove barriers that stand in the way of further innovation. Goal 6 Prescription drug costs and coverage - Drug costs are the fastest growing part of the health care budget. We need to look at how we are going to pay the bill for drugs now and in thefuture. At the same time, current government drug plans only cover about 18 per cent ofAlbertans including seniors, children and people with lower incomes. Most Albertans get theirprescription drugs covered through private insurance plans, but about 27 per cent of Albertanshave no coverage at all. Goal 5 Continuing care quality - The emphasis for continuing care, both long-term care and home care, will be on quality of service. Albertans expect their parents and grandparents will bewell cared for in places where they are respected and treated with dignity. In the longer termwe also need to look at new approaches for paying for long-term care including insuranceprograms or savings plans where people could invest now. Goal 4 Health care providers - The provision of health care requires a well-trained and well- motivated workforce of an appropriate size and mix. Compensation of the health workforce(including physicians) accounts for approximately 70 per cent of health system expenditures.Consequently, health workforce strategic and operational planning is critically important to thelong-term sustainability of the Alberta health care system. Goal 3 Rural communities - Access to health care is a critical issue in rural communities and they face special challenges in being able to provide the range of health care services people needand expect. The provincial government's Rural Development Strategy identifies health care asone of the fundamental pillars that must be addressed in order to preserve and sustain ruralcommunities. Goal 6 Supplementary health insurance - Conduct research and consult with experts on insurance programs for continuing care, prescription drugs and other non-emergency health services.Supplementary health insurance would not be required to cover any medical emergencies ormedically necessary health services. Goal 1 Improving Alberta's Health System-The Third Way - Enhance the sustainability of the health system now and in the future by strengthening policy integration and collaborationacross ministries. The Ministry will lead this initiative, which is one of the eight Top Prioritiesof the three-year government business plan. Actions taken will include: Child and youth wellness strategy Common pharmaceutical framework Continuing care strategy Insurance program for continuing care, prescription drugs and other non-emergency health services.221 HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-092. Strengthen public health riskmanagementcapabilities. Linkage: Goal 2Albertans want to know that their health system is prepared and able to protect them from risks to their health. Recent events such as the outbreak of avian influenza, SARS and West Nilevirus as well as a potential pandemic have reinforced the importance of strong public healthprograms. Albertans are partners in this effort. Key strategies for managing public health risksinclude: Goal 2 Protect Albertans against communicable diseases - Strengthen and restructure system capacity to respond to public health issues and risks. Create a communications partnershipwith other ministries, municipalities, agencies, associations (e.g., Alberta Urban MunicipalitiesAssociation, Alberta Association of Municipal Districts and Counties) and other stakeholders toensure Albertans get timely information on how to protect themselves against all communicablediseases in case of a catastrophic event such as pandemic influenza. Goal 2 Protect Albertans from environmental health risks - Protect Albertans from health risks in the environment through education, regulatory enforcement and partnership with otheragencies. Albertans make choices for healthier lifestyles1GOAL ONECORE BUSINESSES, GOALS, STRATEGIES & PERFORMANCE MEASURES Core Business One: Advocate and educate for healthy living Strategies 1.1 Support Albertans in making healthy lifestyle choices through information services like healthyalberta.com. 1.2 Collaborate with community stakeholders to strengthen the ability of individuals and communities to increase healthy behaviours and reduce the risk of disease, illness and injury. 1.3 Provide health and lifestyle information to help people make healthy choices to reduce the risk of disease and injury (e.g., Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, obesity, sexually transmitted infections, HIV). 1.4 Ensure that addiction information, prevention and treatment services are available province-wide.1.5 Work with other ministries to target strategic health and wellness initiatives that address the health needs of children, youth, seniors, Aboriginal communities and Albertans with disabilities or who aredisadvantaged.What it means The health and wellness of Albertans is influenced by genetic factors, early childhood development,education, employment status, the environment and personal decisions about lifestyle behaviours. TheMinistry provides health information to Albertans to promote healthy lifestyle and quality of life choices.222HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Notes: 1.a Self-reported health status is a good indicator of the health and well-being of Albertans. How people rate their own health is affected by a variety of factors including chronic disease, disability, temporary illness and mental health. 1.b Life expectancy at birth indicates how long a newborn would be expected to live if health and living conditions remain unchanged. It reflects an equitable distribution of wealth in the population, good nutrition, education and environmentalconditions. 1.c-1.d Due to the rising rate of all STIs, a further rise is anticipated in both STI and HIV , potentially peaking in 2007 and t hen declining. These increasing rates are similar nationally and internationally. The targets represent a slowing in the rate of increase. 1.e A low birth weight is 2500 grams or less. Low birth weight babies are more likely to have birth related complications, disab ilities and other health problems. They are also at a greater risk of having developmental delays and health problems. 1.f-1.i Chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes are leading causes of death in Alberta, and the greatest drain on our healt h care resources. The most common chronic diseases are linked by a few risk factors: unhealthy diets, lack of exercise, tobacco use a nd substance abuse. If we can make healthier choices we can move closer to the vision of Albertans are healthy and live, work andplay in a healthy environment. The 2012 targets are from the Framework for a Healthy Alberta. 1.h An \"acceptable\" BMI falls in the normal weight range. There are four categories of BMI ranges in the Canadian weight classification system. They are: underweight (BMIs less than 18.5); normal weight overweight (BMIs 25 to29.9), and obese (BMI 30 and over). Most adults with a high BMI (overweight or obese) have a high percentage of body fat.Extra body fat is associated with increased risk of health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and so me cancers. 1.j Consuming alcohol during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). A baby born with FASD can have serious handicaps and therefore could require a lifetime of special care. Alberta's goal is to have zero per cent of women con sume alcohol during pregnancy by 2012.1.aSelf-reported health status: Per cent of Albertans reporting they are \"excellent, 78.083.0 78.083.0 1.cHIV Rates: Age adjusted rate of newly reported HIV cases (per 100,000 population) 5.4 (2004) 5.5 5.6 5.5 1.dSTI Rates: Age adjusted rate of newly reported sexually transmitted infections (per 100,000population) Syphilis Gonorrhea Chlamydia2.3 (2004) 43.3 3004.3 60 290 1.eBirth Weight: Per cent of low birth weight babies 6.2 (2000-02) 6.0 5.9 5.8 5.5 1.fExercise: Per cent of Albertans age 12 and over who are \"active\" or \"moderately active\" 56 (2003) 60 65 70 80 1.gHealthy Diet: Per cent of Albertans age 12 and over who eat at least 5 servings of fruit andvegetables each day 39.1 (2003) 40 42 45 50 1.hHealthy Weight: Per cent of Albertans age 18 and over with \"acceptable\" body mass index(BMI) 47 (2003) 50 51 52 55 1.iDiabetes: Number of new cases of type 2 diabetes (per 1,000 population at risk) General population First Nations population4.5 (2001)9.0 (2001) 4.38.7 4.38.7 4.28.6 4.18.5 1.jAlcohol Consumption: Per of Alberta women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy 4.0 (2002) 3.5 3.2 3.0 0Performance Measures Last Actual (year)Target 2006-07Target 2007-08Target 2008-09 2012223 HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Albertans' health is protected2GOAL TWO What it means The Ministry monitors the health system and provides leadership and planning for prevention services delivered through health authorities and other partners. As public health issues such as avian influenzagain attention worldwide, Albertans need to know their health system is ready and able to protect them.The Ministry provides support and leadership in the development of the overall provincial response andemergency plans to deal with outbreaks and health threats. These services help to protect Albertans fromdisease and injury. Strategies 2.1 Reduce suicide and the risk of serious injury through education and targeted interventions in collaboration with other agencies. Work with AADAC, Children's Services, and Solicitor General andPublic Security to reduce the number of youth suicides. 2.2 Protect Albertans against communicable diseases by strengthening the health system's capacity to prevent, be prepared for and respond to public health risks such as vaccine-preventable diseases,emerging threats like avian influenza and increases in sexually transmitted infections. 2.3 Protect Albertans from environmental health risks transmitted via air, water, food and physical environments through education, environmental and air quality monitoring, regulatory compliance andenforcement in partnership with other ministries. 2.4 Develop networks and initiatives that improve access to disease screening and prevention services such as the Alberta Stroke Network. 2.5 Work with other ministries on the Water for Life Strategy to ensure safe and secure drinking water for Albertans. 2.6 Develop a provincial immunization strategy that would lead to improved immunization rates among Albertans. 2.7 Conduct health surveillance; assess and report on health trends in selected health priority areas (e.g., a reproductive health report, a West Nile Virus report, an updated children's health status report, and aninjury report). 2.8 Work with other ministries to reduce the transmission of infection in the provision of health care and other community services (e.g., day cares). 2.9 Utilize funding from the Alberta Cancer Prevention Legacy Fund to put Alberta at the forefront of cancer prevention, screening and research.224HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Notes: 2.a Raise awareness of the significant burden motor vehicle collisions and suicide have on society and assure Albertans that act ions will be taken to impact these behaviours. Along with Infrastructure and Transportation and the RCMP, the Ministry funds and support s the work of the Alberta Occupant Restraint Program through the Alberta Centre for Injury Control and Research. 2.b Providing immunizations for childhood vaccine-preventable diseases is a major activity of the public health system. Immuniz ations protect children and adults from a number of vaccine-preventable diseases, some of which can be fatal or produce permanentdisabilities. A high rate of coverage is needed to protect the entire community from outbreaks of these diseases. Immunization s also provide the parents of young children with the opportunity to obtain other needed health information and advice during clinic v isits. * Long-term target is 97 per cent (by 2009) as outlined in the Alberta Immunization Manual, 2001 in accordance with national standards. 2.c Influenza has a significant seasonal impact on the health of Albertans and tends to be most severe among children 6 to 24 mo nths of age, older Albertans, residents of long-term care facilities and those with certain chronic conditions. Illness and death from influenza is more likely in these populations, which affects acute care hospitals and emergency departments. 2.d Education and screening reduces the rate of breast cancer among women from 50-69 years of age. The screening rate is an appropriate indicator of the effectiveness of the health system to detect cancer as soon as possible. Improved access to health services3GOAL THREECore Business Two: Provide quality health and wellness services What it means Albertans expect health services will be accessible where and when they are needed. Working with health authorities and service providers, federal and provincial governments, Health and Wellness setsaccess standards for the health system. Improved access includes waiting time and geographic accessstandards and options in health services. These standards and their targets are as interconnected as thehealth system itself, and each target affects other health services.2.aMortality Rates: (per 100,000 population) Land Transport Accidents Suicide 12.2 (2003)13.9 (2003) 12.013.9 12.013.7 12.013.5 2.bChildhood immunization coverage rates: (per cent by 2 yrs of age): Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, HibMeasles, vaccination: Per cent have received the recommended annual influenza (flu)vaccine SeniorsChildren for cent of women age 50-69 receiving screeningmammography every two years (excludesmammograms done for diagnostic purposes) 52.4 (2003) 60 62 62Performance Measures Last Actual (year)Target 2006-07Target 2007-08Target 2008-09 New Performance Measure under development: The Alberta Cancer Board will be developing a screening program and measure for colorectal cancer. There are no data collected on a provincial basis at this time.225 HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Strategies 3.1 Provide for continuing care services that allow Albertans to \"age-in-place\" in their homes and communities: work with regions to coordinate access to continuing care services for facility living, supportive living and home living; consolidate and modernize continuing care policy and regulations; collaborate with the Ministry of Seniors and Community Supports to address barriers/access to continuum of care and encourage innovation; expand community-based and home care services to enable individuals to remain in their communities as long as possible; and develop a new approach to paying for long-term care. 3.2 Find innovative and culturally appropriate ways to improve access to health services for all Albertans, especially populations who have not taken advantage of health services in the past. 3.3 Work with the Alberta Mental Health Board, regional health authorities and other partners to support their community-based implementation of the Provincial Mental Health Plan. 3.4 Continue to launch pilot projects to remove inefficiencies and speed up access to prostate cancer care, children's mental health and cataract surgery. 3.5 Begin implementation of Rural Development Strategy initiatives focused on health care in rural communities. 3.6 Improve Albertans' access to primary health care by changing how these services are organized, funded and delivered (e.g., Primary Care Networks, Academic and Non-Academic Alternate Relationship Plans,Telehealth, new models for delivery of primary health care services). 3.7 In partnership with health authorities and other ministries, develop and implement long-term capital plans to ensure Albertans have access to appropriate facilities and services. 3.aWait Times: Regional Health Authority achievement of wait time goals in weeks basedon clinical urgency:* Hip replacement surgery Knee replacement surgery Heart Surgery (CABG) MRI90th percentile 54 (June 2005) 66.4 (June 2005) 8.7 (June 2005) 16.7 (June 2005)90th percentile 40 50 8 1690th percentile 30 30 7 1490th percentile 20 20 6 12 3.bNumber waiting for long-term care facility placement: In acute hospital Urgent in community268 (March 2005)272 (March 2005) 255245 242233 230221 3.cPer cent of Albertans who have used Health Link Alberta 23 (2004) 27 28 28Performance Measures Last Actual (year)Target 2006-07Target 2007-08Target 2008-09 Notes:3.a-3.b Providing reasonable access to needed health service is a major objective and a defining attribute of the publicly funde d health system. Longer waits affect health status and quality of life and result in more costly health services. Albertans requiringemergency surgery are not placed on wait lists.* Data obtained from the Alberta Waitlist Registry. Excludes emergency surgical patients. Targets are set for the 90th percenti le as it best represents the actual waiting experience of Albertans requiring these services. 90th percentile means 90 per cent o f patients waited that long or less. 3.c Health Link Alberta is a 24 hours a day, seven days a week service which provides Albertans with access to general health an d service information from a registered nurse. New Performance Measure under development: The Ministry is developing targets for a new measure to track access to children's mental health services.226HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Contemporary health workforce4GOAL FOUR Strategies 4.1 Collaborate with health system stakeholders to support the development and coordination of health workforce plans (e.g., Provincial Comprehensive Health Workforce Plan, regional health authorityworkforce plans, physician resource plans, nursing workforce strategy, development of Health WorkforceInformation Network). 4.2 Work with key stakeholders on initiatives to provide education and training programs to develop the needed health workforce (e.g., continue implementation and ongoing evaluation of the Health Care AideCurriculum; provide placements for community medicine residents and field surveillance officers fromthe Public Health Agency of Canada). 4.3 Provide leadership to key stakeholders on initiatives to recruit, retain and appropriately compensate the needed health workforce (e.g., Rural Physician Action Plan, academic and non-academic AlternateRelationship Plans, Physician On-call programs, Provincial Nominee Program). 4.4 Work with regional health authorities, professional organizations and through the Tri-lateral Master Agreement structure to improve health care through innovations in service delivery and compensationwith an emphasis on the development of multidisciplinary teams and incentives that enable health carepractitioners to work collaboratively (e.g., Telehealth, academic and non-academic AlternateRelationship Plans, Primary Care Networks, Health Professions Act ). 4.5 Promote effective and efficient utilization of the health workforce by encouraging the development of competency profiles across professions and interdisciplinary understanding of scopes of practice for careproviders (e.g., Alberta International Medical Graduate program, increased use of nurse practitioners,Provincial Nominee Program). 4.6 Develop and implement regulations for health care providers under the Health Professions Act to enable health care practitioners to work to their full scopes of practice. 4.7 Increase rural access to health care practitioners and multidisciplinary teams (e.g., Rural Physician Action Plan, Telehealth, Primary Care Networks, Rural On-Call program, Rural Locum Program).What it means Provide strong leadership to ensure that a qualified and integrated health workforce meets the current andfuture health care needs of Albertans. 4.aNumber of physicians in Alternate Relationship Plans* 688 (2005) 840 950 1,000 4.bNumber of postgraduate medical seats 866 (2004-05) 995 1,030 1,050 4.cNumber of health workforce practitioners 46,700 (2003) 47,868 48,825 49,800 4.dPer cent of Albertans who have a family doctor 84 (2004) 86 88 90Performance Measures Last Actual (year)Target 2006-07Target 2007-08Target 2008-09227 HEALTH BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Improved health service outcomes5GOAL FIVENotes: 4.a Successful achievement will indicate that larger numbers of health services are being delivered to Albertans in models of collaborative, multidisciplinary and integrated practice. * Alternate Relationship Plans are new physician compensation models that offer flexibility from volume driven fee-for-service payments. They support the greater use of multidisciplinary teams and other changes to improve overall patient care. 4.b Increasing the number of education seats for physicians should result in more licensed physicians. More physicians improve access to physician services and reduce wait times. 4.c Physicians, nurses (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, registered psychiatric nurses), pharmacists and rehabilita tion professionals (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapists) are included. Increasing the health workforce help s to reduce wait times and improve access to services. 4.d The proportion of Albertans who have a family doctor is rising and encompasses a solid majority of residents. A family docto r who knows his/her patients' history and health issues is in the best position to work with patients and their families to reduce th e risk of disease and attain their health goals. Strategies 5.1 Help Albertans with chronic health conditions (e.g., cancer, diabetes) maintain optimum health through appropriately managed and coordinated care, including paid and voluntary support systems andnetworks. 5.2 Improve quality of continuing care services by: enhancing assessment and case management to help clients to navigate through the health system; improving access to long-term care and home care services; addressing human resource issues by increasing the supply and training of personal care aides; implementing new standards for long-term care centres and continuing care services; and implementing, measuring and enforcing compliance with continuing care standards. 5.3 Work with health authorities to avoid and minimize risks or unintended results in providing health services by promoting quality standards for health services, such as patient safety and infectionprevention and control (e.g., handwashing). 5.4 Strengthen the health system's capacity to define, report, monitor and prevent hospital 1or community acquired infections, adverse events and medical errors. 5.5 Use information from the Health Quality Council of Alberta, including patient/client feedback, to assist in improving performance of Alberta's health system. 5.6 Initiate public reporting of outcome indicators for the key life-saving interventions of cardiac revascularization, kidney dialysis and transplants. 5.7 Review recommendations of the Ambulance Governance Advisory Council, including results of the Discovery Region pilot projects, and develop and execute an appropriate implementation strategy.What it means Albertans expect the best possible care and outcomes when they use the health system. As part of itsleadership and assurance role, the Ministry established a quality framework including six dimensions ofquality health services: acceptability, appropriateness, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and safety.The Ministry continually develops and updates standards, monitors compliance with standards to ensurethe quality of programs and services, and develops new initiatives in response to technological advances,demographic changes and other factors. 1Infections that are acquired while a patient is in hospital are referred to as nosocomial infections.228HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Notes: 5.a Albertans need to be assured that their health system is ready and able to treat those with chronic health conditions to mai ntain optimum health through appropriately managed and coordinated care. * Reduced hospitalization rates for chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, depression, hypertension, neurosis and alcohol and drug dependencies. 5.b Albertans expect the best care and outcomes whenever they use the health system. The 30-day survival rate for heart attacks is an appropriate measure of the quality of health care the system provides in its hospitals. 5.c Survival rates are important not only because they indicate the proportion of people who will be alive at a given point afte r they have been diagnosed with cancer, but also because they may allow the effectiveness of cancer control programs to be evaluated. Health system efficiency, effectiveness and innovation6GOAL SIXCore Business Three: Lead and participate in continuous improvement in the health system Strategies System Management 6.1 Continue to enhance and clarify the accountability relationships within the health system as public expectations evolve (e.g., Tri-lateral Master Agreement, health authority health plans, long-term careand surgical services contracts). 6.2 Implement a policy framework in collaboration with health authorities and professional organizations and continue to develop a health service plan, a provincial public health strategic plan, and a provincialresearch strategy. 6.3 Continue to lead, develop and enhance policies and frameworks that address data security, access, standards and quality requirements. 6.4 Work with key partners and stakeholders to enable Alberta's interests to be forefront in collaborative federal-provincial initiatives. 6.5 Prepare a discussion document on how private supplementary health insurance may affect continuing care, prescription drugs and other non-emergency health services. 6.6 Contribute to initiatives which strengthen collaboration, integration and coordination across ministries to enhance the sustainability of the public health system and ensure optimum strategic investment. 6.7 Collect and publish health system cost information.What it means Alberta's complex health system is challenged by continuous change, rising costs, steady growth and increased public expectations. Health system innovation can only be achieved in collaboration withstakeholders and the Alberta public, through an effective coordination of efforts and clear, timelycommunication.5.aAmbulatory Care Sensitive Conditions hospitalization rates* (per 100,000 age standardized population) 434 (2002-03) 400 400 400 5.b30-day heart attack survival rate for patients treated in hospital (three-year average data, inper cent) 90 (2000-03) 92 92 92 5.c5-Year Cancer survival rates (in per cent): Breast cancer (female rate only)Colorectal cancer (male and female rate) 80 (1997-2002)54 AND WELLNESS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-096.8 Create new expert sub-committees to the Province Wide Services Working Group, consisting of clinicians and program managers, to advise on appropriate volumes, patient outcomes and accessibility for key lifesaving interventions. 6.9 Work with regional health authorities and other partners to strengthen the overall public health capacity in the province. Innovation 6.10 Continue to implement health information technology to give clinicians drug, laboratory and diagnostic imaging data so they can provide quality patient care. 6.11 Change the majority of Alberta's diagnostic imaging services and equipment to filmless technologies to enable earlier diagnosis and reduce unnecessary duplication of diagnostic imaging procedures. 6.12 Implement the following systems: electronic systems within regions and physicians' offices to provide patient information to physicians at the point-of-care (e.g., computer access to a patient's file from each treatment room); electronic tracking and referral and patient tracking systems to streamline access to selected specialty services; and improve system access and security to minimize fraud and better identify eligible health service recipients. 6.13 Provide leadership on federal/provincial/territorial work to manage the growing cost of pharmaceuticals including the protection of Albertans from catastrophic drug costs. 6.14 Introduce a new Health Care Assurance Act . 6.15 Enhance processes to decide whether to publicly fund new health services and technologies. 6.aPublic Rating of health system overall : Per cent rating the health care system overall aseither \"excellent\" or \"good\" 67 (2005)68 69 70 6.bNumber of care providers accessing Alberta Netcare1600 (2004)10,000 15,000 20,000 6.cAccess to data: Per cent of stakeholders reporting easy access to information76 (2005)85 92 92 6.dHousehold spending on drugs: Per cent of households spending over 5 per cent ofhousehold income after taxes on prescriptiondrugs 2.5 (2002)2.5 2008-09 Notes:6.a Albertans who receive health services are in a good position to report from their perspective on the quality of care they re ceive. Several factors may contribute to their judgments about quality service including timeliness, competence, safety, health outcom es and communication between patient and provider. 6.b This is a clinical health information network that links community physicians, pharmacists, hospitals and other authorized h ealth care professionals across the province. It lets these health care practitioners see and update health information such as a patient 's allergies, prescriptions and lab tests.

LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN The work of the Ministry, as defined in its business plan, is fully aligned with and supports the Government of AlbertaStrategic Business Plan. Link to 20-Year Strategic Plan. The Ministry supports all four keyopportunities and the Capital Plan:Link to 2006-09 Government Business Plan. The Ministry supports seven of the fourteen Government Business Plan Goals: Unleashing Innovation 1.

Capital Plan14. Alberta will have a supportive and sustainable infrastructure that promotes growth and enhances quality of life (Supported by all Ministry Goals)237 HUMAN RESOURCES AND EMPLOYMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Demand for Skilled LabourStrong economic growth leads to increased demand for skilled labour across many sectors. Major growth in mining, oil and gas extraction, and construction (pipelines, infrastructureand other major projects) is expected to drive an increased demand for skilled labour. Attracting and Retaining Skilled WorkersIndustry is experiencing increased competition for skilled workers within the province, across Canada as well as internationally. To attract and retain skilled workers, Alberta willneed to promote its high standard of living, exceptional social, cultural and recreationalfacilities, and enviable quality of life. Changing Skill RequirementsSkills required in the workplace are constantly changing due to technological advancements and emerging industries. As a result, there is a greater need for workers to upgrade oracquire new skills to remain knowledgeable, competitive and productive. Employment Standards The workplace relationships between the employer and worker are changing - more peopleare working part time, on contract or in other non-traditional ways. With these changes,there is a need to have employment standards in the workplace to meet the needs ofemployers and employees, and maintain the balance of flexible and productive workplaces. Workplace Health and SafetyWith a booming economy, many new and inexperienced workers enter the labour force, resulting in an increased need to educate employers and employees on health and safety inthe workplace. Labour Relations and Collective Bargaining During times of skills shortages, technological changes and desire for increased productivity, there are great demands placed on the collective bargaining process to ensure a positivelabour relations environment, costs are contained and new ways of doing work areimplemented. Participation of all Albertans in the LabourForceGroups such as Aboriginal people, youth, immigrants and persons with disabilities are under-represented in the labour force. There is a need to increase both the ability of thesegroups to compete in the labour market and the willingness of employers to employ thesegroups. Rising Costs Increased costs, particularly for housing, utilities and prescription drugs impact the collectivebargaining process and the ability of Albertans to manage their financial needs.SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES The Ministry has identified the following environmental factors, which may influence its ability to achieve its goals: Department of Human Resources and Employment: Alberta continues to experience strong economic growth. Megaprojects to develop the oil sands and build pipelines have either been announced or are underway, and money is beinginvested in infrastructure across the province. Unemployment rates continue to be the lowest in the country and labourforce participation rates continue to be the highest. Although Alberta's population is aging, projections suggest that Alberta's average age will continue to be among the lowest in the country. The Aboriginal population has been increasing and is expected to continue to grow. Over recent years,Alberta has maintained the highest level of net inter-provincial migration and immigration is on the rise. Within this environment, several significant opportunities and challenges have been identified which may influence the Department's ability to contribute to Alberta's economic prosperity and productivity through labour force development andby fostering fair, safe and healthy workplaces:238HUMAN RESOURCES AND EMPLOYMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Employee Engagement and RetentionA dedicated workforce is needed to provide high quality service to Albertans. Continuous development of employees, building strong and positive workplace relationships and valuingemployee contributions helps the Alberta government to engage and retain employees. Attracting Talent The Alberta public service needs to effectively attract talent in a competitive labour marketwhere the demand for skilled and knowledgeable workers is high. Succession Management The Government of Alberta is facing a situation where the average age of its employees isincreasing and significant numbers are expected to retire in the next 10 years. A strongemphasis is needed to ensure employees with the skills needed to achieve the government'sgoals will be continuously available in the future. Workplace Health Workplace incidents and injuries affect productivity. The Alberta public service strives toprovide a safe, healthy and positive work environment for its employees and supportsemployee well being.Personnel Administration Office: As an employer, the Government of Alberta operates in an environment with changing demographics and economic trends as well as a competitive labour market. Through the Personnel Administration Office, the Ministry provides leadership in human resource management and works with other ministries to develop innovative and leading human resource practices designed to support the delivery of qualityservice to Albertans. To effectively position the Alberta public service as an employer that offers a challenging, diverse andrewarding team environment, a number of opportunities and challenges have been identified: Alberta Labour Relations Board: The Alberta labour relations field is a dynamic one that responds to changes in the economy, demographics, technology and other factors. The Board must respond to these changes while maintaining theunderlying principles of Alberta's labour relations legislation. To ensure impartial application of Alberta's labour laws, theBoard has identified the following opportunity and challenge: Changing Environment The strength or weakness of the economy as well as changes in demographics andtechnology impact the labour relations environment. By providing effective and timelyinvestigation, mediation and adjudication services to the Alberta labour relations community,the Board contributes to a healthy, stable labour relations climate. Appeals Commission for Alberta Workers' Compensation: The number of appeals arising from the Workers' Compensation Board review body decisions is significantly above previous five-year averages and general administrativeworkloads continue to increase. The Appeals Commission provides a fair, independent and timely final level of appealrelated to Workers' Compensation decisions. The following challenge and opportunity has been identified which couldimpact its ability to provide effective appeal service to workers and employers: Increasing Workload As the workload increases, the challenge is to improve the timeliness of appeals processingwhile maintaining quality decisions and a fair and accessible appeal process. In addition,there is a greater need to work with stakeholders to enhance their understanding of theappeals process.239 HUMAN RESOURCES AND EMPLOYMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of environmental factors, the following strategic priorities have been identified and reinforce Human Resources and Employment's role in Alberta's economic prosperity and productivity and in fostering fair, safe andhealthy workplaces.

BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09252INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09VISION Alberta Infrastructure and Transportation is a Centre of Excellence providing effective infrastructure to supportAlberta's growth and prosperity.MISSION We contribute to Alberta's economic prosperity and qualityof life through the provision and support of effective, safe,innovative and sustainable transportation, public buildings,and water and wastewater infrastructure. LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN Link to goals in the 2006-09 Government of Alberta Business Plan...Goal 1: Alberta will have a diversified and prosperous economy The Ministry provides assistance to rural municipalities, towns and villages in accommodating new resource and industry related traffic, and the provision of facilities to support the delivery of government programs includingthose that support innovation throughout Alberta. Goal 2: Albertans will be well prepared for lifelong learning and work The Ministry provides technical expertise to partner ministries and boards to ensure learning facilities meet program needs. Goal 3: Alberta's international competitiveness will be enhanced The Ministry facilitates development of effective water/wastewater, road, and building infrastructure required to sustain growing communities and enhancement of strategic economic corridors to improve access to themarketplace that supports economic development throughout the province. Goal 5: Albertans will be healthy The Ministry works with health regions to plan and implement the most appropriate facility solutions to meet health delivery needs. Goal 8: Alberta will have a financially stable, open and accountable government The Ministry supports this goal by effectively planning and managing government-owned and leased facilities and implementing innovative technologies to increase energy efficiency and reduce operating costs. Goal 9: Alberta will have strong and effective partnerships with municipal, provincial, territorial, federal and foreign governments The Ministry supports strong effective partnerships through collaboration with other jurisdictions to develop national and multi-jurisdictional transportation and aviation strategies, foster integrated multi-modal transportationsystems, and develop new and deliver existing programs to support municipal and government needs. TheMinistry also collaborates to address infrastructure, freight and passenger transportation, highway and municipalpolicy, and related environmental issues. Goal 10: Alberta will be a fair and safe place to work, live and raise families The Ministry ensures effective driver education services and standards are in place, working to improve transportation safety, and providing safe facilities that support government programs. Goal 11: The high quality of Alberta's environment will be sustained The Ministry sustains the quality of the province's environment by supporting the operation of the Swan Hills Treatment Centre to dispose of hazardous wastes, and by undertaking efforts to reduce the environmental impactof Ministry activities. Goal 14: Alberta will have a supportive and sustainable infrastructure that promotes growth and enhances quality of life The Ministry leads one of the Government of Alberta's top priorities; Building Infrastructure for Our Future which is the plan that addresses future infrastructure investment and current needs to support economic growthwhile maintaining existing infrastructure. The Ministry also supports this goal by partnering with other ministriesto develop the province's Capital Plan and implement approved projects.253INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES Traffic Volumes, Collisions and Injuries The amount of traffic in Alberta continues to rise due to an increasing population and growing economy, resulting in majorimplications for the efficiency of Alberta's roads and safety of Alberta's road users. Greater public awareness of road safetyis resulting in pressures on government to address road safety issues, improve highway infrastructure, implement newtechnologies and address road user behavior and attitudes. Continued efforts are needed to identify and work with high riskdrivers on intervention strategies to reduce collisions and resulting injuries and fatalities. Aging Infrastructure A persistent challenge for the past several years has been to balance the need for ongoing maintenance and rehabilitation ofexisting capital assets with the need to invest in various types of infrastructure to accommodate growth and economicpressures. A significant backlog in deferred maintenance has been created. Major repair can be expected to cost more thanroutine maintenance would have cost, and all-out replacement can cost up to five times what repair would have cost. Aspart of the capital plan process, the Ministry is leading a strategy to provide adequate maintenance and upgrading that isrequired to preserve the province's existing capital assets. Infrastructure and Transportation must address a growing infrastructure debt. As of 2005-06, it is estimated over seven billion dollars are required. Although a significant increase in capital funding has been provided to build necessaryhighways, schools and health facilities related to new capital projects, resolving infrastructure deficiencies will take time.The Ministry will continue to pursue new ways of providing cost effective infrastructure, such as public-private partnerships(P3s) and other alternative financing opportunities. Economic and Population Growth and Changing Demographics Economic and population growth is contributing to increased highway traffic volumes, causing additional pressures. Rail,air and marine modes of transport are also experiencing increased demand. Further complicating the problem is theimbalance of economic growth in Alberta. Developments in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo generate revenuesto the province and growth in the region is creating substantial pressure to expand local infrastructure. While communitiessituated along the Queen Elizabeth II Highway corridor experience significant growth, some other parts of the province arein decline. Population shifts from rural to urban result in high demand for facilities in growth areas and underutilized facilities in declining areas. These shifts are also noticeable within Edmonton and Calgary. While overall population is growingprovince-wide, school enrolment is declining and is projected to continue to decline over the medium to long-term. Anaging population is increasing demand for health facilities and seniors' lodges.Link to key opportunities in the 20-Year Strategic Plan... The Government of Alberta has identified strategic opportunities as cornerstones to achieving the government's vision.Infrastructure and Transportation supports Unleashing Innovation , which links to government Goal 1 through the creation of research facilities, \"green initiatives\" including the use of green power electrical energy in government buildings,implementing intelligent transportation systems, and other innovations. Leading in Learning is strengthened through preservation and delivery of effective and efficient facilities in support of life-long learning through government Goal 2.Competing in a Global Marketplace , which links to government Goal 3, is enhanced through long-term strategic transportation planning, coordination of transportation modes, improving transportation logistics with domestic andinternational markets, and providing much needed infrastructure in high growth areas such as the Fort McMurray/WoodBuffalo region. As part of Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit the Ministry works with municipalities and stakeholders to improve traffic safety and build modern infrastructure in support of Alberta's social, environmental andeconomic goals, which links to government Goals 5, 9, 10 and11.STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of environmental factors, the strategic priorities described below have been identified. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. 254INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09An aging labour force within construction, trucking and related industries will result in increased labour force shortages, beyond what is currently being experienced. Access to off-shore markets is being impacted by the inability of the Port ofVancouver to accommodate import and export trade as it is currently over capacity with pressures anticipated to increase asWestern Canada's economic growth remains strong. Safety and Security There is increased emphasis on security issues related to potential threats of terrorism, natural disasters, identity theft, an d crime resulting in delays at border crossings, at airports and for dangerous goods transportation. Security concerns are alsoresulting in increased demand for modernization of various types of government infrastructure to respond to enhancedsecurity requirements, including the process of verifying a driver's identity and credentials in support of driver licensing. Cost Increases Global increases in the price of raw materials for construction are contributing to cost increases for the construction ofbuildings, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Market condition factors, caused by current heavy demand forconstruction projects and tight supplies of materials and labour, are adding 7 to 20 per cent to project costs and willcontinue to do so in the near-term. These factors vary across the province on a north-south basis, with isolated northerncommunities experiencing the most severe cost pressures. Mega projects and significant new provincial and federal infrastructure programs are contributing to increasing inflation and construction prices for all types of infrastructure. Increased construction activity will further impact labour availability.Wage rates are under stress due to Alberta's low unemployment rate, high labour participation rate and rising constructionvolumes. An aging workforce is threatening to further impact labour costs as skilled workers retire from the workforce. Operations and Maintenance Costs The operation and maintenance of Alberta's capital assets must address a growing backlog in deferred maintenance that isincreasingly resulting in the need for costly repair and/or replacement of the capital asset. Regular maintenance protectsand extends the useful life of our capital assets. The operation and maintenance of Alberta's capital assets must be balancedagainst other government spending priorities. However, the importance of regular maintenance in extending the life of ourcapital assets must be considered in resource allocation decisions. As new infrastructure is built to accommodate theprovince's population growth, a corresponding increase in operation and maintenance costs will be required. New Technology and Innovation Adapting to technological change and improving organizational efficiencies and business processes by integrating the use ofnew technology, is an ongoing challenge for the Ministry. Better information, improved research, and lessons learned frompast integrations will be used to incorporate new technology into business processes. Infrastructure innovations such asdesigning multi-purpose facilities to allow flexibility in the future, applying new sustainable technologies to improveefficiencies in program delivery, energy usage and operating costs, developing intelligent transportation systems, enhancedrailway crossing systems, and advanced road weather information systems are becoming \"must have\" improvements intoday's environment to improve safety. 1. Saving Lives and Reducing Injury onAlberta Highways Linkage: Goals 1 and 2An extensive traffic safety review has been completed with stakeholders and has led to development of the Alberta Traffic Safety Plan. This plan, led by Infrastructure andTransportation, will address issues related to traffic safety such as driver education,enforcement, technology and sustainable funding. These efforts aim to change driver habitsand reduce collisions. During this business plan period, the Ministry will work in255INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09partnership with Justice, Solicitor General and Public Security, and stakeholders to implement the new Alberta Traffic Safety Plan. 2. Building Infrastructure for Our Future Linkage: Goals 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9In today's complex global environment many issues and trends have an impact on the effective and efficient management of Alberta's infrastructure requirements. To ensureAlbertan's infrastructure needs are met, the Ministry will: Work with partner ministries and other stakeholders to design a 10-year plan to address deferred maintenance; Work with partner ministries to determine priority capital projects. 3. Managing Complex InfrastructureRequirements Linkage: Goals 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9Manage Alberta's infrastructure requirements effectively and efficiently in today's complex global environment by balancing the need for ongoing maintenance and rehabilitation ofexisting capital with the need for new capital investment; addressing capital projectpriorities; and considering alternative financing opportunities, including public-privatepartnerships to provide needed infrastructure. 4. Supporting Economic Development andInnovation Linkage: Goals 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9Alberta's continued growth depends on many factors with effective infrastructure being a top priority. Efficient transportation links are needed to get goods to market and learning andhealth facilities are required to support growing communities. Increased competitiveness in domestic and international markets is more attainable through projects such as twinning of the North-South Trade Corridor and development of urbancorridors such as the Edmonton and Calgary ring roads. Construction of new schools andother facilities as well as road network improvements are underway or planned for high-growth areas including the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. Efforts will continuewith municipalities and stakeholders to ensure that required infrastructure meets local needsand supports economic development throughout the province. 5. Support for the Government ofAlberta's Top Priorities Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9The Ministry will continue to play an active role in a number of the Government of Alberta's top priorities in addition to those where it does not have a lead role, such as: Using and Respecting the Land by participating in the development of a Land Use Framework and supporting the Water for Life Strategy; Building Aboriginal Self-sufficiency by providing opportunities for Aboriginal people to participate in Ministry projects on their lands; Protecting People's Private Information by ensuring information entrusted to the Ministry is secure and managed to protect privacy. 6. Provide Service Excellence to MeetClient Needs Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9In support of our vision to become a Centre of Excellence and function as an empowered and flexible organization that provides the best possible service to our clients, the Ministry will: Clarify roles and accountabilities with our partner ministries, clients and stakeholders as a result of sharing responsibility for implementing capital projects; Evaluate opportunities for alternative ways of providing service; Improve service provision by fully integrating department functions and taking advantage of synergies within the restructured organization; Re-evaluate our human resource needs and develop and implement continuity planning strategies to ensure our workforce has the technical and management skills tosuccessfully achieve our goals; Integrate technologies to improve business processes; and Effectively identify and manage risk in all our business areas.256INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Improve driver, vehicle, carrier, road and rail safety1GOAL ONECORE BUSINESSES, GOALS, STRATEGIES & PERFORMANCE MEASURES Core Business One: Manage provincial transportation safety programs Strategies 1.1 Implement the Alberta Traffic Safety Plan to reduce fatalities and injuries on Alberta's roadways. 1.2 Pursue initiatives to support Road Safety Vision 2010, Canada's national road safety strategy, to meet national goals and make Alberta's roads safer. 1.3 Enhance the safety of children through programs and initiatives focusing on child safety seats, bicycle helmets and other safety programs targeted to school-aged children. 1.4 Continue implementation of the Graduated Driver Licensing program to enhance the safety skills of new drivers. 1.5 Undertake safety audits at the highway planning and design stage to ensure overall integration of geometrics, traffic signals, pavement markings and other specialties, and identify rest area and roadsideturnout needs in conjunction with highway improvements. 1.6 Improve commercial driver safety through driver-training initiatives, hours of service regulation, fatigue management counter measures, and development and monitoring of commercial driver profiles with otherjurisdictions. 1.7 Improve highway safety by implementing enhanced elements to the national driver licensing reciprocity agreement, including implementing the Canadian Driver Licence Agreement. 1.8 Improve highway safety through Intelligent Transportation Systems, including Automated Vehicle Identification for safe commercial vehicle operators. 1.9 Ensure commercial vehicle safety through mandated periodic inspection and on-highway inspection programs. 1.10 Renew the partnership with Transport Canada to ensure that the transportation of dangerous goods, a major component of Alberta's exports, is safe and secure within Alberta. 1.11 Monitor provincial railways to ensure railway infrastructure and equipment conform to appropriate standards. 1.12 Ensure the Transportation Safety Board has the resources it needs to conduct timely, fair and impartial appeals of departmental decisions concerning road and rail safety.What it means Infrastructure and Transportation improves driver, vehicle, carrier, road and rail safety by ensuringeffective driver education services, programs and licensing standards are in place; managing driver recordsand high risk drivers; implementing impaired driving programs; delivering and enforcing vehicle andcommercial carrier safety programs; monitoring the handling and transport of dangerous goods; andoverseeing the safe operation of provincial railways.257INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Notes: 1Transport Canada conducts overall seat belt use surveys biennially. The next overall seat belt survey is scheduled for the fal l of 2007. Infrastructure and Transportation will conduct comparable surveys using similar methodology in 2006 and 2008 to meet reportingrequirements. A measure for percentage of commercial vehicles involved in casualty collisions is under development. Infrastructure and Transp ortation is currently reviewing the Road Safety Vision 2010 sub-target, which aims at a 20 per cent decrease in road users killed or ser iously injured in collisions involving commercial vehicles. The objective will be to develop a baseline and target compatible with th is national sub-target and reduction strategies. A measure of the decrease in traffic fatalities will be developed in association with the Alberta Traffic Safety Plan.1.a Seat Belt Usage - Percentage of vehicle occupants wearing seat belts - Alberta184.9 (2003-04)88.0 90.0 92.0 1.b Mechanical Safety of Commercial Vehicles - Percentage of inspected vehicles requiring on-site adjustments 18.8 (2004-05)19.0 19.0 19.0 Involvement of Drinking Drivers in Casualty Collisions1.c Percentage of drivers involved in fatal collisions who had consumed alcohol 19.1 (2004-05)19.0 18.9 18.7 1.d Percentage of drivers involved in injury collisions who had consumed alcohol4.8 (2004-05)4.6 4.4 4.4Performance Measures Last Actual (year)Target 2006-07Target 2007-08Target the efficiency and effectiveness of provincialhighway infrastructure2GOAL TWOCore Business Two: Plan, develop and manage government-owned and leased infrastructure Strategies 2.1 Improve highway design, construction and preservation through innovative research on safety, engineering and Intelligent Transportation Systems. 2.2 Develop a strategy to minimize deterioration of provincial highways, thereby reducing the amount of major maintenance required. 2.3 Implement a state-of-the-art Transportation Infrastructure Management System.2.4 Employ innovative approaches to monitor, enforce and manage truck weight, dimension and safety limits on provincial highways. 2.5 Commence rationalization of the provincial highway network in partnership with local municipalities to ensure local and provincial needs are met. 2.6 Pursue opportunities to develop cost-shared joint-use vehicle inspection stations with adjacent jurisdictions to enhance efficiencies and ensure consistency among the provinces.

This includes developingstrategic economic corridors such as the North-South Trade Corridor and the Calgary and Edmonton ringroads.258INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Notes: 1Criteria for functional adequacy has changed since the 2005-08 Business Plan. Completion of staged pavements has been added as a factor. 2Measures the kilometres of gravel provincial highways requiring paving, based on either average traffic volume of over 400 vehi cles per day or to ensure surface continuity on strategic roads. Targets for measures 2.a and 2.b are stretch targets to move the Ministry toward achieving its optimal performance objectives.For Physical Condition of Provincial Highways, the optimum objective is 80 per cent good, 15 per cent fair, and five per cent p oor. Achieving this objective would eliminate the deferred maintenance backlog with respect to pavements. The construction cost to improve per cent poor by one per cent is approximately $80 million. The Ministry's optimum objective is to achieve a functional adequacy level of 90 per cent. Achieving this objective would elim inate the need for paving gravel highways, widening existing paved highways (for those highways where condition requires improvement), an d completion of staged pavements. The construction cost to improve functional adequacy by one per cent is approximately $180 mil lion.2.a Physical Condition of Provincial Highways: Percentage in good conditionPercentage fair conditionPercentage in poor condition65.523.3 11.266.023.0 11.067.022.510.5 68.022.010.0 2.b Functional Adequacy of Provincial Highways - Percentage of provincial highways that are notsubject to weight restrictions and meet currentengineering standards 79.4179.4 79.4 79.4 2.c Provincial Highway Paving - Remaining kilometres of graveled provincial highways to be paved2 620 500 430 380 2.d Construction Progress on the North-South Trade Corridor - four-laning open totravel 82.0 88.0 90.0 91.0 2.e Ring Roads in Edmonton and Calgary - Percentage of ring roads open to travel 18.2 26.5 40.0 40.0Performance Measures Last Actual (2004-05)Target 2006-07Target 2007-08Target 2008-09 Ensure safe and effective water management infrastructure onbehalf of Environment3GOAL THREE What it means Continue to work with Environment in effectively developing and maintaining water management infrastructure. Provision of professional, technical and management services to Environment forrehabilitation and upgrading of existing water management infrastructure, as well as the design andconstruction of new water management projects is also included. Projects primarily consist of dams andcanals, including related environmental impact assessments.2.7 Develop strategies to improve the road network in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. Strategies 3.1 Complete construction of projects and continue rehabilitation of the main canal of the Carseland/Bow River system to ensure a secure water supply to the area.259INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-093.2 Develop a multi-year rehabilitation program for Alberta Northern Erosion Control Program projects in conjunction with Environment. 3.3 Develop a program to rehabilitate provincially supported water drainage infrastructure.3.4 Rehabilitate and maintain provincially-owned water management infrastructure through efficient planning and resource allocation. 3.a Progress on Completion of Major Water Management Construction Projects - Percentage of Carseland/Bow River rehabilitationcompleted In partnership with all ministries, effectively plan and managegovernment-owned and leased facilities to support the delivery ofgovernment programs4GOAL FOUR What it means In partnership with all ministries, Infrastructure and Transportation is responsible for providing overall capital and operating management of government-owned and leased facilities including office space,courts, correctional facilities, warehouses, maintenance facilities, laboratories and research centres. TheMinistry also plays a key role in ensuring the health and safety needs of occupants and visitors are metincluding maintaining good air quality in government buildings. The mandate to manage governmentbuildings also includes an obligation to minimize the environmental impact of Ministry activities. Strategies 4.1 Develop, maintain and implement accommodation plans to meet the priority program needs for government clients. 4.2 Address physical building and site security needs in government buildings in collaboration with program departments. 4.3 Assist other ministries and agencies in development and implementation of emergency and safety plans for government-owned and leased buildings across the province. 4.4 Ensure accessibility needs for persons with disabilities are fully considered in Ministry building design standards, policies, programs and projects. 4.5 Apply risk management and remediation initiatives to address environmental concerns at properties owned by government. 4.6 Monitor energy efficiency and operating costs of government-owned and leased facilities and make cost- effective improvements. 4.7 Incorporate best practices in indoor air quality standards and ensure appropriate processes are followed to address any incidents, such as mould, that may occur. 4.8 Minimize the net cost to government through operating the Swan Hills Treatment Centre in a safe and efficient manner.260INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-094.a Physical Condition of Ministry Owned and Operated Facilities: Percentage in good conditionPercentage in fair conditionPercentage in poor condition 44.053.0 3.048.049.0 3.050.047.0 3.050.047.0 3.0 4.b Functional Adequacy of Ministry Owned and Operated Facilities - Percentage that providefunctional service 85.4 88.8 91.4 91.8 4.c Average Operating Cost per Square Metre of Ministry Owned and Operated Office Space -Percentage of operating cost compared to industry average 174 <90 <90 <90 4.d Energy Consumption in Ministry Owned and Operated Facilities - Consumption in megajoulesper square metre 1,745 1,750 2008-09 Notes: 1Ministry target for each year is to not exceed 90 per cent of the annual industry average. Planned and recently completed major renovation and new construction projects will positively impact the physical condition of about 150,200 square metres of facilities which is about eight per cent of the total inventory of government-owned and operated facil ities. Physical condition is projected to continue to decline for the balance of the facilities. While it appears that the physical condition target for \"fair\" is decreasing and the target for \"good\" is increasing, there may not be an improvement in the condition of the vast majority of buildings. Rather, this is a result of the amount of new buildings added and capital project renovations being completed, which increases the overall pool of facilities in \"good\" condition or improves a facility from \"fair\" to \"good\" condition. Capital projects (and associated total project costs) that influence the per cent of facilities in \"good\" co ndition include: 2005-06 - Provincial Archives (12,300 m2), Northern and Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditoriums (38,400 m2) and Level III Biocontainment Lab - Leduc Agrivalue Business Incubator (6,900 m\u00b2);2007-08 - Calgary Courts Centre (90,000 m\u00b2). For the Physical Condition of Ministry Owned and Operated Facilities the optimum target is 85 per cent in good condition.A review of the physical condition methodology will be undertaken to develop improved planning assessment tools for building infrastructure. Support municipal infrastructure needs5GOAL FIVECore Business Three: Partner with municipalities, boards and other government departments and agencies to plan, develop and implementinfrastructure that meets local and government needs What it means Municipalities provide a number of essential local services including water/wastewater services. In support of these municipal programs, Infrastructure and Transportation provides funding for eligiblemunicipal water/wastewater facilities through the Water for Life program, focusing on addressing healthand environmental concerns as a top priority. Developing and upgrading of transportation infrastructure isalso funded through various grant programs for eligible projects. The Ministry also participates, alongwith municipalities and communities, in accessing federal infrastructure programs.261INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Strategies 5.1 Assist municipalities with water supply, water treatment, and wastewater treatment and disposal facilities through the provision of funding under the Water for Life program and an enhanced Regional Water andWastewater Partnership Initiative, consistent with the cross-ministry Water for Life Strategy. 5.2 Continue to provide grant funding to assist Alberta municipalities with developing and upgrading infrastructure through the Basic Capital Grant, Cities Special Transportation Grant, the StreetsImprovement Program, and the Rural Transportation Partnership. 5.3 Provide the cities of Edmonton and Calgary with annual transportation funding based on five cents per litre of fuel delivered within their boundaries. 5.4 Administer the Resource Road Program to assist rural municipalities, towns and villages that experience resource and new industry-based traffic. 5.5 Continue to provide grant funding under the Federal Funding for Cities and Communities program, administer the Infrastructure Canada-Alberta Program and the Municipal Rural Infrastructure Fund. 5.6 Administer the $3 billion Municipal Infrastructure Program to upgrade municipal water, wastewater, transportation and other infrastructure facilities. Notes: n/a Client Satisfaction Survey is conducted every two years and is based on calendar year. Respondents rate satisfaction based on a scale of one to six, one being very dissatisfied and six being very satisfied. The next survey will be conducted in 2006 based on th e 2005 calendar year. Development of a measure to determine the performance of municipal infrastructure is underway.5.a Client Satisfaction Survey - Percentage of municipal clients satisfied with overall quality ofservice 95.0 Collaborate with other ministries in the development andpreservation of schools, post-secondary institutions and healthfacilities through the provision of technical expertise and projectmanagement services 6GOAL SIX What it means The Ministry works in partnership with other ministries, including Health and Wellness, Education, Advanced Education and Seniors and Community Supports to ensure existing and future governmentsupported facilities meet the needs of Albertans. To do this, Infrastructure and Transportation managesproject implementation and provides a wide range of technical expertise to ensure that facility solutionstake into account program delivery needs, life-cycle costing, new technologies and building designs, andefficient operating costs.

I am committed to achieving the planned results laidout in this business plan. [Original Signed]Ed Stelmach, Minister of International and Intergovernmental Relations March 1, 2006 THE MINISTRY The Ministry of International and Intergovernmental Relations consists of three mainsections: Canadian Intergovernmental Relations, International Relations, and Trade Policy.Collectively, these sections seek to ensure that the Alberta government's relations with othergovernments in Canada and abroad are coordinated and consistent with the government'spriorities. The Ministry is a single entity and does not have any agencies or boards as part ofits operations.BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09282INTERNATIONAL AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09VISION A strong Alberta, active in an open world and in a prosperous, united Canada.MISSION To lead the development of government-wide strategies andpolicies for Alberta's relations with internationalgovernments and organizations and with federal, provincialand territorial governments in Canada. LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN All of the Ministry's goals and strategies contribute directly to Goal 9 of the Government Business Plan: Alberta will havestrong and effective partnerships with local, provincial, territorial, federal and foreign governments. Strengthenedinternational relations and greater trade and investment liberalization, combined with strategies on a wide range ofintergovernmental issues and processes, also contribute to a diversified and prosperous economy and to internationalcompetitiveness. The government's strategic business plan sets the course for the Alberta government for the next 20 years. International and Intergovernmental Relations contributes most directly to achieving the fourth strategic opportunity identified in this plan:Making Alberta the best place to live, work and visit. SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES Continue to lead and participate in initiatives within intergovernmental institutions and frameworks, such as the Premiers' Council of the Federation and the Alberta-British Columbia Protocol of Cooperation, along with annual FirstMinisters' Meetings and the Western Premiers' Conference, that provide opportunities for Alberta to workcollaboratively with other provinces to influence the national agenda. Continue to pursue opportunities and rise to the challenges in representing Albertans' priorities and expectations with the federal government, and its place in Confederation and jurisdiction over areas such as its natural resources. Deepen relations with key U.S. decision-makers by building on the initial achievements of the Alberta Office in Washington, D.C. Build Alberta's reputation in the world, open new markets, and attract investment through Premier's international missions. Raise the profile of the province in the U.S. through participation in events such as the 2006 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., and the Pacific NorthWest Economic Region's annual meeting in Edmonton. Pursue opportunities to make progress in areas of priority to Alberta such as agriculture, and disciplines on trade remedies and services stemming from the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong inDecember 2005, and the free trade negotiations underway between Canada and Korea, the European Union and othercountries. Improve and broaden the Agreement on Internal Trade. This will depend on commitments of the other provinces and the federal government to implement fully the initiatives directed by the Council of the Federation process.

Alberta Justice plays a key role in Goal 10 of the Government of Alberta business plan - Alberta will be a fair and safe place to work, live and raise families by supporting a trusted justice system that promotes law and order for the purpose of protecting individuals, securing justice for victims, and ensuring offenders are held accountable. The Ministry also plays akey role in Goal 6: Albertans will be self-reliant and independent and those unable to provide for their basic needs will receive help by ensuring that low-income Albertans have access to legal services that they would not otherwise be able to obtain. The Ministry is primarily linked to the fourth opportunity - Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit. The Ministry will continue to invest in Alberta's communities to make them among the safest in North America by gettingtougher on those who commit violent offences. The Ministry will play a leadership role in establishing a more responsivejustice system by expanding the availability and scope of dispute resolution options and using technology to strengthen thejustice system. It will also continue to pressure the federal government to take tough positions against violent crimes andthose who commit them. SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES Recognizing trends, identifying new challenges, and being aware of changes in diverse socio-economic sectors is animportant part of setting the Ministry's strategic priorities and addressing justice concerns for Albertans. A number of theseopportunities and challenges are complex and involve other stakeholders and jurisdictions. The Ministry is presented withthe challenge of being held accountable for outcomes for which the Ministry does not have sole responsibility. Thefollowing factors will influence the Ministry in developing future goals and strategies. Children, Youth, Families & Family Violence Family violence continues to be a significant issue in Alberta. In 2004, women living in Alberta were the most likely inCanada to report spousal violence, while men in Alberta were the second most likely. Family violence impacts thosedirectly involved, the children who witness the violence, the community, and society as a whole. It is estimated that 60 - 70percent of child welfare cases come from violent homes, and that many physical, mental, emotional and financial concernsare rooted in family violence. Child Sexual Exploitation Possessing child pornography is not a victimless crime. Child pornography has devastating effects on children and youth, both those who are exploited in the actual pictures and those who view it. It is permanent proof of the sexual abuse of achild. Although child pornography is not new, the internet has enabled purveyors and collectors of this material todistribute it in an unprecedented manner. Identity Theft Identity theft is one of the fastest growing, and potentially one of the most economically destructive, forms of criminalbehaviour in Alberta, Canada and the world. With the increasing sophistication of the criminal element and the growth inthe use of advanced technology by criminals, it is easier than ever to create a completely false identity, assume the identityof a deceased person or use personal information of an existing person to commit criminal offences. Impact of Gang Crime Across Canada there has been an increase in senseless and unprovoked acts of violence committed by gangs, and Albertahas not been immune to these criminal acts. Particular groups that can be characterized as gangs may or may not fall withinthe legal definition of criminal organization or conform in their methods to traditional patterns of organized crime. They292JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09are groups that carry out acts of violence or commit property offences associated with motives of gain and drug trafficking. Gangs are involved in the illegal manufacture, trafficking and use of drugs, including crystal methamphetamine. Theincreased prevalence of offences committed by drug users may require distinctive policing, prosecution and court strategies.Emerging groups are often inter-provincial and pursue criminal activities in both urban and rural settings. Traffic Safety Alberta has a traffic injury and fatality rate that has been above the national average as recently as 2004. The Albertagovernment has taken a very public stance on the issue of traffic safety, especially with respect to impaired drivers.Alberta's slogan is \"Alberta is getting tough on Impaired Drivers\". Traffic injuries and deaths have a profound impact ongovernment, through provision of health care, loss of productivity, insurance issues, enforcement and prosecution, and roadconstruction and maintenance. The impact on the lives and quality of life of Albertans is immeasurable. Access to Justice All Albertans are entitled to fair and equitable access to and treatment by the justice system. They want to be able to resolv e conflicts with the least amount of time, cost, and complexity, and they want to do it close to their own communities. Issuesaffecting access to justice include: an increasing number of self-represented litigants in the family and civil courts; theinability of low income persons to access the justice system; and an increasing demand for alternatives to litigation that arefair while remaining affordable; and challenges specific to remote areas. Aboriginal Initiatives Aboriginal people are the youngest and fastest growing population in Alberta, with one-third of the Aboriginal population 14years of age or younger. The disproportionate representation of Aboriginal people at all stages in the criminal justicesystem, both as victims and offenders, continues to be a significant issue. Public Engagement and Confidence With Albertans increasingly demanding a greater role in government decision-making processes, constructive engagement isbecoming of greater importance in ensuring that services, programs, and information meet their needs in the most effectiveand efficient ways possible. Engaging and informing Albertans about the justice system through public legal education hasthe potential to improve Albertans' understanding of the structures and processes of the justice system, and it also has thecapacity to instill a greater respect for the rule of law. Understanding the law and the notion that no individual, group ororganization is above the law is fundamental to a free and democratic society. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of external and internal challenges, the following strategic priorities have been identified.The prioritites are equally important to the Ministry. 1. Stakeholder/Partner Engagement Linkage: Goal 4The Ministry must work with Albertans and justice stakeholders in a collaborative, consultative, and continuous way to coordinate efforts and clarify roles and responsibilitiesin order to be able to effectively respond to the key issues of Alberta's justice system. Thisincludes providing increased opportunities for engagement and making stakeholderinvolvement an integral part of the policy and decision-making process. Strong partnershipswith stakeholders are required for the Ministry to enhance Albertans' understanding of therule of law and increase their confidence in the justice system. 2. Traffic Safety Linkage: Goal 2Alberta, in conjunction with the federal government and all provinces and territories, has committed to Road Safety Vision 2010 - a national strategy to make Canada's roads thesafest in the world. The strategy includes aggressive targets to reduce fatalities and injuries293 JUSTICE BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09on Canada's roadways. Justice is working closely with Infrastructure and Transportation, Solicitor General and Public Security, as well as non-government organizations to implementthe Alberta Traffic Safety Plan. The Alberta Traffic Safety Plan provides new strategies,including legislation and increased enforcement, to reduce the number of injuries and deathson Alberta's roads. 3. Family Violence and Protection of Children Linkage: Goal 1Since the Alberta Roundtable on Family Violence and Bullying in May 2004, Alberta has taken many positive steps toward prevention and effective intervention in family violence.However, Alberta continues to experience deaths as a result of intimate or ex-intimatepartner relationships. Although Alberta has many agencies that address family violence,they are not all well positioned to deal with situations of high risk. The establishment of anAlberta Relationship Threat Assessment and Management Initiative would provide an expertresource to professionally assess threats and their level of lethality, formulate mitigationstrategies and develop safety plans. This initiative is being coordinated with the FamilyJustice Strategy to ensure that these two initiatives support one another. 4.

SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES Municipal Affairs strives to fulfill its mandate of ensuring that Albertans live in safe, well-managed communities. Rapid growth, shifting demographics, reliance on technology, and the vulnerability of a resource-based economy all impact local government operations. Industry clustering, potential threats to security, complex regulatory frameworks andcompliance requirements, and a shortage of skilled labour are challenges that impact Municipal Affairs' business activities. The Ministry business plan includes strategies to respond to Albertans' priorities. Four opportunities and challenges have been identified that may affect business plan outcomes:Primary clients and stakeholders include municipalities and their related organizations and associations, organizations accredited under the Safety Codes Act , and industry-based safety and emergency management groups. The Ministry consults and works with the local government sector, delegated authorities, the public, industry, and other provincial and federalgovernment departments as an integral and ongoing part of its activities.303MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Relationships with Municipal PartnersAn opportunity exists for the Ministry to have a significant role in bringing increased efficiency and effectiveness to the services provided to Albertans from both the provincialand municipal orders of government through an enhanced focus on relationships between theProvince and municipalities and their associations. The Ministry will be working with itsmunicipal partners to identify ways to enhance these relationships through variousmechanisms, such as the Minister's Council on Municipal Sustainability. Challenges of Growth Many municipalities continue to face challenges as growth continues to intensify in parts ofthe province. Based on feedback from stakeholders, there is a need for the Ministry to workwith municipalities and other stakeholders to address broad planning and coordination issuesto maximize opportunities and minimize disputes. Challenges of Financial SustainabilityAs noted in the Rural Development Strategy, while some municipalities are growing, others are facing economic and demographic decline. There is a need for the Ministry to work withother ministries to determine what the province might do to work with these primarily small,urban and rural municipalities to assist them in exploring ways to deliver services within theconstraints of their resources.

This group may have different skills, abilitiesand expectations from current seniors. At the same time, the number of seniors aged 85 and over is expected to grow by 30per cent to 45,500 by 2016. As Albertans live longer and expect to remain in their communities, demand for housing andcommunity supports to maintain independence will continue to grow. Persons with disabilities are also living longer andtraditional seniors' services may not be well adapted for the needs of this group. The aging of parents/guardians andcaregivers will also significantly impact the way the Ministry provides supports and services. Rising Cost of Living Many of the Ministry's clients have relatively low or fixed incomes with limited capacity to adjust to the cumulative effectof rising living costs. The Consumer Price Index for lower-income households in Alberta increased by 15.1 per cent fromJanuary 2001 to February 2004, compared to 11.1 per cent for higher-income households. In addition, increases in itemssuch as utilities, gasoline and insurance impact the operating costs of agencies and organizations funded by the Ministry toprovide services to Albertans. Rising Cost of Health Care New and more effective drugs and advances in medical equipment can significantly improve people's lives. Drugs havebeen the fastest growing component of Canadian health care during the past 25 years. Advances in medical equipment, suchas power lifts, power beds, augmentative communication devices and prosthetics also contribute to rising health costs. Achallenge for the Ministry is to find ways to make these costly items more affordable for the Ministry's clients. Increasing Complexity of Needs The needs of the Ministry's clients have grown increasingly complex. Many require a range of coordinated supports andservices. Some have multiple and complex challenges, such as physical and developmental disabilities; addictions; mentalhealth issues; challenges related to aging; poverty; difficulty finding appropriate housing; and/or abuse. Shift to Community-Based Supports The shift from facility care to community-based care allows individuals to return home after shorter hospital stays or havetheir ongoing health and personal care needs met in their community where they may experience greater quality of life.However, this shift currently requires Albertans to absorb a significant portion of the costs of equipment, supplies, drugs,transportation and other items that would have previously been covered by facilities or through the acute care system. Thisshift requires flexible options for assisting Albertans with some of these costs. Community Inclusion There is a growing movement among persons with disabilities and seniors regarding the right to participate and be fullyincluded in all aspects of community life. Increasingly, the expectation of this movement is that government has aresponsibility to ensure that barriers to full inclusion and community participation are reduced. The Ministry recognizes thechallenge of balancing and sharing these responsibilities. Housing Pressures Higher housing prices, increased utilities costs and continued in-migration to the province have contributed to the highdemand for affordable housing. In addition, there is an increasing need for affordable and accessible housing for personswith disabilities. The private sector has shown a lack of interest in affordable housing due to higher profitability in privat e market housing. Many provincially-owned facilities targeted to lower-income Albertans are more than 25 years old andrequire repair and/or replacement. 326SENIORS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 The Ministry's mandate provides many opportunities to address needs, and coordinate programs, policies and resources to serve clients in a more comprehensive way. To support greater demands and rising expectations, the Ministry recognizesthe need to enhance its human resources, information technology systems and information resources. Through the Ministry's review of environmental factors, the following strategic priorities have been identified. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. 1. Seamless Services Linkage: Goals 1 to 7Key programs that serve seniors, persons with disabilities, and people in need of housing have been brought together under this ministry. Many of these programs serve the samepeople at different points in their lives, and frequently people are eligible for benefits andservices from more than one of the Ministry's programs. Many clients also receive servicesfrom more than one ministry. For Ministry clients, moving from one program to another, orapplying for additional programs for which they may be eligible should be smooth, simpleand seamless. The Ministry will work to streamline access to programs for Ministry clientsand build effective linkages with other government programs that serve them. 2. Quality Information Linkage: Goals 1 to 7Quality information assists people in making wise choices concerning housing, health services, end-of-life planning and other matters that affect their lives. It also helps toeducate the public and community agencies on issues and resources that impact theMinistry's diverse client base. The Ministry will review its information services to ensurethat information provided is clear, relevant, consistent, accurate, and accessible to those withalternate communication needs. 3. Sustainable Housing Linkage: Goals 4 and 5The Ministry will encourage public, private and non-profit housing sectors to work together to develop locally-based sustainable housing initiatives. These initiatives will includehousing for lower-income Albertans, persons with disabilities, and other Albertans who havedifficulty finding suitable housing within their means, such as those working in high-growth,high-cost areas. The Ministry will work with communities in finding innovative ways tohelp address specific local housing needs. One-time capital funding will be provided topublic, private and non-profit housing sectors for the development of housing that does notrequire ongoing operating subsidies.Partnerships Communities are becoming increasingly engaged in working collaboratively with the Ministry on issues and services thatimpact their citizens. Collaborative relationships with other levels of government have also grown, while collaboration withother ministries within Alberta continues to be an important focus of the Ministry's work. Such partnerships provideopportunities to tap expertise, build knowledge, share good practices and develop service approaches that result in the bestpossible outcomes for Albertans.327SENIORS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-094. Adult Protection Linkage: Goals 6 and 7The Ministry is responsible for a range of safeguards, for example, the Protection for Persons in Care Act, the Dependent Adults Act , and an Abuse Prevention and Response Protocol for persons with developmental disabilities. In addition, the Ministry assists infunding community agencies that provide accommodation for abused seniors. However,more needs to be done to enhance the safety of seniors, persons with disabilities, and adultswho receive government-funded care services from facilities such as hospitals, long-termcare and supportive living facilities. The Ministry will work with other ministries andstakeholders to examine adult protective mechanisms in Alberta and their impact on theMinistry's clients. In addition, standards and compliance mechanisms for accommodationservices will be established in supportive living and long-term care settings. 5. Leadership in Policy Linkage: Goals 1 to 7The consolidation within a single ministry of responsibility for such a diverse population provides a unique opportunity for the Ministry to take a leadership role in policy directions.Work will include liaising with community stakeholders to identify factors in the social andeconomic environment that impact the Ministry's clients. As well, collaboration with otherministries will contribute to government programs and policies that reflect the changingneeds of seniors, persons with disabilities and persons in need of housing supports. 6. Quality Continuing Care Linkage: Goals 1 to 6 The Ministry will support the shift to supportive living from long-term care accommodation by facilitating the development of affordable supportive living options, and maintainingquality supportive living and long-term care accommodation services. In addition, theMinistry will work to adjust long-term care accommodation rates in a fair and incrementalway. Seniors in need have access to financial benefits that will enable a secure and dignified way of living1GOAL ONECore Business One: Provide targeted financial and health-related benefits What it means Income is one of the major determinants of health and well-being. Income assistance programs help seniors to live with dignity by enabling them to make their own financial decisions, secure their basicliving needs, maintain their independence, and continue as participating and contributing members of thecommunity. The Alberta Seniors Benefit is an income-based program that provides monthly cash payments to eligible lower-income seniors to improve their financial situations. The Special Needs Assistance for Seniorsprogram provides a lump-sum cash payment to eligible seniors who demonstrate they are experiencingfinancial difficulties in meeting one-time, extraordinary expenses above their basic living requirements. Strategies 1.1 Provide a simplified, single point of entry for accessing income-based seniors' benefits. 1.2 Forecast, plan and model seniors' policies and programs to identify potential improvements to income- based seniors' benefits that are responsive to changing needs. 1.3 Develop consistent, accurate and client-focused information on programs and services for seniors.328SENIORS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-091.a Percentage of seniors provided with the opportunity to apply for the Alberta SeniorsBenefit. 99% 100% 100% 100% 1.b Assessment time in working days for Special Needs Assistance for Seniors programapplications. 12 days 12 days 11 days 10 days 1.c Satisfaction with information services provided by the Seniors Information Line. 92.7% 93% Number of working days between completed applications and decision for AISH applications. 30 25 24 23Performance Measure Last Actual (2004-05)Target 2006-07Target 2007-08Target 2008-09Albertans with a severe and permanent disability have access tofinancial benefits that assist them to live as independently aspossible2GOAL TWO Strategies 2.1 Continue to implement and evaluate the changes to the AISH program resulting from the 2004 AISH Review, and identify further program improvements to respond to client needs. 2.2 Continue analysis of current business applications and plan future information system solutions to facilitate effective planning and responsiveness to changing client needs. 2.3 Enhance mechanisms to assist persons with disabilities to manage their financial benefit.What it means Income is one of the major determinants of health and well-being, but some Albertans are unable to work to support themselves due to a severe and permanent disability. These Albertans need to be able to meettheir living needs, such as rent, food and clothing, as well as achieve their longer-term goals andaspirations. Through the Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) program, the Ministry provides a monthly living allowance so clients can meet their living needs and live as independently as possible. Inaddition, personal income support benefits help with extra monthly or one-time expenses incurred byAISH clients. An increasing number of Albertans are accessing these benefits. The benefits help AISHclients to live as independently as possible and be fully included in society.329SENIORS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09The Ministry's health-related supports and services enhance independence and well-being3GOAL THREE Strategies 3.1 Explore service delivery policies and eligibility criteria for health benefits across the Ministry and work towards a single point of entry for clients. 3.2 Collaborate with internal and external partners to help coordinate health-related benefits of AISH clients in a cost-effective manner. 3.3 Adjust delivery models to provide a range of health supports and services to contribute to the independence of Ministry clients. 3.4 Identify and implement a range of supports for informal caregivers of persons with disabilities. 3.5 Implement a pilot program to provide augmentative communication devices for persons with communication difficulties.What it means Health-related supports and services enhance well-being by enabling Ministry clients to maintain theirindependence in their homes or home-like settings. To support this goal, the Ministry provides a numberof programs and benefits, including the Alberta Aids to Daily Living program (AADL), health-relatedbenefits through the AISH program, dental and optical programs for seniors, and supports to family andother informal caregivers of persons with disabilities. AADL helps Albertans of all ages who have a long-term disability, chronic illness or terminal illness maintain their independence through the provision of hearing and communication devices;medical/surgical supplies; mobility equipment; prosthetics and orthotics; custom footwear and seating;and respiratory equipment. For seniors, the Ministry's dental and optical programs assist with the cost of dental treatment and eyeglasses. For AISH clients, health-related benefits include premium-free Alberta Health Care Insurance, eye and dental care, emergency ambulance services, prescription drugs, essential diabetic supplies, and exemptionfrom Alberta Aids to Daily Living co-pay fees. Family and other informal caregivers play a crucial role in assisting seniors and persons with disabilities. The Ministry works in partnership with community organizations and other government ministries toprovide supports to family and informal caregivers. 3.a Percentage of AADL clients who agreed that AADL helped them be more independent in theirhomes or residences. Survey conducted every two years.330SENIORS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Lower-income Albertans have access to a range of housing options4GOAL FOUR Strategies 4.1 Provide one-time capital funding and develop partnerships to increase the supply of sustainable, affordable housing. 4.2 Continue to make provincially-owned land available for affordable housing in high-growth communities such as Fort McMurray. 4.3 Encourage communities to take a lead role in developing community housing plans that identify a range of coordinated shelter and related services that promote the transition to independent living. 4.4 Work within the ministry, with other ministries, and with stakeholders such as regional health authorities to make supportive living an affordable alternative to long-term care for lower-income seniors andpersons with disabilities. 4.5 Work in partnership with housing operators to plan community supports in coordination with housing.What it means Albertans value their independence and want to have choice in how and where they live wherever possible. Lower-income Albertans may have difficulty meeting their housing needs, which can vary atdifferent stages of their lives. For example, disabilities, illness, conditions related to aging, orhomelessness all require different sorts of accommodation and supports. The cost of private-sectorhousing options is beyond the reach of many Albertans. These include those working for relatively lowwages in high-cost, high-growth areas of the province as well as many seniors and persons withdisabilities. The Ministry provides supports for a range of housing options that are intended to help people with lower incomes to either move toward independent living situations or remain as independent as possible in thecommunity. Housing options may include emergency and transitional housing, housing for persons withdisabilities, family housing, and supportive living. The Ministry works toward this goal by fundingemergency and transitional shelters, increasing the number of affordable and accessible housing units,supporting the development of supportive living options, and assisting with home adaptations to helppeople remain in their own homes. 4.a Number of affordable housing units developed with support from provincial funding. 1,162 360* Notes: * The reduction in the target is due to increased funding per unit. ** Funding for 2007-08 and 2008-09 has not been allocated. New measure: Number of affordable supportive living units for aging in place developed with support from provincialfunding. Baseline results will be reported in 2005-06 Annual Report.New measure under development: Number of working days on social housing wait list for applicants who are determined tobe in critical need. Core Business Two: Provide a range of housing options and supports for lower- income Albertans331 SENIORS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Housing programs are effectively managed and focused on those most in need5GOAL FIVE Strategies 5.1 Focus resources on maintaining aging provincially-owned housing. 5.2 Ensure that the Ministry's housing portfolio is operated according to acceptable standards. 5.3 Evaluate the effectiveness of affordable housing and supportive living projects that received capital assistance in meeting their goals and requirements of providing long-term affordable housing options. 5.4 Work with other ministries and stakeholders to develop and implement accommodation standards for supportive living and long-term care settings; establish monitoring and enforcement mechanisms; anddevelop a public information and reporting system. What it means Housing that is effectively managed results in greater responsiveness to individual needs, and improvedquality of housing and services provided to residents by the organizations that directly manage thehousing. These management services should be provided in a fiscally responsible manner. The Ministry is the steward of a housing portfolio that is managed through local management bodies. The Ministry works to ensure these management bodies are operating effectively and within legislativerequirements, and ensures adequate funding is in place to maintain housing facilities. In addition, theMinistry is responsible for developing, monitoring and enforcing accommodation standards for long-termcare facilities and supportive living settings, including seniors lodges; and for setting long-term careaccommodation rates. Quality of accommodation provided by housing operators, and where appropriate, services provided,as indicated by satisfaction of residents New measure under development: Quality of accommodation services provided in supportive living and long-term carefacilities, as indicated by the percentage of facilities reviewed that meet or exceed provincial standards. New measure under development: Effectiveness of management bodies in managing their budgets. What it means Participating in the community means being able to work, volunteer, take advantage of educational and recreational opportunities, and engage in other chosen activities. Many Albertans need support to beinvolved in these activities due to disability, illness or frailty. Seniors and persons with disabilities have access to supports that enable them to participate in community life6GOAL SIXCore Business Three: Provide and coordinate a range of supports for living in the community 332SENIORS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Strategies 6.1 Work with communities to strengthen their ability to support persons with disabilities in participating in and contributing to community life. 6.2 Work with other ministries and community organizations to enhance services and opportunities in areas such as transportation, post-secondary education, lifelong learning, volunteering and employment. 6.3 Renew the AISH delivery model to connect AISH clients to a range of supports and services to meet their needs and enhance their independence. 6.4 Invest in research and research-related initiatives that contribute to communities' abilities to include adults with disabilities. 6.5 Implement a new guardianship model to ensure better outcomes for dependent adults.6.6 Deliver a renewed public education campaign to encourage Albertans to plan for the future through personal directives. 6.a Satisfaction of families/guardians of persons with developmental disabilities with PDD-fundedservices 85.8% 89% n/a* 89% 6.b 82% 80%** 80%** 80%** Satisfaction with supports and decision-makingservices provided by the Office of the Ministry works in a number of ways to enhance the ability of persons with disabilities and seniors to participate in community life. The PDD Boards provide living, employment and community access supports for adults withdevelopmental disabilities. Albertans with disabilities receive community support services through the Brain InjuryInitiative and the Program Development for Persons with Disabilities Initiative. The Ministry leads the implementation ofthe recommendations of the Alberta Disability Strategy, and works with other ministries and community stakeholders toinfluence policies and programs that enhance seniors' independence and continuing participation in their communities. TheOffice of the Public Guardian supports private guardians and provides decision-making services for dependent adults, whenrequired. Notes: * Survey conducted every two years.** Private guardianship is preferred over public guardianship where possible and appropriate. Historical data indicates that t he appropriate ratio of private to public guardianship is approximately 80-20. *** Surveys were conducted in 2004-05 and 2005-06. Results of 2005-06 survey will be reported in 2005-06 Annual Report. Survey will be conducted biennially in subsequent years. New Measure: Satisfaction of dependent adults with supports and decision-making services provided by the Office of thePublic Guardian. Baseline results will be reported in 2005-06 Annual Report.New Measure: Percentage of persons with brain injury and/or other disabilities and their families/caregivers reporting theyfeel supported by Community Support Services. Baseline results will be report in 2005-06 Annual Report.333SENIORS AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Strategies 7.1 Review current legislation and policies relating to adult protection and develop options for improving safeguards. 7.2 Continue the legislative review of the Dependent Adults Act , the Personal Directives Act , and the Protection for Persons in Care Act . 7.3 Continue to improve the process of receiving and investigating complaints of abuse of adults receiving government-funded services. 7.4 In partnership with the community rehabilitation service sector, review and evaluate safeguards against mistreatment of individuals with developmental disabilities. 7.5 Continue the development of a comprehensive approach for government to address the complex issue of abuse of seniors. 7.6 Enhance the current role of the Office of the Public Guardian with private guardians including: providing support throughout the term of a court order, consultation and dispute resolution, monitoringand investigation of complaints and bringing forward urgent matters to the attention of the courts in aproactive way. What it means A safe and secure environment, where people are free from abuse and neglect, is important for well-beingand quality of life. The Ministry has a particular interest in addressing the safety and security needs ofadults who may be especially vulnerable to abuse and neglect, including persons with disabilities, olderadults, and persons who require the assistance of a guardian to make personal decisions. Through the Protection for Persons in Care Act , the Ministry investigates and responds to complaints of abuse of people receiving government-funded care services. The Dependent Adults Act and the Personal Directives Act include protective functions that help to preserve the rights, enhance decision-making, and prevent abuse of vulnerable adults. In addition, the PDD program has an Abuse Prevention and ResponseProtocol for addressing abuse of adults with developmental disabilities. The Ministry also works withother ministries to prevent and address abuse of seniors in their families and communities.The safety and security of seniors and persons with disabilities are enhanced7GOAL SEVEN Performance Measure New Measure: Percentage of persons involved in Protection for Persons in Care investigations satisfied with the investigation process.

LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN GOVERNMENT GOALS RELATING TO SOLICITOR GENERAL AND PUBLIC SECURITY While the Ministry's core businesses and goals align with and support a number of government goals and priorities, theMinistry plays a key role in Goal 10: Alberta will be a fair and safe place to work, live and raise families and Goal 6: Albertans will be self-reliant and independent and those unable to provide for their basic needs will receive help. STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS The Ministry is primarily linked to the fourth opportunity - Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and Visit. It willfocus on the continued reduction of violent crime by improving its commitment to policing and community policingprograms. The Ministry will also involve the communities, along with the private sector, families and individuals to buildsafer communities for Albertans. It will continue to urge the federal government to take steps that will better protect thecommunity from crimes of violence. World events have highlighted a need to provide security from threats of a globalnature. The Ministry will continue to focus on preparing for, responding to and recovering from major emergencies anddisasters at the provincial and local levels.339 SOLICITOR GENERAL AND PUBLIC SECURITY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES The recognition of trends, identification of new challenges, and awareness of changes in other socio-economic sectors must be considered in setting the strategic direction for the 2006-09 Solicitor General and Public Security Business Plan. Whilemany opportunities and challenges exist, the following issues have been identified as being significant for the Ministry. Policing In Alberta and the rest of Canada, a key challenge in policing centers on the question of whether police have the ability toobjectively and fairly investigate themselves when a public complaint is made against one of their own. Alberta recentlytook the opportunity to amend the Police Act to provide additional oversight powers and responsibilities at both the municipal and provincial levels. Organized Crime As society has become more technologically advanced, the types of illegal activities available for exploitation haveincreased significantly. Criminal organizations are not only involved in traditional activities such as the illegal drug trade , prostitution, money laundering and people smuggling, but also such activities as telefraud, internet crime, identity theft, andcredit card manufacturing. Core Businesses Policing, Crime Prevention and Response to Organized Crime Custody, Supervision and Rehabilitative Opportunities for Offenders Security Services Victim Programs and Services Promoting Safe and Secure Communities Key Program Areas Municipal Policing Grants Oversight and Assistance for Municipal Policing Provincial Policing Aboriginal Policing Special Constable Program Private Investigator and Security Guards Policing Standards and Evaluations Traffic Safety Initiatives Crime Prevention and Restorative Justice Adult Remand and Sentenced Custody Adult Community Supervision Young Offender Custody Young Offender Community Supervision Youth Justice Committee Program Aboriginal Correctional Programs Corrections Criminal Intelligence Unit Security Operations Protection Services Legislature Security Executive Security Security and Information Management (SIM) Victims Programs Victims Financial Benefits Support Services Aboriginal Justice Initiatives, Human Resource Services, Planning and Policy Services, Information Technology Services, Financial Services, Communications340SOLICITOR GENERAL AND PUBLIC SECURITY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Gangs are breeding grounds for organized crime. Organized crime crosses all boundaries, affects everyone, and presents increasing challenges for justice and law enforcement organizations. The economic and social impact of organized crime isenormous. Costs to health and social welfare programs, increases in insurance rates, consumer costs associated with creditcard fraud and theft, and the targeting of our youth in the ever expanding drug market are examples of how organized crimeimpacts the lives of every citizen in Alberta. Through the coordinated efforts of Criminal Intelligence Service Alberta andIntegrated Response to Organized Crime Unit, Alberta has the opportunity to combat organized crime. Illicit Drugs The impact of illicit drug use affects a person's physical health, society on the whole and the Alberta economy. Theprovince is facing challenges by the increased manufacturing and use of methamphetamines and marijuana grow operations.Theses activities pose significant threats to public health and safety through increased levels of violence from organizedcrime and their involvement in other areas that are funded by the profits from drug cultivation and manufacturing. It isestimated that 80 per cent of organized crime group's funding is from drug trafficking. Alberta is a leader in Canada when it comes to the response to methamphetamine and has taken the opportunity to network with other governments and stakeholders to address this growing problem. A cross-ministerial working group, in place sinceJuly 2003, has produced a comprehensive report on this issue and is currently implementing the recommendations of thatreport. Terrorism The nature of terrorism is changing and creates diverse challenges for both government and the private sector. Many factorsare driving this change, including the erosion of national borders, increasing ease of travel, and technological advancements.Preventing terrorist activity depends on opportunities for collection, analysis and dissemination of information andintelligence, and on cooperation between law enforcement jurisdictions, levels of government and the private sector. Thecontinued economic well-being of Alberta depends on our ability to manufacture and move trade commodities expedientlyand in a secure environment. Correctional Issues During the past several years there have been several significant changes in the Corrections environment that have createdunique challenges and opportunities. There are now more adult offenders serving a conditional sentence under supervisionin the community than there are offenders serving a custody sentence. As well, remand populations have been rising rapidlyfor several years and it is anticipated that this population will increase by 34 per cent over the next 3 years. These trends are not unique to Alberta. For Corrections, the rapidly rising remand population has placed significant strain on institutionalcapacity, which has potentially significant financial, operational and community safety implications. Child Sexual Exploitation The internet has substantially changed the nature of child sexual exploitation. It provides a perceived safe haven forperpetrators to exchange images of victims and share strategies on how to lure victims and avoid law enforcement.Protecting our children from exploitation continues to be a priority and challenge of the Ministry. To increase theopportunities to combat the exploitation and victimization of children, the Ministry announced the implementation of anIntegrated Child Exploitation Unit. Cyber Crime Cyber crime refers to the specific crimes dealing with networks and computers (hacking) and the facilitation of traditionalcrime through the use of a computer (child pornography, hate crimes, telemarketing/internet fraud). The increasing use ofthe internet in society has created an opportunity for new crimes such as identity theft, as well as more technologicallysophisticated methods for committing traditional crimes. One of the greatest challenges of cyber crime is that it can becommitted from any country in the world, many of which are not subject to Canada's legal jurisdiction. Partnerships among and between governments, law enforcement agencies, and the non-profit sector has created an opportunity to more effectively address the multi-faceted and multi-jurisdictional issues associated with cyber crimes.341 SOLICITOR GENERAL AND PUBLIC SECURITY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Family Violence Family violence continues to be a significant challenge in Alberta. In 2002, Alberta recorded the highest rates of spousalviolence against women in Canada (11 per cent as compared to Canada's rate of 8 per cent). Family violence affects theindividuals directly involved, children who witness it, and those in the community around them. It is critical to maintain the momentum started by the Alberta Roundtable on Family Violence and Bullying in 2004. The challenge is to ensure that programs, education, and training opportunities already developed receive sustainable fundingand are delivered as part of a coordinated and collaborative approach. Aboriginal Initiatives Aboriginal people are the youngest and fastest growing population in Alberta, with one-third of the Aboriginal population 14years of age or younger. The disproportionate representation of Aboriginal people at all stages in the criminal justicesystem, both as victims and offenders, continues to be a considerable challenge. Additionally, the rise of Aboriginal gangsand associated violence is of particular concern. The Ministry supports a number of initiatives that provide opportunities to address Aboriginal issues including First Nations policing and victim services, Aboriginal crime prevention and restorative justice initiatives, Aboriginal cultural and spiritua l correctional centre programs, Aboriginal youth justice committees, cultural awareness training to Ministry staff, andAboriginal community corrections programs. Crime Prevention and Restorative Justice During the 1999 Alberta Summit on Justice, greater community involvement in crime prevention and public safety wasconclusively recommended. Summit recommendations included greater victim participation and offender accountability injustice processes. Reintroduction of the Alberta Community Crime Prevention and the Alberta Community RestorativeJustice grant programs enhances the Ministry's ability to support community participation in addressing local crimeconcerns. The community need for sustainable funding and emerging crime issues such as identity theft, vehicle theft orsocial issues such as child sexual exploitation, family violence and bullying continue to challenge the Ministry as a leader incommunity safety and public security. Victims of Crime One of the challenges of crime is that it affects not only the victim, but also society as a whole. While victims of crime maysuffer physical, emotional and financial losses, the cost to society for victims' health needs, policing and the criminal justi ce system continues to be a challenge. In Alberta, 98 per cent of municipal Police and RCMP detachments have access to avictim services unit. These units provide a range of services including providing information about the status of the policeinvestigation and any criminal court proceedings, practical assistance, courtroom support and information about availableprograms and services. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of external and internal challenges, the strategic priorities described below have been identified. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. Each strategic priority is linked to the Ministry goals they support. 1. Policing Linkage: Goal 1A Ministry priority is to ensure that police have the necessary resources to meet both existing and emergent crime and public safety challenges in an increasingly dangerousenvironment and that the police operate under effective civilian oversight. 2. Leading Practices Linkages: Goals 1, 2, 3 and 4Consistent with the Ministry's on-going commitment to ensuring public safety, the Ministry will bring increased focus on ensuring that correctional, policing, and security servicesreflect international best or leading practices.342SOLICITOR GENERAL AND PUBLIC SECURITY BUSINESS PLAN 2006-093. Correctional Services Linkage: Goal 2In order to bring greater efficiency and transparency to the entire spectrum of correctional services, the Ministry will engage federal correctional officials in discussions surroundingthe potential integration of currently shared program delivery responsibility. 4. Traffic Safety Linkage: Goal 1As part of the on-going commitment to safe homes and communities for all Albertans, the Ministry will use a coordinated approach with law enforcement and other stakeholders toreduce traffic deaths and injuries. 5. Emerging Technology Linkages: Goals 1 and 3 Based on the Ministry's Information Technology Strategic Plan, the Ministry will enhance operations internally to maximize emerging technology to support the core businesses andgoals of the Ministry. The Ministry will work with public security agencies to maximizeopportunities for information sharing, and will coordinate a major upgrade ofcommunications capabilities for public security agencies across the province by utilizing themost current proven technology. 6. Victims of Crime Linkage: Goal 4Further to the approved recommendations of the MLA Report of the Alberta Victims of Crime Consultation, the Ministry will develop and enhance programs and services for victims. Provide leadership in policing and services that promote safe communities1GOAL ONECORE BUSINESSES, GOALS, STRATEGIES & PERFORMANCE MEASURES Core Business One: Policing, Crime Prevention and Response to Organized Crime Ensuring safe communities in Alberta by ensuring adequate and effective policing, by targeting organized crime, and by developing and promoting crime prevention programs. What it means The Ministry oversees policing throughout the province, provides a provincial police service (through theRCMP), assists municipalities with their policing costs through the provision of municipal policinggrants, and works with police and other agencies to develop, support or operate effective programs thatspecifically target organized and serious crime.

[Original Signed]David Coutts, Minister of Sustainable Resource Development February 28, 2006 THE MINISTRY The Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development consists of the Department of SustainableResource Development; the Natural Resources Conservation Board; the Surface RightsBoard; the Land Compensation Board; and the Environmental Protection and EnhancementFund. Working with other ministries, and within a strategic framework defined by 11 Actsand associated regulations, the Ministry provides leadership on integrated resource policy,resource allocation, and resource stewardship and assurance. The Ministry strives to achievebalance among differing uses and advance a consensus-based approach to meet the currentneeds without compromising resource use by future generations. As the primary manager ofpublic lands, the Ministry works with industry sectors, communities, and other stakeholdersto provide opportunities that support prosperity. As stewards, the Ministry promotesrespectful use of the province's natural resources through partnerships with resource users.BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09350SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09VISION Alberta's lands, forests, fish and wildlife benefit present and future Albertans.MISSION Sustainable Resource Development encourages balancedand responsible use of Alberta's natural resources throughthe application of leading practices in management, science,and stewardship. LINK TO THE GOVERNMENT OF ALBERTA STRATEGIC BUSINESS PLAN SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES Maintaining Alberta's dynamic economy over the long term is the direct result of the sustainable management of theprovince's natural resources. This management requires balance among the environmental, economic and social benefitsthat Albertans receive from these resources. Viewing natural resources and environment as inter-related parts of a system iskey to achieving success in sustainable resource management. Challenges influencing the strategic direction of the Ministry include:Alberta's Busy Landscape: A broad... consensus exists that the once-open frontier has closed, that Alberta's finite land base and its stock of natural capital are under mounting pressure from population growth and economic developmentand that the pressure will only intensify in the years to come . 1 Resource development will continue to be a vital part of the Alberta economy into the foreseeable future. To support their economic viability and growth, many industry sectors (oil and gas, forestry, agriculture, tourism) require increasingand secure access to public land and the associated natural resources. At the same time, the public has an interest inaccessing public land for a spectrum of non-consumptive and consumptive (such as fishing and hunting) recreationalactivities. 1Canada West Foundation, Managing Prosperity: Developing a Land Use Framework for Alberta, July 20052006-09 Government of Alberta Strategic Business Plan Goals2006-09 Sustainable Resource Development Business Plan Goals Goal 1 - Alberta will have a diversified and prosperous economy Strategic Opportunity - Unleashing InnovationGoal 1 - Alberta's public lands, including rangelands, are healthy, productive and sustainable Goal 6 - Timely and impartial decisions on resource development and confined feeding operations are made in the public interest Goal 3 - Alberta's international competitiveness will be enhanced Strategic Opportunity - Competing in a Global MarketplaceGoal 4 - Alberta's forests support a competitive and sustainable forest sector Goal 10 - Alberta will be a fair and safe place to work, live andraise families Goal 11 - The high quality of Alberta's environment will be sustained Strategic Opportunity - Making Alberta the Best Place to Live, Work and VisitGoal 2 - Alberta's forests and forest communities are protectedfrom wildfiresGoal 3 - Alberta's forests and forest landscapes support healthyecosystems and vibrant communities Goal 5 - Alberta's fish and wildlife resources and their habitats are healthy, productive and sustainable Goal 14 - Alberta will have a supportive and sustainableinfrastructure that promotes growth and enhances quality of life Relates to Goals 1-5 listed above351 SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Alberta's current land use policies were developed in a period of resource abundance. Current growth trends in industry sectors and in Alberta's population put considerable pressures on the finite public resources challenging the Ministry'sability to reach and support informed, integrated resource management decisions. The forecast for continued growth hascreated a need for the Government of Alberta to adapt the province's land use framework. This will provide the tools toresolve an increasing and often conflicting competition for the allocation and use of public lands, and to value naturalresources according to their ecological, social and economic contributions to Alberta. Natural Environmental Trends: Sustainable Resource Development is constantly challenged to adjust its programs and management strategies to address changing environmental conditions over which the Ministry has little or no control.Recent flooding across the province has affected fish and wildlife populations and their natural communities. Theseverity of pest outbreaks such as mountain pine beetle, spruce budworm, and grasshoppers are dependent on climatevariability and will have significant impact on how the Ministry manages the landscape. A significant natural challenge is the mountain pine beetle, the most destructive insect pest of mature pine forests in North America. Mature pine forests along the eastern slopes, especially by the Alberta/British Columbia and Alberta/UnitedStates borders, are most vulnerable to mountain pine beetle attack. The mountain pine beetle's impact has become alandscape issue, extending into the areas of natural resource industry, biodiversity, watersheds, wildfire management andpublic land use. In addition to infesting the lodge pole pine, there is a significant probability that, without a major effortto control and mitigate the entry of the mountain pine beetle into the province, the insect could attack other coniferspecies (i.e., jack pine) and spread across the country into Eastern Canada. Resource Sector Sustainability: Natural resource industries require regulatory regimes to ensure reliable and fair market access. A significant trend in the world marketplace has been the requirement for resource industries to demonstrate thesustainability of their business practices. Within the forest sector, this trend has translated into requirements forcertification that demonstrate sustainable forest management practices. A challenge for the Ministry is to ensure that itspolicy, legislative and regulatory frameworks support and facilitate progress to ensure natural resource industrysustainability. These efforts should capture the principle of stakeholder engagement and provide information about howcompanies and communities can work together to design successful and mutually beneficial projects. Arising from these challenges are opportunities to demonstrate leadership in managing Alberta's public natural resources to support vibrant communities, competitive industry, and a healthy environment. Opportunities that Sustainable Resource Development will explore in 2006-09 include: Shared Outcomes: Sustainable Resource Development, in co-operation with Alberta Energy and Alberta Environment, will implement the Sustainable Resource and Environmental Management Framework to achieve government-widesustainable resource and environmental management outcomes. Innovative partnerships, processes and tools will beidentified to deliver the actions that best contribute to the desired outcomes and objectives of sustainable resourcemanagement. Integrated Policies, Standards, Information Systems and Responsibility: Through the use of integrated management approaches like the Sustainable Resource and Environmental Management Framework, Sustainable ResourceDevelopment will: minimize the industrial footprint on the landscape, support future resource-based opportunities, and maintain ecological integrity and biodiversity; harmonize sustainable resource and environmental management standards that use an integrated cross-ministry approach and a formalized stakeholder consultation process; 352SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2006-09 Through the Ministry's review of external and internal challenges, the strategic priorities described below have been identified. These are in addition to the important ongoing core activities of the Ministry. 1. Using and Respecting the Land Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6A provincial Land Use Framework will be developed with a new approach to land management that allows the government to ensure that the province's land base is used aseffectively as possible, recognizing traditional and different possible users, for the benefit ofall Albertans. 2. Sustainable Resource and EnvironmentalManagementFramework Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5The framework will achieve outcome-based management systems, integrated sustainable resource and environmental management policies, and streamlined regulatory processes.Key components of the framework include: Resource Information Systems - Integrate environmental and resource information systems to enable easy access to data and information required across government by industry,stakeholders, and the public. Integrated Land Management - Develop and implement policies, guidelines and practices that work towards minimizing the industrial, commercial and recreational footprint on publiclands. 3. Stewardship Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5The Ministry will enhance its promotion of a stewardship ethic with partners, shareholders and industry through public education and outreach programs. 4. Rural Development Strategy Linkage: Goals 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6Alberta's Rural Development Strategy will provide a framework for initiatives, programs and policies that will help sustain the province's rural communities. The Ministry will work tomaintain or improve Alberta's air, water and soil for the well-being of current and futuregenerations through essential policy, legislation, information and services related to soilconservation, water quality, range management, climate change, and biodiversity. 5. Biodiversity Strategy Linkage: Goals 1, 2, 3, and 5Alberta's natural advantage will be maintained through the development of an Alberta approach to biodiversity and endangered species management. provide environmental and resource information systems within government and with external information providers that enable easy access to data and information required across government by industry, stakeholders and the public;and assign responsibility, authority and accountability for the full lifecycle of each natural resource project/activity to a single regulator. Public Education and Outreach: Sustainable Resource Development will pursue an outreach program to provide Alberta's youth, educators, resource sector clients, the media and the general public with information on sustainable andresponsible resource management and use practices, Ministry programs, and changes in legislative requirements.353 SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09CORE BUSINESSES, GOALS, STRATEGIES & PERFORMANCE MEASURES The Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development delivers four core businesses. The Department of Sustainable Resource Development is responsible for three core businesses: Lands, Forests, and Fish and Wildlife. These three core businessesare delivered through the divisions of Forest Protection, Fish and Wildlife, Public Lands and Forests, and Strategic ForestryInitiatives, with support from Strategic Corporate Services, Policy and Planning, Human Resources, and Communications. Core Business 1, Lands , integrates leading planning and management practices to develop common goals for the use of Alberta's public lands that cross multiple stakeholders and demands. This \"place-based\" stewardship approach to naturalresource management combines the efforts of other ministries toward achieving the goal of sustaining the benefits Albertansreceive from their natural resources. Core Business 2, Forests , ensures the multiple benefits received from the province's forests are realized by utilizing a combination of leading forest management, forest wildfire protection and forest industry practices to provide leadership andoversight in the management of Alberta's forests. Core Business 3, Fish and Wildlife , manages fish and wildlife species based on the best available science and integrated decision-making processes that generate new information for informed, future decision-making. The sound stewardship offish and wildlife resources facilitates consumptive (fishing and hunting) and non-consumptive recreational opportunitiescompatible with healthy, diverse fish and wildlife populations. Core Business 4, Land, Access and Compensation Boards , is the purview of the Ministry's three boards, which are guided by specific legislation that provide them with their mandates. While these boards report to the Minister of SustainableResource Development, they make their formal decisions independently, in accordance with their governing legislation.The Natural Resources Conservation Board conducts independent public reviews of projects that may affect the naturalresources of Alberta and also regulates new or expanding confined feeding operations. The Surface Rights Board conductshearings when an operator and a landowner or an occupant fail to reach an agreement regarding entry or compensationrelated to resource activity on privately owned or occupied public lands. The Land Compensation Board is responsible forpolicies and procedures for situations where a landowner's property is expropriated by a public authority. Alberta's public lands, including rangelands, are healthy, productive, and sustainable1GOAL ONECore Business One: Lands What it means Alberta's public lands are managed to optimize their current and long-term economic, environmental and social values within the context of sound resource management decision-making to facilitate the optimumbalance of the multiple activities occurring on it.

The plan sets out specific investmentobjectives, goals and strategies to achieve the Heritage Fund's objectives as expressed in the legislation. MISSION The mission of the Heritage Fund is to provide prudent stewardship of the savings from Alberta's non-renewable resourcesby providing the greatest financial returns on those savings for current and future generations of Albertans.1 BACKGROUND AND FISCAL CONTEXT The Heritage Fund was created in 1976 to save a portion of non-renewable resource revenue. The Heritage Fund grew from a portion of Alberta's oil and gas revenue being deposited into the Fund from inception until 1987. As well, priorto 1982, the Heritage Fund retained its income. On January 1, 1997, the Heritage Fund was restructured in response to a public review and, after a transition period, is now an endowment fund. The restructuring included a new governance structure as well as the establishment of newinvestment objectives and performance measures. Public consultation on the future mandate of the Heritage Fund was conducted in the form of a survey mailed to all Alberta households in 2002. The survey confirmed the importance of the Heritage Fund as an endowment,underscoring the need to preserve its real value over the long term. The Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund Act includes a provision to retain a portion of the Heritage Fund's income in the Fund to protect its real value. Regular inflation-proofing of the Heritage Fund commenced in 2005-06. Assets and income of the Heritage Fund are fully consolidated with the assets and revenue of the Province. All income earned during a fiscal year is transferred to the General Revenue Fund (GRF), except for amounts retained for inflationproofing. In accordance with the Access to the Future Act , additional assets will be allocated to the Access to the Future endowment within the Heritage Fund, up a maximum of $3 billion. An amount equal to 4\u00bd percent of the endowmentwill be allocated annually to the Access to the Future Fund from the General Revenue Fund to enhance advancededucation opportunities for Albertans. An initial allocation of $750 million has been made to the Heritage Fund forthis purpose in 2005-06. 1Preamble to the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund Act .HERITAGE FUND STRUCTURE AND INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE TheAlberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund Act created an endowment with the objective of maximizing long-term financial returns. The Act requires the Minister of Finance, when making investments, to adhere to investment and lending policies,standards and procedures that a reasonable and prudent person would apply in respect of a portfolio of investments to avoidundue risk of loss and obtain a reasonable return that will enable the endowment to meet its objectives. GOALS, INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES What it means The Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund Act provides for the maintenance of the Fund's real value by requiring the Heritage Fund to be inflation-proofed. Investments must be made with the objective of maximizing long-term financial returns. Equities have typically provided investors with higher historical total returns (current income and capital appreciation) than fixed income investments, and therefore constitute a significant proportion of the portfolio. Strategy In accordance with the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund Act , retain a portion of Heritage Fund income equal to the value of the Fund at the end of the fiscal year multiplied by the percentage increase in the Canadian gross domestic product price index. This will ensure that the Heritage Fund grows with inflation over time. What it means Heritage Fund income is included in consolidated revenue of the province. Consequently, the level and variability of Heritage Fund income is important to the government's fiscal plan. However, the benefit of long-term capital appreciation is also desired. The Heritage Fund is invested in a diversified portfolio that includes fixed income securities, Canadian equities, US equities, non-North American equities, private equity and income investments, absolute returnstrategies, timberland and real estate. The Fund is invested to generate long-term returns to assist in supporting the Province's income and spending needs. It is widely accepted that a prudent mix of interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and alternative asset classes best achieves the objective of optimizing financial returns as it provides enhanced expected returns and diversifies risk. While income may fluctuate from year to year, over a five-year period it is reasonable to expect income forecasts to be met. The following strategies, expected outcomes and performance measures pertain to both Goals 1 and 2. 364 364 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-091GOAL ONEPreserve the real value of assets 2GOAL TWOAchieve budgeted cumulative income forecasts during a 5-year planning horizon365 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Strategies Implement the policy asset mix as per the Heritage Fund's Investment Policy Statement. The asset mix was based on the conclusion of a 2003 asset mix study and a review of current market conditions and new investment products.See Table 1 for the current policy allocation of the Heritage Fund. Increase investments in non-traditional asset classes. Increasing exposure to non-traditional asset classes (e.g. absolute return strategies and private investments) can create a portfolio with improved risk/return trade-offs even after the additional investment costs associated with these assets are taken into account. Reduce Canadian fixed income and public equity investments. These investments will be gradually reduced to accommodate the increase in non-traditional asset classes. Review, and if deemed appropriate, add new investment products to potentially enhance return and reduce the total risk of the portfolio. Vary the allocation of assets to enhance returns. Based on the outlook for financial markets, Alberta Investment Management may vary the allocation of liquid assets to enhance returns.366366 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09TABLE 1: Current Policy Allocation and Policy Benchmarks Actual as of Dec. 31, Allocation Policy Benchmark 2005 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 Cash & Absolute Return Strategies Money Capital 91-Day Treasury Bill 0.6% 2% 1% 1% 5% 30.4% 33.0% 29.0% 29.0% 29.0% Inflation SensitiveReal Estate Property Index 10.7% 10.0% 10.0% 15.0% 15.0%Non-North American East 16.5% 15.0% Active Currency Overlay2-5 % 5 % 5 % 5 % Absolute Return Strategies Overlay3-5 % 5 % 5 % 5 % 1In the 2005-08 Business Plan Policy Portfolio, the 5% allocation to Private Equities included allocations to both Private Equit ies and Private Income. However, the breakdown between Private Equities and Private Income was not separately disclosed. 2Allocations to active currency overlays are shown as targeted notional exposure. These strategies have notional exposure to various currencies, but generally have near zero net exposure. 3Absolute return strategy overlays are investments in absolute return strategies that are used in conjunction with public equity indices to enhance portfolio returns. Continue to practice responsible investing by investing in companies that operate legally and in countries that maintain normal trade relations with Canada. Also, use proxy voting to advance good governance and management practices. 367 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09Expected Outcomes Income forecasts are achieved on a cumulative basis over five years. Real value of assets is preserved over a 20-year horizon. The Heritage Fund policy asset mix is expected to generate a real rate of return of 4.5% at an acceptable level of risk over a moving five-year period. Active management will add 50 basis points (0.50%) of value above the stated benchmark return, over a moving 5-year period. Performance Measures The market value rate of return of the policy benchmark will be compared against the Consumer Price Index (CPI) plus 4.5% to determine whether the investment policy is achieving the returns expected based on long-term capitalmarket assumptions. The actual market value rate of return will be compared against the policy benchmark return to determine the impact of fund management on performance using the appropriate policy benchmarks for each asset class. Alberta Investment Management will seek to add 50 bps (0.50%) of value per year (after fees are deducted) over afive-year investment horizon. See Table 1 for the corresponding benchmark for each asset class and Appendix A for a description of each benchmark. Achieve sustained, real market value of assets. Achieve income forecasts over a 5-year planning horizon. RISKS TO GOALS, INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES Investment returns and income will vary significantly from year to year for the following reasons: The well-established capital market principle that increased expected returns are accompanied by increased risk. An investment policy to maximize long-term returns implies a weighting towards investments in equities. Equities have historically provided investors with higher total returns (dividends and capital gains) than fixed incomeinvestments; however, dividend yields in general are lower than interest rates. An equity portfolio will provide lowercurrent income while the magnitude and timing of realizing capital gains is uncertain. Given a well-implemented private equities program, private equities can provide investment returns above those of public equities. However, by their nature, private equity investments are highly illiquid and are associated with aninvestment horizon of five to ten years to realize investment gains. Some private equity investments are subject topotentially large or total investment losses. Absolute returns strategies have gained prominence in recent years with an expectation of stable returns. However, this market is very fragmented, with many different strategies and investment fees above those of traditional managers. Insome cases, there have been large losses sustained in the industry by otherwise well informed and highly professionalinvestors. Manager selection and oversight are therefore critical to successful implementation. To better manage risks, Alberta Investment Management is in the process of implementing a comprehensive risk management program based on value-at-risk.368368 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09ACCOUNTABILITY TO ALBERTANS What it means Results from the Looking Forward survey confirm Albertans want a strong, healthy Heritage Fund that is used primarily for savings. Ongoing communication through published reports and news releases will ensure Albertans remain aware of the performance of the Heritage Fund. Strategies Release quarterly and annual reports on a timely basis in simple, understandable language. Release summary reports of the Heritage Fund's investment activities and results for Albertans on a timely basis. Publish the Heritage Fund Business Plan annually. The Legislature's Standing Committee will hold annual public accountability meetings around Alberta to report on the Heritage Fund's results and to answer questions on the Fund's performance. Expected Outcome Improved understanding by Albertans of the management, operations, investment philosophy and performance of the Heritage Fund. Performance Measures Timeliness of reports and public accountability meetings. Knowledge of Albertans regarding information provided about the Heritage Fund. Annual report will be released by June 30 of each year. Quarterly reports will be released within two months after the conclusion of the quarter. Albertans are satisfied with their knowledge of the Heritage Fund, with 50% able to estimate the Fund's value.3GOAL THREEEnsure the transparency of the Heritage Fund's objectives and results for Albertans369 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY The mission and investment objectives for the Heritage Fund have been established in legislation and are summarized above. A Standing Committee of the Legislature has been created by legislation and has the following responsibilities: To review and approve annually the business plan for the Heritage Fund; To receive and review quarterly reports on the operation and results of the Heritage Fund; To approve the annual report of the Heritage Fund; To review after each fiscal year end the performance of the Heritage Fund and report to the Legislature as to whether the mission of the Heritage Fund is being fulfilled; and To hold public meetings with Albertans on the investment activities and results of the Heritage Fund. The Minister of Finance is responsible for the operation of the Fund. The Endowment Fund Policy Committee advises the Minister of Finance by reviewing and recommending for approval the business plan, quarterly and annual reports, and the investment policies for the Heritage Fund. The Committeeincludes a majority of private sector members with relevant financial and business expertise. The Policy and Strategic Planning Division of Alberta Finance is responsible for providing investment policy support for the Heritage Fund to the Minister of Finance and the Endowment Fund Policy Committee. Alberta Investment Management, the investment operations group of Alberta Finance, makes ongoing investment decisions. Alberta Investment Management uses external managers for certain investments that have the potential togenerate high returns but require specialized resources. The Auditor General is the auditor of the Heritage Fund. When making investments, Alberta Investment Management, acting on behalf of the Minister of Finance, will adhere to investment and lending policies, standards and procedures that a reasonable and prudent person would apply inrespect of a portfolio of investments to avoid undue risk or loss and obtain a reasonable return that will enable theHeritage Fund to meet its objectives. Therefore, the Fund is not to be used for economic development or socialinvestment purposes.370370 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09INCOME AND EXPENSES Capital gains and losses on traditional investments are not recognized as income until the investment is sold or, given a significant loss, is written down. Therefore, gains and losses that are included in reported rates of return may not beimmediately reflected in realized income. In contrast, income and expenses on equity index swaps are accrued asearned, resulting in gains and losses being realized as income as they occur. The income forecasts include: Interest income; Dividend income; Capital gains or losses only when they are realized, such as when an investment is sold or written down; and Income and expense on index swaps and interest rate swaps accrued as earned. The income forecasts do not include unrealized capital gains. The Heritage Fund records investments at cost, which exclude unrealized gains and losses. The fair value of investments in provided for information purposes. CICA publicsector standard setters are currently reviewing the issues surrounding the accounting and reporting of financialinstruments at fair value for governments. Following are current forecasts of Heritage Fund income based on the assumptions noted. Actual results will vary from projected income depending on the extent to which actual interest rates and equity market returns vary from theassumptions used.

If equity returns are lower than assumed, accounting investment income will be lower depending on the extent of the decrease in equity returns and the amount and timing of turnover in the equity portion of the Heritage Fund. 2. If interest rates increase, the market price of bonds held by the Heritage Fund would typically decline. Accounting investment income will decrease depending on the extent of the interest rate increase and the amount and timing ofturnover in the fixed income portion of the Heritage Fund.372372 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09EXPENSE FORECAST The preceding forecasts of income for the Heritage Fund are gross of estimated direct investment expenses. Estimated investment expenses are as follows: TABLE 5: Heritage Fund Expense Forecast1 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 ($ millions) Direct Management Costs 2.8 2.9 3.1Externally Managed Investment Pools 31.5 33.7 36.1 Internally Managed Investment Pools 6.9 8.0 8.4 TOTAL 41.2 44.6 47.6 As a % of Fair Value 0.27% 0.28% 0.29% 1Due to factors such as differences in assumed and actual experience in asset class allocations and growth in the size of the He ritage Fund, actual expenses may differ from forecasted expenses. Administrative expenses include both direct and indirect administrative expenses, which include staff time, supplies and services, investment service costs and advisory services. The forecast increase in costs is due to increased staff and systems costs, increased size of the fund, and increased allocation to non-traditional asset classes (absolute return strategies and private investments), which are more costly tomanage.373 ALBERTA HERITAGE SAVINGS TRUST FUND BUSINESS PLAN 2006-09APPENDIX A Description of Benchmark Indices for the Heritage Fund Scotia Capital 91-day T-Bills Index (SC T-Bills Index) The T-Bill Index measures the performance of the Canadian money market.
