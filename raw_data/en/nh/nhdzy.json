I hope we can do better this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that September and October are the best times for most people to get vaccinated. This season, the vaccines have been updated with an influenza A (H1N1) component. One choice is egg-based; the other is cell-based. And, while there's an approved nasal spray for non-pregnant, healthy folks ages 2 to 49, I don't think it is efficacious and would suggest you don't use it. Children who need two doses of vaccine should get their first shot as soon as the vaccine becomes available; the second dose at least four weeks after the first. If your child previously got two doses of flu vaccine at any time, only one dose is needed this season. Seniors have three choices of Quadrivalent Vaccine. Why bother? During 2019-2020, flu vaccines prevented an estimated 7.5 million cases, 105,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 6,300 influenza-associated deaths. And a 2022 study showed that flu vaccination reduced children's risk of severe life-threatening influenza by 75%. Bonus: Three studies show that getting flu shots 10 years in a row powerfully decreases inflammation, slashing the risk of heart attack by over 30% in the following year and all causes of death in that 10 year period by over 20%. So give it shot. How to protect your child from a peanut allergy An estimated 2.5% of kids in the U.S. contend with a peanut allergy and around 100 children a year die from an anaphylactic reaction to the legume. Two warning signs that a child may be allergic to peanuts are if he or she has an egg allergy or allergic eczema, which affects nearly 20% of children, 30% of whom go on to develop food allergies. Unfortunately, other times, there is little warning. The good news is that early exposure to peanuts prevents development of a peanut allergy \u2014 when it's done carefully and correctly. A study by the Cleveland Clinic confirms what the LEAP (Learning Early about Peanut) study revealed: Early exposure to peanuts can reduce the prevalence of peanut allergy in high-risk kids by up to 86%. Through the Clinic's Food Allergy Center of Excellence, 22 kids, 7 to 11 months old, received peanut oral immunotherapy, starting on a daily dose of 18 milligrams of peanut protein (about twice the weight of a grain of table salt). Over six months, they were slowly given larger daily servings \u2014 reaching 500 milligrams, the equivalent of two peanut kernels. All 22 babies were able to increase peanut exposure to 500 milligrams, more than half experienced mild allergic reactions that resolved on their own, and only one required epinephrine to control anaphylaxis. If you have concerns that your child may be at risk for developing a peanut allergy, work with an expert in safe prevention of peanut allergies \u2014 don't try to do it on your own. Meet alpha-gal \u2014 the tick-borne meat allergy You've heard of an alpha male, well now there's alpha-gal \u2014 syndrome, that is. It's a tick-bite-caused allergy to meat and other products that come from mammals, such as dairy, and even to some pharmaceuticals, like the cancer drug cetuximab. The main source of the allergy is the bite of a lone star tick, common in the Midwest, South and mid-Atlantic areas of the country. And it's estimated that up to 450,000 folks in the U.S. may have contracted alpha-gal since 2010. Alpha-gal syndrome can cause symptoms that range from a mild rash or gastrointestinal upset to life-threatening anaphylaxis (that's why you need to carry an Epi-pen if you are diagnosed). If you find that you're having such reactions two to six hours after eating meat or dairy, ask your doctor for a blood test to see if you have the condition. Many doctors won't think of alpha-gal as a possible cause of your symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fully 42% of 1,500 doctors surveyed had never heard of alpha-gal syndrome and 35% said they were not confident in their ability to detect or treat the illness. So be on the alert for tick bites \u2014 and make sure to always use a repellant with 10%-30% DEET, wear long socks or pants when you're in grassy, wooded, or rural areas, and do a skin check before you go back indoors. You know I think you should eliminate all red meats from your diet \u2014 but this is not the way to learn to do it. More reasons to avoid all added sugar Def Leppard wailed \"Pour Some Sugar on Me,\" but if the band knew the risks that sugar posed, not just to their love life, but their life itself, they may not have been so enthusiastic about getting more of the sweetener. Two studies reinforce what I have been saying for years \u2014 added sugar is one of the most harmful food additives, fueling inflammation, chronic diseases like diabetes, heart woes, and sexual dysfunction, and causing premature aging inside and out. The first is an epidemiologic study published in JAMA that found that when postmenopausal women had one or more sugar-sweetened drinks a day, they were 78% more likely to develop liver cancer and die from chronic liver disease than women who had three or fewer sweetened beverages monthly. Not as solid as a randomized, controlled trial would be, but the degree of increase in risk makes one believe it may reflect reality. The second epidemiologic study, released in Frontiers in Nutrition, found that participants who got more than 25% of their total calorie intake (yikes, that's enormous!) from added sugar were 88% more likely to develop kidney stones compared to folks who got only 5% of their calories from added sugars. Again, not a randomized controlled study, but the difference in risks is so great that where there's smoke there may be fire. So, ditch sweetened beverages and foods with added sugars and tune into LongevityPlaybook.com for solid information on how to live younger longer \u2014 and the great tasting foods and drinks that will help you do that. Aromatherapy can boost your memory Researchers say there are around 400 types of smell (AKA olfactory) receptors in your nose and it's their job to detect an enormous array of scents \u2014 from stinky to soothing. You know that wonderful aroma of fresh-brewed coffee that greets you every morning? Well, it's the result of 800 distinct types of molecules that travel from your cup to your smell receptors. With such complex activity going on in your olfactory nerves, it's no wonder research shows that loss of smell is associated with declining cognition and Alzheimer's. But new research by University of California, Irvine neuroscientists found that wafting essential oils (using a diffuser) into the bedroom of folks ages 65+ for two hours a night for six months boosted their cognition by 226%. The study used seven different oils, one each night over the course of a week. So what is aromatherapy? It's the use of essential oils, such as lavender, Ylang Ylang, jasmine, lemongrass, and patchouli, to waft a scent throughout a room. As the molecules of aroma reach your brain, they affect what is called the limbic system, which impacts memory, blood pressure, breathing and emotions. The aromas' potent benefits do come with potential risks for some folks, including people with allergies, asthma and those who are pregnant or have high blood pressure. And no one should ever use them full strength on skin or orally. So, ask your doctor about giving this memory-booster a try using a diffuser, and check out \"11 Essential Oils: Their Benefits and How to Use Them,\" at My.ClevelandClinic.org.
