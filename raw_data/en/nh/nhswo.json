Find out more about the [types of cholesterol.](#WHAT) Anyone can develop high cholesterol. It can be caused by many different things; some you can control, and others you can't. Things that cause high cholesterol which you can control: Things that cause high cholesterol which you can't control: Genes carry the information that determines your features or characteristics that are passed on to you \u2014 or inherited \u2014 from your parents. [Familial hypercholesterolaemia](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/conditions/familial-hypercholesterolaemia) (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed down through families in faulty genes and can lead to very high levels of cholesterol, even if you don't have other risk factors. Cholesterol is used by all the cells in your body to keep them healthy. It is carried around your body to the cells that need it by proteins in your blood. Proteins are substances in your body that do most of the work in your cells and help keep your body's tissues and organs working as they should. When cholesterol and proteins combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoproteins. One is good for your health; the other is bad. High-density lipoproteins or HDL is known as 'good' cholesterol. It gets rid of the 'bad' cholesterol from your blood by taking cholesterol you don't need back to the liver, where it is broken down and removed from your body. Non-high-density lipoproteins or non-HDL is known as 'bad' cholesterol. Too much non-HDL leads to a build up of fatty deposits inside the walls of the blood vessels (channels that carry blood throughout your body). This builds up and narrows blood vessels, increasing the risk of a heart attack or stroke. You may also have heard 'bad' cholesterol being called 'LDL' cholesterol. This used to be the main measure of harmful types of cholesterol, but we now know that other forms of non-HDL cholesterol can also affect your health. Our blood also contains a type of fat called triglycerides (found in fat cells), which can also contribute to narrowed arteries. Having excess weight, eating a lot of fatty and sugary foods or drinking too much alcohol can cause high triglyceride levels. If you have had results from a lipid profile (a test that looks at all aspects of your cholesterol), you may see your triglycerides level - your doctor will be able to tell you if it's too high. You can have a normal level of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol but still have a high triglyceride level. If you are found to have this, you may wish to speak to your GP to discuss what it means for you. There are usually no symptoms of high cholesterol. But if left untreated, it can lead to heart attack and stroke. It's often a hidden risk factor which means it can happen without us knowing until it's too late. That is why it's so important to get your cholesterol level checked. However, if you have familial hypercholesterolaemia, you may have visible signs of high cholesterol. These include: | | Tendon xanthomata - swellings made from cholesterol on the knuckles of your hands, your knees or the Achilles tendon at the back of your ankle. | | Xanthelasmas - small, yellow lumps of cholesterol near the inner corner of your eye. | | Corneal arcus - this is a pale white ring around the coloured part of your eye, your iris. You can ask your GP to check your cholesterol levels, which are measured using a simple blood test. It is sometimes referred to as a 'lipid profile'. Your GP or practice nurse will take a blood sample, to check for the following: You will also get a total cholesterol result. You may be offered a finger-prick cholesterol test. This can be done in some pharmacies, or as part of the NHS Health Check in England. Cholesterol levels vary from person to person, but in general, for a healthy heart you need a low level of non-HDL level and a higher level of HDL. The information below is just a guide. What matters is your individual risk. Talk to your doctor about your results and what levels you should aim for. [Find out more](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/tests/blood-cholesterol) about what your results mean, how your doctor works out your risk and when you might need medication. | | Result | | Healthy level (mmol/L) | | Total cholesterol | | 5 or below | | HDL (good cholesterol) | | 1 or above | | Non-HDL (bad cholesterol) | | 4 or below | | Fasting triglycerides (when you're asked not to eat for several hours before the test) | | 1.7 or below | | Non-fasting triglycerides (when you eat as normal before the test) | | 2.3 or below | | Total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio | | 6 or below If you have been told you have a high cholesterol level, it means you have too much 'bad' cholesterol in your blood, which increases your risk a heart attack or stroke. But a high level of 'good' (HDL) cholesterol can help keep that 'bad' (non-HDL) cholesterol in check.
