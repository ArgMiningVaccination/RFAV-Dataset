Cover photograph \u00a9 B&C Alexander This Report is a bout values . It describes how we, the people, companies and businesses that make up the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, are strivin g to live up to our re sponsibilities - financial, social and environmental. It is also an invi tation to you to tell u s what you think o f our performance , and in this way participate with us in the global debate about the role and responsibilities of busin ess. This Report al so relates the feelings and determination of over 100,000 people in the Shell Group who are dealing with profound change as they rise to the chall enge o f making the Group more efficient and competitive - in a way that c onforms to the core value s which have been t he bedrock of the Group since it was founded. It is a matter of pride and reassurance to us that througho ut the years these core value s have endured. They represent an unshakable foundation on whi ch to build at a time when society has ri sing expectations of busin ess. Debating expectations Multinationals have bee n criticis ed as being overly concerne d with profit and fai ling to take th eir broader respon sibilities seriously: to defend human rights, to protect the environment , to be goo d corpor ate citi zens. Such accusa tions reflect a sh ift in what society expects of both business and government. Some comment ators argue, for exam ple, that the privatis ation of tradit ionally state-run compan ies transfers power government to the private se ctor. An opposi ng view holds that governm ents are merely realising that business and civil society ca n perform th ese functions better. This debate is taking place in the conte xt of a fast-chan ging world, characteri sed by global communicatio ns and dim inishing respect for establis hed authority, profes sions and social frameworks - a form of moral vacuum in which f ear and doubt pros per. Faced with such uncertainty , people are wit hdrawing their trust in traditional i nstitutions unless it can be demons trated that such faith is warranted - what has been called a move from a 'trust me' to a 'show me' world . Clearly , es of balisation, rapid improvements in technolo gy and dram atic changes in world order h ave caused considerable confusion over exactly what is - and is not - expected o f busines s. Should it play a bigger r ole in society, by providing infras tructure and s ocial services where government does not, and the n face accusations that it is int erfering or buying influe nce? Or s hould it conc entrate on w hat it does best: servin g its customers a nd gettin g the best return for sh areholders? Searching for answers Answers a re not always ea sy to find , but mana gers who run a bus iness in this uncertain world have no choice but to m ake difficult decisio ns in the face of complex dilemmas. We were al l shaken by the tra gic execution o f Ken S aro-Wiwa and eight Ogonis by the Nigerian authorities. We were ill- prepared for the public react ion to plans to dispose of the Brent Spar off-shore storage buoy in deep water in the Atlantic. We bel ieve th at we acte d honourably in both cases. But that i s not enough. C learly, t he conviction t hat you are doi ng things right is not the same as getting them ri ght. For us at least, this has been a very sa lutary lesson . We were ready to learn from e xperienc es, however pai nful, because of a planned process of change begun in 1994. It represented t he most thorough and far- reach ing review for over 30 years - our Transformation. Nothin g was sacrosa nct and fundam entals were questioned : the structure, the way business is d one, the qua lity of leaders hip, rel ationships with people and our vision of the fut ure. One e lement of the Transformati on involve d a worldwide programme through 1996 of conversations with peo ple to understand society's exp ectations of mu ltinational companies, and anot her to e xplore the reputation, image and overall s tanding of the Group. This inv olved 7,500 members of the general public in 10 countries and 1,300 opinion le aders in 25 countries. We also interviewed 600 Shell people in 55 countries. The news was both good and bad. Hal f of the general public and opinion leaders had a favorable view of Shell , while 40% were neutral and 10% ha d an unfavorable o pinion of us. Shell was thought to be wanting i n its care for the en vironment and human rights by a small but s ignificant group of people . We h ad looked in the mirror an d we neither recogn ised nor liked some of w hat we saw. We have set about putting it right, and this report is a small mani festation of wides pread action t aking place across the Group. Economic r esponsibilities Profits ver sus principles The Royal Dutc h/Shell Group is commercial in nature an d its primary resp onsibility ha s to be eco nomic - wealth generat ion, me eting customer needs, providing an acceptable return to investors, and contribu ting to overall economic development. This assertion is easy to make and hard to substantiate i n a short pub lication, but we are determine d to try. This is a first attempt at what will be an annua l report. We will get better at it as we learn. Success is almos t entirely dependent on the heart-felt approval of all those i n the Shell Group, an d on how well we can equi p ourselves with the right tools to tackle the many challenges which await u s. But there is also an inseparable responsibility to ensure th at our b usinesses a re run in a way that is et hically ac ceptable to the rest of the world and i n line with our own values. Equally im porta nt, we must sho w we are doing so, by providing i ndependently verifie d assurance. T his approac h is absolutely fundam ental to t he healt h of business. This is why part of our pl ans for improvement involves the developme nt and integration o f new processes and thi nking to help us better mana ge our s ocial and ethical responsibilities , meas ure performance and report regularly. We re alise too that we must b e part o f the debat e in order to learn from ot hers, explain our actions and put our poi nt of view forward. We m ay not alway s get it right but we do strive at all tim es to be good corporate citizens. We have a proud histo ry of social responsibility and we w ant to build on that. It is a big step for the Group. S hell comp anies are, in eff ect, reinforcing their global undertaking to society to live by their Busin ess Principl es and to be ju dged by their performance . Much of what follows addres ses the S tateme nt of General Busi ness Principles. This is our code of conduct to he lp those having to make difficult decis ions. There has been a formal set of Principles since 1976 and the latest in a number of u pdates was completed in 1997 to take account o f changes in soci ety and world views. This undertaking may well be unique in a Group of our size and comple xity. We are proud to p lay a leading role and we are confident t hat the Group, with it s experience and glo bal capacity, has much to offer. We also know t hat we need to listen to others very carefully a nd therefore we would appreci ate your advice . The 'Tell Shell' section is provided in the Report for you to send us your views on issues th at concern b ig business and on th e Report itself. The Princip les show that we are very serious about our resp onsibilities to society a t large, our shareholder s, employ ees, customers and those with who m we do busine ss. We hop e, through th is Report and by our future actions, t o show that the basic i nterests of business and society a re entirely compatib le - that there does not have to be a choice between profits and prin ciples .

Reply envelop e The Royal Dutc h/Shell Group has a set of Principl es which applies to all of our bus iness affairs and describes the behaviour expecte d of every employ ee. The Princi ples are rooted in our core valu es of ho nesty, integrity and respect for peo ple. We believe in the promotion of trust, op enness, teamwork an d profes sionalis m, and in pride in what we do. This section atte mpts to show the exte nt to which our Princi ples work in pr actice. Where possible we provide obje ctive e vidence to support our clai ms using dat a from the S hell Repor t Survey Results (see Anne x). This is indicated throughout this Report by text highlighte d in green as below. There has b een a formal Statem ent of General Business Principles since 1976. This has been updated periodica lly, most recently in 1997 after extensive consultations with interested parties aroun d the wo rld. Relative ly few cha nges were made , mainly becaus e the core values on which t he Principles were original ly based have endured. The revis ions reflect height ened pu blic intere st in human rights issues - we are t he first m ajor energy company to support publi cly the Unite d Nations Univers al Declaration o f Human Rights - and the emergenc e of the concept of sustainable developme nt. All Group companies are expec ted to com ply with the Princi ples as a m atter of course. In joint ventures w e use our influe nce to persuade our p artners to ado pt and apply principles consi stent with ours. We also expect contract ors in their wor k with She ll companies to c onform to the Pr inciples in all aspects of that work (s ee Princi ple 2 for how we go about thi s). This data has not bee n verifie d by the auditors . We a re developin g managemen t systems designe d to enable future report s to include increasing ly verifiab le me asures of the performance of Shell com panies agai nst the Principl es (see Road Ma p). The Stat ement of Genera l Business Principl es has been tra nslated into 34 langu ages, wh ich cover th e local langu ages of m ore than 96% of Shell employ ees, and of partners and contractors in 1 02 countries. Putting the ory into practice A Socia l Responsibility Committee wa s set up in 1997 consisting of six members of the Boards of the Parent com panies of the Shell Group, three from Royal Dutc h Petroleum Company and three from T he \"Shell\" Trans port and Trading Comp any, p.l.c. The role of t he Com mittee is to revie w the po licies and conduct of Shell co mpanies with respect to the Business Principles, the Group Healt h, Safety and Envi ronment Po licy and Commitment, as well as major i ssues of public concern . Embedding key policies Company polici es are of va lue only when there are rigoro us procedures to make them work in pract ice. This section concentrates o n impleme ntation in key areas of t he Stateme nt of General Busi ness Principles, in particular Business Integrity and Health, Safety a nd Environment (HSE). Specific comm itments are m to susta inable developme nt and huma n rights. It is easy to talk about t hese issues but a lot more challenging to apply the theory in the field. Real progres s will on ly be made by working together with ot hers in a proces s that learns from experie nce and best practi ce. But S hell compan ies have made a start and are beginning to ma ke headway on some da y-to- day practi calities. Every year man agers of Shell compani es are required to sign letters coverin g performan ce in each of these ar eas. These provide confirmatio n to the Directors of the Group Holding Com panies that the policies have been adopted and that procedu res are bein g or have been i mpleme nted to ensure compliance. We have published an introduc tory guide for managers on human rights. W ritten with t he help of i ndependent experts, thi s booklet aids the understandi ng of huma n rights, its history, vocabulary and the dilemm as that a belief in such rights ca n pose. It will help Group compan ies bette r identify their roles and responsibilities i n supporting hu man rights and forms part of an aware ness programme designe d to help managers de al with these issues in their w ork. Submission of t he letters is a re sponsibility of the senior m anagers of Shell co mpani es worldwide. Th eir respon sibility i s taken very seriously. Sen ior ma nagers a re encoura ged to discuss their letters with their own mana gement teams, and many ask their own team mem bers to sign similar le tters on a cascade basis. We are develop ing a detailed and practica l guide o n how t o make oil and gas production more s ustainabl e. Topics include: ! Tools and te chniques to contribute to sustainable developme nt: assessmen ts; life cycle assessments; full-cost accounting. ! Managers who sign the letters are held personally responsible for their conte nt. Performance is monitored as part of the reward an d car eer progres sion proces ses. The provision of false informatio n or failure to reveal the truth i s rega rded as a very serious disciplinary ma tter and can lead to dismissa l. This process has evolved over t he past two decades; it is explained in the boxes on Letter of Representatio n, HSE Lett er and Business Principles Letter. Case studies on how to get start ed, from Shell comp anies in Canada and Peru; policy making; target setting; consulting with s takeho lders; minimis ing impact o n health, social structures and t he environment ; building social capital. Letter o f Representation The Lett er of Representation was first introduced in 1978. The letters are signed by the C hief Execut ive and C hief Financial Officer of Shell companies. The y contain a number of assurances which include confirmatio n that business is carried out with integrity, according to Principle 4, and which are submitted in respect of all Shell compan ies. They are als o a declaration by management as to the effectiveness of sound financial contr ols, the proper recording of transactions , and any instances of bribes or illegal payments . The letters are i n standard format a nd any exceptio ns or ot her matters reported are summaris ed and reviewed by the Group Audit Committ ee. The process is reviewed by t he External Auditors who re port the results of their review to the Group Audit Committee . The letters also support the repr esentations made by the Directors of the Gr oup Holding Companies to t he External Auditors prior to completio n of the annual Financial Stateme nts of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Compan ies. Health, Safety and Environme nt letter A common HSE policy has bee n formal ly adopte d by Shell com panies, and all compan ies are committed to setting up a forma l HSE man agemen t system b y the end of 1999. The HSE letter w as introduced within t he Group as publi c concern about HSE issues increas ed and is submitted by the Chief Executive of individual com panies. It is designed to give a ssura nce that the necessa ry managemen t procedures, in cluding systems and audits , are in place to ensure knowle dge, understandi ng and implement ation of t he policy . Adoptio n of the common HSE policy is bei ng verified, alon g with certain performance data, and will be reported o n by External Verifiers in the Group HSE Report and those of the major Bu sinesses to be published in June 1998. Business Princi ples letter Following t he update of the Statement of General Busin ess Prin ciples comp leted in 1997, the Boar ds of all Group Companies were invited to adopt the revis ed Bus iness Principl es as their own comp any policy , and to confirm t heir adoptio n in writing to t he Chairman of the Committee of Managi ng Directors. Confirmatio ns covering Group companies in 125 countries have been received. a number of confirmations are stil l outstanding, in most cases becaus e the board me eting has not yet taken place. In addition, a new annual letter, the Business Principles letter, has now bee n introduced. These letters are from the Count ry Chairmen* and are i ntended to cover all Sh ell com panies worldwide. T hey are des igned to confirm t hat the necessary p rocedures have been put i n place to ensure that t he spirit is understood by employ ees and that the Principles are being implemented. The letters do not have a standard format. Country Chairm en have been asked to cover a numb er of sp ecific issues and have been encouraged to give as much detail as possible on how the procedures are bei ng put into effect. The letters recei ved are being summaris ed and a report on the res ponses will be mad e to the Directors of the Group Holding Companies. E ach signatory of a letter will have a formal meeting with t he relevant Region al Managing Dir ector, e ither directly or through a sen ior executive, to d iscuss plans for imp lementing and applying the Principl es over the co ming year . It should form the basis for action over t he comi ng year, before the whole exercis e is repeated on an annual cycle. The deadli ne for the return of these letters has not permitte d a full analysis in this report but a prelim inary examination shows: ! ! A total of 127 Business Principles letters have now been received out of 129. The extent of t he impl ement ation already achieve d is encouraging and is illustrated by extensive communications and awaren ess training progra mmes , and worksh ops with employees on the applicatio n of the Prin ciples in the loc al environment . We are k een to explore further t he accept ance of these Business Pr incipl es in areas where op erational contro l or financi al authority does not vest in a Sh ell comp any exclusively - for examp le in joint ventures. Indepe ndent verifiers have been reques ted to review the assertions set out above with regard to t he process for the adoption o f the revised Statemen t of Gen eral Busin ess Principl es. Their report is inc luded on page 52. Note: There is a considerable amount of overlap i n the a reas covered by the different princip les. We have c hosen t hose aspects which we feel are pertine nt under each principle.

This person is called the C ountry Cha irman when several business es are oper ating in a countr y, and is called the She ll Repres entative when only one business is present. Acting R esponsi bly Shell comp anies have resp onsibilities to a wide ran ge of in terested parties, such as sharehold ers, employees, customers and others in society . And the resp onsibilities relate to our financia l, environmental and social impacts o n each o f these groups. Living up to th eir ex pectations demands a long-term perspective, e mbraces many non-fina ncial considerations , and calls for b alance when requirements co nflict. Our a pproach to these responsibilities i s a mai n theme of this report. Princi ple 1 Objectives The o bjectives o f Shell companies are to engage efficiently, responsibl y and profitabl y in the oil, gas, chemica ls and other selected businesses a nd to participate in the search for and deve lopment of other so urces o f energy. Shell companies seek a hi gh standard of performance and aim to maintai n a long-term position i n their respective comp etitive environm ents.The Group finds ROACE useful i n judgi ng the economic efficiency of o peratio ns worldwide. Their aggregat ed performa nce over the p ast 10 years is shown in t he graph below, compared with other oil m ajors. Operating effici ently The efficiency of a bus iness can be gauged in many ways, for example, by how well its employees perform (total staff hours per barrel of oil produced or sold); how low its costs are (cos ts per barrel , see graph); how much value it adds to t he world's economy; and how eco-e fficient it is. Eco-efficie ncy refers to the provision of goo ds while progressively re ducing t he environment al impact o f their lifecycle to sustainable levels. The Shell Group is bottom whe n compare d with the main competitors, and the performance gap widened in 1 997. This can be ex plained, in part, by the mix of businesses that make up the Shell Group and in part by the holdin g of large cash reserves. The Group is de termined to improve its performance and have committ ed to deliver a minimum of 13 % ROACE in 19 98 and 15% by the year 2001, based on an oil price of US$ 18 per bar rel. It will be tough to achieve , but we will co ntinue to make better use of our existi ng assets and c ash reserves and to invest i n areas of growth. The choice of measure depe nds largely on the perspective of those who are judging . Finan cial meas ures are better es tablis hed and are the most ge neral, they e nable i nvestors to compare t he performance of different businesses, and to be assured that their capita l is being used as efficiently as possible. A traditio nal efficiency measure among investors is h ow well a compa ny uses its capita l and assets, such as Return On Average C apital Emp loyed (RO ACE) - how much money is made from the money invested. A bright future from biomass fuel Making a Pro fit By most meas ures the S hell Gro up has been a leader in total profit (see Princi ple 2, responsibility to shareholders). Profits are essen tial to susta in a private business: with out profits to re-inv est, a business ceases to exist and contributes nothin g. They also enable us to fulfil our social and environme ntal obligat ions (see Princip le 3). Our Principles aim to e nsure that profits are both fairly earned and wel l used. Other source s of energy The Group' s new bus iness Shell Internatio nal Renewa bles, aims to be a ma jor force in commercial renewable sources of en ergy, which we see as gainin g a 5 to 10% share of the world energy markets by 2020. (See Renewa bles) Shell com panies have invested in the developme nt of biomas s (plant matter) an d solar energy for the past 20 ye ars. We have tree plantatio n interests in Arge ntina, C nd, Para guay and Uruguay . We have played a lead part in the developme nt of sustainable forestry standards and the use of wood as a cle an source of renewable energy. By the mi ddle of the next centur y biomass fuel could b e supplying as much e lectricity as oil and gas does today. Shell com panies are ex ploring t he potential to supply small communities with electricity from wood grown in plantati ons near by. Specially develope d trees would be grown a nd harves ted ac cording to sustainable fores try practices . The wood would be turned into gas in specially designed ga sifiers, and then converted by a gas engine and a generator into el ectricity. In 1997 we committed US$ 5 00 million over five yea rs on investmen ts in renewa ble energy technolo gies, es pecially those that exploit solar po wer and bioma ss. We aim to achieve a 10% share of t he photovoltaics market by 2005. This inves tment is small comp ared with t he US$ 1 billio n which Shell comp anies spend each year ex ploring for oil and gas, but we see it as signific ant when com pared with other commercia l investmen ts in new sources of energy. Renewables are now one o f our core areas of business and demons trate our intention to invest in areas of susta inable growth. Burning wood - and growing m ore to repla ce it - does not increase the net concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, becaus e the tree s absorb as much CO2 wh en growing as th ey release when burnt. A typical 140 kiloWa tt bioma ss system could supply a village of 50 fami lies with al l their electricity ne eds, including refri geration for essen tials such as medicines. The system ca n also provide heat for s mall-scale indus trial uses, such as dr ying farme d crops. We are, howev er, cautious in our approac h. Solar power, for example, n eeds to become five times less e xpensive i f it is to compete in the el ectricity m arket at today's prices. Continue d research a nd develo pment is essen tial. Besid es, oth er forms of en ergy a re emerging w hich might overtake current techno logies. W e want to be in a position to take advantage of any investme nt opportunities that aris e. A wood -based system ca n be used in conjunctio n with solar coll ectors, in what we call a Sun Station. Solar in the ho me Shell Solar provides one of the most reliable and long-la sting sola r home systems available. The 50 Watt system ha s been designed for simple and eas y operation in remote locatio ns and is supplied as a complete kit re ady to be installed. In a sunny climate it can provide enoug h electricity to run a hous ehold's lights , radio and television. Princi ple 2 Responsibilities Shell companies r ecognise five areas of responsibility: To shareholders To pro tect shareholders' investment, and provide an accep table re turn. To custo mers To win and maintain cust omers b y developing and providing produc ts and services which offer value in terms of price, quality , safety and environmental i mpact, which are su pported by the req uisite technological, en vironmental and commercial expertise. To employee s To those w ith whom they do business To societ y Operating to b est business practice The Parent Com panies, Royal Dutch Petroleum Com pany and The \"Shell\" Trans port and Trading Comp any, p.l.c., each conform to two fundam ental recommendat hment of separate committees com posed of non-e xecutive directors, one to set directors' pay and the other to c heck the integrity of fi nancial reporting. I n 1967 the companies introduced the joi nt Remunerati on and Succession Review Committee and in 1976 the joint Group Audit Co mmittee. Protecting shar eholders' investment As a mi nimum, Shell com panies comply with all legal controls governing t he way companies conduct their financ ial affairs. These are desig ned to protect t he interests of shareholders and other i nvestors. We are also co mmitted to good corporate governance - ensuring that compani es are properly directe d, supervis ed and controlle d - and we do our utmost to operat e in accorda nce wit h best business practice i n this field. The Parent Com panies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Gr oup both have an excellent record in providin g good returns at low risk to investors, whi ch is also fundamental to the protection of shareholders' investment. O ne of the ways in which we approach t he management of risk is through our pioneering work at deve loping scenario p lanning - exploring di fferent pictures of how the future could b e - for i nvestment pl anning and evaluation. Providing an acceptable return 'Acceptable' is used intentionally, rather than 'maximum' . This is becaus e it reflects our responsibility to make profits w hile also taking full acco unt of social and environment al considerations, as well as t he long-term success of in vestmen ts. Total Shareholder Retu rn fina ncial performance . It combines changes in share price growth with divid ends. An investment i n shares in the Parent Companies in 1988, with all dividends reinvested, would n ow give th e return s shown in the graph. Shares in the Parent Comp anies are ofte n passed down fr om one generat ion to t he next, reflecti ng the value and stability in which t hey are r egarded . Shell's sta ted objective on d ividen ds is tha t they should provide incre ases at least i n line with inflatio n averaged over a period of years. Clearly complex decisions are required, o ften involving difficult trade-of fs. For instanc e, the cost of lower e missions will have to be recovered, eit her by increas ed prices to customers (wh ich may not always b e welcome) or by changes in the tax regim e and thus reduce d governme nt income. Reducing environmental impact of products It is easier for u s to affe ct and monitor environment al impact i f we have direct control over the process (eg making fuels). Our HSE reports, for example, show th at the eco-efficie ncy of Shell refineries has im proved considerab ly over the past five years. However, S hell compan ies accept that the responsibility fo r products extends beyond their productio n and sale, and they must do what they can t o help reduce the overall impact. We acknowledge our responsi bility to contribute i n this area a nd Shell comp anies work closely with governme nts by providing the results of research i nto tec hnical feasibility, costs a nd the imp act of emission s so that balanced dec isions can be ma de. Custom er value There are over 47,000 Shell retail stations serving more th an 20 mil lion customers a day worldwide. T hese sell fuel , lubricants a nd other fast-movin g consumer goo ds, such as food and household es sentials . The popul arity of the Shell brand is an import ant performance indicator for our businesses. We have con ducted market surveys for man y years. In 1996 we commissioned independent researchers to carr y out the first globa l Brand Tracker of retail c ustomers, covering 52 co untries. This was extended to 98 countries in 1997. Wh en retail customers were as ked wh ich bra nd they would prefer, all else bein g the sa me, Shell wa s most preferred in 48 countries , and was in second place in a further 22, (s ee grap h below). Responsible car e of chemicals Our ch emicals businesses sup port Responsible C are\u00ae, a voluntary programme initiate d by t he global c hemical s industry to boost its performance in HSE. R esponsible Care\u00ae inc ludes a commitme nt to be open with the public and to report o n performa nce. Take fuels, for example. It is technically possible to redu ce urban emis sions by reducing t he content o f some of the potenti al pollutan ts during th e refin ery process. Low- sulphur diesel, for in stance, ha s been introduced in a number of markets. Shell leads t he world in the sales o f unleaded petrol a nd we have a proven tr ack record in the developme nt and market ing of cleaner fuels. Shell com panies have also pione ered methods for me asuring the local impact of exhaust emissio ns from various types of vehicles. Enshrined in the programme is t he idea o f Product S tewards hip, in which the com pany takes certai n responsibilit ies for its products throughout their lifecycle (see M auritania examp le, in 'Dealing the 'Issues and Dilemm as' section). There is a strong em phasis on working with customers (mainly those in business) to ens ure safety and the reducti on of environm ental impact. This involves advice, informatio n and sometimes direc t help in improv ing standards . Some of our b usinesses, such as Sh ell Internation al Chemicals and Shell Exploratio n and Production, mostly sell dire ctly to other compan ies rather than individu al consumers . These Sh ell businesses ca rry out regula r research into how their custome rs view their products and services . They also commis sion opinion polls and survey the vie ws of groups in society in terested in our businesses wh o might be affect ed by their activit ies. However, the production of cle aner fuels invariab ly invol ves higher costs . Higher energy require ments an d consequently higher emission s of CO2 ma y also result. Additio nally, t he reduction in t he conte nt of one po llutant m ay only be poss ible by the increase in another. Furth er decreases in pollutan ts may involve extremely h igh costs but only a small improvement in air qua lity. A key feature of Product S tewards hip is the apprais al of customer facilit ies and our customers are visited regularly t o chec k on the adequacy of their e quipme nt. Shell chemical com panies work har d to ensure that customers can handle t heir products safely. There are ma ny occasions whe n orders have been declined until She ll com panies have been able to work with the customer to achieve the necessary equipment a nd procedures to handle products safely. At the end of 1996 She ll chemical companies had Product S tewardship initiatives in 45 companies oper ating in 30 cou ntries, and t he number is growing (see She ll Chemica ls HSE report an d website www.shell.com/Chemhse ). Employee rights and conditions The most fundamental right o f each employee is that t heir life, health and safety is protected. We employ more than 100,000 people in 132 countries. Their working conditions, terms of employ ment and, wher e nec essary, redundancy payments are monitored to ensure these ar e competit ive, both nationally and within the relevant industry sector. Our primary aim is to es tablish and mai ntain high quality, direct and open dialogue with all individual employees. Where unions or works councils are an established part of t he employment culture and legal framework, our relationshi p with them is respec tful, inclusive and complete, o ften co vering si gnific antly more than mini mum requirements. The lowes t paid Shell employ ee (in US $ terms) worldwide receives 1.6 times th e statutory minimum wage i n that country. Shell com panies in 77 countries have organised forums for staff to discuss employ ment conditions . In 82 c ountries employee wel fare is protected by clearly stated grievance proced ures. On 548 occasions in 1997 staff either tabled issues, or were invited to do so. Equality and opportunity We probably e mploy the most diverse group of peo ple in the world a nd we value the benefits this bri ngs. The vast m ajority of Shell staff are from the countries whe re the compan ies are based. This is reflected throughout ma nageme nt, and is beginning to be seen in the top jobs . In 1997 the Group had 5,700 expatriat es of 67 nation alities working in 112 different countries around the world. Still, many of the top 400 jobs in the Group are he ld by British, Dutch and American m en. We are e ager to change this th rough improved s taff developme nt programmes , recruitment, trai ning and education and by embed ding diversity into bus iness planning - but mos t import antly by bringi ng about a change i n corporate culture. Recently, a deliberate e ffort to incre ase the contribution from women at the most senior levels of the Group was announced. Shell Oil recog nised for equal opportunities In 1996 Shell Oil Company of the USA received th e Mo ses Leroy Foundation Award presented by the Mart in Luther King Jr. Community Centre for outstandi ng and ongoing suppor t for equal oppo rtunities - the first corporation to win t he award. HISPANIC, a US ma gazine, inclu ded Shell Oil Com pany for three co nsecutive years (1995-7) in the top 100 US companies which provide the most op portunities for Hisp anics. Th ese a re two of many examples where t he com pany has been public ly recognis ed for encouragin g people from mi nority groups in the US We have formal polici es to enco urage equa l opportunity employment i n all countries where this is not a legal require ment. In some countries our position has to be handle d with particular sensit ivity to take account of cultura l issues, religious b eliefs, affirma tive employ ment programmes and laws on sexual preference . (see www.shellus.com ). Awards and acknowled gement s for the e fforts of Shell companies in promoting equal opportunities have bee n receive d in Australia, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa and the US A. To shareholders To customers To employees To respect the human rights of their employees, to provide t heir emplo yees wit h good an d safe conditions of work , and good an d com petitive terms and co nditions of service, to promote the development and best use o f hum an talen t and equal opport unity empl oyment, and to encourage the involvement of employees in the planning and dir ection of their work, an d in the applicat ion of t hese principle s within their com pany. It is recognised that commercial success depends on the full commit ment of all employees. To those w ith whom they do business To seek mut ually beneficial relatio nship with con tractors, suppliers and in joint ventures and to promote the application o f these principles in so doing. The ability to promot e these principles effect ively will be an important factor in the decision to enter into or re main in such relationships. To societ y Training leads to better working conditions Intensive training of em ployees and contractors on t he Cormorant and Dunlin Alpha platforms in the North S ea has enhance d future profitability by 19%, secured jobs, improved competitiveness and mad e the workin g environmen t more satis fying by encouraging e mployees to make improvements f or themselves. Shell Exploratio n and Productio n, which operates the platforms, was one of the 'supreme winners' of the UK's 1997 National Training Awar ds. Seeking mut ually beneficial rel ationships We aim to forge constructive, long-term alliances with lo cal com panies because it makes good b usiness sen se. Wh ere th is cannot be done - bec ause part ners fail to meet our stand ards on emp loyee huma n rights , corruption, HS E or qualit y - we will explore w ays to resolve the problems. If this fails, we will find other partners who can meet our s tandards. In 90 countries Shell companies are helping local suppliers to re ach Shell's required s tandards. In 60 count ries, Shell com panies provide trai ning for suppliers and contractors , rang ing from road s afety to HSE practices and Quality Assurance. We also participate in the deve lopment of new products, and improveme nts to meet international standards . Health, safe ty, environment an d human rights Shell com panies do not work wi th suppli ers and contractors who are not able to meet Shell standards. In mo re than 100 countries Shell compan ies screen suppliers for th eir ability to meet HSE standards and the huma n rights of their e mployees. We welcome the developme nt of recognis ed independent standards which will help Shell compa nies and their s uppliers meas ure an d monitor performance in this area. Shell com panies are committe d to major programmes to support and encourage the developme nt of local suppliers and t hose from minority groups . For ex ample: ! ! ! ! ! ! Brunei - Local Business Development Policy In 88 countries our Statement o f General Business Principl es is pr ovided or explic itly discussed as a nor mal part of major contract negoti ations . Cana da - Abor iginal Programme In 1997, at least 95 contracts were cance lled because contractors f ailed to adhere to our s pecifie d standards on HSE, or employee human rights. Malaysia - Petr onas Vendor Development Programme Singapore - Loc al Industry Upgradin g Programme South Afr ica - Affirmative Action/Black Busin ess Develop ment Progra mmes Child labour The use o f child labour is of increasing concer n in many parts of the w orld. Shell companies employ only those people above the le gal working age , and seek to use contractors and suppliers who f ollow the same rule. USA - M inority and Women' s Business Programme. The us e of child labour is more prevalent in certain parts of the world and a number of Shell com panies in t hose regions operate specific screeni ng proce dures. For examp le, Shell C hina formally c hecks t hat no child or forced l abour is used and Bharat Shell in India specifica lly mon itors its con tracts for th e use of child labour. Corporate citize nship There are, as yet, no u niversally acce pted meas ures by which to ju dge our performanc e as a corporate citizen committe d to the concepts of sustainable develo pment, although some of the economi c aspects c an easily be quant ified. ! ! ! ! Tax. Shell comp anies are a major contributor to the infrastructure of economies wher e they o perate. The tot al tax and other duties paid to go vernments worldwide is shown in the graph. As economic engines, Shell comp anies are now providing more than US$ 50 billion in tax revenue each ye ar. To put it in a human conte xt, The Unite d Nations Development Programme (UND P) report on Human Development 1997 estimates that the annual costs of un iversa l access to bas ic social services are: b asic education for a ll (US$ 6 bill ion), basic health and nutrition (US $ 13 bil lion), reproductive he alth and family planning (US$ 12 billion) and low cos t water supplies and sanitation (US$ 9 billion) totalli ng US$ 4 0 billio n. To shareholders To customers To employee s To those w ith whom they do business To societ y To conduct busin ess as responsible corporat e members of societ y, to observe the laws of the countries in which they operate, to expre ss support for fundam ental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business and to give prope r regard to health, safety and the environm ent cons istent with their commitment to contribute to sustainable development. These five areas of responsibilit y are seen as inseparable. Therefore, it is t he duty of management continuously t o assess the priorities and dis charge its respon sibilities as best it can on the basis of that assessm ent.Employment . Shell comp anies employ more than 100,000 people directly and another 240,000 or so contractors. Further employ ment is provide d through business gen erated for sup pliers. We paid over US$ 6 billio n in employee remuneration and related costs in 1997. Research and Technical Servic es. Shell companies invest over US$ 50 0 million in res earch and technical services each year, the results of whic h directly or indirectly benefit world und erstandin g and technical capability. Social investment and charitable giving . Over the five years from 1992- 1996 we have co ntribute d on average 1.05% of net income after tax - equivalent to 0.6% net income before tax - to community causes, social projects and charities. In 1997 our contri bution totalled approxim ately US$ of 15% from the previo us year's total of US$ 68.4 million. Global ly, Shell compan ies' social investments refl ect their o perations, as shown by comparing co ntributi ons with capita l expenditure. (S ee grap h). Contribution programmes of S hell compan ies address issues of direct relevance and concern to the communities where they operate. This is reflected in the range of causes supported. Environmental l aws Companies, esp ecially t hose inv olved i n heavy manufact uring, may at times fail to comply fully with environme ntal laws. This is not necessarily a wanto n flouting of the law, but i s often c aused by human error or equipment f ailure. The signific ance attac hed to the transgression and the size of the p enalty depend greatly on the nature of the particular e nvironment al laws. Penalties range from fin es agai nst the company through to im prisonment for directors. Generally, the environmental laws which compan ies most often break are associa ted with permits issued by th e authorities gove rning t he amount of pollution they are lega lly allowed to e mit - known as cons ent leve ls. If a comp any unwittin gly exceed s its consent l evel, say, when m achinery breaks down , then it can be liable to prosecution. In many instances the companies them selves inform the authorities when this happe ns. Often no direct d amage is caused a nd the size of the fine, if one is levied, reflects this. In many countri es authorities acknowle dge the difficulties i n immediately complying with new laws and allow comp anies time to re ach the desired leve l of performance . In some countries the laws regarding environment al liability are far reaching and can involve companies i n severe penalties and remediatio n cos ts. Supporting fundamental human rights Shell operates in 132 countries worldwide. Human Rights groups claim that the authorit ies in over 90 c ountries have violated the rights of t heir people , as defi ned by th e Unit ed Nat ions. It is inevitab le that many Shell com panies will be doing business in such coun tries (see page 32). Our positi on on two hi gh-pro file case s: Nigeria The execution in 1995 of Ken S aro- Wiwa and ei ght other Ogo nis shocked and saddened all of us. Before Mr Saro-Wiwa's arrest we said that whi le we did not necessarily agree with all of his views, he had the right to voice his opinions. After his arrest we said he should be treated fairly in prison and should be given the necessa ry medica l attention. We did not seek to influe nce his trial, but after the verdict the C hairman o f the Group's Committee of Managing Di rectors sent a let ter to the Nigerian head of state urging him to grant c lemency for all those sentenced . Twenty Ogo nis are cu rrently de tained in Nigeria in connection with the same incide nt. We ar e the only major company o perating i n the count ry to call publicly , and repeate dly, for humane treatment, a fair trial for t he detainees and cleme ncy for those found guilty. We have m ade these appeals both publicly and privately . We will co ntinue to promote humanitarian v alues in Nigeria. For examp le, when o il unio ns took part in the general strike of 1995, pr oduction by Shell Petrole um Development Company (SPD C) fell by a half. We took the positio n that we would not work under milit ary protection to i ncrease the flow of oi l. Nigeria is poor, despite being Africa' s leading oil producer. Its populat ion of more than 100 million has a gross domestic produ ct of only US$ 260 per person. It has many deve lopme nt challenges. There is a lack of governme nt investment in the social infrastruc ture of the area i n which we o perate. We reco gnise a responsibility to ac t. In 1997, the Shell joint venture spent US$ 32 milli on on a wide rang e of community and developme nt projects, inc luding the buildi ng of hospitals and schools (see the Shell Nigeri a website www.shellnigeria.com ).

South Africa Shell South Africa has advanced over nearly 100 years from a small agency based in Cape Town to a significant nation-wide co mmercial e nterprise, an integral part o f the national economy with dee p roots in South African society. During the apartheid y ears, when pressure was first exerted o n Shell to withdraw from South Africa, the company was employing more than 2,500 people, representing all the different racia l and cultural groups in the country. An equ al opportunity e mployer for ma ny years, Shell speed ed up black advancement in the co mpany fr om the beginning of 1980. The company provided housing for b lack employees in segregated ' white areas ' and offered legal assista nce should they be prosecuted und er aparth eid laws. The company's commitment to employees was encapsulated in what were enlig htened emp loyment policies for South Afr ica at the time . These include d: ! ! ! ! ! equal pay for equal work recruitment, dev elopme nt, trai ning and advancem ent of black staff to redress the imb alance between black and white staff withi n the company housing assistance to promote home owner ship retirement be nefits, medic al aid, educational assista nce for employees a nd their chi ldren promoting goo d industrial re lations both unionised n witho ut trial, c losure of newspapers and called for d emocracy and the release of politi cal prisoners. Their purpose was to ex press the company 's condemnat ion of inhumane and unjus t pract ices, its belief in a free and equa l society and to provid e financial support for the alternative press. Shell South Africa cont inues to fund and promote a wi de range of comm unity projects in t he country. Its work has be en publicly recognised an d was most recently shortlisted for t he Worl daware Award for S ustainable Develo pment in 1997. It won the Lawrie Group Award for Social Progr ess in 1997, for Shell's Centre for t he Advancem ent of Science and Mathem atics Education (CASME). The ju dges sai CASM E project and ongoi ng Educationa l Services, Shell has been a long-standing contr ibutor to South Afr ican education , both and after apartheid\". Criteria for in vestment deci sions This Princ iple helps our man agers find a balance betwee n ens uring the commercia l success of in vestmen ts and our lon g-term resp onsibilities to society and the environment. The Royal Dutch/Shell Gr oup, from its ori gin as two small companies in the 1890s, has grown to a Group of more than 2000 comp anies. It has been successful for over a 100 years. And to continue, it is essential to have endorsement from society - what s ome cal l a 'lice nce to operate'. Princi ple 3 Economic Principles Profit ability is essent ial to discharg ing these responsibilities and s taying i n business. It is a measure both of efficiency and o f the val ue that customers pla ce on Shell produc ts and services. It is essential to the allocation of the necessary corporate resources and to support the continuing investment required to develop and produce future energy supplie s to meet consumer n eeds. Without profits and a strong financial foun dation i t would n ot be possible to f ulfil the responsibilities outlined above. Shell companies work in a wide v ariety o f changing social, political an d econ omic environm ents, but in general they believe that the interests of the community can be served most effici ently by a marke t economy. Criteria for invest ment decisions ar e not exclusively economic in nature but also take into accoun t social and environmental co nsiderations and an appraisal o f the security o f the invest ment.Profitability The idea of profit is seen as quit e accept able by the majority but some perceive it as exploitative and uncaring , which is unfortunate because economic sustainability is one of the three supporting pi llars of sustainable developme nt, a concept fully endorsed by all members of the United Nations (see www.un.org and www.undp.org ). This will involve with society's lon g-term exp ectation of business. One of the tools we use to do this is scenario planni ng - e xploring different picture s of how th e future could be. W e are acknowledge d leaders in this field and we have develo ped s cenarios specifica lly to help us d ecide on investmen ts. Makin g good , secure investments involves the balancing of many issues, ranging from po litical stability of t he country in whic h we intend to do bus iness, through t o the health of the global environme nt. Busin ess has a number of social a nd environment al responsibilities but without profits a com pany - no m atter how big or small - ce ases to exist and can make no contri bution to any of its stakeholders. Competitiveness in t he marketpl ace must be a primary concern for all businesses, and Shell's are no different . The emphasis is now increasing ly on how companies com pete - t he ethical framework whic h determines their actions - and how they use thei r profits. Regular profits enab le Shell compani es to carry out our social and environment al responsibilities laid out i n the Principles. Profits give us the confid ence to take a long-term view, and the capacity to avoid th e tem ptation o f short-term wins, which could u ndermine our commitment to sustainable developme nt. Environmental Impact Assessm ents are undertake n for major projects . We are increasing ly consciou s of the need to be more systema tic in the assessme nt of th e socia l impa ct too. The care and sensitivity we have shown in ne w projects, such as our search for gas in Peru and our g as project at Malampaya in the P hilippine s, is evidence of the progres s we are maki ng in this area. SPDP's approac h, which is being impleme nted with the help of others, has three mai n elements: Be ope n, consult widely and co-operate with local and foreign interested parties. The project is being monitored by Red Am biental Peruana, a national health umbrella organisation m ade u p of 35 Pe ruvian non- governmental o rganisations (N GOs). Pro- Natura, a S wiss-based NGO is working with SPDP to ensure that it is constantly aware of its commitment t o sustainabl e developme nt. Doing it right in Peru Shell Pros pecting and Develo pment Peru (SPDP) is a ssessing natural gas reserves in the upper Am azoni a region of Peru in South America. The area, wh ich straddles the Camis ea River , is home a number of indige nous peoples, borders the Manu nation al park and is rich in biodiversity. The Camisea Project is important to Peru because it could substantial ly increase the country's rese rves of ga s, wh ich would provide cle aner altern atives to widely -used diesel. It could also protect foreign currency reserves b y reducing imports of fossil fuels and providing e arnings from exports. SPDP knew fro m the beginning that the project had to conform to the hi ghest technic al, envir onment al and social standards . This meant us ing the best availa ble technology and being ope n and responsive to those who could be affecte d by the operations. The project has given SPDP an opportunity to pione er the way large compan ies should work i n remo te and sensitive regions of the world, which is particularly pertinent to the Group's commitment to contribute to sustainable developme nt. Minimis e the impact o n the health and social structure s of loc al people, and their environment . The Royal Tropic al Institute of Amsterdam, wo rking with Peruvian e xperts, has assessed the h ealth of local commun ities. Healt h carers fr om the local communities and the C atholic Church are working with SPDP to protect and im prove the healt h of peo ple in the are a. All SPDP workers have to carry a Healt h Pass showing that they have bee n vaccinated. SPDP is helping in r egional vaccinatio n campaig ns. The Smithsonian Institution has m ade an inventor y of the local environment (including biodiversity assessmen t) and has join ed Peru vian environment al organisations to monitor for any detrime ntal effects o f the pr oject. Work to incre ase the social capital of the region, i n this way ensuring t hat the local communities be nefit from the project. Alternat iva, a Lima-bas ed NGO, is helping local communiti es deal with t heir waste in a n innovative w ay. Senati, a leading training institution in Per u, has develope d workshops on sewing and cloth m aking i n Nuevo Mundo, Cash iriari, Camisea and www.camisea.com ). Princi ple 4 Business In tegrit y Shell companies insist on honest y, integrity an d fairness in all aspect s of their business an d expec t the sam e in their relationships with all those with whom they do business. The direct or indirect offer, payment, soliciting and accept ance of bribes in any form are unaccep table practices. Emplo yees mus t avoid con flicts o f interest bet ween their private financial activities and their part in the conduct of company business. All business transacti ons on behal f of a Shell company must be reflected accurately and fairly in the accounts of the company in accordan ce wi th established procedures and be subject to audit. No bribes We do not bri be, nor do we accept bri bes. We do not sanc tion illegal payments of any kind. We in vestiga te all susp icious circumstances. Any employee found to have bribed or to have acce pted bribes is dismissed . Shell com panies have 'of ficial' no bribes policies in all 132 countr ies in which t hey oper ate, backed by procedures to detect such c ases. The policy and actions taken to enforce it are part of a strong anti-corruption culture within Shell. It is rein forced th rough a range of interrelated acti ons, such as supporting internatio nal initiatives against corruption by government, business and pressure groups (for examp le, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develo pment (OECD) Convention to C ombat Bri bery of Foreign Officials), and thoroug h internal investigations o f suspicious circumstances. We bel ieve th at cutting corruption is essential and leads to gr eater equ ality, a happier workplace, more effic ient econ omies , rapidly increasing investment flows a nd the spread of prosperity. It is a f act, though, that Shell managers are regularly offere d bribes , or urged to pay them to secure business and we work hard to reduce this pressure. Employ ees are as sured that they will not be penalised if they lose business becaus e they c hoose not to compromise Shell's Principles. This is helpi ng to establish Shell companies as 'no bribes' organ isations where business is won for business reasons. In 1997, Shell companies reported 23 instances in which Shell sta ff were detecte d soliciti ng or accepti ng bribes in any form. In all cases, the financial value involved was sma ll, but in some ca ses the consequenc es could have resulted in high costs to th e comp any. All cases were in vestiga ted, and the lesson s learne d were ci rculated i nternally to improve th e systems. Every ca se resulted in termina tion of employment . No cases were reported in wh ich a bribe was offered or paid by o r on behalf of a Shell comp any. The policy is to withdraw from potenti al business opportunities if th ey can not be conducted in line with the Business Prin ciples. For examp le, we withdrew fro m the m arket in Italy for 14 years in 1976 when it became clear th at com panies could not do bus iness without making unauthorised payments. We uncovered evid ence o f extortio n demands linked to the payment of politic al contributions tot alling more t han US$ 4.5 million . The matter was fully inv estigated, and the Ge neral Manager subsequently left the group. When is a gi ft a bribe? Gifts a re an essen tial part of doing business in some countri es, where it wo uld be rude not to bring a present to t he first bu siness meeting . Elsewhere gifts, especially if they are substantial, can be regard ed as a form of bribery . At what point does a gift become a bribe? And who decid es? This is a dilemma th at Shell man agers often face. Our overridin g princip le is that nothin g should be hidden. The policy is that we dec lare all gifts, and those above a token va lue are declined. Some Shell com panies have a policy of pooling gifts and auctio ning them, with t he proceeds goi ng to charity. Princi ple 5 Political Activities Of companies Shell companies act in a sociall y responsible manner within the law s of the count ries in which t hey operat e in pursui t of their legitimate commercial objectives. Shell companies do not make payments to political parties, organisations or their representatives or take any part in party politics. However, when dealing with governments, Shell com panies have the right and the responsibility to make their position known on any matter which affect s themselves, their emplo yees, their customers, or their shareholders. They also have the right to make their position known on matter s affec ting the communit y, wher e they have a contri bution to make. Of em ployees Where individual s wish to engage in activities in the community, including standing for election to public office, they will be given the opport unity to do so where this is appropriate in the light of local circumstan ces. No party politics Busin ess has no mandate to pa rticipate in party politics, although, as a m ajor generator of economi c wealth, th e oil in dustry clearly has cons iderabl e social and political i mpact. Shell com panies do not make co ntributions to political parties and treat t his issue in t he same way as bribery and corruption (s ee Principl e 4). Some of the issues in this Princi ple are hard to measure, and little qu antified evidence is availa ble. We are trying to dev elop suitable measures of per formance for use in subsequent rep orts. Please use the 'Tel l Shell' section if you ha ve suggestion s on the sort of evidence you want to see. Not all countrie s have po litical parties. As part of our anti-corruption commitment, Shell companies in 108 countries h ave clearly sta ted policies forbiddi ng payments to po litical parties . Social R esponsi bility We know t hat the integrity of e mployees - as individua ls - will earn the trust and respect of those with who m they deal, as well as people from the societi es in whic h they live a nd work. In 1997, there were no reported cases of politi cal donation. Shell com panies make large investments over long tim escales and they know t hat they can only prosper if t hey act respo nsibly within the societies of whic h they are a part. Their primary commitment is to t he country and its people , rather than just to the government of the day. We do, however, work with regulators and policy makers and we m ake our position known o n many matters of gove rnment policy, regul ation and legislat ion likely to affect our bus iness. This is done as part o f the democratic process. We als o work with trade associa tions which also lobb y on behalf of legitimat e trade interests. In 1996 we held a series of round-table discussion s in 14 coun tries toge ther with other forms of r esearch to get the views of t he way in which society's exp ectations of large multi-nation al compani es were chan ging and might e xpect to change i n the future. The results of this co nsultation helpe d us improve our Principles and ot her key e lements which determin e how we run our busin ess. We will continue to cons ult - this report i s part of t hat process - to ens ure that our act ions are aligned with the values and expectations of the societies i n which we o perate. Making our po sition kno wn Shell com panies beli eve in the right to m ake their position known, eit her priv ately or publicly, on issues wh ich affect th eir business or their employees, such as stat utory low pay and politi cal detentions . We can also be of help in some cir cumsta nces wh ere our knowledge or e xpertise contri butes to the better understanding of issues a ffectin g communities and nations. W e realise t hat this must be do ne with sensitivity be cause it can easily be m isinterpreted as i nterference or trying to exercis e undue influence. Just Do It! Political payments in the USA The Sh ell Oil Company was re cently criticised for hel ping employees in t he USA to m ake contributions to the po litical c andidates o f their choice. At their request, donations were - and still are - deducte d from t he employees pay and sent directly to a political action committee made up of employees who deci de which c andidat es will receive financial support. S hell Oil also provide s a mec hanism for employee donations for uni ons and charities . This support for the freedom of choice for in dividuals is commo n practi ce among US companies. Such administrative help is seen as part of our com mitment to allow em ployee s the right to participate personally i n party politics. Employee invol vement A numb er of Shell em ployees have persona l involvement in local and comm unity politics, while ot hers have bee n grante d exte nded leave to stand for election and have t aken up politica l positions at nation al level. T hese are individua l matters and S hell compani es do not kee p figures. Helping to pictu re the future Shell has considerable exp erience at buildi ng scenarios - alter native pictures of how t he future could loo k. We use scenarios to help plan our own busin ess. The summaries of the two scenarios 'Just do it' and 'Da Wo' from th e Global Scen arios 1995- 2020 are featured below . We have also helped other organisations i n developi ng their own s cenarios in various subject areas , such as : ! ! ! ! sustainable developme nt with t he World Busin ess Coun cil for Susta inable Development in 1997 climate change with the Intergovernment al Pane l on Cli mate Change the Mont Fleur scenarios in South Afric a between 1990 and 1994, which helped shift governme nt thinking towards a democra tic system the Nigeria Scenarios in 1997 which were presented to the Vision 2010 Committee, and which perh aps uniquely brought toget her government m inisters, traditional leaders, special interest groups, NGO members, pub lic figures and business for the commo n goal of visioning a better future for Nigeria. We sh are our in ternal scena rios with key opinion formers in gover nment, inter- governmental i nstitutions, NGOs and academics . In this scenario, success comes to those who take adva ntage of quick-movin g opportunities in a world of hyper competit ion, customis ation, a nd rapid technological innovatio n.

Please read the Group Report for more detai l (see www.shell.comThis is only a brief s ummary of our progres s on HSE. Please read the Group Report for more detai l (see www.shell.com ). ! ! ! Every Sh ell comp any has adopted the Group Policy and Proce dures on he alth, safety and e nvironment. More than 90 c ompani es alrea dy have HSE ma nagemen t systems in place. The target is to have such systems in stalled in all companies by th e end of 1999, and to have an assurance proces s in place to ensure that t he targets are met . Indepe ndent auditors will ch eck adoption of the HSE Poli cy and Procedur es. Furthermore, they will check a representative number of com panies to assure themselves that t he data we collect and publish accurately reflects the HSE performance of t he Group. ! ! ISO 1400 1. Published by the International Organisatio n for Standardis ation (ISO), this is part of a new fami ly of environmenta l managemen t systems sta ndards, called the ISO 14000 series. ISO standards are recogn ised worldwide. Eco-Managem ent and Audit S cheme (EMAS ). This is the Europe an Union's environment al mana gement standard. EMAS is compatible wit h the ISO standard , but goes further to re quire conforming sites to report public ly on the results of regular audits wh ich must be verified by outsi de experts. Our pos ition is that all Shell compani es must have a certifia ble HSE man agemen t system in place by the end of 1999. In many cases this has already been achieved . For examp le, Shell refi neries Sweden, lubricant in Germany and exploratio n and production acti vities in Thailand have all received ISO 1400 1 accreditation. (see www.iso.ch) Improving road safety in Oma n In Oma n, company emp loyees have to do a lot of driving o n dirt roads, over long distances in intense heat. Such conditions increase the risk of a ccidents. Safety Life is a fundamental huma n right and the safety of all people at our sites i s paramount. We ta ke our resp onsibilities very seriously. Shell com panies train t heir em ployees and contractors to work safely and provide the necessa ry syste ms and techn ology to en sure their safety. They strive to encourage a culture of safety in the company and among t heir contractors. Our goal is no harm to peopl e. The accide ntal death of anyone working for us , includi ng those employed by contractors, must be reporte d imme diately to a mem ber of the Committe e of Managing Directors. Each case is fully investigated and action is taken to prevent s imilar acci dents from happening again. We dee ply regret that 8 emp loyees and 61 contractors lost their lives in 1997 worldwide, mostly in road accide nts. Shell compan ies continue to work har d to ensure that drivers are as well train ed and as safety cons cious as possible. We use two standard measures to gauge safety performa nce: Los t Time I ncident Frequency (LTIF) an d Total Recordable Cases Frequency (TRC F). They in dicate overall safety performance of employees and contractors against the tot al number of hour s exposed to work related ris k, and are ful ly explained in the Group HSE Report. Total exposure was some 290 million exposure hou rs for employees and some 444 million exposure hours for contractors in 1997. (These are interim figures only, see the Group HSE Report 1998 for verified data) . All employees o n our sites, inc luding those of contractors, are treated in t he same way. Safety dat a from contractors are collat ed to help in th e analysis of the cause s of acci dents and to help in o ur programmes to improve the safety recor ds of co ntractors. Petroleum Development Oman ( PDO) is particularly concerned about ro ad safety and is committed to reduce the number of road accidents and decrea se the risk of serious injuries they cause. Among the many initiatives introduced in 1997 are: ! ! ! on-the-road s pot chec ks of com pany vehicles and drivers by an independent road safety mo nitoring t eam mand atory train ing for all comp any and contractor drive rs in the interior of Om an under the PDO driving permit system an electron ic mon itoring system in the vehicle w hich recognis es good and bad driving behavio r. PDO's resea rch shows th at human behavior is one of the majo r contributing factors in accide nts - peo ple wil l break rules knowing ly, especial ly when they are alone and unsupervised in vehicles. This means, as a minimum , careful train ing of employees is es sential. But mor e importa nt, we have to conv ince t hem that the rules will really help protect them and other road us ers. PDO has signifi cantly im proved the road safety performa nce in Oman and will continue to do so through e ffective training, sustained vigil ance and accurat ely targeted safety ca mpaigns. PDO has been greatly he lped by the Gra nd Mufti, the highe st advisory officer for Islamic Affairs i n Oman. He addressed emp loyees and contractors in August 1997 and emphasised the sanctity of life and the religious an d legal co nsequen ces of wasting life by reckless driving. Debating the role of business a nd government \"A moral va cuum is appearin g ev erywhere cede authority to business\", sa ys Professor Homer Erickson of Miami Un iversity. \"The role of government is declining as is the old 70s and 80s agenda of rampant self-interest. The public is pressurin g business everywh ere to a ct responsibly\". Professor Erickson's view s reflect the sp irited global debat e about the respect ive and evolvin g roles of b usiness and govern ment in society. Some see govern ments volun tarily withdrawing, or bein g force d to do so by their constituenc y, from those areas of society where business can do a better job. This has led, in many so cieties, to t he privatisation of state-own ed businesses, such as telecommunic ations, airli nes and prisons. There are als o calls from t he media, gover nments and non-gover nmental organisations for business to do more than merely pay its taxes and create jobs. They want business, especially in the less develope d parts of the world, to deliver developme nt, fight corruption , provide schools and healthcare, and generally act as a stabilising influence on society. At the same tim e business is crit icised for exerting too mu ch influence o n society, for perpetuati ng the negative im pacts of globalisation, and having too much sway with govern ment. Th ese critics w ant business to play a muc h lesser role, or fo r the activities of multinational companies to be better controlled either through legislat ion or voluntary codes . In the face of these conflicting demands some compan ies have been slow to jo in the debate but many are lo oking more closely at t heir role in society. (For more infor mation see www.wbcsd.ch 7 The Communi ty The most important contribution th at companies can m ake to the social and material prog ress of the countries in which the y operate is in performing their basic ac tivities as e ffectively as possible. In addi tion Shell companies take a constructive interest in societal matters which may not be directly re lated to the business. Oppor tunities for involve ment - for example through community, education al or donations program mes - will vary depending upon the size of the company concern ed, the nature of the local societ y, and the sco pe for useful privat e initiatives. Performin g effectively The success of S hell's b usiness has a positive effect o n the communities of which it is a part. For examp le, Shell comp anies pay remuneration and relate d costs (totalli ng over US$ 6 billion in 1997) to more than 100,000 employ ees, and many more are employ ed by contractors who work with us, o r by our suppliers . We are widely involv ed in traini ng and coac hing of suppliers and contractors , whose skills are then be nefiting the loc al community. We realis e that communities want us to do more tha n simply pay taxes and leave the buildi ng of the necessary infras tructure to government, for instance roads , schools and hospitals. A Shell comp any is not, an d should never be, a stand-in for governmen t, nor is it a charity. But w hen invited , Shell com panies aim for mutual benef it through partners hip with communitie s, develo ping the abi lity of people to work t ogether for t he common good. Some people use t he term 'building social capital'. Community programmes Contributing act ively to communities through out the world h as always been very important to us. Responsi bility r ests with Shell comp anies wh ich address issues in their particular cou ntries, as well as with S hell International which supports societa l issues of international concern. We have a three-tier approac h. First, we provid e long-term s upport to a range o f comm unity activities within particular g eographic areas . For examp le, Shell Philippines has supporte d the Philippine Busin ess for Socia l Progress (PBSP) in itiative ever since it helped found the organisation in 1970. PBSP now has over 180 member companies and has worked with over 1,000 partner organisations and supported over 3,000 projects with fund ing in the region of US$ 50 million. Second, we promote sustained involvement in helping to deve lop and encoura ge bes t practice o n a particular s ocial issue. For examp le, we h ave ha d a role i n spreadi ng good mod els for small business develo pment acros s many countries . A programme c Livewire, which encourages a nd advises young entr epreneurs in starting and running their own businesses, wa s set up by Shell UK 15 years ago a nd is now oper ating in Australia, Bahama s, Chile, Hunga ry, the Netherlan ds, Oman and South Africa as well as the Unite d Kingdom. Schools educati on programmes , ranging from environment al awareness to road safety training , are also supported i n many countries in t he world. Third, we recog nise that as a global citize n we have o pport unities and responsibilities to help address the critical issues of the global community. She ll's internatio nal social investmen ts programme seeks issues fun damental susta inable developme nt, including economic developme nt, environmenta l care and social progress. The re port Shell 's Investment in Society features a number of ca se stud ies (see www.shell.com ). Helping community banks fund inner-city entrepreneurs Shell Oi l of the USA h as forme d alliances with two inner-city community banks i n a pilot programme to help provide fu nds for minority and women ow ned businesses and entrepreneurs. Shell commu nity financing com panies - especial ly set up for th e purpos e - will provide capital to expand the lending capac ities of the Unity Natio nal Bank in Houston and Fo unders National Bank i n Los Ange les. It is hoped that the funds will help rejuvenate the c ommunities served by t hese banks. If the tri al is a success the sche me could be extended to fou r more cities yet to be named, with a possibility of US $ 45 mil lion being invested i n the pilot project. \"Communities a re living entities that private and corporate c itizens must work toget her to sustain and grow,\" sa id Shell Oil's Presid ent and CEO Philip Carroll. \"This C ommunity Banki ng Initiativ e provides an e xcellent opportunity for us to help support the communities that support our company.\" Shell was born of free e nterprise. We believe in sustainable growth through meeting consumer needs in a responsib le manner. The best way of achieving t his is by free an d open competition . Highly regulat ed markets, a nd restrictions on trade, lead to inefficien cies, stagnation and less wea lth creat ion for all. (See Global isation and the role of multinatio nal compani es) Princi ple 8 Competition Shell companies support free en terprise. They seek t o compete fairly an d ethicall y and within the fr amework o f applicable compet ition laws; they will no t preven t others from compet ing freely with them. Even thoug h controlled markets can be very profitabl e for t he select few, we encourage countries to mo ve to free m arkets where compan ies can compete o n quality and service as well as price. Shell compani es are keen competitor s in one of the world's most competitive i ndustries, which is characterised by ng technic al challe nges and stiffer laws to protect safety and the e nvironment. In the last five yea rs, two ca ses have been reported i n whic h Shel l compani es were found to have taken anti- competitive acti on. Our main com petitive adv antag e is our ability to develo p and use advanced techno logy to i mprove the efficiency of our business. This, c ombine d with o ur financial strength, me ans Shell companie s can com pete fairly in markets all roun d the world. In one case, th e comp any was subject to tight stat e regulation o n refinery gate prices and mar gins, and failed to reduce the price at the same time as the regulation re quired. There was a fine of US$ 670. We strongly be lieve that living up to our Principl es is both right and goo d for our business. Such integrity and adherence to high sta ndards gives Sh ell comp anies a further competiti ve edge in the long-term. We also be lieve t hat free mark ets, consumer choice an d fair competition all contribute to a more free societ y. In the other, an EC Commission decision from 1988 relating to PVC, which had been annulled was re-issued against Shell Internation al Chemicals Limited. The business was fined 850,000 ECU. This decision is subject to a ppeal. In develo ped co untries, market competition agenc ies regula rly review competitive practices . This has involved Shell comp anies at least five tim es in Europe i n the last five years. It is a lso common for comp anies to challenge com petitors in the courts in today's highly litigious environment . Confidentiality and openness: uncomfortable bedfellows Companies are often accuse d of being secretive and ar rogant in the way they dismiss re quests for informati on from outsiders. Such attitudes are beginning to change as business realises that its s uccess depends on the approval of a broa d range of people, including those outside the organisation. \"Tomorrow's s uccessful company can no longer affo rd to be a faceless institution that does nothing more than sell the right product at the right price\", s ays an Economist editorial. \"It will have to present itself more as if it were a person - as an intelligent actor, of upright character that brings explicit moral judgem ents to bear on its dealings with its employees and the wider worl d.\" Business is sta rting to talk about a move away f rom a ' trust me' worl d of the past where people trusted business (and government) to do the best f or society, to a 'tell me' and increasingly 'show me' world, where business has to demonstrate that it is indeed doing the best it can for the broader s ociety. A 'show me' world means t hat business has to be far more open in its dealings with society and make much greater efforts to acc ommodate r equests for information. It is stru ggling to find a way of doing this while operating in a highly competitive mar ket wher e infor mation is highly valued and can be us ed by competitors to thwart succes s. The nec essity t o keep some i nformation confidential will always pr event bu siness - as it does for government - from being totally open about its activities. Successful companies will be those who find a balance where legitimate d emands for information are treated with openness rather than arrogan ce. Princi ple 9 Communic ations Shell com panies recognise that in view of the importance of the activities in which they are engaged and their impact on natio nal economies and in dividuals, o pen communication is essential. To this end, She ll companies have comprehensive corporate information programmes and prov ide full relevant information abo ut their activities to legitimately interested parties, subject to any overriding considerations of busin ess confidentiality and cost . Open commu nication Open commu nication Communicatio ns technology and the expectations of those who depend on Shell, or who are affected by our activities, have changed dramaticall y in recent years a nd continue to do so.

Our t raditiona l corpo rate cul ture has not necessarily enc ouraged openness. Bu t we are now trying hard to be more accessible and open in the way we deal with requests f or information , and in the style in which we communicate with employees in t he Group, the media, opinion formers and the general public.

We are also deter mined to li sten mor e and get involved in debate and dialogue. For examp le: ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! We organise regular meeti ngs with interested partie s around the wo rld to hear th eir views and expectations. In 1996 we held r ound-ta ble discussions in 14 countries to discover people 's attitudes towards multinatio nal compan ies and Shell in particular. We commissioned a glo bal survey by MORI in 1997 to get statistical data to support the fi ndings of our roun d-table discussion s. Our senior managers acce pt invitations to speak in a wide ran ge of forums. The speeches are published. Major effort is put into the trai ning of senior executive s and external affairs staff to help the m understand the issues which are of public co ncern , and to communicate clearly and accurately. This includes self-a ssessmen t meth ods b acked by compete nce developme nt programmes. We produce briefs on a wide range of energy-related and global issues, includi ng managing air qua lity and vehicle emissions, climate change and sustainable developme nt. These are posted on our website. Shell Int ernatio nal runs an award- winning website (www.shell.com). This has a discussion group dealing with matters of pub lic concer n. There are l inks to other sites, i ncluding those o f our critics. There are 28 link ed Shel l websites in different languages de aling with specific issues or region al interests. Notably there is a regularly updated site on the fate of the Brent Spar storage buoy with more than two years of discussion and information , and another on Shel l's activit ies in Nigeri a. Our websites are int eractive and we encourage debate. W e respond to 95% of enquiries within two worki ng days. We hol d informal shareholder meetings in the UK and t he Netherlands to keep in touch with private shareho lders in the parent compa nies. In January 1998 we held our first ever meeting with i nstitutional shareholders to talk about non-f inancial matter s. We have incre ased our public transparency by providing more opportunities for the i nternatio nal media to meet and que stion members of the Committee of Managing Directors 'on the record'. Such a c hange in attitud e is in line with what people expect o f us, and it makes good business sense too. This is bec ause it helps us understand the needs of a fast-changing world an d enables us to act quickly and decisively. Besid es our in ternal magazines and staff newspapers , we have an intra net (an interactive com puterised infor mation system a vailable to emp loyees via their computers) and in 1997 we lau nched a Group-wide satellite t elevision network, carrying real-ti me presentat ions by senior management, news and information abo ut Shell com panies and other relevant to pics. This Report is itself symbolic of the change in approac h withi n Shell, and is an example of our determinati on to be as open as possible in a hig hly com petitive world. Our plans to mana ge and measure social a ccountabi lity (see Road Map) implies a com mitment to t he developme nt of partners hips and dialogue with interested groups. We have an award-winnin g film and video unit w hich produces documentaries that contribute to world debat es on such issues as defores tation, water, soil erosion and poverty. The revenue generated for the local gove rnment by your operations represent s some 20 of the national GDP. Over th e last 50 years ther e have been se veral differ ent regimes in power.

For Shell's appro ach see B usiness Principle 5 Multination al compani es may have to d ecide whether or not to do business with a develo ping countr y where briber y and corruption are co mmon place and there is little regard for environmental issues: 1. should you go in and expose yourself to p ossible criticism tha t you a re willin g to enga ge in business with such a gover nment? 2. should you stay out and de ny the country and it s communities t he economic benefits your pres ence would bri ng - and indeed the financial return s your sh areholders migh t expect from such an opportunit y? 3. what would be the basis for y our moral s tand for either optio n?

In turn, this can lead to i nequalit ies and tensio ns. How can com panies tackle t his question? Would you pay local employees at international rates in the belief that t he wealth wil l spread to t he wider communit y? Would you pay local rates and face accusations of ex ploitatio n and dou ble standards ? Most people agree that the giving and receiving of bribes is m orally unacce ptable and undermines economic and political freedom . But at w hat point does a consultancy fee for exam ple one paid to an influential intermedi ary for negoti ating a major piec e of additio nal business - become a bribe? The company c ould take variou s forms of actio n: 1. view the co ntract as big enough so that it cou ld afford to pay the intermedi ary a sum equivalent to a small perce ntage of the total contract value and leave it up to him to decide how best to use the money 2. try to put the intermediary on a retain er - in other words, enga ge him on a short term co ntract to work for the co mpany 3. try to draw up a contract detaili ng what the consulta ncy fee mayor ma y not be used for 4. another course of actio n.

Human Righ ts Human rig hts are the universal rights which every human being is e ntitled to enjoy and to have protected. The u nderlyin g idea of such rig hts - fundam ental principles that should be respected i n the treatment of all men, women and chi ldren - e xists in some for m in all cultures and s ocieties. Such rights are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The declaration covers two broad sets of rights: one is known as Civil and Poli tical Rights; the other as Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. More detail from UN (see www.un.org ) and Amnes ty International (see www.amnesty.org ) and Ri ghts Watch Duty of busine ss Comp anies have a responsibility to resp ect the civil and political rights of t heir employees and many woul d acc ept that their suppliers and con tractors should act likewise. T here is still cons iderable debate o n whether bus iness can or should u se its influe nce with the governments of the countries i n which it operates to address broader issues of human rights. (see www.hrw.org ). Responsibilities of government Governments ar e held responsi ble for t he protection of hu man rights. The y must protect the life, liberty and security of t heir citize ns. They should guarantee that no-one is enslaved or subjected to arbitra ry arres t, detentio n or tort ure. Ever yone is entitled to a fair trial . The ri ght to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the right to freedom of expression are to be protected . Most multinatio nals c hoose to s tay politic ally neutral and not to interfere i n what they see as natio nal issues. But comp anies that play a major economi c role in a country are coming under increasing pressure from h uman righ ts groups and others to speak out agai nst human rights abuses or to dive st - particularly when com plaints to government s fail. Governments ar e exp ected to improve the living co nditio ns of their citize ns by, for examp le, guara nteeing the right to food , clothin g, housing and medical care, th e protection of the family and the rights to social security , education and employment - and to promote these rights without discrimination o f any kind. Campai gners argue that comp anies should recognise a dire ct self-interest i n promoting the preservation of hum an right s. The violation o f human rights often leads to c ivil instability and uncertainty in the inves tment climate . And even i n stable tim es, a lack of positive actio n from companies in this regard can damage co rporate reputati ons. Some comment ators have argu ed that t he idea o f univer sal huma n rights conflicts with the very specific characteristics of local or regional culture s and customs - or may vary in differen t religious con texts. However, th e govern ments of such region s have a rgued that s trict me asures curbing po litical freedoms were necessary to prime their e conomies, or that developm ent can be regarded as a separate as piration. This is despite the fact that at least half the 30 artic les of the Universa l Declara tion specify econ omic, social and cultural rights whic h constitute much of t he developme nt effort. Shell's Approach We s upport the Univers al Decl aration of Human Rights , and have made specific reference to this in our Business Principles. (See page 5) This is what we have done to ensure we act in the best possibl e way when co nfronted with human r ights issues. We speak out i n defence of hu man rights when we feel it is justified to do. ! ! ! ! It is abun dantly clear th at issues and pos sible courses of actio n differ accordi ng to culture and local co nditions. This mak es it important for Shell managers to be trai ned and fully briefed so that they have both the knowled ge and authority to take appropriate actio n in their particular circumstan ces (see page 6). We inc luded specific ref erences to human r ights in our Business Principl es when t hey were updat ed in 1997. This followed wi despread co nsultatio n with many di fferent interest groups, i ncluding those defending human rights. We en gage in discussion on huma n rights issues wh en making b usiness decision s. We conti nue to debat e the issues within the Group and work with human righ ts specialists to improve our understandi ng of the subject (see also Worki ng in Politically Sensitive Regions, page 38, see www.shell.com ). We have established a regular dialogue with gr oups which defend huma n rights. One such d ialogue wa s with Amnesty Internation al and Pax Christi together. This has subsequently been published by Pax Christi (March 1998) to assist others addres sing this topic (see www.antenna.nl/paxchristi ). We a re setting up Socia l Responsibility Managem ent Systems (see pag es 49- 51), designed to help in the impleme ntation of our Business Principl es, and therefore our sta ted support for h uman rights. ! ! We are develop ing awarenes s training and managem ent proce dures to help resolve human r ights di lemmas when they arise. This includes a guid e to human r ights for mana gers (see e 6). Climate Ch ange Shell's Approach Human activitie s, especially the use of fossil fuels, may be influenci ng the climate, according to m any scientists, i ncluding those who make up the Intergovernme ntal Panel o n Climate Change (IPCC). Curbing the use of fossil fuels ha s obvious business imp lications for Sh ell. Nonetheless, we share conce rn over the im pacts of potenti al climate change and believe t hat prudent precaut ionary meas ures are cal led for. The reducti ons set out in the Kyoto Protocol provide the necessary direction to encourage such measures. Gases present in the atmosph ere, such as water vapour, c arbon dioxide (CO2) and metha ne, keep the earth warme r than it would otherwis e be, by acting as an insulating blanket and trapping some of the sun's rays - th e natural green house effect. Shell com panies are committe d to play their part - and to help customers play theirs - in making the savings in energy needed . We feel stron gly that furth er research is needed to help the world better understand the potential impact o f climate change and we conti nue to contribute fu nds to make this happen. The burning of fossil fuels - coal , oil and natural gas - to gether with othe r human activities , such as defores tation, releas es greenhouse g ases, mainly CO2 into t he air. We thi nk agree d mechanisms to curb green house ga s emission s should be highly flexible and allow reductions to be carried out where they can be achi eved most efficie ntly and be of t he gre atest benefit to everybody. We welcome the po ssibility of emissions tradin g and partners hips betwee n countries to implement reductio ns jointly. Their concentr ation in the atmos phere has been risin g since the industrial revolution . This has led to an enhanced greenhous e effect and there is concern that it will c ause the world to warm up, whic h could le ad to a change in climate and local weather p atterns , possibly with increased droughts, floods, storms and s ea level ris e. The average temperature of t he earth has risen by about half a degree Celsius over the l ast century, possibly due i n part to gree nhouse gas emission s caused by human activity. The world ne eds to take actio n now. But we must do so carefully, appreci ating that the timesca le is necessa rily lon g, that our unders tanding will deve lop, and that the human costs of stunting economic developme nt would be very high. What the world has decided to do Most of th e world 's nations wer e sufficien tly concerne d to si gn a United Nat ions agreement , the Framework Convention o n Climate Change (FCCC), i n 1992. Industrial countries aimed to reduce emissions of greenhouse g ases to the level they were in 1990, by the year 2000. Very few countries will meet this tar get. Unfortunate ly many assertions about future climate are b ased on simplis tic extrapol ations of current en ergy trends, whic h lump a ll fossil fuels together. Th is ign ores their very differen t impacts . The carbon intensity of en ergy supply has steadily f allen as we have move d from wood, to coal, to oi l, to gas. All the world's estimated resources of convent ional o il and gas could be consumed without raising atmos pheric c arbon co ncentrations above t he limits suggested b y even th e most p essimistic observers. The r eal problem is with the very much larg er resources of carbo n intensive coal. At a conference in Kyoto (December 1997), stronger commitments under t he Conventio n were agreed. Rich countries wil l be legally bound to reduc e their greenho use gas emissions by at least 5% on average relative to 1990 levels, by the years 20 08 to 2012. This is th e first real step in what will li kely be a series of further in ternational negotiation s to tackle the issue globally. The dec arbonis ation trend will continue as the world moves towards a greater use of renewables and, possibly, other forms of energy. Wit h this in min d, Shell compan ies have been activ e for 20 y ears with res earch into the viability of renew ables and the developme nt and harnessing of techno logies . We thi nk renewable sources could be supplying 10% of the world' s energy by 2020, and perhaps half by 2050. Our past activities , our in clusion of re newables as a core business activity and our recent investmen t commitmen ts are discussed in more detai l on pages 9 & 44. Read on if you would like to know more detail on what s hapes our t hinking. What shapes our thinking We are i nfluenced by our view of sustainab le developme nt and the long-term energy scene. We bel ieve th at afford able, clean and reliabl e energy products are essential to sustainable developme nt: meeting the needs of the present w ithout compromi sing the ability of future generatio ns to meet the ir own needs. Fossil fuels sup ply around 85% of the world 's primary energy needs. There ar e no alternatives available now in sufficient amounts - at a price cons umers are willi ng to pay - to replace these fue ls. But we expe ct renewable sources to get cheaper over the next few de cades. This view is based on our work with independent experts to make educated guesses on wha t might happen in the future. We see three developme nts: 1. The eventual consum ption of m ost of the world' s conventi onal o il and gas, main ly because t hese fuels are hi ghly effective, convenie nt to us e, and easy to t ransport. 2. Use of co al will grow, but not to the same level a s some oth ers would suggest. 3. CO2 emis sions could p eak in the period 2020- 2030, at a level below that of many lo ng-term estimates made by others, inc luding governme nts. This would lead to st abilisatio n of atmospheric C O2 levels at just over twice the pre-i ndustrial l evel, close to the target propos ed by the Europea n Union. Help customers red uce their emission s. This is achieve d by providin g lower- carbon fuels, especia lly natural gas and renewable energy sources. Many Shell companies have promoted automotive LPG, a fuel wit h a lower c arbon conte nt than gasoli ne. Modern petrochemicals products made by Shell chemi cal operations allo w the substitution of energy-intensive materials, such as steel with less energy -intensive p lastics. This has helped reduce the weight of cars, improving fue l efficien cy. Furthe r improvements , albeit small in CO2 emissions, come from the additi ves used in fuels and lubr icants that improve or maintai n engine effici ency. Energy markets are changi ng fast. We have to pla n for this and do the best for the Group, our shareholder s and the broad er society. In short, Shell companies expect to do the following : ! ! ! ! ! ! Continue to produce oil and gas to fuel the next 20-30 years of econo mic growth, p articularly in developi ng countries. Growth is essential if fast- growing, and often poor, popu lations are to improve t heir living stand ards. This me ans we have to continue to fi nd more reserves. Provide more natural ga s. This fuel will be in high demand for the next few decades because it is abundant; can be converted e fficiently into electricity; is relatively cheap to fi nd and transport; and emits far less CO2 and ot her polluta nts tha n competin g fuels. We will continue to redu ce the amount of CO2 our fuels emit o n use by co ncentrating o n low-carbon m aterials such as gas and renewables . industry associa tions Shell com panies belo ng to many industry associations, so me of whi ch take a view o n climate change and lobby regul ators. One such lobby group is the Glob al Climate Coalition (GCC) of the USA. Until recently Sh ell Oi l in the USA had been a member of t he coalition. Following Kyoto it became clear that the respective views of the Shell com panies and the GCC were too far apart. Shell Oil withdrew its members hip in April 1998. The main disagreement centred on the Kyoto pr otocol whic h aims to cut overall gree nhouse gas emissions by 5% by the year 2012. The GCC is actively campai gning against l egally binding targets and timetables as well as ratific ation by the US government . The Shell view i s that prudent precaution ary meas ures are c alled for. Develop our b usinesses in gas-fired power generati on. Electricity is essential for developm ent and improvem ents in the qu ality of life, especially in developi ng cou ntries. Develop renewable energy sources. Reduce emissions from their ow n operations. Since 1992 we have reduced f laring of unwant ed gas by 20%, venting by 26% and the emissions of chloro fluoro carbon s (CFCs) an d halons by 85%. We are committ ed to cease cont inuou s flaring and venting by 2008. (Gas is produced as a by-product of oil productio n. Flaring refers to the burning o f unwanted gas. Vent ing is t he release of gas withou t burning. Natural gas and CFCs and halons are powerful greenhouse g ases. Flaring creat es CO2, the pri ncipal greenhouse g as). More informatio n is available on the Shell position (see C limate C hange brief on www.shell.com and recent spee ches by Group Managi ng Directors, page 56). Globalisation and the r ole of multinat ional companies Globalisat ion - t he com bination of much freer movement of capital and muc h freer trade i n goods and services around t he world - brings many benefits but is also caus ing dee p concern about it s social a nd environmenta l consequenc es. Some ional compan ies prob ably make the biggest contribution to - and benefit most from - globalisation, m ainly because t hey have t he infrastructure, te chnolo gy and access to fun ds to take advantage of t he many opportunities. It is estimated that the top 500 multinationals account for ne arly 70% of global trade and 80% of internati . The debate about globa lisation' s benef its and drawbacks , and the role of mu ltinationals in particular, is characteris ed by splits betwee n those who argu e that progress and the eradicatio n of poverty are bes t achieve d by allowing global markets to emer ge, and others who thi nk this is unlikely to ad dress human and environmental concerns adequ ately. Increasing direc t invest ment Increas ed by large companies in developi ng cou ntries can boost trade, create jobs, and help alleviat e povert y. Such investment, known as Foreig n Direct Investment (FDI), is on the rise and is fast replaci ng overs eas aid, whic h is shrinking as donor govern ments cut back. The key issue is wh ether markets sufficien tly encourage companies to tak e such conc erns into ac count, and to what ext ent new standards and corresponding n ew accounti ng tools are ne eded. FDI fi nancial risks that developi ng governments face if they borrow money from banks or raise it o n the capital markets. Compa nies bea r the r isk if their investments fai l. Both governme nt and the business benefit if the in vestment is successful, through ta xes paid and profits made. Inter-govern ment support for the idea of sustainable developme nt, whi ch gives equal weight to econo mic progress, e nvironmental protection and social res ponsibility, has intensifie d the debate . But many peopl e are deeply concerned that while multi nationals mig ht create competit ive compan ies in the develo ping world, th ey can also destroy loca l enterprises wh ich find it difficult to com pete. People feel powerless to affect the actio ns of multin ationals and often accuse such co mpani es of ig noring the ir socia l responsibilities an d rigging internatio nal regulations and c odes of conduct in favour of b ig business. Nothing new Free trade and capita l flows existed before the First World War, alt hough on a much smaller s cale than today. The end of communis m and the almos t universal support for market eco nomies, combi ned with improvements i n information te chnolo gy, have e ncourage d the trend towards globalisation. This has allowed thos e develo ping cou ntries which adopt policies compat ible with globalisation to grow very fast. In the 1800s it took Britain 8 5 years to double the income per pers on. China has achieve d the same in a dec ade. Those countries whic h have not benef ited tend to have adopted polici es which discourage trad e and investment. Multination als are also accused of operati ng double stan dards in areas such a s wages, safety and the e nvironment: paying lower rates in the developing world, and working to lower s afety and environm ental standards than they would in their hom e countries. It is, though, also acknowledged t hat multinatio nals w ith long-term in vestments - and which are also under public scrutiny - have suffici ent incentives to observe relatively strict standards worldwide. Globalis ation m eans that some businesses can now choose to make goo ds in one region of the world and sell t hem in others, constantly see king out t he most efficie nt locations. Investors too have the opportunity to look for the highest rate o f return in a growing numbe r of capital mar kets around the world. History sh ows th at such prosperity also brings deman ds for h igher s ocial and environment al standards . Shell compa nies, due to th e capital i ntensive nature of their operations, are long term investor s. In 1997 , the capital investment of Shell com panies worldwide was in excess of US $ 12 billion (see pie chart for breakdown) . In additio n more t han US$ 1 billion was spent in explorat ion worldwide. It would be short sighted for Shell companies to practice low standards at the beginning of the investment cycle , only to have to raise them later at much greater ex pense. Another major concern is t hat globalisation reduces the bar gaining power of low-s killed labour a nd increases job i nsecurity, and t hus contributes to poverty, in equality and socia l disintegratio n. This is bec ause production of manufactured goods can be moved from one country to anot her with relative ease, but workers are far more restricted in their ability to cross borders. The moveme nt of light manufacturin g compani es from t he USA to Mexico is a n example . Shell com panies do not prete nd to operate in an identical manner aroun d the world, althoug h some standards are g lobal by their very n ature. Th e importance of human life is the same world wide and She ll operates to t he same standard in the areas of occupation al health and safety. Companies workin g with natural resources - for exam ple m ining, oil and gas, and tree plantations - have to make lo ng-term commitments be cause of the c apital-i ntensive nature of th eir busin ess. Other standards to which we adhere must depend on local circumstances, such as the conditio n of a r egion's environment, w hat the customer wants and is willing to pay for, and the law. In any event, e ach She ll com pany has adopte d and will conform t o the Group's Statement of Ge neral Business Principles and HSE Policy. Some social a nd environm ental groups want, as a minimum, voluntary codes of co nduct for multinatio nals. There is also a deman d for legal instrumen ts which would pla ce greater control on the activities of multi nationals and force them to include socia l and environment al factors in their investment decision s. Standards The debate wit hin the Group on the issue of standards is aimed at achievin g the best policy to ensure that Group-wide s tandards bring t he intended benefits for Shell compan ies, the people who depend on them, and protection for the e nvironm ent. Special standards governing private a nd public enterpris e may be he lpful to consumers , workers and the public at large. The appropriate authorities should decide on these standards and Shell comp anies will then conform to t hem. The Business Principles act as a safety net against abus e or inad equate exercise of such authority. Such demands are often resisted by developi ng cou ntries becaus e they are s een as cultural im perialism, des igned to im pose a barrier to their developme nt by reducing their competitive adv antag e. Produc ers in emergin g economies a lso accuse regula tors in the deve loped world of creat ing barriers to trade by imposing environment al conditio ns on trade . Two examples are s tandards designe d to protect dolphi ns in the tuna fishing industry an d the environmental labelling of paper products in the Europe an Union . As a mi nimum, the Grou p supports the efforts of governme nt and inter-gover nmental organisations, such as t he Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developme nt (OECD), to intro duce measures like th e Multilateral Agreement o n Inves tment (MAI), which wil l enhance international inves tment within a sensible framework. In some ca ses it ma y be sensible to ha ve mand atory standards . Ideally these should be set as a result of dialogue betwe en the relevant i nterest groups. Where this is not possible - wher e governments are weak or uncaring - then internatio nal standards may be useful. The imposition of such standards creates many di lemmas , mainly because those who campai gn for th e standards are often doing so on be half of others who might, or mi ght not, appreci ate the help. Shell's ap proach Shell strongly supports globalisation as a way to ensure greate r prosperity for all. There are two key issues in the debate: the role of private ent erprise and the call for globa l standards . The princi ple of different standards is enshrined in a United Nations agreement (Principle 11 of the Rio Declaration of 1992), which m akes it clear that national environment al standards have to be effective but \"s tandards applied by some countries may be inappropriate a nd of un warranted economic and s ocial cost to other countries, in particular d eveloping countri es\". Enterprise In princi ple, private ent erprise is benef icial and it works be st when there is competition in markets. This pr ovides strong incentives to innovate and adopt best practi ce, whic h ultimately leads to hig her livin g standards . Operating in politically sensitive re gions Multination al compani es, especially those in the oil an d gas industries, sometimes op erate in politically uns table regions of the world, characteris ed by oppres sive regimes , civil unrest, armed in surgen cy and terrorist or guerrilla activity. Shell's ap proach We ar e very concerned by the human r ights issues a ssocia ted with politically sen sitive region s. We su pport the Universa l Declaration of Human Rights and all our actions are based on our Bus iness Principles . Energy is a state concer n and oil comp anies are inevitably involved in discussion s with the prevailing government, either b y licensing agreements, fisc al obligat ions o r through joi nt ventures with s tate-owned companies. The Group' s businesses are hig hly capital intensive and involve long-term commitments. We know from considerable e xperience that governments change , often for t he better, as has happened in South A frica and in the former Soviet Union. Our com mitments are to the communities and the nations in whi ch we operate, not just to the governm ent of the day. These rela tionships exp ose comp anies to criticism from human ri ghts and other groups which see t he involvement of business as an endorsement of government poli cies and actions. Security Other than human rights, two areas are of particular co ncern. One is the w ay companies organise their securit y operations and the other is the role o f forei gn com panies in joint ventures. We realis e that all private s ecurity arrangeme nts have to be handled with g reat sensitivity. The need arises only in exceptio nal cases when re quired by l aw, or when t he state has insufficien t resources to p rovide normal protecti on. We have establis hed a dialogue with Human Rights gr oups to ensure that our security guideli nes and actions reflect current think ing. Security Compan ies have a duty of care to provide security for their employ ees, as well as a responsibility to shareholders fo r the protection of property and information. The security risks ca n include malicious p ractices, crime, civil disorder, extremism , terrorism and armed co nflict. As ordinar y citizens, compan ies would ex pect t he state's forces of law a nd ord er to give a ppropri ate protectio n against the more serious threats to peo ple and property . However, they would be expecte d to provide routine sec urity of their own as sets, which may include guarding. This can s ometimes be seen as runn ing private armies or us ing and paying for troops and police from an oppres sive regime. Nigeria is a good ex ample of where security is neede d. Shell Petroleum Deve lopment Company (SPD C), the Shell company i n Nigeria, has reviewed its security force guideli nes agai nst three Unite d Nations documents: UN Basic Princ iples on the Use of Force and Firea rms by Law Enf orcement Officers; UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials; and UN Pocket Boo k on human right s for the Po lice. As a result, and in line with t he Statement of General Business Principl es, the guideli nes were update d to inclu de explicit reference on the need to respect and protect human dignity and upho ld the human rights of all persons. Joint vent ures Some campa igners argue th at compan ies in joint ventures wi th the state, even if they are minority shareholders , should use their influence - or t heir own resources - to ensure higher levels of pay, better standards of safety and environment al protec tion, and to defend human rights. Joint vent ures We are i nvolved in a number o f joint ventures around th e worl d. In some, t he Shell company is the majority shareholder a nd totally in charge . In ot hers where it ho lds a minority sta ke it migh t be responsible for running t he daily affair s of the joint ventur e, but it do es not necessarily control the decisions made by the ve nture a s a whole , (as in Nigeria , see be low). In all minority ventures where a Shel l comp any has a substantial i nvestment (greater t han 20%) it makes a conc erted ef fort to see t hat the Principl es or a c ompatib le set of Princip les are acce pted by partners . Shell com panies will no longer f orm joint ventures where partners decline to ado pt Business Princip les compati ble with ours. One of our dilemm as is how to deal with existing joint ventures w here partn ers curren tly reject such Principles, or fail to imple ment them. But budget cuts and cons equent reductions in production me an that planned projects and publis hed impro vement targets will h ave to be resch eduled. Earlier promises on environment al improvements will not be met on time. The case whe n Shell com panies are a significant shareholder, but wit h a minority stake, c an pose many dilemmas , especially in the are as of pay, and health, safety and environment . What does a Shell com pany do when f aced with this situatio n? Some say it alone should make up for the shortfall, eve n if this is not its responsibility under the terms of the jo int venture. Such action would not only fai l its investors, but it could also enco urage other joint venture partn ers to make s imilar an d probab ly unfair dema nds. Take Nigeria. Shell Petroleum D evelopme nt Company (SPD C) is the o perator of a jo int venture on behalf of the government-owned Nigerian Natio nal Petroleum C orporation (NNPC - 55% interest), Shell (30%), Elf (10%) and Agip (5%). The partners fund the operations i n proportion to t heir shareholdi ng. This is clearly a difficult area and provides us with a dilemm a we are working hard to resolve. The jo int ve nture's partners recommende d a business programme for 1997 which, includi ng com munity and envir onment projects, cost some US $ 1.9 bil lion. This was dependent on funds being made avail able to cover the NNPC 's 55% share from the government's 1997 budget, which has to balance the growing ne eds of a natio n with many deve lopment and econom ic challe nges. It becam e clear in February 1997 that sufficient fu nds were not goi ng to be availa ble from t he governme nt. The jo int venture' s budge t was reduced by 40%, which led to major cut s in its activiti es. SPDC managed to maintain the comm unity programme at US$ 32 mi llion and spent US$ 94 million in 19 97 on environm ental improvement projects. Deali ng with industri al legacies Most companies involved in manufacturing and heavy industry have to de al with environment al problems created by past activities, of thei r own or a predecessor's making. In some ca ses th e practices wh ich led to these are no longer ac ceptable. For example, paint m akers ofte n own property conta minated with lead, w hich used to be an ingred ient in paint before it was known to be harmful to he alth if ingested. The soil on sites of old municipal gas fa ctories is usually contami nated with co al tars. Heavy industry often o wns property contaminated with chem ical solvents used for degreasing . Oil productio n compan ies own platforms and other instal lations that are no longer neede d and oil distributors often have t o deal with ground cont amination from fue l which has slowly leake d from storage tanks. Much of th e industrial contami nation o f soil does not pose an imme diate hazard, as long as the property is left un disturbed. Contami nation which is an immediate threat to peop le and the environment , such as contami nated ground water, us ually has to be cleaned u p, in most countries as a matter o f law, with the company responsible bearin g the cost. National laws differ on the responsibilities compan ies have to be ar for his torical contami nation, and the level of remediation required. Ge nerally, contami nation reduces the value of both the property and t he companies who own it. Public co mpani es operating in t he USA are required by Securities and E xchange Commission regulations to disclose large environmental exposures, such as contami nation. The accounts of these companies ofte n show provisions which have been mad e for the cost of future clea n up. Shell's approach Clean ing up co ntamin ated soil and water is the responsibi lity of the companies who own the sites. As par t of their Commi tment to HSE, Shell comp anies un dertake to assess contami nation and to put co ntrol an d remediation plans in place. The compa nies have to make decisions on rest oration based on conditions o n the spot and work closely with loca l authorities. The disposal of obsolete oil platforms and other ins tallations is controlle d by natio nal laws and internationa l agreements. For examp le, in the UK, the process adheres to the Inter national Mari time Organisation guideli nes, an approach contained wit hin the UK Environme ntal Protectio n Act. This allows, in some circums tances , for a portion of t he installation to be left , providi ng there is adequ ate water cleara nce. Before this is allowed to hap pen the requirements of OsparCom (an alliance of 12 nations bordering the North Eas t Atlantic) mus t be met. Unless there are specific legal stipulatio ns on how ins tallations are to be decommis sioned, Shell com panies come to an agr eement o n the best option with regulators and will also consider the wider social implications . Our experie nce with the Brent Spar has taught us that sticki ng to the letter of t he law is not enough. We need to dispose of installations in a way that is also acceptable to the broader s ociety. Protests were vo cal and physical. They ranged from the person al interv ention of senior politic als in several Europ ean countries, to the occupat ion of the Spar by Greenpea ce activists. There wer e violent attacks on Shell service sta tions in German y, with 50 dam aged, two fire-bo mbed and one raked wit h bullets. In the face of such pu blic o pinion against its plan, Shell UK halted the dispos al and the Spar was towed to a moori ng in a Norwegian fjor d while its final fate was decide d. Tests by an independent Norwegian foundatio n, Det Norske Veritas , disproved claims by a 'toxic timebom b'. Greenpe ace later apologis ed. Dialogue leads to Brent Spar solution Brent Spar, the redundant storage and loading buoy which w as the centre of controversy ove r plans for its deep -sea disposal in 1995, will be used to build a quay extension near S tavanger in Norway , if the plan meets official approval. The original plans, which were given statutory and governme nt approval, wer e oppos ed when t he time came to c arry them out. Protesters felt that the sea should not be used as a dum ping ground an d were concern ed that ot her oil ins tallations would be disposed of in t he sam e way if the sinking of t he Spar went ahead. Many false allegation s were made but th ese were difficult to rebut in t he highly-char ged atmos phere of confrontatio n that prevaile d at the tim e. A two-year dialogue process then started with a series of meet ings in Denmar k, Germa ny, the Netherlands and the UK to help Shell UK identify a soluti on by gatheri ng a wide range of views - know n as the Brent Spar Dialo gue. Shell UK cons ulted with non-gov ernmenta l organisations, opinion formers and exp erts on the best disposal optio ns. Participants were asked for th eir opin ion on the issue, an d later on in the selection process, to help choose betwee n the shortliste d options for t he Spar's disposal. This unique co nsultation exercise has helped to promote a different approac h to dec ision makin g in the Group, an d has shown n ew ways in which Shell co mpanies can be more open and ac countab le (see t he Brent Spar website www.shellexpro.brentspar.com ). The dieldrin wa s provided by aid agencies as a strategic stock for the control of locusts in the 1960s and 70s. The licence to use the material was later withdrawn w hen newer products becam e available - but the stocks remained. Wit h time the stores posed a potenti al threat to the environm ent and communities. As the makers of the di eldrin we took responsibility under our co mmitment to Product Stewardship to help in the disposal. Shell Int ernatio nal Chemicals provided technic al advice , assistance and trainin g, and paid for the transport and high-temperature incinerat ion in the Netherlands. Product Stewardship in Mauritania In 1997 Shell Intern ational Chemicals complete d a pr oject with t he non profit- makin g German Agency for Technic al Co- operation (GTZ) an d the govern ment of Mauritania to remove an d safely dispose of 186,000 litres o f obsolete dieldr in insecticide and some 1,500 contaminated storage drums from sites around Mauritani a, North West Africa. Earlier collabor ative projects wi th GTZ provided i nvaluable learning on how to deal safely with obsolete pesticid es. Further projects are un derway with the intentio n of disposing of all unwant ed dieldrin stocks. Shell's multipart y approac h to the disposal of obsolete p esticides is being used as a mode l for similar oper ations elsewher e. In 1993, working with the Gabon government and a re presentati ve from the WWF, S hell Gabon s et about r eturning an area surroun ding 26 d isused sites to a conditio n where the environme nt could recover n aturally.

How to help th e environmen t heal itself removing al l debris, or burying it if removal was more damagin g Shell Gabon has b een work ing with the Gabon govern ment a nd the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to rehabilitate disused exploration areas in the coun try's forests. clean ing up and filling mud pits stabilising the sides of th e platforms to minimise erosion and limit surf ace water run-off Gabon, in West A frica ha s some of th e largest oil reser ves sout h of the Sahara and is rich in tropical r ain forests. Shel l Gabo n has been working i n the cou ntry for over 20 years. breakin g bridges and destroying acces s to roads and tracks to avoid re-use seeding the sites and tracks to s peed natural regener ation o f veget ation. Early exploration, mainly in the 1960 s, led to the bui lding of bridges and rou gh roads made from crus hed s tone; clearing of sites to accommod ate drilling platforms also made from crushed stone; erection o f engineering equipme nt, concrete cell ars, flow-lines and the di gging of mud pits to stor e waste hydrocarbons . In 1996 the job was completed to the satisfaction o f the Gabo n gover nment and the WWF. Shell Gabon is using its knowledge to plan in ad vance for the eventual rehabilitation of its producing si tes in the country. When insufficien t oil wa s foun d, most of th e infras tructure was abando ned as was common pra ctice at the time. The roads and clearings were subsequently used by other oil compan ies and by loggers . The work has le d to the initiatio n of standards, proc edures and tools which are being used by other S hell comp anies worldwide. The experie nce als o underli nes the need to incl ude re habilit ation in the planning of new explor ation ventures - now considered best practice by responsible compan ies. The creation of additio nal plantations is a positive mea ns of abs orbing CO2 when mature trees are used fo r tradit ional uses such as paper a nd timber. In spite of the benefits, tree plantatio ns can cre ate controversy. The issues include: Renewable Resourc es One answer to t he challenge of achievi ng sustainable economic development i n the face of fas t-growing populatio ns is the developme nt of locally -based re newabl e energy sources, sup plying local ma rkets. the type of land used and t he conditions under whic h it is acquired and occupied ! ! ! ! ! ! what hap pens to local people when trees are pl anted and what benefits or disadvant ages result Technologies to exploit renewa ble energy sources, such as wind, sun and biomass (plant matter), are developi ng fast. But e xcept in niche markets none can yet compete effectively wit h the convenie nce, cost and efficie ncy of fossil fuels. This, o f course, will change as popu lations grow, re quiring energy sup plies that fossil fuels ca nnot deliver. Renewa ble resources are exp ected to provide betwee n 5% and 10% of the world's energy within 25 y ears and t he market s hare could grow rapi dly after t hat, perhaps expanding to half by 2050. what ty pes of trees are grown how the plantati ons are managed how wild life and ecosystems a re protected what the impact is on water supply. All of these issues must be a ddressed in t he planning and management of plantations. This trend will substantial ly affect the vi ability of thos e energy compan ies whic h are re liant on fossil fuels. Furthermore, the environment al drawbacks of a continuin g dependence on such fuels - ma inly emission s and exploration in socially and ecologic ally fragile regio ns of the world - have led to c alls for oil com panies to invest much more in t he developme nt of renewables . Renewa bles are clearly set to play an increasingly imp ortant part in satisfyin g the world's need fo r energy and this provides energy compani es with pote ntially attractive opportunities. Shell's ap proach We have been exper imenting with r enewa ble energy technologies for 20 years. In 1997 we made a commitment to invest US$ 500 million over five years in renew ables and in the process created another core business, Shell Int ernatio nal Renewa bles. That this business wa s set up demonstrates the Group 's commitment to the developme nt of renewables . A substantial shift a way from fossil fuels will certain ly reduce man y of the environ mental risks involved in finding , transporting, proces sing and using oil, gas and power, although renew ables are not totally free from environment al and social impacts. The burning or gas ification of biomass is considered environmental ly sound when converted to use able energy wit hout harmful emission s. This is b ecause plan ts regrown for this purpose absorb as much c arbon dioxide as they rele ase when burnt, and therefore do not incre ase the conce ntration o f greenhouse gases in the atmosp here The decision illu strates how inte gral environment al issues are to business. The need to en sure a susta inable form of developme nt worldwide is helping drive the market for ren ewables , as is the glob al pressure to reduce the amount of carbo n dioxide emitte d to the air. Shell Int ernatio nal Renewa bles will devote most of its effort to th ree a reas: solar electricity, forestry a s a business in its own right and biomass power gener ation. Forestry and Bi omass Power Wood is a key source of renewable energy. It is converted i nto energy by co mbustion and is ideal for small-scale power s tations in the developi ng worl d. Solar power Shell com panies have invested i n plantation forestry since the early 1980s and have gaine d considerable experience in all aspects of the business, includi ng the environmental and social issues. For exam ple, we worked with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) to produce t he Tree Plantatio n Review, a series of 12 reports on a ran ge of social, economic and e nvironmental issues that affect the developme nt of forest ry plantations. Shell Internation al Renewabl es recent ly prepare d revised guideli nes for safe work ing practices and environme ntal manageme nt of tree plantations. Solar We ex pect t hat the cos t of prod ucing photovoltaic panels could drop at the rate o f 6-8% each year over the next 20 years. This would mean that 10 years from now, the cost of solar electrici ty could be thre e times cheaper th an it is today . The experience of Shell comp anies with pi lot systems in both sunny and cold clima tes shows how effe ctive and useful the tec hnolo gy can be - however fos sil fuels are che aper to use. We are wo rking to re duce the cost of makin g solar panels and look ing at new techno logies to i ncrease the ef ficiency of conversion from sunlight to elect ricity. As part of the process, each o f our plant ation compan ies is committed to achieving IS O 1400 1 certification, the first hav ing been accredited in July 1997. We have a team working o n a design for a 10 MegaWatt manufacturin g line whic h can be set up anywhere in the world, d epending on loc al conditions. Solar and Biomass combined The two t echnol ogies can be combine d in what we c all a 'sun station' to supply villages and small towns with an uninterrupted s upply of electricity. We are also investigating other techno logies , such as offshore wind farms, to see how our expertis e can help to develo p a range of energy technolo gies. A Personal View We invite d John Elkington to contribute h is person al thoughts on the challenges that Shell companies, and like min ded enterprises, face as they set about embr acing the concept of s ustainable development. John Elkington , Chairman of SustainAbility; Member, EU Consultative Forum on and Sust ainable Development; author, Canni bals With Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Busin ess. Why we decide d to work with Shell I should explain Susta inAbility's decision (a s a values-led co nsultancy) to wo rk with Shell. For two years after the Brent Spar and Nigerian controversies, my colleagues an d I fende d off requ ests for help from various parts of the Shell Gr oup. There was no disputing Shell's n eed, but our logic wa s simple. F irst, rightly or wrongly, we sensed that m any Shel l executives were still i n denial. Second, we believed we coul d better leverag e change from ou tside. And, thir d, we work with the environmenta l, human rights and developme nt movements : even had we wanted to sa y yes, a link-up would have been unacce ptable to many of our o wn stakehol ders. But we ke pt a watchi ng brief and - late i n 1997 - accepted an invi tation to meet and challenge a range of to p She ll people , includin g chairman-design ate a wi despread recognitio n that S hell mus t now perform a gainst what we dub the 'triple bottom line' o f sustainable developme nt. Can Shell account for the triple bottom line? More specifically, we were impr essed by: Cor Herkstr\u00f6ter's he Committee o f Managi ng Directors' clear commitment to the new accounta bility Road Ma p (see Message from the C hairma n and Road Map); the developme nt of Exploratio n & Production's sustainable developme nt guid elines; and the formation of the Shell Renewab les business (see Issues & Dil emmas), with c lear market share targets. Given th at a sustainable oil com pany is a contradictio n in terms , we were als o intrigue d by the brief of the new Shell Chemicals executive vice-p resident respons ible for sustainable developme nt. It not only covers health, safety and environment (HSE), but also such 'mainstrea m' areas as stra tegy a nd planning, portfolio ma nagem ent, mer gers and acquisitions , and joint ventures . The implicat ion: sustainability considerations will help reshap e the Shell Chem icals portfolio of businesses over time. Ho pefully, the approach will sp read to oth er Shell businesses. The sustainable developme nt community , meanwhi le, must develo p its toolkit for triple bottom li ne accountability and management . Offered th e opportun ity to embark on a multi- year work programme with Shell's new Social Accountability Team, we consult ed our own internatio nal Council and Facult y - and joint ly conclude d that the time had come to commit . This is an open- ended experimen t, requiring exten sive piloting in Shell b usinesses. We will report regularly on the experience an d outputs. If sustainabl e development is to become a global reality rather th an remain a seductive mirage, governments, communi ties, compan ies and individua ls must work together to i mprove their 'triple bottom li ne' (economic, social and environmental) performance . To this en d, we not only need new forms of accountabi lity but also new forms of accounting. This does not m ean that every aspect of a company's performance c an - or should - be reduced to a 'common currenc y' of money values. But if we are to m anage a given comp any's performa nce effectively we a lso need to be able to measure it. We must find accurate, us eful and credible indicators of progress in terms of economi c prosperity, environment al quality and social justice. Sustainable value creation Companies exis t to create wealt h, so the most direct contri bution they can make to sustainable developme nt is to create lo ng- term value on an economica lly, socially and environmentally susta inable basis. A key 21st century challenge, i n short, will be 'sustainable value creation'. But how ca n we meas ure progres s agains t the emerging econo mic, socia l and environment al performance i ndicators? Try to benchmark S hell's - or any other company 's - performance against Shell's Statement of General Busin ess Prin ciples and you will fin d it hard, if not impossible. In part, this is a problem o f data avail ability. But it als o reflects weaknesses in accou nting theory and the fragment ation of standards and metrics i n this field. This is a proble m both for outsiders, who increasingly want to trac k corporate performance , and for compa nies like Sh ell. To create long-term trus t and s harehold er value, com panies need to ma nage t his complex new agenda, but to do so both compan ies - and their s takeholders - mus t be able to me asure progress agai nst the triple bottom li ne. What about shareholder value? At the heart of the emerging sustainable value creation concept is a recognition that for a company to prosper over the long-term it must continuously meet society's needs for goods and services without destroying natural and social capital. The approach does not necessarily imply a new concept of what companies are primarily for; rather, it extends the time-horizon over which the full range of a company's - and its shareholders' - interests should be assessed. But it also, as signaled by stakeholders in Shell's 'Society's Changing Expectations' consultation process, demands a deep shift in corporate culture, values, decision-making processes and behaviour. Happily, the evidence suggests no fundamental conflict between sustainable value creation and long-term shareholder value added. The real difference is that for value creation to be sustainable, a company must acknowledge and manage the full range of relevant economic, social, ethical and environmental costs associated with its activities. Shell International has now assembled an internal Social Accountability Team, pooling resources with Arthur D. Little (ADL) and SustainAbility, to develop a range of 'total net value added' metrics. The indicators will be developed with inputs from Shell's internal and external stakeholders. What would triple bottom line accounts cover? Unfortunately, these new forms of accountability have taken most parts of the accountancy world by surprise, with most accountants ill-prepared for the challenge. Even financial accounting, evolving for 500 years, is still developing rapidly. There are huge debates, for example, over how to account for new financial instruments like derivatives. Environmen tal accounting has a much shorter history, of perhaps 20 years, with most progress made in the 1990s. And, while embryonic versions have been around for some time, social and ethical accounting and auditing are only now getting into their stride. So we need intense, focused efforts not only to develop these three different forms of accounting but also to evolve frameworks which enable the results to be increasingly integrated - to ensure both full accountability and efficient business operations. Let's look briefly at each form of value in turn. Economic value added : The scale of Shell's economic contributions is indicated by the figures for its sales (1997: over US$171 billion), sales taxes (1997: over US$43 billion) and total taxati on paid (1997: over US$50 billion). Shell focuses on 'Return on Average Capital Employed' (ROACE), but another approach - 'Economic Value Added' (EVA) - is promoted by US investors concerned to know whether given companies or industries are adding or destroying value. The profits a company makes are adjusted for the costs of the capital employed. A linked concept, Market Value Added (MVA), calculates how much value a company has created since it was founded. To measure total net value added, however, EVA and MVA values will need to be adjusted for the linked impacts - both positive and negative - on natural, human and social capital. The internalisation of such costs and benefits represents one of the greatest challenges both for business and for accountants. Environmental value added : Among other things, we must adjust our measurements of wealth creation and profit with a charge for the natural capital employed - and, in the case of non-renewabl e resources, often consumed for a one-off benefit. Our natural capital is a combination of renewable and non-renewable resources. Even in the case of renewable resources, the most important values are not in the timber produced by a forest or in the fish produced by a sea, but in the ongoing capacity of such ecosystems to produce yields on a sustained basis. Some types of natural capital may be substitutable by technology and other forms of man-made capital, but most are not. Even companies pioneering in the environmental accounting field have typically not yet integrated environmental accounting into their mainstream accounting, although some are working in this direction. Key barriers include the lack of a standard methodology, the fact that accountants and auditors lack environmental experience, the difficulties involved in identifying environmental costs (particularly in companies pursuing integrated investment strategies), and the valuation of liabilities. Social value added : The ultimate bottom line for any project or business must also be adjusted for impacts on human and social capital. In the case of human capital, we must account for knowledge and skills developed or lost. In the case of social capital, the focus might be on the levels of resilience, mutuality and trust in communities, be they villages, mega-cities or world regions. New benchmarks are emerging, among them Social Accountability 8000 (SA 8000), developed by the US Council on Economic Priorities (CEP), and the revision of the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) sixteen environmental principles to embrace emerging social requirements. New organisations like the UK-based Institute for Social and Ethical Accountability (ISEA) aim to bridge the divide between the different forms of accounting, auditing and reporting. But the social accounting challenge has hardly begun to be addressed. Total net value added : Despite the barriers, we will see significant progress made on triple bottom line accounting, auditing, reporting and benchmarking. There will be huge debates about who sets the standards and how to value particular outcomes, but our understanding of which technologies, which companies and which economies are adding or subtracting value will be transformed. Working with the Shell Social Accountability Team and ADL, we aim to evolve a better picture of the total net value added by Shell.

A background briefing paper will be available on the web in due course (see www.shell.com ). Writing this m essage has bee n on my mind throughout the preparatio n of this Report. How, I wondere d, can I succeed in expressing my thoughts which ar e both rati onal and passionate about the c hanges taking place in the Royal Dutch/Shell Group? Fundame ntal to this is our commitment to support s ustainable develo pment and to embody this in our strategic pl anning and the daily con duct of our b usinesses. It's true that this document - and more importantly , the planned Social Responsibility Managem ent System of which it is a part - are entirely logical un dertaki ngs, as significan t for our b usinesses a s any other commercial activity. It would be quite wrong to cast the proc ess in anything other than sane and sen sible terms. But I know too , as someone who has been at the ce ntre of the Transf ormatio n of the Group, that it is about much more th an sober facts and soun d figures. It in volves the p assions and fee lings of t he people who make t he Royal Dutch/Sh ell Group wh at it is. Peo ple from differe nt backgrounds and cultures, all held toget her by a common de sire to do their business with integrity so th at they ca n hold their heads high in their commu nities and among t heir families a nd frie nds. That such determination exists, and is so strongly imbedded in our organisation, makes me feel particularly proud of t he plans we have put in motion to rei nforce the ethical underpinning of the Group as it enters its ne xt hundred years. We bel ieve fu ndament ally that there do es not have to be a choi ce between profits and princi ples in a respon sibly run enterprise. Our plans reac h into the very heart of our corporate culture an d pulse thro ugh the entire organisation, i n every corner of the world. They are base d on our commitm ent to contribute to s ustainable develo pment and the concept of social accou ntability. This represents my personal commit ment, it is the commitment o f all my co lleagues on the Committee of Managing Dire ctors, as it is of the whole of the Group. It is tempting for me, as I prepare to retire, to look back with nostalgi a on an eventful and exciting past, but I find myself only looki ng forward. Forwa rd towards the fruits of what has been sown in the 1990s - plans that will help ensure a sustainable future for the tens of thousands of people who wor k within Shell and the hundreds of thousands who be nefit in so many ways from our activitie s, now and i n the future. The Road Map shows details and timi ngs of those plans - i n the co ntext o f earlier developme nts. Like any long journey through uncharted territory, I'm sure there will be good a nd bad times with ma ny unex pected problems and difficulties. We m ight not get to all the targets o n time and there will inevitab ly be detours, but I kno w we will eventually attain our stated o bjective: to provide the necessary evidence so that ot hers may judge if Shell is l iving u p to its princi ples. Thank you for r eading this far. Please use t he \"Tell Sh ell\" secti on to let us kno w what you think of us, how you would like us to improve and how you migh t tackle some of the issues we face on a daily basis. We might not alway s agree w ith your views , but I promis e they will be taken seriously. Cor Herkstr\u00f6ter (Chairman of t he Committee of Managi ng Directors) April 1998 We s hall also seek to develo p an approa ch to calculat ing the 'net value' which Group compan ies add to the world in a given time frame by t aking into account ou r contribution to the t hree com ponents o f sustainable developme nt. Much of our plan ned efforts will be pioneeri ng. To impleme nt the changes outlined globally, fo r a Group of such complexity, is a major undertak ing. But we are determi ned. We will seek help and believe th at through our efforts we will also have muc h to offer. We look forward to working with like-minde d comp anies and organisations i n furthering developments i n this area. The conce pt of 'net added value' is not new but the challe nge is how to apply it in practice to an enterprise the size of t he She ll Group. It will re quire measures of performance different from t hose used in conventio nal financial accounti ng. If this approac h is to have cre dibility or value in helping comp anies a ssess th eir overa ll contribution to society then the basis on whi ch it is calcu lated will ne ed to be broadly recognis ed an d accepte d. Our goal is to have our responsibilities to stakehol ders and society at large clearly seen as an essential part of t he Shell culture an d sustainable developme nt integral to all decision m aking. The sectio ns in t he menu det ail the key compone nts to the challenge ahead and the Road Map provides the time line. The Roa d Map details how we aim to achieve this. It places ou r plans in t he context o f past developme nts but more importantly charts the road a head. Sustainable Development Shell com panies are fully commi tted to contributing to sustainabl e development and are under no illusions about th e difficulties . There is little practical expertise in t his field and implement ation will be a lengthy proces s of develo ping in-house knowledge and learning from outside exp erts. A start has been made with the writing of a practic al guide for She ll Exploratio n and Production compan ies. Our actions will at all tim es remain relev ant to our commer cial objectives. We are under no illusions about the difficulti es but w e are determine d to work with ex perts in t he field to ex plore this approac h. We believe t hat it has the potenti al to steer rational debate about t he responsibilities of companies i n the co ntext of their contributio n to sustainable develo pment and to help foc us on areas for improvement. We know it could take m any ye ars to achieve . Our intentio n is to develo p ways for consistently monitoring, meas uring a nd reporting p erformance in a manner aligned to the expectations of society and our Statement of Ge neral Business Principles. This framework will encomp ass the t hree compone nts of s ustainable development (finan cial, environment al and social) a nd the Report will reflect th e underlying values, systems and performa nce in an integra ted mann er. It will draw upon i nternal and external engage ment activities. We call t his framework of v alues and proce ss our S ocial Responsibility Ma nagemen t System. Standards Reporting Social ac counta bility standards are slowly beginning to e merge, although no universally agreed, compre hensive set e xists yet. Current standards are limited i n scope and do not meet al l our nee ds. The reportin g structure will gra dually evolve towards an integrated approa ch reflecting the compone nts of s ustainable development. As yet there are no established m ethodologi es or standards for doing this. We aim to pl ay a constructive role in helping in their developme nt internation ally. We will see k ways to collat e and report meani ngful perf ormance me asures which can be independently verified by external auditors . We will seek to work with companies and other interested groups in the se tting of standards . Our involvement will not necessarily mean that we will adopt or endors e the entirety of any standards set, unless there is a clear re levanc e to our businesses. We will explore options o n how we can obtain an independe nt view (as surance) of whether we behave as we claim. To ens ure accuracy , Reports will be based on data backed by an extern al ver ificatio n proces s, genera ted by a Social Responsibility Managemen t System (of wh ich future reports will be a part) a nd based on standards consistently applied t hroughout the Group. Releva nt standards and meas ures of performance are mature in the financial area and becomi ng establis hed for HSE. They are fragmented and inadequate in the social dimension. Those that do exist have not yet achieve d internationa lly recog nised status. The o bjective is to establis h ambitious standards whi ch take i nto account the size and complexity of the Group's worldwide operations. W e may nee d to cre ate certai n standards ourselves and select the rest from those which em erge. We will re port on progress. The approach taken by Shell will be guided and enric hed by an extensive process of internal and external engagement, which will influe nce decisions in daily operations and activities. Social Accountability and Social Responsibility Management Systems Terms are evolving and 'accountability' and 'responsibility' are of ten used to mean the same thing in the literature. In future both could be replaced with alternatives which more aptly describe the concepts and processes referred to. For the purposes of this Report we use the term 'Social Accountability' to mean the over- arching ambition of an organisation to be accountable to its stakeholders and society at large. It embraces the need for an organisation to act responsibly in contributing to sustainable development, and be accountable for its performance through externally verified reporting to pre- determined standards and performance criteria. It also implies a suitable degree of transparency with re gard to the basis on which decisions are made. We use the term 'Social Responsibility Management System' to mean the framework of values and process by which the needs of social accountability are met. The sheer size of the Group, the complexity of its operations and the huge differences in social structures throughout the world, means that the systems will have to be tested in a number of operating companies first before they are adopted across the Group. Consultants Arthur D. Little (ADL) have been commissioned to help in assessing existing systems and develop thinking in this area. Progress will probably be made in steps, both in terms of the scope of the framework and its application across Shell companies. We see that many components of the framework are already in place and that there is much best practice to embody. There will be an inevitable need to design and adopt new procedures but we are determined to keep this to a minimum by using existing ones as far as possible. Once the framework has been shown to be workable all Group companies will adopt it. External verification We distinguish between the accuracy of data, and the assurance process by which the quality of performance against stated objectives can be judged. Accuracy . KPMG and Price Waterhouse - auditors to the parent companies - will check the integrity of the data generated by management systems. They have been chosen for their professional ski lls, their infrastructure which exists in over 100 countries in which we operate, and their familiarity with Shell management systems. The scope of their verification will depend on the availability of cons istently generated data. This is a new area for auditors and we realise that they will need to gain additional experience in the field. Financial reports have been subject to rigorous audit processes for many decades on the basis of increasingly sophisticated control and audit mechanisms. The Group HSE Report, and underlying HSE reports of the key businesses, are developing rapidly in the direction of reporting fully verified data generated on the basis of HSE Management Systems which will be in place in all Shell co mpanies by the end of 1999 at the latest. Assurance process . We have yet to resolve how assurance can best be achieved. There are a number of possibilities, including: the use of the traditional auditors who are developing their expertise in this area; the use of new firms who specialise in this form of assurance; inviting non-governmental and other organisations to revi ew specific areas of the Group's activities; or a mixture of the three. We will explore all of these options. Engagement - encouraging a dialogue with critics and interested parties - is the essence of social accountability. Our aim is to gain the acceptance of those who have an interest in the Group's activities - our stakeholders - and to try to match or exceed their expectations of us. We distinguish between internal and external engagement. Internal engagement. A structured process of dialogue with employees has been tested. The aim is to find an effective means of engaging all staff in understanding what social accountability and sustainable development mean to them and on how these concepts can be embodied in the way we live up to the Business Principles in the daily conduct of our businesses. External engagement. We see consultation with a broad group of non-governmental and other organisations and opinion formers as essential to the success of our social accountability plans. This involves understanding their expectations. Engagement is a two-way process, which gives us an opportunity to underline how we see our responsibilities and to set out the social boundaries of our commercial organisation. The dialogue process could evolve from consultation to co-operation and eventually to some form of alliance with key stakeholder organisations. Finding the right partners is a difficult process and we will do it in a structured way, helped by independent experts. We may get it wrong occasionally and we are prepared to be corrected. Our consultation process started several years ago and it will be ac celerated in 1998. We will report on progress.
