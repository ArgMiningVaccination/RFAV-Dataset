Key Definitions The term \"populations that experience health disparities\" refers to NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations which currently includes Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities ( [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/)). The term \"health care models\" refers to the different existing or newly proposed models of patient-centered care. Examples of existing health care models include the Chronic Care Model, the eHealth Enhanced Chronic Care Model, the Community-Based Transition Model, the Nurse Management Model, the Home-Based Model, the Integrated Delivery Systems Model, the Patient-Centered Model and the Value-Based Care Models. The term \"multi-component\" refers to the different components of the health care models (e.g., health care system organization, clinician decision support, clinical information system, patient self-management support, delivery system design, and others). The term \"multi-level\" refers to the multi-dimensional framework of determinants relevant to understand minority health and address health disparities. This concept is further described under the NIMHD Research Framework ( [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/)). Background The increasing prevalence of U.S. adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) has posed several clinical and public health challenges, especially in providing preventive services, increasing awareness among those at highest risk, attaining optimal treatment and control of coexisting MCCs, and subsequently preventing fatal or disabling complications. The proportion of U.S. adults with MCCs has also continued increasing, and it is estimated be 42% or higher, varies by U.S. state, and is higher among adults aged 65 years and older, although the proportion of adults younger than 65 with MCCs has been steadily increasing. The prevalence of MCCs could be twice as high among persons living in poverty compared to those living at 400% or more of poverty level. Adults from some racial or ethnic minority populations have experienced a greater increase in prevalence of MCCs, especially those aged 45-64 years, compared to Whites. In addition, the rate of preventable hospitalizations and visits to the emergency department related to individual chronic conditions such as pulmonary diseases, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and to MCCs tends to be higher among populations that experience health disparities, including racial or ethnic minorities, those without health insurance or optimal health insurance coverage, and some rural communities. The significant costs associated with these preventable events deepens the financial hardship experienced by many of these patients and their families, which could also be experiencing disabling complications associated with MCCs. Over the last two decades, there has been a loud chorus of calls for fundamental change in the care of persons with chronic diseases in the U.S. Workgroups led by the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) and HHS have identified challenges associated with the attainment of recommended care goals for persons with MCCs, including: delivery system issues (for example, lack of or suboptimal care coordination, integration of primary and specialty care, and subspecialty referrals); limited understanding on the best integration or prioritization of guidelines of care within the context of coexisting conditions or risk factors, and the risk of polypharmacy and undesirable adverse events; patient-centered priorities (for example, patient's expected outcomes, quality of life, out-of-pocket affordability); and payment or reimbursement issues for clinicians and health care systems (for example, lack of reimbursement for some services). Also, the frequent exclusion of persons with MCCs from clinical trials precludes the generation of necessary evidence that would inform the optimal integration of new treatments into real-life clinical settings. At the same time, strategies to address these challenges, include \"facilitating research to fill knowledge gaps\", and \"scaling up interventions that reach all people\", and especially \"disadvantaged populations disproportionately affected by chronic illness\". Several health care models have been proposed that intend to incorporate broad approaches to the management of chronic diseases. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) emphasizes the central role of productive interactions between the patient and the health care team and proposes the integration of six elements -health care organization, community resources, patient self-management support, delivery system design, health care provider decision support, and clinical information system. The CCM catapulted the proposal of other health care models (for example, the eHealth Enhanced Chronic Health Care Model, the Community-Based Transition Model, the Model for Developing Complex Interventions in Nursing, the Home-Based Model, the Integrated Delivery Systems Model, Team-Based Care, Family Management Framework, and others, in which components of the CCM have been expanded or enhanced. More recently, the Value-Based Care Model (VBCM) has gained increasing interest. In the VBCM, value (or value proposition) is defined as health outcomes (or quality of care) achieved per dollars spent. It has been proposed that under the VBCM the integration or organization of multi-disciplinary or multi-specialty care for co-existing chronic conditions, the assessment of costs and health outcomes, and the integration of health care information technology platforms that are patient-centered and support easy management of medical data could lead to an effective value-based health care system. Some of the health care models mentioned above, or interventions in some of their components, have demonstrated improvements in disease-specific health outcomes or the facilitation of care coordination. Nonetheless, the impact of these models on attaining optimal control and prevention of complications associated with MCCs has not been fully tested or evaluated. Very importantly, an underlying commonality to many of these models is the focus on payment or cost-reduction as a central or primary trigger around which interventions are implemented. However, attainment of optimal health outcomes as a central goal (instead of cost reduction being the main aim) in any model needs further study. Moreover, there has not been enough research evaluating the impact of these different health care models on health outcomes such as reduction of preventable complications, prevention of hospitalizations or readmissions, improved quality of life, proactive health care delivery, engagement and effect on patient caregivers and representatives, and direct and indirect health care costs for persons with MCCs from populations that experience health disparities. Research Objectives The overarching goal of this FOA is to support innovative, multidisciplinary, and multi-level and/or multi-component research through existing or newly proposed health care models designed to optimize the care of persons with MCCs from U.S. populations that experience health disparities through the adaption, integration, and implementation of evidence-based or recommended guidelines of care for different and coexisting chronic conditions with a holistic perspective, and focused on attaining optimal health outcomes as the primary goal. The integration/implementation of multiple guidelines of care should be set to accomplish optimal treatment and recommended health outcomes goals to reach health equity, and not merely demonstrating improvement in health outcomes. For the purpose of this FOA, chronic diseases of interest are those that have the highest prevalence and/or are associated with the greatest burden of morbidity, disability, and/or mortality among populations that experience health disparities. These diseases/conditions include: obesity, diabetes and its complications, cardiovascular diseases (include coronary artery disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke), cardiometabolic disease risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia/dyslipidemia, tobacco smoking, prediabetes), cancer and its complications and risk factors, chronic respiratory diseases -especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma-, sleep disordered breathing, cognitive decline (including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, substance use disorders, chronic kidney disease (including end-stage renal disease), osteoarthritis and other chronic musculoskeletal diseases, mental health conditions (including anxiety and depression), diseases and disorders of the visual system, and diseases and disorders of the auditory system, including deafness and other communication disorders. Studies would be expected to be performed in clinical/health care settings that provide health care to and include in the research design sufficiently diverse patient populations (for example, >50% patients from populations that experience health disparities), thus allowing appropriate health outcomes/health equity comparison analyses. Ideally, more than one population that experiences health disparities would be represented in the patient population of interest, unless geography or other circumstances would posit limitations to do so. Limited-resource institutions and health care settings are of high-priority under this initiative. Research teams could include investigators from both limited-resource and high-resource institutions. Within the context of such partnerships, is expected that investigators from limited-resourced institutions will assume primary responsibility for the study design and execution, while investigators from high-resource institutions are expected to provide scientific expertise and technical assistance to less research-intensive institutions to successfully execute research activities. Given that the bulk of research activities will take place in limited-resource institutions and health care settings, it is expected that at least 60% of direct costs will be directed to those institutions and personnel. In addition, investigators from limited-resource institutions who are assuming primary responsibilities should be assured key personnel status. Although most studies on MCCs have focused on adults, some studies have highlighted the increasing prevalence of children with chronic diseases, especially asthma, and their unique health care needs. Therefore, projects focused on the health care of children with MCCs are also of interest. Under this FOA, research may take place within the context of at several potential scenarios involving existing health care models within established health care settings, or studies involving the proposal of new health care models. Within the context of existing health care models, examples of research projects include pilot interventions or small-scale projects integrating recommended or evidence-based guidelines of care for more than one chronic condition by involving more than one element or component of the existing models. These components may include health care organization and intercommunication, connection with community resources, patient self-management support, clinical information systems, clinicians intercommunication, access and affordability of necessary pharmacotherapy, case management, and others, or more than one level of influence (per [NIMHD's Research Framework](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/nimhd-framework.html)). Larger-scale studies for which pilot data or small-scale success have been documented, or the comparison of the effect of different health care models on health outcomes (for example, comparing an experimental model or interventions within a model with a standard model), are also examples of research projects within established health care models. Proposed multi-component or multi-level interventions should move beyond already studied interventions such as those solely based on a single component such as patient navigation. Within the context of new health care models, research projects could include pilot tests of the implementation of guidelines of care through the combination of elements or components from different models or propose completely brand-new health care models. Considering the complexities of health care and gaps in research demonstrating the impact of different health care models on health outcomes for persons with MCCs in the U.S., and especially those from populations that experience health disparities, it is imperative to think what can be done differently. Within this context, attaining optimal health outcomes based on evidence-based guidelines and patient-centered goals through health care models that adapt to patients' health care needs, personal goals, resources, and limitations is the primary aim of this initiative. Examples include but are not limited to personal health outcomes that patients hope to achieve, especially related to health insurance coverage, out-of-pocket expenses, lost wages, time that health care would demand, physical/mental function and independence, well-being, life expectancy, social/occupational engagement, burden of diagnostic/surveillance tests or procedures or treatment, and complexity of self-management tasks), In addition, examples of strategies that need to be tested within the context of care of patients from populations with health disparities include the seamless integration of multiple levels of health care professionals and supportive personnel in a comprehensive and holistic care plan; algorithms and decision support tools for clinicians; and strategies that prevent unnecessary readmissions that account for the natural recovery of the underlying chronic diseases, incorporate early outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge, telehealth, or home-based rehabilitation or clinician visits. Furthermore, understanding the feasibility, affordability and sustainability of such models would be critical for their long-term success. The initiative will support interventions (especially multi-component or multi-level interventions), clinical trials (including cluster-randomized trials, pragmatic trials), natural experiments (e.g., impact of health care and non-health care policies), mixed-methods, quasi-experimental studies, time-series quality improvement studies, and evaluation of proposed interventions within existing health care models or newly proposed health care models. Recipients under this initiative would be expected to use common data elements (CDEs) for patient demographics and social determinants of health (refer to the [Phen-X Toolkit](https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/)), as well as for clinical conditions measurements or assessments and clinical outcomes. Specific Areas of Interest Areas of interest include but are not limited to: Other Institutes' Specific Research Interests: National Institute on Aging (NIA) NIA has an interest in the use of innovative models of care that are effective when the person living with chronic conditions also has Alzheimer's Disease or a Related Dementia, and whether such models change outcomes such as cost, quality, access, or care coordination for people with MCCs and Alzheimer's Disease or a related dementia. NIA has an interest in the use of innovative models of care for Medicare beneficiaries with MCCs. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) The mission of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases. In the context of this FOA, the NIAMS is interested in the use of innovative health care models, on both individual and community levels, to reduce and encourage elimination of health disparities in patients with MCCs within the NIAMS mission relevant diseases. Research areas include rheumatology, orthopaedics, dermatology, metabolic bone diseases, heritable disorders of bone and cartilage, inherited and inflammatory muscle diseases, and sports and rehabilitation medicine. Clinical trial applications will only be supported by NIAMS if submitted to a NIAMS clinical trial-specific FOAs. A current list of active NIAMS clinical trials FOAs is available at [https://www.niams.nih.gov/grants-funding/conducting-clinical-research/grants](https://www.niams.nih.gov/grants-funding/conducting-clinical-research/grants). Applicants are encouraged to discuss potential applications with the appropriate NIAMS program director. National Eye Institute (NEI) The National Eye Institute (www.nei.nih.gov) supports basic and clinical research into diseases and disorders of the visual system and the special needs of people with impaired vision or who are blind. NEI is particularly interested in research of improved methods for delivering vision care and rehabilitation in underserved populations including people in urban and rural settings with MCC. Research topics may include but are not limited to telemedicine, screening and automated diagnosis, medication adherence, quality of life, and rehabilitation strategies for those with vision loss. NEI would only support clinical trial applications for this FOA that fulfill the NIH requirements for either a mechanistic or minimal risk trials. A mechanistic trial is designed to understand a biological or behavioral process, the pathophysiology of a disease, or the mechanism of action of an intervention. A minimal risk trial is one in which the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. National Cancer Institute (NCI) NCI Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) DCP leads, supports, and promotes rigorous, innovative research and training to prevent cancer and its consequences, to improve the health of all people. DCP is interested in research that supports its mission by using innovative models of care to improve the health of individuals with multiple chronic conditions from populations that experience health disparities (as defined above under \"Key Definitions\" as well as adolescents and young adults and older adults). Examples of research areas of interest to DCP in these populations include but are not limited to models of care and strategies that: Division of Cancer Control & Population Sciences (DCCPS) The mission of the NCI Division of Cancer Control & Population Sciences (DCCPS) is to reduce risk, incidence, and deaths from cancer as well as enhance the quality of life for cancer survivors. DCCPS is interested in supporting research that develops, evaluates, and/or identifies key components of care delivery models designed to improve cancer-related outcomes for individuals with MCCs, their caregivers, and communities. Examples of research areas of interest to DCCPS include, but are not limited to, models of care and strategies that: Applicants are encouraged to discuss potential applications with an NCI Program Contact for this announcement or other appropriate NCI Program Director. National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) NINR supports research that builds the scientific foundation for policy and practice across clinical and community settings, and advances the prevention, detection, and management of disease and disability. Drawing on nursing's holistic perspective, NINR supports observational, intervention, and translational research that integrates factors at multiple levels to identify their role in health, health improvement and health inequities in varied settings. These settings include hospitals and clinics, people's homes, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, justice settings, and communities. For this PAR, NINR is especially interested in research related to multiple chronic conditions that tests models of care including those listed in the PAR as well as Nurse-managed Health Center Models. Research is encouraged in these areas: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) welcomes applications in which disordered communication processes, including diseases or conditions affecting hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language, are a component of the MCCs being examined within populations who experience health disparities. Populations of interest include both pediatric and adult. Examples include, but are not limited to: The Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) The ORWH is part of the Office of the Director of NIH and works in partnership with the 27 NIH Institutes and Centers to ensure that women's health research is part of the scientific framework at the NIH and is supported in the larger scientific community. ORWH uses a multidimensional framework to represent the intersection of factors that underlie patterns of disease and determinants of health outcomes in populations. Biomedical research that considers sex and gender influences, alongside race, ethnicity, social class, and other biopsychosocial and cultural factors, will enhance understanding and inform community-based strategies and healthcare practices most likely to result in improvement of health outcomes and resources for all segments of the population. A growing body of work notes a higher level of chronic disease burden, earlier onset of multimorbidity and the compounding effects of multimorbidity alongside greater risk of poorer multimorbidity trajectory among racial and ethnic minority groups. Given the increased recognition of health and healthcare disparities, interventional research will need to leverage multicomponent care models to optimally manage the health of persons with MCCs from such populations. Applications proposing approaches which consider individual and higher-level determinants of health/healthcare disparities and explore the intersectionality of sex, gender, race and other biopsychosocial factors in the implementation and evaluation of evidenced-based models are of particular interest. For additional guidance on areas of interest to the ORWH, please refer to the 2019-2023 Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for the Health of Women on the ORWH website ( [https://www.nih.gov/women/strategicplan)](https://www.nih.gov/women/strategicplan)).\" The following types of projects are not considered responsive to this FOA, and will not be reviewed.

Criteria Note: Effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023, the Data Sharing Plan and Genomic Data Sharing Plan (GDS) as part of the Resource Sharing Plan will not be evaluated at time of review. Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. In addition, for applications involving clinical trials: A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Scored Review Criteria Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms?

Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm](//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm) and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). 2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159), including of note, but not limited to: If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions. Should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html) HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA.
