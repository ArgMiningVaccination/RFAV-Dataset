A strong immune system helps to combat the invasion of foreign particles and consequently resists the diseases. Vaccination is such a context becomes imperative as it strengthens an individual's immunity. In vaccination, antigens or germs are given in very small doses. They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to fight against that particular infection. Vaccinations are provided to both children to protect them from a number of diseases. However, different vaccinations are provided at different ages according to the susceptibility to diseases. Some of the vaccinations that are provided to newborns are: 1. Hepatitis B vaccine: This vaccination is given in order to prevent the child from having Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a liver disease that if persists can lead to liver failure or even liver cancer. This vaccine must be injected immediately after the birth of the baby. The first dose must be followed by administering a second dose within a span of a month or two. 2. Rotavirus Vaccine (RV): This vaccine, taken orally, prevents the infant from Rotavirus. This virus causes vomiting and diarrhoea in children that often leads to severe dehydration. This vaccine is administered within two to four months of the baby's birth. Sometimes, on a doctor's prescription, a second dose may be necessary for the sixth month. 3. Acellular Pertussis Vaccine and Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids: This is a combination of various vaccines that protects the child from tetanus and diphtheria. Newborns are extremely prone to diphtheria that causes fatal illness and sometimes even deaths in children. This vaccination thereby, is extremely important and must be administered within two or four months and must be followed up with secondary doses later under the doctor's supervision. During [pregnancy](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pregnancy), [flu](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/flu) (influenza) can impose serious health implications for both the mother and the child. Due to pregnancy, the risk of developing complications like [pneumonia](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/pneumonia) are very high, which can pose as a problem during childbirth. [Miscarriage](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/miscarriage), low birth weight, premature birth are some of the major issues, which might develop if the mother has suffered from flu during her pregnancy. Although flu [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) during pregnancy has certain risks, it has been observed that in most cases the benefits of [inactivated](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/inactivated-influenza-vaccine) influenza vaccine outweigh the risks. However, Live attenuated influenza vaccine is not recommended at all during pregnancy. Recommendations across the world suggest that prevention of influenza by administration of inactivated influenza vaccine is the best intervention in pregnancy. The vaccine for Flu should be administered before the onset of flu season. RANZCOG, NHS UK, RCOG, FOGSI recommends inactivated flu vaccine for all the pregnant women unless there are any contraindications. Taking inactivated influenza vaccine can be beneficial in multiple ways: Some concerns Often, one [fear](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fear) about the vaccine, is the development of Gullain Barre syndrome. This is very rare and the risk of GBS are higher following influenza like illness. Also, if the patient is allergic to eggs they are advised to consult a physician. Flu vaccines have traces of egg [protein](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/protein-benefits-sources-and-side-effects) in it. Certain precautions are taken after studying the patient's medical history.

The current guidelines suggest to take primary vaccination like bcg/ easysix/pentavac/ mmr on priority basis on time Precaution to b taken is to inform prior to visiting hospital n avoid crowding. Booster vaccination can b delayed Vaccines are not just for kids; the human body can be vulnerable to viruses during any time period of life. It is important for an adult to get vaccinated regularly, else there are always chances that some virus or infection may attack you in a severe way. Let's look at some of the vaccines adults should get for a healthy and ensured life:Pneumococcal Vaccine - This vaccine protects the human body from diseases like Pneumonia and Meningitis. Who should get this vaccine? How many vaccine shots should I get? PCV 13 and PPSV23 is prescribed to the elderly over the age of 60. PCV13 is to be taken at first and PPSV23 to be taken one year after the first shot. Hepatitis Vaccine - Strains of Hepatitis Viruses like A, B and C attack the Liver and can cause Liver failure in adults. There are vaccines to prevent the human body from Type A and Type B. However, there's no vaccine for hepatitis C yet. Who can get it? When to get it? Hepatitis vaccine can be taken during any time of the year. Vaccine options for Flu: Vaccine options for Typhoid: Vaccine options for Pneumococcal: Vaccine option for Hepatitis A: Vaccine for Hepatitis B: Human body is vulnerable throughout its life. Deadly viruses can attack our body anytime, and we must stay prepared and ahead of them. The vaccines mentioned above would help in avoiding some of the common but dangerous diseases. Human Papillomavirus ( [HPV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hpv)) is a group of 200 viruses. 40 of these are transmitted through direct sexual contact. The infections from papillomavirus can cause [penile cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-penile-cancer) and anal cancer, [oropharyngeal cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-oropharyngeal-cancer), vaginal cancer in women. The Human Papillomavirus is used to prevent such diseases. Transmission and [infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/infection) from HPV The symptoms of the HPV infection usually develop years after the first contact. Therefore, there is a huge possibility of transmission of the virus during intimate. HPV virus may be of a high-risk variety or a low-risk variety. The high-risk HPV produces two proteins. These deactivate the tumour suppressing genes. This leads to abnormal growth of cells that causes cancer. Cervical cancer is the most common form of HPV infection. In India over 1,22,000 women are diagnosed annually from HPV related cancers. Of them, 67,000 women die annually. Thus, India has the highest HPV related deaths in the world. Using [HPV vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/doctors-for-hpv-vaccination) when a person becomes sexually active is the only preventive method. HPV Vaccine HPV vaccine is used to produce [antibodies](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/torch-screen-antibodies/health-feed) against the virus that prevent them from infecting the cells. It contains virus-like particles. These are not [infectious](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/infectious-panel/health-feed) despite having the structure of a virus. The vaccine promotes antibody production and prevents future infections. HPV vaccine is quite effective if an individual is immunised before becoming sexually active. The [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) requires three shots given over a period of 6 months if you are beetween age 13-26. All girls before marriage should take this vaccine. It is single best vaccine which can prevent genital cancer in women. Yearly [flu](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/flu) [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) is the best tool currently available to protect against influenza (flu). While how well the flu vaccine works can vary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a yearly flu vaccination as the first and most important step in protecting against flu and its potentially serious complications. Millions of people have safely received flu vaccines for decades. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctors' visits, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations. A flu vaccination does not guarantee protection against the flu. Some people who get vaccinated might still get sick. However, people who get a flu vaccine are less likely to get sick with flu or hospitalized from flu than someone who does not get vaccinated. Why do I need to get vaccinated every year? New flu vaccines are released every year to keep up with rapidly adapting flu viruses. Because flu viruses evolve so quickly, last year's vaccine may not protect you from this year's viruses. After vaccination, your immune system produces [antibodies](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/torch-screen-antibodies/health-feed) that will protect you from the vaccine viruses. In general, though, antibody levels start to decline over time \u2014 another reason to get a flu shot every year. Flu vaccines bring down the risks of suffering from flu. However, its effectiveness is based on different factors. Age: Usually, the flu vaccine happens to work the best for healthy adults. However, these vaccines cannot work as well with children, especially infants (below the age of 2-3 years). Nevertheless, the efficacy improves with age. Since older people are more prone to contracting the flu virus, it is essential that they get themselves vaccinated. Even if the vaccine is not able to ward off the flu entirely, it can still help reduce the risks to some extent. General Health: Vaccine spurs immunity into action. It helps your body in identifying and fighting the virus. The efficacy of the flu vaccine solely depends on the capability of your body's immunity system and how well it responds to the virus. Chronic illnesses weaken your body's defense mechanism and with a poor immunity system, the vaccine may not work properly. The time of the vaccination: For optimal protection, it is advised to go for the vaccination every year right before the 'flu' season starts. This is because after the flu season gets done with, old vaccines may not work as effectively. The flu vaccine needs to be updated every season to guard you against the kind of flu dominant in that particular year. Getting yourself vaccinated is also not a guaranteed foolproof protection, however, it does render partial immunity and helps reduce the severity of the symptoms. However, it should be noted that flu vaccine cannot shield one from cold viruses.

[HPV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hpv) refers to Human Papillomavirus. This is a common virus, which has got more than 100 different types and over 40 of these types are transmitted sexually. This virus may cause [cervical cancer](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cervical-cancer) and cases of [genital warts](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/genital-warts). It is likely to occur in people who are sexually active to contract genital HPV, and it is not accompanied by any signs or symptoms. The virus is transmitted via skin to skin contact and is severely [infectious](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/infectious-panel/health-feed) in nature. Using condoms may reduce the risk of spreading of this virus, but is not always successful. There are two major vaccines for HPV. Reasons for [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) against HPV HPV vaccines are recommended to girls between 11 and 12 years. It is also given to girls and women between the age of 13 and 26 years, who have never been vaccinated against HPC before. These vaccines should be given to females before they start being active sexually and get exposed to the HPV virus. Sexually active females benefit from these vaccines as well, but the effect is less. Here are three reasons why you should vaccinate against HPV: HPV vaccines are a series of effective vaccines, which prevent the occurrence of cervical cancer and other cancers which are sexually transmitted. They are generally given to women before getting sexually active to prevent transmission of HPV viruses. Some HPV vaccines are prescribed to males as well. If you wish to discuss about any specific problem, you can [consult a doctor](https://www.lybrate.com/pune/doctor/dr-ramesh-maheshwari-sexologist-1) and ask a free question. Human Papillomavirus ( [HPV](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/hpv)) is one the most common sexually transmitted virus and an [HPV vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/doctors-for-hpv-vaccination) protect you against this virus. It is estimated that HP infects at least 50% of the population during their sexually active phase. Although the virus is not a deadly type of a virus asit goes away on its own, in some cases, it can lead to anal, throat cancers and [genital warts](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/genital-warts) as well. The common vaccine [Gardasil](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/gardasil-vaccine/health-feed) is the common form of HPV vaccine that is routinely given for such conditions. It is given to people who're between the age group of 9 and 26. HPV vaccine is not fool-proof as these don't work effectively against all types of HPV. But, these vaccines are effective against the high-risk [strains](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-strains) that account for nearly 75% of all cervical cancers. The vaccine is also effective against the cancer of the vagina and vulva. The correct dose The vaccine has a virus-like strain but it is not the actual virus. The patient is given three doses over a period of six months, and there are no side effects associated with it, apart from giddiness and instances of fainting spells (in some cases). However, these are only passing phases and should disappear in some time. Small facts It's always advisable that you consult a well-trusted doctor before going for one of such vaccines. Thanks to marketing gimmicks, many people can be misguided into this, so it's always better to know if you're the right person for this or not. Check your report with a doctor, and then decide. Recently, Gardasil 9 was approved by the medical associations and this strain of vaccine is far more effective than its counterparts. Above all the vaccination should not be taken without consulting your [gynaecologist](https://www.lybrate.com/gynaecologist). In case you have a concern or query you can always [consult an expert](https://www.lybrate.com/obstetrician) & get answers to your questions! There are a variety of reasons why a person can fall sick. A good number of these illnesses cannot be prevented though a person may take general precautions. Having said that, in the case of influenza, it can be prevented to a large extent and it does not seem all that smart to avoid taking easy precautions when one has an option, right? Every year, thousands of people die from influenza, which is so unfortunate because an annual shot can reduce that number by almost 60 percent. So what exactly makes a [flu](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/flu) shot or vaccine work? As a result of the vaccine, after about two weeks or so, [antibodies](https://www.lybrate.com/lab-test/torch-screen-antibodies/health-feed) begin to develop in the body. These antibodies help fight off [infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/infection), specifically the kind that is targeted by the vaccine. It is important to get vaccinated for this flu on an annual basis. Choosing the right flu shot Considering the great number of options there are when it comes to flu vaccines, which are the ones to be injected? It is a good idea to get the opinion of a doctor to see which one to choose. This is because the choice is dependent on a variety of factors, which a medical professional would be able to assess appropriately. Note that it is important not to use the nasal spray version of the vaccine as the medical authorities have recently found that it is not as effective a method as it once was. When should you get it? Flu season does vary across the world, but in the US, it starts in about October and goes on till May. During this time, the flu viruses are a lot more active. When one gets a flu shot, it is this period that one needs to look out for. So, it is better to get vaccinated in late September or the start of October, so that there is minimal unprotected exposure to the viruses. Who is it for? It is to be kept in mind that every individual who is older than six months should be vaccinated. While it is said that getting a vaccine shot year after year reduces its effectiveness, it is still important to do so. This is because each year, the shot is altered to reflect the biggest virus threats in that year. There might be few side effects of the flu vaccine such as redness in the injected area, soreness or [swelling](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/swelling). However, as long as one gets a flu shot in time, it is almost a given that there will be almost no time spent 'down with the flu'.
