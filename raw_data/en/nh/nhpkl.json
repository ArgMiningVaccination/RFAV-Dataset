A form of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is often used today to complement other types of orthopedic treatments for occupational and work injuries, auto accident injuries, and sports injuries. An acupuncture treatment involves inserting fine needles into the body, with their location depending on the condition that is being treated. Acupuncture can stimulate a variety of biological systems in the muscles, immune system, nervous system, and endocrine system, and triggers the release of the body's own pain-killing endorphins. This treatment can help to reduce pain from an injury more rapidly, reduce muscle spasms, and increase joint range of motion, enabling a patient to begin physical therapy or strengthening sooner. Some of the conditions that acupuncture may be used to treat include: - Ankle pain and sprains - Arthritis - Back pain - Bulging or herniated discs - DeQuervain's syndrome - Elbow pain, including golfer's elbow and tennis elbow - Fibromyalgia - Headaches, including migraines - Hip and groin pain - Jaw and neck pain - Joint strains and sprains - Leg and knee pain - Meniscus tears - Muscle strains and sprains - Plantar fasciitis - Post-surgical pain - Repetitive motion injuries - Rotator cuff injuries - Sciatica - Shoulder pain - Thoracic outlet syndrome - Wrist pain and carpal tunnel If you think that acupuncture in southeast Michigan could be a good supplement for your other orthopedic treatments, come to the sports medicine and orthopedic specialists at DMC Medical Group.
