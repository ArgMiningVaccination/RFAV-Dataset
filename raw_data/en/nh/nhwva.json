Benefits of integrative therapy As mental health care incorporates a greater sensitivity to the long-term effects of trauma, integrative therapies can provide you with powerful support. These therapies help you learn to regulate your feelings, build coping skills and realize you can start and finish an activity and work toward mastery. Other benefits of integrative therapy include: - Adults may explore new, more productive and positive ways to spend their leisure time that can help alleviate depression or anxiety. - Adolescents may have better ways to tell their stories and express the feelings they struggle with. - Children may find avenues to productively channel and regulate their energy, voice their feelings and connect to themselves and others. - Most integrative therapies incorporate a verbal component in each session. This helps you reflect on what you were able to express and experience and identify how this applies to your specific situation. - The therapist provides feedback to appropriate treatment team members if the integrative therapies uncover troubling or safety issues, so you can receive the help and attention you need.
