The [mutation]of was the [recombination]of different [strains]and the [mutation]of the [strains]adapting to the [environment].

Therefore, researching and cross- [protection]through continuous [monitoring], isolation and sequencing are important to determine whether their genetic characteristics are changed and to evaluate the protective [efficacy]of current [vaccines]. The [porcine epidemic diarrhea virus](PEDV) can piglet [diarrhea]or [death]in some herds. [Genetic recombination]and [mutation]facilitate the continuous evolution of the [virus](PEDV), posing a great challenge for the prevention and control of porcine [epidemic] [diarrhea](PED). [Disease]materials of piglets with PEDV [vaccination]failure in some areas of Shanxi, Henan and Hebei provinces of [China]were collected and examined to understand the [prevalence]and evolutionary characteristics of PEDV in these areas. Forty-seven suspicious [disease]materials from different litters on different [farms]were low viral in all three [cell]types, as indicated by their [growth]kinetic curves. Possible putative [recombination]events in the isolates were identified by RDP4.0 [software]. Sequencing and [phylogenetic PEDV SX6 contains new insertion and [mutations]in the S region and belongs to [genotype]GIIa. Meanwhile, ORF3 has the complete [amino acid and LW/L.
