Description Discover the Healing Power of Bliss Rx Transform your relationship with habits, lifestyle, and disease using Dr. Kavitha Chinnaiyan's remarkable approach to health. Integrating modern medicine and the ancient wisdom of Yoga, Vedanta, and Ayurveda, The Heart of Wellness shows you how to break free of the false assumption that disease is something you need to fight. Instead, you'll explore the mind-body connection and your true nature so that you can end suffering and embrace the unlimited bliss of who you are. You'll begin by examining the nature of disease: the causative and risk factors, the role of diet, exercise, and medication, and how Eastern and Western medical practices can come together. A holistic and self-paced practice is outlined, based on the author's successful Heal Your Heart Free Your Soul program. With it you'll learn to reduce stress, attend to inner needs with meditation and breathwork, declutter your outer life, increase forgiveness and gratitude, and so much more.
