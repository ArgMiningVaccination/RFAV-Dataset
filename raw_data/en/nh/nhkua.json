We are facing a global pandemic, social change, economic challenges, the stress of a national election, and the impact of western wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. Judges are engaged in the reconciliation of these issues from every perspective and in every way and there is no doubt it is having an impact. 2 It is our intention in this article to demonstrate the critical importance of resiliency to members of our judiciary and to our system of justice and to offer methods for engaging in those practices. We stand by these recommendations and suggest that they are, and will continue to be, absolutely essential as our judges play a pivotal role in our nation's recovery. Introduction Judges in the United States work at many different levels of the government and are often seen as the pinnacle of power and authority in the legal profession. Despite this envied status, the daily challenges of the position are stressful and have an adverse effect on a judge's health and well-being. 3 While some would argue that these challenges are part of the job, the judiciary, legal community, and public in general would be remiss not to recognize the strain that they create. In the 2017 Report of the National Task Force on Lawyer Well-Being, entitled, The Path to Lawyer Well-Being: Practical Recommendations for Positive Change (hereinaf- ter \"the National Task Force Report\"), 4 these unique challenges were summarized: 1. For author biographies and acknowledgement of others who contributed to the paper, see Appendix A1-3. 2. An informal poll was conducted during a presentation to approximately 200 judges. 88% indicated higher stress, 79% increased anxiety, and 47% a higher feeling of depression or hopeless- ness than before that state's Stay at Home order. Attendees were asked about their level of avoidance or substitution behaviors (including drinking or food). For 37% it had increased, it was the same for half, and lower for 12%. 3.

JPL_2020.indd 1 12/9/20 2:44 PM2 Journal of The Professional Lawyer Judges regularly confront contentious, personal, and vitriolic pro- ceedings. Judges presiding over domestic relations dockets make life- changing decisions for children and families daily. Some report lying awake at night worrying about making the right decision or the conse-quences of that decision. Other judges face the stress of presiding over criminal cases with horrifying underlying facts (citations omitted). 5 The National Task Force Report describes the systemic isolation so acutely experienced by jurists after taking the bench,6 a condition that deprives them of the essential support and consolation of their colleagues. \"Judges cannot take off the robe in everyday interactions outside the courthouse, which is a hallmark of their elevated status in society but also a reality that can contribute to social isolation.\" 7 Recognizing these unique challenges of the American judiciary, the National Task Force called upon judges\u2014and the entities that regulate, support, and educate them\u2014to consider systemic changes that would bolster well-being, resilience, and stress-hardiness. Noting the absence of a thorough, large-scale national sur - vey of judges (comparable to national surveys of lawyers8 and law students9), the National Task Force Report called for a \"broad-based survey of the judiciary to determine the state of well-being and the prevalence of issues directly related to judicial fitness.\"10 The National Judicial Stress and Resiliency Survey, the largest of its type ever conducted, was designed to answer this call.11 It was undertaken to identify: (1) stressors unique to the judiciary, (2) how those stressors affect individual judges, and (3) strategies that judges have used to mitigate these stressors. The results serve as the context for recommendations made to the multiple stakehold- ers who comprise, regulate, and support the U.S. judicial system. Literature Review In 2016, two major studies were published that documented the dismal state of well-being among U.S. lawyers\u2014The Prevalence of Substance Use and Other Mental Health Concerns Among American Attorneys; hereinafter \"Lawyer Study\"\u2014and law students\u2014Suffering in Silence: The Survey of Law Student Well-Being and the Reluctance of Law Students to Seek Help for Substance Abuse and 5.

JPL_2020.indd 2 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 3 Mental Health Concerns; hereinafter \"Law Student Study.\"12 The impact of these two studies on the legal profession has been extensive, serving as the impetus for the National Task Force Report and the inspiration for this study. Both surveys were preceded by various controlled and localized research efforts that were relied upon to support and assist lawyers and law students for decades.13 To date, while research on the well-being of judges has been limited in size and geographic representation, it has served as the basis of initiatives through judicial organizations and Lawyers and Judges Assistance Programs (hereinafter LAPs). In response to the National Task Force Report recommendation to con-duct a national survey of judges, the American Bar Association Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs (CoLAP) Judicial Assistance Committee recruited members from national judicial organizations to carry out this initiative. The working group 14 included representatives from The National Judicial College, the ABA Judicial Division, and the National Center for State Court's Center for Judi-cial Ethics. The working group designed a survey to complement\u2014but not mirror\u2014the surveys conducted in the Lawyer Study and the Law Student Study, one that would focus on sources of stress, its effects on judges (including alcohol use and indica-tions of mental health issues), and how judges manage that stress and use resil-iency practices. Unlike the Lawyer Study and the Law Student Study published in 2016 that examined stress generally, the National Judicial Stress and Resiliency Survey items were designed to highlight the specific experiences of judges and the judicial setting. Earlier U.S. surveys of judges focused on secondary and vicarious trauma, burnout, and other stressors. For example, a 2018 survey of judges conducted by The National Judicial College sought information on the \"pain points\" of being a new judge. 15 The sur - vey results revealed that these challenges were divided roughly into two catego-ries: those related to one's comfort level in this new role and those related to the body of knowledge a judge must have. By and large, new judges struggle with 12. See generally Krill et al., supra note 8; Organ et al., supra note 9. 13. See generally W.

JPL_2020.indd 3 12/9/20 2:44 PM4 Journal of The Professional Lawyer their new judicial identity: the isolation that comes with being a judge, the fear of appearing incompetent, and the difference between what the judge thought they would be doing and the realities of the job. To address these challenges, the NJC embedded (and recommends that states embed) topics into their new judge ori-entations such as judicial wellness, including stress management and addressing burnout, understanding bias, coping with the isolation that comes from cutting ties with social circles and friends, and vicarious trauma. Prior research has frequently addressed secondary trauma as a significant source of judicial stress. Secondary trauma concerns the impact of exposure to the testimonies, photographs, and other evidence, and demeanor of victims and behavior of perpetrators. The National Judicial College's Judicial Edge includes a \"Question of the Month\" and in the October 2017 edition, judges were asked \"[h]ave you suffered secondary traumatic stress from being a judge?\" 16 Of those who replied, 45% responded in the affirmative. Notably, one commenter suggested that greater recognition of the symptoms of secondary traumatic stress would lead to a larger percentage of judges who identified as having experienced the condition. Decision-making, too, can be a cause of stress for judges and has been con- nected to secondary trauma. 17 For example, judges tasked with determining which parent should have custody of the parties' child or children know their decision will have life-altering effects on family members and, often, judges continue to be troubled by the weight of that decision due to its profound significance. Burnout, 18 another condition affecting judges which has been studied, \"is a psychological syndrome emerging as a prolonged response to chronic interper - sonal stressors on the job,\" one that manifests as \"an overwhelming exhaustion, feelings of cynicism and detachment from the job, and a sense of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment.\" 19 Such fatigue is also related to absenteeism.

JPL_2020.indd 4 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 5 a study published in Judicature, it was reported that more than 25% of judges reported missing ten or more days of work due to stress.20 The effects of fatigue on judgment and mood cannot be understated. In a study of 1,112 decisions by parole board judges in Israel over a ten-month period, the effects of managing a full docket of cases became evident over the course of one day of hearings. In the morning, judges' decisions tended to be more favorable toward the parolee, but steadily declined until lunch break. After lunch, the favor - ability was again very high but declined until mid-afternoon break. Following the break, it was again high and declined until closing. This pattern was present in cases involving determinations of release or change in parole terms regardless of the seriousness of the crimes. 21 Most recently, a 2018 survey of 221 judges from two states who attended a state judicial education seminar demonstrated the extent to which the judiciary is impacted by stress.22 The survey measured overall stress experienced within the last year; health (both mental and physical) and job satisfaction and job efficacy.23 Of the participants, 82% stated that they were in good mental health and 76% rated their physical health as good.24 However, nearly one-half of the judges (48%) reported having experienced stress during the year and acknowledged that it has impacted their mental health. 25 Internationally, 150 Australian judges and magistrates were surveyed regard- ing stress, burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and substance use.26 Significant and concerning levels were found for each of these conditions, though the level of depression was lower than that for lawyers. While distress was elevated, those surveyed felt they were more satisfied in their work as judges than they had been as attorneys. Methodology Procedures The National Judicial Stress and Resiliency Survey design and instrument were formulated by an interdisciplinary working group of judges, attorneys, and a forensic psychologist. 27 The group met online for more than a year, reviewing 20.

Prior to distribution, the survey was submit- ted to an institutional review board for approval.28 The survey was then tested for feedback and revision in one state (Idaho) and one major metropolitan area (Indi- anapolis) through each jurisdiction's judicial administration. The final revised survey was placed in a secure online survey platform and email invitations to participate were distributed through The National Judicial College. Each state's Lawyer Assistance Program was asked to send the survey to their chief justice for distribution of the survey site link. Respondents were asked to complete the survey within two weeks, but a delay in distribution in some states allowed four weeks for return. Participants completed survey items on sources of stress, effects of stress, alcohol use, resiliency, and stress management practices. Responses were anonymous and IP addresses, demographic information, and geo-location were not requested to ensure anonymity. ParticipantsThere are an estimated 18,000 judges across the United States. Our data is based on 1,034 judges who completed and returned the survey. The participa-tion rate could not be calculated due to state associations controlling the number of people receiving invitations. Demographics of those returning the survey are shown in Table 1. Men (56.5%) and women (42.8%) were fairly equal and very similar to the results of the 2016 Lawyer Study (53.5% and 46.5% respectively). Other gender identification categories were considered, but not used because the percentage indicating other genders on the lawyer survey was very small and too small for meaningful statistical analysis or comparison. Age was categorized in five ranges, starting at 30 and ending at 70 and above in intervals of ten years. The most common age range reporting was 60-69 (38.5%), followed by 50-59 (35.3%). The majority of Respondents identified as Caucasian/White (84.3%), with about 5% identifying as Hispanic or African American; Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander/Hawaiian, and Multicultural were less than 2%. Judicial respon-dents were more diverse than in the Lawyer Study (91.3% Caucasian/White, 2.6% Latino, 2.5% Black/African American, and 4.6% identifying as Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander/Hawaiian, Multicultural, and Other). 28.

About a third identified as a chief, administrative, or presiding judge, and just over 90% were active, full time judges. Seventy-five percent of respondents presided over trials or hearings; 19.8% over both appeals and trials/hearings; and 5.2% appeals only. About 30% were involved in problem-solving, healing-to-wellness, therapeutic, or restorative courts, while 69.7% did not have this focus. Geographical areas over which they presided were relatively similar, with rural and mixed at 28.8% and 24.4% respectively; metropolitan, large metro- politan, and suburban at 15-16%; and frontier at .7%.

The first three scales were based on similar items from other surveys and examples of statements in the literature but were revised and customized to the judicial experience. The Alcohol Use Scale is a widely used standardized scale for identifying level of alcohol use. The AUDIT scale on alco-hol use was used without revision. The Sources of Stress Scale and Effects of Stress Scale were rated by participants along a five-point Likert scale of agree- ment, ranging from \"Not at all, Slightly, Moderately, Very much, Extremely.\" The Stress Management and Resiliency Scale also used a five-point Likert format from \"Would never use, Rarely use, A few times a month, Several times a week, Nearly daily.\" Sources of Stress Scale. There are many scales that measure stress and its effects, but few have been designed with specific questions regarding court- specific stress factors. The literature and several previous surveys were examined, and items were revised to reflect unique judicial context and stressors. A total of thirty-seven items were used in this scale and reflected such areas as workload, safety and security, interpersonal stress, trauma exposure, staffing issues, ethical concerns, and court procedures. Because this scale was developed specifically for this survey, it does not have correlations with other scales for validity. However, it is based on other validated surveys and published literature. Cronbach's alpha is a measure of internal consistency or how closely related items are in a scale. A .60 is the lowest acceptable threshold for this measure and the alpha for this scale was categorized as \"very high,\" .93. Effects of Stress Scale. This scale was constructed based on judicial surveys in the literature, conversations with judges, and common stress items adapted to the judicial context. The thirty-four items in this scale reflected the effects of stress on general well-being, cognitive performance (inattention, decisions, intrusive thoughts), emotional performance (anxiety, depression), professional and family relationships, and attitude toward the judicial role. Like the first scale, this scale is newly developed and did not have comparisons with other scales other than shar - ing content validity. The Cronbach alpha for this scale was also a \"very high,\" .95. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The AUDIT is a widely used screening tool for identifying levels of alcohol use. 29 It consists of ten self-report items that identify the frequency and amount of consumption, and the consequences of problematic use. It has a well-established validity and reli- ability across many different populations and was used for comparison in the Lawyer Study. 29. Thomas F. Babor, John C. Higgins- Biddle, J.B.Biddle, J.B.

JPL_2020.indd 9 12/9/20 2:44 PM10 Journal of The Professional Lawyer Stress Management and Resiliency Scale. This scale was a collection of diverse practices that are commonly reported in stress studies relating to how peo- ple manage stress. The twenty-four questions covered items on physical methods (e.g., exercise, relaxation), mental methods (e.g., meditation, mindfulness), recre-ation (e.g., hobbies), health practices (e.g., sleep, nutrition), social support (e.g., close friends and colleagues) community involvement (e.g., service), and profes-sional development (e.g., new skills, continuing education). In addition to asking which they currently use, participants were also asked for each item, the extent to which they would like to increase their use of that method. The discrepancy between current use and desired use was also a measure of interest and potential area for resiliency and health education. Results Sources of Stress Survey participants acknowledged a wide array of stressors that affected them. Their responses were rank-ordered in percent frequency of endorsement (see Table 3). The most frequent items were related to importance/impact of deci-sions (79.7%) and heavy docket of cases (73.2%). A cluster of situations involv-ing frustration followed, including unprepared attorneys (67.6%), self-represented litigants (62.5%), dealing repeatedly with the same parties without addressing the underlying issues (58.1%), and a lack of public awareness about the courts (55.5%). Other items reaching about 50% or more endorsement were long hours of work without a break (53.5%), hearing contentious family law issues (50.3%), isolation in judicial service (50.3%), and insufficient staff support (49.5%). Other issues below 50% are still important and should be considered when determining goals for discussion and improvement. An important cluster to consider is self-represented litigants (62.5%) and hear - ing contentious family law issues (50.3%). The National Center for State Courts (NCSC), among others, acknowledges that self-represented litigants are a growing challenge for civil and criminal court judges and have recommended various inno- vations to relieve the challenge for judges and court administrators. 30 Lawyers and courts in most jurisdictions are adjusting to the fact that the self-represented are the primary litigants in family court.31 Therefore, it is not surprising that these two stressors ranked in the top ten as numbers \"4\" and \"8.\" 30.

These effects are often related because sleep deficits underlie fatigue and often reduce awareness, concentration, and attention. The effects of fatigue on judgment and mood cannot be overstated. 32 Depression and anxiety are also commonly related to stress. Survey items reflecting depression in respondents included: not having initiative (22.9%), preoc- cupation with negative thoughts (20%), work is no longer meaningful (17.8%), can't wait for the day's work to end (16.7%), depressed mood (15.3%), nothing to look forward to (12.6%), feel increasingly numb to pleas of urgency (11.2%), and care little about trial outcomes (6.9%). Each of these criteria is concerning. The finding that over one in five judges meet at least one criteria for depressive disorder deserves our full attention. Although not directly comparable, the Lawyer Study identified 28% of respondents as meeting criteria for mild to severe depression during the past week. 8.4% reported symptoms that were severe or extremely severe. Depression is a predictor for suicide and just over two percent of the judges responding reported experiencing thoughts of self-injury or suicide. This item is very troubling. While it is one of the lowest frequencies in this particular survey, it still reflects that twenty-two participating judges experienced thoughts of self- harm over the past twelve months. In comparison, the Lawyer Study found that 11.5% of lawyer respondents reported suicidal thoughts over their careers, and the Law Student Survey reported that 6% of its respondents reported the same feelings in the previous twelve months. Isolation, reputation, and the impact of exposure to trauma may all contribute to a judge finding it difficult to reach out for help. The authors believe that judges would benefit from increased suicide awareness. Judges who endorsed experiencing anxiety were not as numerous as depres- sion but were still significant. These included: increased health concern (27.6%), feelings of apprehension or anxiety (23%), having intrusive thoughts of traumatic images of people or evidence (19%), finding it difficult to ask a respected col- league for a critique of work (13.3%), experiencing breathing difficulties (7.4%), and being worried about panicking or losing control (4.6%). While each of these is 32. See Danziger, Levav, & Avnaim-Pesso, supra note 21. JPL_2020.indd 12 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 13 significant, feelings of apprehension and experiencing intrusive thoughts deserve particular attention. Eighteen percent (18%) of those responding to the Lawyer Study met criteria for a mild to extremely severe anxiety disorder, whereas only 5.6% of the responding judges reported severe or extremely severe symptoms. Twenty-three percent (23%) of judges responding to the survey met criteria for stress at a level that could be debilitating. As with previous studies of differential effects of stress on gender, men and women report slightly different effects of stress (\"Stress and Gender\"). Gender is related to how people respond to stress. 33 Female judges were more inclined than their male colleagues to report one or more symptoms of stress (73% vs. 54%), such as sleep disturbances, intolerance of others, physical complaints, depression and sense of isolation. Female judges also more often acknowledged the severity of these stresses, sometimes about twice the rate of men. For example, 11.5% of female judges reported stress interfering with concentration, while male judges reported a rate of 5.5% of such interference. Female judges scored higher than male judges on internalizing factors (somatic symptoms, over-eating, sleep difficulties, sadness, loss of appetite, feel- ings of helplessness or hopelessness, anxiety, depression, fatigue and stress) ver - sus externalizing factors (anger, frustration, intolerance of others, cynicism and irritability). This distinction between internalizing and externalizing based on gen-der is consistent with other studies on gender and stress for various populations. 34 Table 4.

Table 5 shows that 1026 respondents completed the AUDIT. 929 or 90.5% of respondents were rated in the \"lower risk\" range, while 97 or 9.5% scored in what is considered a higher range. More specifically, for the higher risk range, 81 (7.9%) were at \"increasing risk,\" 11 (1.1%) were at and 5 (.5%) were rated at \"pos-sible dependence.\" It is possible that alcohol use is underreported because it is a sensitive issue for some people who do not wish to divulge their use or do not believe it is a problem. 35 35.

Babor, A Review of the Alcohol Use Disorders Iden- tification Test (AUDIT), AUDIT-C, and USAUDIT for Screening in the United States: Past Issues and Future Directions, Am. J. Drug Alc. Abuse (2018). JPL_2020.indd 14 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 15 The level of problematic alcohol use for judges in the past year (9.5% in 2019) is lower than that for lawyers (20.6%), also in the year preceding their responses to the survey.36 Both rates are higher than that for the general population of adults over 25 years of age in the past year (6.6% in 2018).37 The Centers for Disease Control has long recommended that moderate alco- hol drinking not exceed one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men.38 More recent research suggests that the upper limit for men should be reduced to one drink a day as well. 39 The judicial survey revealed that the majority of judges who consume alcohol are not daily drinkers, and two-thirds of those who do con-sume alcohol will consume one or two drinks. Of the more than 1,000 judges who took the survey, however, 20 individuals indicated that they did have six or more drinks at a time daily, almost daily, or weekly. A very small handful experienced interference with their daily lives due to drinking, whether it was failing to meet their own or others' expectations, needing a first drink in the morning to get going, blackouts, or feeling guilt or remorse around drinking. In comparison, the Lawyer Study revealed that 32% of lawyers age 30 and under engaged in problematic use of alcohol. 40 More than 14% of lawyers between the age of 61 and 70 and 16.2% of lawyers between the age of 51 and 60 met the cri-teria for problematic use. It may be that lawyers with the highest levels of problem- atic alcohol use and other distress leave the profession. On the other hand, because lawyers become judges later in their legal career, it could be that younger lawyers with problematic drinking issues changed their behavior because they recognized and faced a problem or that they knew they will face scrutiny. Another reason for the disparity may be that judges responding to this survey are more determined to mask and deny problematic use because of the potential impact. Regardless of the reasons for the disparity, a rate of 9.5% problematic alcohol use for judges is concerning. Table 5.

See Krill et al., supra note 8. JPL_2020.indd 15 12/9/20 2:44 PM16 Journal of The Professional Lawyer A recent article in the Journal of Judicial Administration reported that a study (using the AUDIT) of 152 Australian judges from five courts showed that one third of the judges responding to the survey used alcohol at a \"problematic level.\"41 The Law Student Study, of over 3,300 law students, reported that about one quarter were at risk of alcoholism.42 There are many factors that result in variable report- ing and underreporting: different survey questions, different levels of career devel-opment and position, and different cultures. Problematic drinking can externally manifest in the same manner as stress, for example hostile behavior, frequent absences, as well as inappropriate behavior and mood. Regardless of etymology, such behavior impacts judicial responsibilities and reflects poorly on the judiciary which can result in loss of confidence by liti-gants and the public. When such conduct is reported to state judicial conduct com-missions or supreme courts, judges may face disciplinary actions that can include removal from the bench. 43 This makes educating judges about the importance of maintaining wellness, well-being, and stress management skills even more critical. Stress Management and Resiliency ActivitiesThe Current Activity Scale presents a list of activities for stress management and resiliency that are currently practiced from \"a few times a month\" to \"nearly daily\" (see Table 6). These frequencies are compared to Interested Activities that reflect an interest in these activities, but no current participation by the responding judge. The difference between the frequencies for each item suggests an opportu- nity for judges to engage in these stress management activities, and an opportunity for judicial educators to develop programs and resources to support judicial perfor - mance. For example, mindfulness was a current activity endorsed by 36%, however, 81% of the judges were interested in it. This suggests that the 45% gap may reflect a potential for further training in this highly effective resiliency skill. \"Maybe\" and \"Yes\" answers are merged for this analysis. Rank is based on current activity. The most frequently endorsed method of stress management and resiliency promotion by judges is some form of physical exercise (82.3%). This choice is consistent with the general literature on its effectiveness in reducing stress in gen-eral, and for anxiety and depression, improving sleep, and promoting resilience to stress. 44 A common counterpart to the invigoration of exercise is relaxation that reduces anxiety and muscular tension. The variety of relaxation methods avail-able are quite broad and include: relaxed movement and stretching (e.g., yoga, t'ai chi) (51.3%), meditation and mindfulness (35.9%), spiritual and faith practices (49.3%), reading (77.3%), and quiet hobbies and pastimes (73%). Sleep hygiene (e.g., healthy sleep practices) was identified by 66% of respondents, and good nutrition by 88.7% as a practice used to cope with stress. A cluster of social and relationship activities generally was rated highly: diverse friends outside the field 41. See Schrever, et al., supra note 26. 42. See Organ et al., supra note 9. 43.

JPL_2020.indd 16 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 17 (73.4%), social support of trusted people (76.6%), providing personal support or confrontation of peers (54.7%), and involving staff in planning court schedules/ dockets (71.4%). The one social item that stood out, at only 36.8%, was asking for peer support. The discrepancies between the current activities and what the judges are merely interested in is considered a measure of gap in their stress management skills and what they would actually like to be able to do or do more effectively. This gap may identify helpful topics and practices for personal development and improved stress management. An early study of judicial stress revealed the first gap is a judge's ability or desire to ask for support and described the adverse effects of judicial isolation. 45 This study shows the same gap ranking first: ask- ing for peer support. The current survey revealed that the second greatest gap is regarding mindfulness or mind quieting practices. Mindfulness has become a fre- quent topic at judicial conferences and training programs. Research shows that it may decrease some of the inherent unconscious biases in decision making, 46 and recover concentration and attention when distracted or overwhelmed.47 A third gap involves the reported \"current activity\" and \"interested in\" levels regarding relaxation. Stress is often manifested physically in muscular tension, such as tension headaches and postural aches and pains, and emotionally in the experience of anxiety. Extensive research over decades has shown that participat-ing in some form of stretching and relaxation can reduce stress as well as prevent gradual build-up of tension. Sitting and relaxing, mindfulness or other medita-tion, yoga, Pilates, and t'ai chi can all be used to promote physical and mental relaxation. 48 Similarly, reading, painting, and engaging in other enjoyable hobbies provides respite from disturbing thoughts and tensions. Based on the difference rank, the study reveals a fourth gap between prac- tice and interest in being able to ask for personal support or confront a colleague (54.7% vs. 89.6%). This hesitancy may be related to the isolation previously noted, need for confidentiality, or avoiding the risk of adverse reaction from a colleague. Nonetheless, being able to share one's stress narrative, provide support for oth-ers, and provide constructive feedback to a peer are important values, and can be instrumental in stress reduction and resiliency promotion for oneself and others. Other gaps between current and interest in activities responses worth noting are a need for better sleep (66.4% vs. 96.9%), time for hobbies and pastimes (73% vs. 97.8%), and having friends in diverse areas outside the field (73.4% vs. 94.5%). 45.

To bring forth systemic and sustained improvement to the well-being of the judiciary as a whole, however, the burden cannot rest solely on the shoulders of individual judi-cial officers. Nor will this ambitious task be attained through exercise and healthy eating alone. Instead, entities charged with governance, regulation, education and support of judges must lead these efforts. The authors of the 2017 National Task Force Report set out 44 recom- mendations that placed responsibility for changing the deleterious culture of the legal profession directly on leaders of the profession, particularly the seven 49. ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2 (2010). JPL_2020.indd 18 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 19 stakeholder groups with authority to bring systemic change: judges, regulators, legal employers, law schools, bar associations, legal professional liability carri- ers and Lawyer Assistance Programs.50 Likewise, this study's authors also offer recommendations for bolstering the well-being of the judiciary to the stakeholder groups responsible for governance, regulation, education and support of the U.S. judicial system. These groups are state supreme courts, federal court administra- tion, judicial regulators, judicial educators, membership associations for judges, as well as judges and lawyers assistance programs. Because the judicial stress and resiliency survey gathered such extensive data regarding individual judge's sources of stress and efforts to promote their own well-being and resilience, this article also makes recommendations based on insights gained from review of these findings. Recommendations to Court, Tribal, and Agency Leaders Those who serve as leaders of courts and administrative agencies in state, federal and tribal systems have the ability, pursuant to their legal authority and symbolic power, to create rules, trainings, and programs that will promote the well-being of their fellow jurists and to serve as exemplars of health and resilience. The authors encourage these leaders to use their power to institute the following: 1. Communicate and demonstrate by example that judicial well-being is a pri- ority. Our first recommendation echoes the National Task Force Report's recommendation that, \"the highest court in each state should set the tone for the importance of well-being of judges.\" 51 As the ultimate leaders of each state's legal system, justices of the highest court in the state's judi-ciary should maintain awareness that \"they will be closely watched for sig- nals about what is expected\" when caring for one's own and each other's well-being. 52 By prioritizing self-care, justices set an example and send a message that well-being is a priority. Also critically important is that jus-tices at higher levels are aware and appreciate the different challenges and stresses of judges presiding in the lower courts. 2. Convene a statewide task force on well-being in the legal profession, including the judiciary and all other stakeholders. In Appendix A of the National Task Force Report, a state action plan and checklist for convening a statewide task force is provided. 53 The chief justice (or their designee) is encouraged to bring together representatives of all stakeholder groups to review potential ways in which well-being can be improved, to create priorities and develop and promote implementation of an action plan. 50. See National Task Force Report, supra note 4. 51. Id. at 22. 52. Id. at 13. 53. Id. at Appendix A. JPL_2020.indd 19 12/9/20 2:44 PM20 Journal of The Professional Lawyer 3. Ensure the judiciary has access to well-being resources and programming, including services provided by Lawyer Assistance Programs. Through positions of authority in relation to judicial education and support orga- nizations, as well as oversight of budgets for the state judicial system, justices are uniquely positioned to ensure the availability of well-being resources, programming, and protocols in their state. Fulfillment of this recommendation would also mean ensuring that judges and lawyers assis-tance programs have adequate resources to serve members of the judiciary at all levels. An excellent example of this work occurred in 2017, when the National Center for State Courts released Elements of Judicial Excellence: A Framework to Support the Professional Development of State Trial Court Judges. 54 Included in the framework were recommendations for judicial well-being and the ways in which state court leaders can structure the professional development of judges to include information on well- ness and stress management. Some ideas suggested are formal mentoring and coaching programs, regular engagement with judicial colleagues, and intentional use of personal time to refresh and recharge. It may also be important to identify and reduce barriers to implementing such practices before they can be successfully introduced. 4. Ensure adequate insurance, leave policies, and retirement benefits. Judges are more likely to get the professional help and treatment they need if the cost of that assistance is paid in full or in part by insurance that does not impose onerous out-of-pocket expenses on them. This could itself add to their stress by affecting their financial security. Similarly, a paid leave policy that allows judges who need in-patient treatment for the effects of stress and/ or substance use to get the help they need is necessary. Finally, in the event that a judge has a mental disability or other concern that renders the judge unable to perform judicial functions, a generous disability retirement plan that does not deprive the judge of the means to meet the expenses of treat-ment and other costs is crucial to encourage, not penalize, retirement. 5. Authorize caseload and staffing studies. Because heavy dockets were cited as one of the primary sources of stress, courts should study whether caseloads are fairly divided by size and type of case, and whether judge-ships and staffing are adequate within and across divisions, dockets, and locations, and make any necessary adjustments. These adjustments could include strategic use of senior judges when such a resource is available. Whether there are technological solutions to some of the docketing issues judges face also should be examined. The National Center for State Courts has performed numerous studies on these issues for courts. 55 54.

JPL_2020.indd 20 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 21 Recommendations to Judicial Regulators Judicial conduct commissions are charged with \"preserving the integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system and, when necessary, safe- guarding the bench and the public from those who are unfit.\"56 Often, charges of misconduct do not result in removal, but instead, are addressed \"through informal or private dispositions such as counseling, letters of caution, private admonish- ments, or appearances before the commission.\" 57 Not infrequently, a complaint stems from a judge's conduct resulting from a behavioral health concern, such as depression, anxiety, burnout, or substance use. Conduct commissions should be able to offer interventions and resources that directly target these issues as an alternative to addressing these issues strictly as disciplinary matters. Doing so will enable the judge to remain on the bench and ensure that the above commission goals are met. 6. Commissions should implement policies that appropriately allow for a diversion or intervention program and is targeted to address the underlying behavioral health concern. 58 Based upon the National Task Force Report's recommendation, judicial conduct commissions should follow those states that currently have a \"Diversion Rule\" for judges. 59 (See Appendix C for a list of states with diversion or deferred discipline agreements). 7. Judicial diversion programs should allow referral of judges to Judges and Lawyer Assistance Programs when a behavioral health condition is appar - ent, even though misconduct is not present, or when the misconduct is due to a mental or physical health-related issue. Such a voluntary referral would allow the jurist to receive needed services early in the development of an issue such as a substance use or mental health disorder, rather than waiting until misconduct manifests. A Lawyer Assistance Program 60 exists in each state, with 90% providing services to judges.61 Typically, LAPs provide assistance to members of the legal profession who are experienc- ing issues related to substance use and mental health disorders, as well 56.

Id. at 6. 58. A deferred discipline agreement is appropriate only when the alleged misconduct is minor, that is, it does not reflect on the judge's fitness for office, and when the underlying cause of the misconduct can be addressed through a treatment or rehabilitation program. See Rule 6 cmt., ABA Model Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement .

The overwhelming major - ity of LAPs provide diagnostic assessments, interventions, and referrals to behavioral health specialists. A majority offer direct services, such as counseling and peer support. In response to a 2014 survey, LAPs indicated that 9% of their referrals came from disciplinary agencies. 62 As such, many programs would welcome the opportunity to work with their judicial con-duct commission to provide support to referred judges. 8. Judicial regulators should educate themselves about mental health and substance use issues, including burnout and secondary trauma. Judicial conduct commissions are advised to consult with experts in behavioral health. These experts may include psychiatrists, mental health therapists, physicians who specialize in the intervention and treatment of substance use disorders, as well as professional staff of their state's LAPs. Recommendations to Judicial Educators National and state judicial education organizations should routinely include program topics on the potential behavioral health challenges that judges face, as well as resilience-enhancing, evidence-based strategies that will help judges in their efforts to endure the inevitable stressors of their career. 63 Increasingly, judi- cial educators are doing just that. For example, The National Judicial College pres-ents an annual course on mindfulness-based stress reduction and on the state level, the North Carolina Judicial College developed a Special Topic Seminar on mental health that provided information related to judicial mental health with sessions on vicarious trauma, mindfulness, and resilience. 64 9. Regularly offer presentations on judicial impairment (including risk fac- tors such as vicarious or secondary trauma) and well-being topics and involve LAPs in their development and delivery. 65 Increasingly, mem- bers of the judicial community are developing an expertise in these areas 62.

Gender disparities in reactions to the stress effects of vicarious trauma have also been found. An earlier study that evaluated vicarious trauma in 105 juvenile and family court judges showed significant differences between the male and female judges. The average age of the judges was 51 years, and 54.3% were male and 45.7% were female. In describing their work, \"... judges are increasingly exposed to graphic medical evidence, tapes of 911 calls, photographs and videotapes of JPL_2020.indd 22 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 23 and could serve as speakers. Alternatively, LAPs routinely provide CLE programming and will have judicial members who volunteer or serve on their governing boards who could speak at no cost.66 Topics for instruction could include for example: stress and resiliency, burnout and its effects on engagement, identification and intervention of common mental health and substance use disorders, and secondary or vicarious trauma.67 10. Especially for new judges, provide information about these topics and LAPs in courses and all materials (print and online). Although it varies among states, new judges are typically required to complete a significant number of educational hours at the beginning of their careers. These \"new judges schools\" should include programming that will adequately edu-cate the new judicial officers on the array of behavioral health issues they may encounter in themselves, or their colleagues, over the course of their career on the bench. Judicial educators should also review their websites and online offerings for all jurists to ensure the on-demand availability of programming, resources, and articles. 68 11. During judicial conferences, offer experiential well-being programs, such as judicial roundtables or other small group sessions. Judicial educa- tors can take concrete steps towards breaking down some of the isola-tion experienced by jurists simply by creating space within their programs for building connections among attendees. Numerous jurisdictions have found success with judicial roundtables, a practice taken from the medical profession. These interactive sessions can reduce isolation, allow for shar - ing of common experiences and normalize some of the stress responses experienced by participant jurists. 69 For example, the protocol lists \"Deci- sion Fatigue,\" \"Everyone Has an Opinion About Your Opinion,\" and \"Judi-cial Decision-making\" as sample topics for the event.

Conduct anonymous well-being surveys at conferences and use responses to design future programs. Just as the Judicial Stress and Resiliency Survey gave rise to this discussion and its series of recommendations, state-level and even local surveys create an opportunity to identify judicial stressors particular to the jurisdiction, as well as coping strategies employed by its judicial officers. Distribution of the survey itself, and discussion of the results at some later date, also serves to highlight the issue of judicial stress and the need for systemic and individual change. To facilitate the development of localized surveys, the questions used in the Judicial Stress and Resilience Survey may serve as examples. See Appendix B. Recommendations to Judicial Membership Associations 13. Create a judicial well-being committee and add a LAP representative as a member. A number of state judicial associations have created a well-ness committee, including the Illinois Judges Association Wellness Com-mittee (https://www.ija.org/wellness-committee), the New York State Bar Association's Judicial Wellness Committee (https://nysba.org/committees /judicial-wellness-committee/) and the California Judges Association's Mindfulness and Wellness Committee (https://www.caljudges.org/Comm Mindful.asp). Activities for such committees could include establishment of a facilitated mentoring program, and other programming targeted at creating communities (in-person and online) for their members. The com- mittee could also be tasked with developing programming for conferences, serving as a resource for knowledgeable speakers and creating relevant online content. One valuable example of such a group's work is \"A Well-ness Guide for Judges of the Ninth Circuit Courts\" of California, a proj-ect of that jurisdiction's Wellness Committee. 71 The Guide offers family members, court staff and colleagues, who are likely to observe signs of impairment, specific steps to help the judge while protecting the public, who appear in front of the judge. 14. Provide online resources regarding impairments and well-being, includ- ing self-assessments, articles, videos, and links to state LAPs' websites. A dedicated tab that provides timely and relevant information online to judges is one way that judicial associations can support their members who are 70.

Additionally, the National Center for State Courts maintains an extensive collection of resources and information in their Judicial Resource Guide which can be found at: (https://www.ncsc.org/Topics/Judicial-Offi cers/Judicial-Stress/Resource-Guide.aspx). Another resource, published in 2017, by the American Judges Association is an issue of the publication Court Review devoted entirely to judicial well-being. It featured articles, such as Judges Well-Being and the Importance of Meaningful Work. 72 15. Add recovery meetings and experiential components to conferences. Increasingly, bar associations are adding wellness activities to their con-ference programs, such as yoga, exercise or meditation. 73 And for years, many have offered recovery meetings (often listed on the program as \"Friends of Bill\") in the early morning or late evening hours. Judicial associations could follow suit, particularly given the significant number of responders to this survey who indicated a strong interest in learning more about physical activities and mindfulness. Judicial roundtables (see Recommendation 9, supra) also provide an opportunity for mutual sup- port. Doing so also gives leaders of the association the opportunity to role model best well-being practices. 16. Offer presentation opportunities to LAPs at conferences. Frequently, judi- cial associations offer exhibit space to their state LAP which can be helpful in raising awareness that these resources exist for judges who are con-cerned for themselves or another judge, or for a possibly impaired lawyer in their courtroom. Unfortunately, experience shows that few judges are willing to be seen spending time at the LAP exhibit because of the stigma that is still associated with behavioral health impairments. To ensure that members receive the valuable information, associations should include the LAP staff and their judge volunteers in time allocated at the podium, either to present an educational session or to make announcements about the array of services they provide to the judiciary. 72.

Publicize the Judicial Stress and Resiliency Survey results and offer pro- gramming to meet needs identified by survey respondents. This survey, sponsored by the ABA Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs, offers an excellent opportunity for state lawyer assistance programs to col-laborate with judicial educators and associations by bringing this infor - mation to their events in the form of presentations, announcements, and distribution of results in materials or at exhibit spaces. As areas of interest for additional training are clearly expressed in the results, LAPs have a ready guide of program offerings to develop. 18. Develop a peer support network of judges, and other avenues for peer-to- peer connection. Lawyer Assistance Programs routinely maintain a cadre of volunteer attorneys who serve as peer support for others in the profession who are struggling with behavioral health disorders, especially those new to recovery. 74 Some also offer networks of judges which function as peer support programs, developed for judges and staffed by volunteer judges. In the absence of such a program, LAPs should use the National Judges Helping Judges Helpline (see Recommendation 19, infra) as a referral resource to help local judges find a peer who can provide critical guidance and support in the early days of recovery. Examples of programs designed to assist judges include Washington's Judicial Assistance Service Program which connects callers with trained \"peer counselors\" who are also judges (https://www.wsba.org/for-legal-professionals/member-support/wellness /judicial-assistance-service-program); as well as the New Jersey Judges Assistance Program (http://judgesassistance.org/). 19. Advocate for inclusion of court personnel in well-being educational pro- gramming and events. Court personnel are often exposed to the same stressors that detrimentally affect judges, such as exposure to graphic and traumatic evidence, high stakes decisions, distraught litigants, and unpre-pared lawyers. Additionally, staff for the court are often among the first to notice distress and impairment on the part of the judge, lawyers, and jurors appearing in the courtroom. 20. Reach out to new judges (especially chiefs) to educate them about Law- yer Assistance Programs' services. In the ABA Model Lawyer Assistance Program, directors are charged to \"[e]stablish and maintain coopera-tive relationships with the state's ... courts.\" 75 As a consequence, most 74.

Promote and utilize the National Judges Helping Judges Helpline (800- 219-6474). The ABA Commission on Lawyer Assistance Programs' Judi-cial Assistance Initiative created this nationwide confidential helpline to assist members of the judiciary who may be experiencing issues related to substance abuse or mental health disorders, including vicarious trauma, chronic stress, and burnout. Answered by professional staff at the Texas Lawyers' Assistance Program, this helpline matches the caller with a vol- unteer judge (typically in another state) who has experienced the same issue. 77 Referrals to professional resources (e.g., psychotherapists or treat- ment centers) will also be made upon request. 22. V olunteer for Supreme Court task forces or judicial well-being commit- tees. Lawyer Assistance Programs have valuable information on the core behavioral issues that lead to impairment, maintain current knowledge of local resources for intervention and treatment, and have a corps of volun-teers that stand ready to assist individuals, as well as to conduct trainings or serve as speakers. Often, LAPs have recruited members of the state's judiciary to serve as volunteers. Consequently, they are uniquely posi- tioned to serve as a resource and support for well-being undertakings by judges. Despite their vast knowledge, unfortunately, LAPs are not always considered for inclusion when these projects are initiated. As such it may be incumbent upon LAP directors themselves to proactively offer services. Recommendations to Judges Individually While all stakeholders are responsible for ensuring a judicial system that pro- tects the well-being of its members, every jurist has a significant role to play in ensuring his or her resilience in the face of stress. Prior to making recommen-dations for individual judges, however, the authors first considered which of the stressors cited by responding judges can be changed and which are simply inher - ent to the requirements of the position. For example, the greatest stressor\u2014the importance and impact of decisions that jurists must make\u2014is integral to the role of an adjudicator and cannot be changed without altering the very role itself. Likewise, there is very little that a 76.

However, several stressors are within the control of every judge, such as fatigue and social isolation, failing to take adequate breaks, and fostering healthy habits. The following sets out a list of evidence-based strategies that are known to promote self-care and enhance resiliency, all of which are in each individual judge's locus of control. 78 In describing these options, we recognize that social expectations of judges can stand in the way of beginning self-care and resilience strategies. By offering what might seem like very basic steps and recommenda- tions, we hope to ease that path to better well-being. Resiliency and Stress Management. Resiliency is the ability to rebound after a crisis or a setback. While it is often thought of as returning to a pre-stress state, increasingly, resiliency is considered as: (1) returning to a higher state of functioning due to having learned what can be done to avoid or mitigate the stress in the future, (2) building more effective coping skills, and (3) using effective inter - personal resources. Resiliency can be promoted through building more physical resistance to stress through improved sleep habits, sound nutrition, exercise, and relaxation. Mental resilience can be developed through such practices as mindful-ness, reflection on experiences, sufficient sleep, positive self-talk, and beliefs that give meaning and direction and help make sense of sometimes confusing or over - whelming events. Finally, relationships with others can provide protection against stress. Relationships offer judges the ability to: share their experiences, fostering rebounding; break isolation, a key concern and connect with people who care for the judge. These practices also overlap in benefits for the body, mind, and spirit. Vicarious Resilience. As much as the horrific nature of some cases can pro- duce vicarious trauma, seeing survivors' personal strength, resourcefulness, spirit, and hope can be a source of inspiration and vicarious resilience for a judge. The idea that exposure to trauma could be both harmful and beneficial was an out-growth of therapists working with refugees and severely traumatized clients. Rec-ognition of personal resilience in survivors could prevent burnout in providers, 79 and could benefit judges as well. Crises that lead people to court can also be a pivotal point for beneficial change for many people. Many survivors have learned to utilize supports more effectively, redefine their lives and goals, and become advocates for others in crisis. Reassessing personal issues in comparison to others 78. See National Task Force Report, supra note 4, at 9-10. The Report sets out six facets of well-being, based upon a definition drawn from the World Health Organization which defines mental health as, \"a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contri- bution to her or his community.\" The six facets are: occupational, Intellectual, spiritual, emotional, social and physical. 79.

Stress has, as one of its effects, a dampening of energy and interest in physical activity. Intentional persistence in maintaining or increasing activity can help reverse this process.81 If one has not been physically active, checking with a physician or exercise physiologist should occur before starting an exercise plan. Generally, exercise starts slowly and for shorter periods with low intensity activities such as walking, biking, light weightlifting, or swimming. Exercise in a group can be helpful for social interaction and support. As strength and endurance improve, exercise can progress to faster or longer practice or group sports. Moni-toring heart rate can also be helpful to check excessive activity but also as feed-back on progress. Exercise also improves sleep, appetite, and immune response, and is a recommended treatment for depression. Sleep. Sleep difficulties in the United States are considered a public health cri- sis according to studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Sleep Foundation, and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health (Goldschmidt, 2017). 82 Although there is some normal variability in duration of sleep, on average, people need about eight hours. Persistent disrup-tion of the duration or quality of sleep has dramatic implications for health. Sleep deficits are related to greater susceptibility to stress, interference with awareness and concentration, poor memory, and a host of health problems including apnea, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. A study of judicial sleepiness have resulted in judges losing their driver's license, case retrial, and retirement. 83 Severe snoring and potential apnea should be discussed with a physician and consideration of a sleep study to determine the cause and treatment. The importance of sleep cannot be overestimated. During sleep new learning is consolidated and creative ideas are connected. Dreaming helps reduce the emo-tional intensity of experiences, deep sleep helps recover physical energy, and the waste products of the brain (associated with Alzheimer's disease) are flushed out of the brain. Less than the recommended eight hours of restful sleep a night can impair a person's judgment without the person being aware of it. Avoiding electronic devices before bedtime can reduce the effect of their \"blue screen\" lighting that can interfere with production of melatonin that signals the onset of sleep. Sleeping at a regular time, having a ritual before sleep (leisure reading, bathing, etc.), turning off sources of light (that can interfere with mela-tonin), cool room temperature, using a sleep mask, masking sounds with a \"white 80.

Mindfulness practice also can help put aside thoughts of the day. Mindfulness. Judicial routine is occupied by constant thinking, examin- ing, and judging often at the expense of reflection and mental respite from these demands. Mindfulness involves awareness without intention, comment or judg-ment\u2014a deserved \"time out\" from deliberation. 84 Like physical exercise, mindful- ness needs to be practiced regularly to provide benefits. Mindfulness is simply keeping one's awareness in the present. Depression can be thought of as the gap between the present and the disappointments or regrets of the past; anxiety as the gap between the present and the anticipated future. We react as if our memories or anticipations are real, but the past is over and the future still undetermined. A focus on the present allows a person's thoughts and physiol-ogy to become quiet, relaxed, and enables a judge to engage feeling more centered and refreshed. Starting mindfulness practice can be for as little as a few minutes several times a day and involve simply being aware of surroundings or paying attention to the rhythm of breathing. With practice of 10-20 minutes a day, it becomes easier to let go of intrusive thoughts and images. Quiet walks in nature are often particu-larly relaxing, whether actually doing it or even imagining it. Increasingly, mindfulness is becoming recognized as a highly effective tool in managing stress. The Florida Bar Journal (April 2016) focused an entire issue on the topic. 85 Mindfulness research shows that it can be helpful in promoting sleep, reducing negative thoughts and rumination, improving decision making, being less emotionally reactive, reducing anxiety and depression, increasing attention and awareness, increasing immune functioning, and lowering blood pressure. In his article titled, Mindfulness and Judging, Judge Jeremy D. Fogel describes how routine judicial activities can be enhanced through mindfulness. Mindfully \"taking a plea\" will cause the judge to carefully observe the defendant's dress and body language; whether the defendant has friends or family members present; and the interaction between the defendant and their attorney. 86 84.

JPL_2020.indd 30 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 31 \"Laughter is good medicine.\" The use of judicial humor is controversial given the propriety of the court,87 but as used here it refers to the out-of-court use of appropriate humor and especially the physiological and psychological effects of laughter. The Mayo Clinic reports that a good rolling laugh stimulates the heart, lungs, and muscles, releases the reward endorphins in the brain, and promotes lower blood pressure and relaxation afterwards.88 Its subsequent positive thoughts enhance the immune system, reduce pain, and lessen anxiety and depression. Watching others laugh can also stimulate an individual's own empathic laughter. Movies, stories, cartoons, jokes, spending time with family and friends laughing, and even just practicing an intentional deep laugh can provide these benefits. Stretching and Relaxing Movement. Sitting on the bench all day for many days can extract energy, lead to postural headaches and muscle strain, and produce emotional tension. In recent years, yoga, t'ai chi, Pilates, and other stretching and movement practices have become popular and effective for tension reduction, low impact physical exercise, and mindfulness. Yoga involves relaxing and stretching postures that are graduated to a person's fitness level. T'ai chi (pronounced \"tie gee\") is a traditional Chinese exercise that involves a series of slow-motion move-ments based on self-defense, and are relaxing, low impact, meditative and can improve balance. Pilates is more physically active and involves low impact flex- ibility, muscular strength, and endurance movements. An example of this activity takes place in the 4th Court of Appeals courtroom at the Cadena-Reeves Justice Center in San Antonio, Texas, where time is set aside a few days each week to practice yoga. Judges, attorneys, court reporters, bailiffs and clerks gather to prac-tice yoga and reduce the strain of court work. 89 Judicial Family Resilience. The stresses that confront judges are reported in this study, but there are challenges and stresses impacting family members, too.90 Our survey revealed that having less time for family, and an increase in fam- ily arguments and conflicts can be a consequence of judicial stress as well. Run- ning for election can bring family members into public life in ways they had not intended, long work hours can place an extra burden on spouses or partners, and the isolation and emotional stress on a judge can be a source of worry to family members that further increases stress on the judge. There are several recommenda-tions that can mitigate family stress. It is important for family members of all ages to appreciate the role of a judge. Confidentiality should be explained as well as 87. Marshall Rudolph, Judicial Humor: A Laughing Matter?, 41 Hastings L. J. 175 (1989). 88. Stress Relief from Laughter?

Security and safety issues and coping with social pressures at school and in the community can be an unspoken concern. Discussing these issues candidly may elicit good discussion and better understanding of the stresses experienced by all. It is also important for judges to listen attentively to the feelings, perspectives, interests and concerns of family members, and spend time on family activities. Children can be invited to attend family workshops and support programs, as well as judicial conferences where they can meet members of other judges' families. Cultivation and Maintenance of Supportive Relationships. Isolation is one of the most frequently reported sources of stress across many surveys of judges. Supportive relationships are a key component for building judicial resiliency. As discovered in this study, judges often feel isolated for many reasons. Having close friends outside the profession, supportive colleagues who can caringly listen to a judge's experiences, and participating in rounds where judicial stress is normal- ized and resiliency practices are shared, can reduce feelings of isolation. Dr. Isaiah Zimmerman, a clinical psychologist on the faculty of The National Judicial College recommended that judges maintain relationships with old and childhood friends, have a close circle of relatives with whom to have candid conversations, engage in activities and new friendships unrelated to legal activities, and mentor others. 92 Meaningfulness of Work. The repetitive exposure to cases involving trauma and horror can challenge a judge's sense of order and meaning in the world, undermine morale, and lead to burnout. In contrast to a psychological focus on pathology, Martin Seligman, Co-Founder of \"Positive Psychology,\" emphasizes well-being as \"belonging to and of serving something that you believe is bigger than the self.\" 93 In many ways, this is a philosophical or spiritual emphasis that is often disregarded in stress management and wellness programs. It focuses on meaning, direction, and goals in life, and how those can be superordinate over the tragedies often experienced. Work is a major contributor to how one's life gen- erates meaningfulness. Sara J. Ward & Laura A. King have identified six fruit-ful \"pathways\" to enhance meaningfulness: make people happy, connect people and contribute to others, help others identify goals and feel motivated, help oth-ers develop a sense of coherence and structure in their lives, provide financial resources that can support meaningful pursuits, and explore religious and philo- sophical beliefs and values that foster purpose and meaning. 94 91.

JPL_2020.indd 32 12/9/20 2:44 PM Stress and Resiliency in the U.S. Judiciary 33 Future Research The scope of a research project, by necessity, has limits and does not cover all aspects of an issue. However, the results of this survey demonstrate the need for additional research on judicial stress and resiliency. The following are suggestions for future inquiry. Representation of some demographic groups in this study were very small, thereby not lending themselves to more detailed analysis. Future research could focus more exclusively on these judges and how they experience stress and promote well-being (e.g., Native Americans, Asian, Pacific Islanders, etc.). Alternate gender identification as a demographic was also not identified in this study due to expected small numbers as well as sensitivity. This impor - tant issue may be useful to explore in future work. Since the presentation of the preliminary results of this study at the ABA CoLAP 2019 National Conference for Lawyer Assistance Programs in Aus-tin, Texas, the important conversation about judicial stress and resiliency has expanded. It may be useful to form a collaboration or consortium of researchers on this topic across the U.S. to share methods, instruments, and data on judicial stress and wellness. This study revealed that there are some clear differences between men and women in judicial roles. This could be more clearly explored to identify the implications of the differences and recommendations for resiliency for each gender, and alternate genders not identified in this study. The use of drugs, both prescribed and illicit, and compulsive behaviors, to manage stress should be the subject of future studies. In particular, given the move towards legalization, marijuana and its effects should be studied. Conclusion The National Judicial Stress and Resiliency Survey is one of the largest and most representative surveys of judges on the topic of stress and its effects to date. It has identified sources of judicial stress and their multifaceted impact on well-being and performance. The survey provides a better understanding of coping methods that judges employ. The elements necessary to be an effective judge\u2014logical decision-making, focus, and memory\u2014are affected by the stress and emo-tional depletion often experienced by many judges as this survey indicates. It is critical to judicial performance that tactics bolstering resiliency and mitigating stress are embraced by the judiciary and key stakeholders. JPL_2020.indd 33 12/9/20 2:44 Biographies David X.

It will identify general and unique sources of stress by judicial setting and the impact of stress on aspects of well-being. The survey will also identify how coping mechanisms, including resiliency practices, are employed to deal with stress. The results will help clarify areas for sup- port and services, implications for stress management and resiliency skills, and serve as context for considering changes in early professional development and continuing education. This study has been approved by an Institutional Review Board.

Screening and Investigation Disposition after Full Investigation.(1) Upon the conclusion of a full investigation, disciplinary counsel may rec- ommend to the investigative panel: (b) private admonition or deferred discipline agreement;(2) If the investigative panel finds that there is reasonable cause to believe the judge committed misconduct, (a) it may propose a private admonition or deferred discipline agreement to the respondent and if the respondent consents, it shall admonish the respondent or implement the deferred disciplinary agreement; in addi- tion, it may assess costs against the respondent as a condition of the pri-vate admonition or deferred disciplinary agreement. JPL_2020.indd 49 12/9/20 2:44 PM50 Journal of The Professional Lawyer Comment: A deferred disciplinary agreement may be entered into only with the con- sent of the judge. The agreement sets forth conditions imposed by the investiga- tory panel with which the judge must comply in order to avoid the reinstatement of disciplinary proceedings. The agreement must be in writing. A deferred disci-pline agreement does not constitute a finding that misconduct was committed. It is appropriate only when the alleged misconduct is minor, that is, it does not reflect on the judge's fitness for office, and when the underlying cause of the misconduct can be addressed through a treatment or rehabilitation program. Upon successful completion of the program the complaint will be dismissed. If the judge fails to complete the program, the investigative panel may proceed to determine whether to dismiss the complaint against the judge, impose a private admonition with the consent of the judge or direct disciplinary counsel to file formal charges or a peti- tion for transfer to incapacity inactive status.

Deferral of impairment cases. A. If the commission finds during the course of an investigation that there is cause to believe that any misconduct specified in the complaint was the result of alcohol, drug, or substance abuse, addiction, or a mental or emotional disorder, the commission and the judge may agree that the judge undergo confidential evalu-ation through the Alabama Lawyers Assistance Program (\"ALAP\"). Should the evaluation reveal the existence of a condition for which treatment through ALAP is appropriate, the commission may thereafter enter into a diversion agreement with the judge under which resolution of the complaint is deferred upon the condi- tion that the judge participate in the professional treatment, counseling, after-care, and/or other assistance program recommended in the ALAP evaluation. Every diversion agreement shall be reduced to writing, shall provide for peri- odic reporting by ALAP to the commission regarding the judge's compliance or noncompliance, and shall be signed by the judge and the chairman of the com- mission. A copy of the agreement will be given to the judge; the original shall be maintained in the commission's file. Upon the judge's satisfactory completion of the agreed treatment, counseling, or other assistance program, the commission may dismiss the complaint or take other appropriate action. If the commission finds the judge is noncompliant with treatment or has otherwise failed to successfully com- plete the agreed program, the commission may reopen the deferred matter.

E. Consideration of Complaint (2) The Commission shall make such initial inquiry as is necessary to determine if the complaint is founded and within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commission may also conduct further inquiry, begin an investigation, agree to a deferred resolution, or issue a private cau-tion. If the final disposition is by deferred resolution or private caution, the judicial officer shall have had the opportunity to respond to the alle- gations in writing and the complainant shall be notified that appropriate action was taken without specifying the nature of the disposition. (5) If the investigation does not disclose probable cause to warrant further proceedings, the Commission may dismiss the complaint with a finding that no misconduct occurred, may conduct further investigation, or may issue a deferred resolution or private caution, and the judicial officer shall be so notified. Where a deferred resolution or private cau-tion is imposed, the judicial officer shall have had an opportunity to respond in writing to the allegations. (7) If, upon the conclusion of a full investigation, the Commission does not find probable cause to believe that misconduct has occurred, the Commission shall dismiss the complaint.

LOUISIANA http://www.lasc.org/rules/supreme/RuleXXIII.asp Louisiana Supreme Court RULE XXIII. THE JUDICIARY COMMISSION Section 31. Deferred Recommendation of Discipline Agreement.After a notice of hearing has been filed, the Commission may enter into a Deferred Recommendation of Discipline Agreement (DRDA) with the respondent judge. A DRDA must contain the following provisions and may contain such other provi-sions as the Commission deems appropriate: (a) The judge must admit to some or all of the ethical violations alleged in the notice of hearing, agree to a private admonishment for such conduct, and agree to take specified remedial steps during the term of the DRDA to address any harm caused by the judge's conduct and to prevent a recurrence of such conduct. The JPL_2020.indd 52 12/9/20 2:44 PM Diversion and Deferred Discipline Agreements 53 judge must also consent to having the Commission recommend a specified type of discipline to this Court if the Commission determines by clear and convincing evidence, after a hearing before a hearing officer or the Commission, as decided by the Commission, that the judge did not comply with the terms and conditions of the DRDA. (b) The Commission must agree to defer making a recommendation of disci- pline to this Court during the term of the DRDA provided its terms and conditions are complied with. If the Commission makes a recommendation of discipline in a case in which a DRDA has been executed, this Court is not bound to impose the type of discipline referenced in the DRDA and may impose any discipline autho-rized by the Louisiana Constitution, or no discipline at all. Before a hearing has been held on the allegations contained in a notice of hearing, the respondent judge may request, or the judge and the Special Counsel may jointly request, a DRDA within the time specified for such requests in the case management order. The request may be submitted in the form of a pleading or by letter to the Commission, in care of Commission Counsel, with a copy to the Special Counsel, and shall include a detailed statement of the terms and conditions of the proposed DRDA. If the Special Counsel has not joined in the request, the request shall also contain a statement as to the Special Counsel's position on the request, if known to the judge. Unless the request was made jointly by the judge and the Office of Special Counsel, the Commission shall grant the Office of Spe-cial Counsel an opportunity to respond to the request. After a hearing has been held on the allegations contained in a notice of hear - ing and the judge has appeared before the Commission for further proceedings in accordance with Section 29(f) of this rule, the Commission may, in its discretion, propose to the judge that the case be resolved with a DRDA. In deciding whether to grant a DRDA, the Commission may consider any fac- tors it deems appropriate, including but not limited to the following: (1) The nature and seriousness of the misconduct; (2) The respondent judge's length of service on the bench; (3) The nature of the procedures or steps the judge has taken, or proposes to take, to correct the problem and avoid a recurrence of it; (4) Whether the misconduct was private or public; (5) Whether the judge received any private benefit as the result of engaging in the ethical misconduct; and (6) Whether the judge has previous proven misconduct. The fact that a DRDA has been executed and the contents of the DRDA shall remain confidential unless the judge fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the DRDA, in which case the DRDA shall become a public record upon the matter being lodged with this Court. If the conditions of the DRDA are satisfied by the judge and the DRDA expires according to its terms, the underly-ing conduct and the fact that an admonishment was given pursuant to a DRDA may be referenced in another matter involving the judge in accordance with Sec- tion 3(e) of this rule.

Judges and Judicial Appointees, Chapter 400, Judi- cial Disabilities and Discipline, Division 4. Disposition Other than Filing of Charges RULE 18-426. Conditional Diversion Agreement (a) When Appropriate. The Commission and the judge may enter into a conditional diversion agreement if, after an investigation by Investigative Counsel: (1) the Commission concludes (A) that any alleged sanctionable conduct was not so serious, offensive, or repeated as to justify the filing of charges or, if charges already had been filed, the imposition of any immediate discipline, and (B) that the appropriate disposition is for the judge to undergo specific treatment, participate in one or more specified educational or therapeutic programs, issue an apology to the complainant, or take other specific corrective or remedial action; and (2) the judge, in the agreement, (A) agrees to the specified conditions, (B) waives the right to a hearing before the Commission and subsequent proceed-ings before the Court of Appeals, (C) agrees that the conditional diversion agree-ment may be revoked for noncompliance in accordance with the provisions of section (b) of this Rule, and (D) agrees that the agreement may be admitted in any subsequent disciplinary proceeding against the judge to the extent that it is relevant to the allegations at issue or the sanction that may be imposed. Committee Note: A conditional diversion agreement may be the most appropriate response to the situation set forth in subsection (a)(1) where any sanctionable conduct was predominantly the product of the judges impairment, as it can provide a meaningful opportunity for remedial assistance to the judge who, by consenting to the agreement, recognizes it is needed, as well as protection of the public. The judge is free, of course, to reject an offer of a conditional diversion agreement, in which event the Commission may deal with any sanctionable con-duct in other ways. (b) Compliance. The Commission shall direct Investigative Counsel or some other person to monitor compliance with the conditions of the agreement and may direct the judge to document compliance. The monitor shall give written notice to the judge of the nature of any alleged failure to comply with a condition of the agreement. If, after affording the judge at least 15 days to respond to the notice, the Commission finds that the judge has failed to satisfy a material condition of the agreement, the Commission may revoke the agreement and proceed with any other disposition authorized by these Rules. If, upon request of the judge, a moni- tor other than Investigative Counsel is appointed, all reasonable expenses of the monitor shall be assessed against the judge. (c) Not a Form of Discipline. A conditional diversion agreement under this section does not constitute discipline or a finding that sanctionable conduct was committed. JPL_2020.indd 54 12/9/20 2:44 PM Diversion and Deferred Discipline Agreements 55 (d) Notice to Complainant; Confidentiality. The Commission shall notify the complainant that the complaint has resulted in an agreement with the judge for corrective or remedial action. Except as permitted in Rule 18-407, the terms of the agreement shall remain confidential and not be disclosed to the complainant or any other person unless the judge consents, in writing, to the disclosure. (e) Termination of Proceedings. Until the conditions of the agreement have been fully satisfied, the complaint remains open. Upon notification by Investigative Counsel that the judge has satisfied all conditions of the agreement, the Commission shall terminate the proceedings.

The Commission may not enter into an agreement with a judge to defer for - mal disciplinary proceedings if the Commission has determined, pursuant to NRS 1.467, that there is a reasonable probability that the evidence available for introduction at a formal hearing could clearly and convincingly establish grounds for disciplinary action against the judge pursuant to NRS 1.4653.

The Commission may enter into an agreement with a judge to defer formal dis- ciplinary proceedings only in response to misconduct that is minor in nature. 4. A deferred discipline agreement entered into pursuant to this section must be in writing and must specify the conduct that resulted in the agreement. A judge who enters into such an agreement must agree: (a) To the specified rehabilitation, treatment, education or minor corrective action; (b) To waive the right to a hearing before the Commission; and (c) That the agreement will not be protected by confidentiality for the pur - pose of any subsequent disciplinary proceedings against the judge, and the agreement must indicate that the judge agreed to the terms set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). Such an agreement must expressly authorize the Com-mission to revoke the agreement and proceed with any other disposition of the com- plaint or formal statement of charges authorized by NRS 1.467 if the Commission finds that the judge has failed to comply with a condition of the agreement.5. The Executive Director of the Commission shall monitor the compliance of the judge with the agreement. The Commission may require the judge to document his or her compliance with the agreement. The Commission shall give the judge writ-ten notice of any alleged failure to comply with any condition of the agreement and shall allow the judge not less than 15 days to respond. 6. If the judge complies in a satisfactory manner with the conditions imposed in the agreement, the Commission may dismiss the complaint or take any other appropriate action.

Rule 35: InterventionDuring the course of an investigation, upon the good faith belief that the alleged misconduct was caused by mental illness, drug dependency, addiction to alcohol, or temporary mental infirmity, the Board shall take one or more of the following actions: (2) request that the judicial officer seek appropriate treatment;(4) upon application of the judicial officer, the Board may approve an appropriate treatment program. CHAPTER 11. Special Procedures for Cases Involving Substance Abuse The Judicial Conduct Board recognizes that the judiciary, like the general popula-tion, includes individuals impaired by substance abuse. Because judges exercise a unique public trust, the Judicial Conduct Board, in devising its rehabilitative diversion procedure, desires to encourage affected members of the judiciary to seek help at the earliest possible moment so as to ensure maximum protection against misconduct resulting from their impairment. The Board seeks to achieve this objective through a realistic plan to mitigate the harmful consequences of sub-stance abuse to the judiciary and the public. The primary function of this Policy is the rehabilitation of the judge; a secondary modality is the prompt disposition of substance abuse related complaints, obviating costly and time consuming investi- gations, hearings and related proceedings. Rule 36: Petition for Rehabilitative DiversionA. When the Board finds probable cause to investigate a Complaint alleging mis-conduct involving a substance abuse, the Board may notify the Judicial Officer of its investigation and provide the Judicial Officer with an opportunity to petition the Board for permission to enter a rehabilitative diversion program acceptable to the Board prior to the filing of formal charges with the Court of Judicial Discipline. JPL_2020.indd 57 12/9/20 2:44 PM58 Journal of The Professional Lawyer B. Such petition shall be filed with the Board promptly. Absent Board approval, a petition shall not be considered if filed after the Judicial Officer's response to the Board's Notice of Full Investigation. C. The petition for rehabilitative diversion shall contain(1) the Judicial Officer's verified statement that he/she desires to participate in a qualified treatment program; (2) a release giving Board Counsel access of all information and records bearing on the rehabilitative program, including information concerning the applicant's part substance abuse and treatment, as well as the proposed rehabilitative program; (3) a stipulation as to facts which are agreed to by the Judicial Officer and Board Counsel relevant to the formal charges; and agreement of the admissibility of such stipulation in any future proceeding before the Court of Judicial Discipline; (4) a waiver by the Judicial Officer of the right to file pre-trial motions based on grounds then known to the applicant unless specifically modified as exceptions to the waiver; and (5) the Judicial Officer's consent to submit to testing for drug or alcohol consump-tion during any probationary period later imposed.Rule 38: Diversion ProcedureA. When a Judicial Officer enters a rehabilitation diversion program pursuant to this Chapter, the Board may defer filing formal charges with the Court of Judicial Discipline for a reasonable period of time to permit the completion of the pro-gram, provided that the Judicial Officer consents in writing to the release of treat-ment information and records relating to his or her participation in the program.B. When a Judicial Officer satisfactorily completes an approved inpatient rehabili- tation program, the Board shall continue the matter for a twelve (12) month proba- tionary period, which may be conditioned on the Officer's continued participation in a recommended recovery program. D. If the Board determines that the applicant Judicial Officer has abandoned the recovery program, or has violated the terms in any substantial way, the Board may direct the filing of charges before the Court of Judicial Discipline, or take such other action as may be appropriate in the circumstances.

DEFINITIONS(7) \"Deferred discipline agreement\" means a confidential agreement between the judge and the Board setting forth conditions for the judge to undergo treatment, counseling, education, or other corrective action. It is available only as a response to misconduct that does not require prosecution and sanctions and that can be addressed through nondisciplinary means.Rule 8. ALTERNATIVES TO A FORMAL COMPLAINT(3) Deferred discipline agreement. The Board may propose a deferred discipline agreement in any case in which it believes a violation has occurred but (a) the conduct is not a serious violation, and (b) the conduct did not appear to cause sig-nificant harm to any person, and (c) the judge admits the violation, and (d) there is no evidence of a pattern of similar violations by the judge, and (e) it appears to the Board that the conduct at issue is not likely to be repeated by the judge. Such an agreement may also be entered into if the Board considers it important to avoid future violations (for example, by assuring that substance abuse treatment JPL_2020.indd 60 12/9/20 2:44 PM Diversion and Deferred Discipline Agreements 61 or counseling is obtained) even when the current violation might not otherwise merit a Formal Complaint. Deferred discipline may not be imposed except by agreement. The agreement may impose terms and conditions as an alternative to discipline. Such terms and conditions may include, but are not limited to, educa-tion, psychological counseling, substance abuse programs, monitoring or review by the Administrative Judge or other suitable person, and\u2014with the concurrence of the Administrative Judge\u2014limitations on the performance of judicial duties. The Board may direct the Administrative Judge to monitor compliance with the conditions of the agreement, and may direct the judge to document compliance. The Board shall inform the Administrative Judge and the complainant that the complaint has resulted in a deferred discipline agreement, but unless the judge consents in writing, shall not inform the complainant of the terms of the agree-ment. If such an agreement is entered into after the filing of a Formal Complaint, the fact that a deferred discipline agreement has been entered into shall be made public, although the terms thereof shall remain confidential except when disclo-sure is permitted pursuant to Rules 6.(8), 6.(9), or 6.(27), above. In addition, such agreements may be reviewed and considered by the Board if relevant to determin-ing whether to proceed on any future complaint filed with the Board, or what sanc-tion to impose in any future proceeding before the Board. Copies of all deferred discipline agreements, once signed by the Board and the judge, shall be provided to the Supreme Court. Upon successful completion of all terms or conditions, the complaint will be dismissed. Subject to the disclosure provisions of Rule 6, the deferred discipline agreement shall remain confidential upon dismissal. A judge's failure to comply with a material term or condition of the agreement, without just cause, may result in the revocation of the agreement and further disciplinary action authorized by these rules, and may constitute an independent basis for discipline separate from the underlying complaint. If the judge does not consent to enter into a deferred discipline agreement, the Board may pursue any other action authorized by these rules.
