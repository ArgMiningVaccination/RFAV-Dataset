Acupuncture is a type of therapy that is part of traditional Chinese medicine. The idea behind acupuncture is that it may help to balance the flow of energy known as Qi (pronounced \"chee\") throughout the body. Traditional Chinese medicine explains that Qi flows through many connected \"channels\" or \"meridians\" in the body and can sometimes get blocked by illness, trauma, injuries or side-effects of some medications. Poor nutrition, working too much, not getting enough sleep, emotions and stress can also block the flow of Qi. It is believed that acupuncture can help rebalance the flow of energy. Why should I try acupuncture? Acupuncture therapy can be very helpful for patients with pain. Many clinics across the United States have found that acupuncture can be very helpful to their patients. What if I don't like needles? Some people may avoid acupuncture because it involves needles. What they may not know is that acupuncture needles are very thin-as thin as a strand of hair-and they attach very lightly into the skin. We often say that it \"sticks to the skin\" (like a sticker). We like to refer to the needles as \"whiskers,\" because they feel and bend like the whisker of a dog or cat. What should I expect during the treatment? Each treatment starts with an evaluation to find the best locations to place the \"whiskers.\" This is done by checking the pulse on your wrist and by pressing on other areas such as your feet, stomach and neck. You may be surprised that these locations do not always include where the pain is located, and where you are having pain can be avoided. After a few points are selected, the tiny \"whiskers\" are placed in the acupuncture point and you just relax for a few minutes. Many people find it so relaxing that they end up taking a short nap. How soon should I expect to see results? While each person is different, many patients notice a change in their symptoms during the treatment. With each treatment after that, the body learns how to hold on to the effects of acupuncture longer and longer. The goal of the treatment is to help the body heal and to strengthen the way in which it heals. It's similar to using a machine at the gym to work on a specific muscle then repeating it over time to make that muscle stronger. Acupuncture is like that machine: It can help your body regain strength in an area that may be weak. How many treatments do I need? There is no specific number of treatments. However, each treatment will help your body learn what to do and how to hold on to the treatments over time. In the beginning, you may only need a treatment once a week, and after some time you may only need to get acupuncture once per month. At Children's Hospital Los Angeles we provide a program of 8 sessions to help families decide if acupuncture is right for them. Many research studies have found that acupuncture can be a helpful treatment for patients with pain. Some benefits include: - Lowers pain - Reduces need for medications - Reduces side-effects of medication (such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, etc.) - Reduces inflammation (swelling) and promotes healing - Lowers anxiety - Helps you fall asleep easier "}
