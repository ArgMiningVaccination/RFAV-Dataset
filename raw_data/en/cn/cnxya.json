Integrative medicine is a healing-oriented approach rooted in the idea of looking at the patient as a whole and incorporating alternative treatment options, along with traditional/conventional methods, when necessary. It is the best of both worlds! We recognize that traditional medicine plays an important role in patient care, but we also believe that alternative methods are equally as important and effective when appropriate. Integrative medicine seeks to utilize more natural options, with fewer side effects, as an adjunct to traditional medicine whenever possible. By combining these practices, we at Body by AIM360 give patients the most focused overall health and wellness plans with special attention to our main pillars of practice: weight loss, hormone health, and gut health.
