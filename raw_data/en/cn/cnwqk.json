We report the safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine during 18 mo following vaccination at 11 African sites with varying malaria transmission. Methods and Findings: 6,537 infants aged 6-12 wk and 8,923 children aged 5-17 mo were randomized to receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01 or comparator vaccine. VE against clinical malaria in children during the 18 mo after vaccine dose 3(per protocol) was 46% (95% CI 42% to 50%) (range 40% to 77%; VE, p,0.01 across all sites). VE during the 20 mo after vaccine dose 1 (intention to treat [ITT]) was 45% (95% CI 41% to 49%). VE against severe malaria, malaria hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalization was 34% (95% CI 15% (95% CI 11% to 27%),respectively (ITT). VE against clinical malaria in infants was 27% (95% CI 20% 21% to 33%], ITT), with no significant protection against severe malaria, malaria hospitalization, or all-cause hospitalization. Post- vaccination anti-circumsporozoite antibody geometric mean titer varied from 348 to 787 EU/ml across sites in children andfrom 117 to 335 EU/ml in infants (per protocol). VE waned over time in both age categories (Schoenfeld residuals p,0.001). The number of clinical and severe malaria cases averted per 1,000 children vaccinated ranged across sites from 37 to 2,365 and from 21 to 49, respectively; corresponding ranges among infants were 210 to 1,402 and 213 to 37, respectively (ITT). Meningitis was reported as a serious adverse event in 16/5,949 and 1/2,974 children and in 9/4,358 and 3/2,179 infants inthe RTS,S/AS01 and control groups, respectively. Conclusions: RTS,S/AS01 prevented many cases of clinical and severe malaria over the 18 mo after vaccine dose 3, with the highest impact in areas with the greatest malaria incidence. VE was higher in children than in infants, but even at modest levels of VE, the number of malaria cases averted was substantial. RTS,S/AS01 could be an important addition to currentmalaria control in Africa. Trial registration: http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00866619 Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary .

Introduction Considerable gains have been made in the control of malaria during the past decade as a result of improved diagnosis, introduction of effective treatment with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), and widespread deployment of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) [1,2]. It is estimated that malaria mortality fell by 45% in all age groups and by 51% in children under 5 y of age between 2000 and 2012. However, in 2012 Plasmodium falciparum still caused an estimated 207 million cases of malaria and 627,000 deaths, mostly in young children in sub-Saharan Africa [3], and the gains that have been made recently in malaria control are threatened by emerging insecticide and drug resistance [4,5]. New interventions are required if malaria is to be finally contained in the large areas of Africa where malaria transmission remains high [6]. A malaria vaccine is needed to complement current interventions. RTS,S/AS01 is currently the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate and the first to undergo large-scale phase 3 evaluation in Africa. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, which targets the pre- erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum , induces humoral and cellular immune responses to the circumsporozoite protein present on the surface of sporozoites and liver stage schizonts. RTS,S was identified as a potential candidate for further development following encouraging results in an experimental challenge study [7]. Subsequent phase 2 studies in adults and children showed that the vaccine was safe, was immunogenic, and provided protection against clinical episodes of malaria in the range of 30%-60% [8- 10]. The AS01 adjuvant was shown to be more immunogenic than the AS02 adjuvant used in initial studies [11], and RTS,S/AS01 was well tolerated and efficacious [12-14]. These encouraging phase 2 trial results led to the decision to conduct a large-scale phase 3 clinical trial involving 15,460 children recruited at 11 sites in seven countries across Africa. We have reported previously overall vaccine efficacy (VE) and safety during 12 mo of follow-up [15,16]. The first analysis, conducted in 6,000 children aged 5- 17 mo at the time of first vaccination, showed that, per protocol, RTS,S/AS01 gave 56% (97.5% CI 51% to 60%) protection against the first or only episode of clinical malaria and 47% (95% CI 22% to 64%) efficacy against severe malaria during 12 mo of follow-up. VE was lower in young infants vaccinated at the age of 6-12 wk when RTS,S/AS01 was given at the same time as routine Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines; VE against first or only clinical malaria episode in the per-protocol population was 31% (97.5% CI 24% to 38%) malaria and 37% (95% CI 5% to 58%) against severe malaria. The vaccine was immunogenic and generally safe, although an imbalance in cases of meningitis was seen in both age categories between participants who received RTS,S/AS01 and the control vaccine (rabies vaccine for children 5-17 mo at enrollment and meningococcal C conjugate vaccine for infants 6-12 wk at enrollment) [15,16].The objectives of the analyses reported in this paper were determination of VE in both age categories of children during 18 mo of follow-up, just prior to administration of a booster dose of RTS,S/AS01 and, for the first time, an analysis of variations in the immunogenicity and VE of RTS,S/AS01 by study site. Site-specificmeasurements of VE provide insight into the determinants of the overall estimates of VE and are used to calculate the number of clinical and severe malaria cases averted, important measures ofpublic health impact that will be useful to policy makers. Methods The trial protocol was approved by the ethical review board at each study center and partner institution and by the national regulatory authority in each country (Table S1A). The study wasconducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines[17]. Study Design Trial methods have been reported previously [15,16,18] and are available in the Text S1. This randomized, controlled, double-blind trial of the candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 is being conducted at 11 sites in seven African countries (Figure 1). The trial is designed to evaluate VE, safety, and immunogenicityduring an average period of 49 mo (range: 41-55 mo) after thefirst dose of study vaccine in children and an average period of41 mo (range: 32-48 mo) after the first dose of study vaccine inyoung infants. Informed consent was obtained from the partici-pants' parents or guardians. Children with a moderate or severe illness; a major congenital defect; malnutrition requiring hospital- ization; a hemoglobin concentration ,5.0 g/dl, or ,8 g/dl with clinical signs of decompensation; a history of atypical febrileseizures; a neurological disorder; or WHO stage III or stage IVHIV disease at the time of presentation were ineligible forenrollment. ITNs were provided or made available to any child who presented for screening. Reported ITN use or protection by indoor residual spraying was documented during a home visit12 mo after the third dose of study vaccine. Anthropometricmeasurements were taken at enrollment and 1 and 18 mo after thethird dose of study vaccine. Randomization and Vaccination From March 27, 2009, through January 31, 2011, 15,460 young infants and children were assigned randomly to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. One group received RTS,S/AS01 followed by a booster dose 18 mo after completing the primary vaccinationseries, a second group received the RTS,S/AS01 primaryvaccination series without a booster, and the third group receivedcomparator vaccines, rabies vaccine (VeroRab, Sanofi-Pasteur) forchildren or meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (Menjugate,Novartis) for young infants. This analysis combines the first and second groups (referred to as the RTS,S/AS01 group) and compares this with the third (control) group, prior to theadministration of the booster dose in the first group (Figure S1).Young infants received the study vaccine at the same time as EPIvaccines. Surveillance for Clinical and Severe Malaria Malaria was detected by passive surveillance. Clinical malaria was defined as an illness accompanied by a temperature $37.5 uCRTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine Trial: 18 Months Follow-up PLOS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 2 July 2014 | Volume 11 | Issue 7 | e1001685and P. falciparum asexual parasitemia ( .5,000 parasites/mm3)o r as an algorithm-defined case of severe malaria. Other case definitions are presented in Tables 1, 2, S2, and S5. Safety Surveillance Data on serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected by passive surveillance. SAE classification was made using all available clinical evidence, and was not bound by stringent laboratory or diagnostic criteria. Verbal autopsies were conducted on deathsthat occurred outside a hospital. SAEs were coded from clinician- assigned diagnoses according to the preferred terms of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) [19]. Immunogenicity Anti-circumsporozoite (anti-CS) antibodies were measured by ELISA in the first 200 participants in each age category at each study site at enrollment and 1 mo after the third dose of vaccine. The threshold for a positive titer was 0.5 EU/ml [20]. Figure 1. Study sites and malaria endemicity. Adapted from Hay et al. [34]. The location of each participating study site is shown on this previously published map showing the spatial distribution of P. falciparum (Pf) malaria endemicity. The data are the model-based geostatistical point estimates of the annual mean P. falciparum parasite rate (PR) age-standardized for 2-10 y for 2007 within the stable spatial limits of P. falciparum malaria transmission, displayed as a continuum of yellow to red from 0%-100% (see map legend). The rest of the land area was defined as unstablerisk (medium grey) or no risk (light grey).

All blood smears were read by two independent microscopists, and parasite densities were determined usingstandardized procedures. Discrepant findings were resolvedaccording to a formal algorithm. Standardized, automatedbiochemical and hematological methods were used. Standard microbiology methods for blood and CSF culture were followed using automated Bactec incubators and pediatric bottles (BactecBD Diagnostic Systems). A rigorous external quality assuranceprocess was implemented at all sites for all laboratory proceduresthat produced study end points. Statistical Analysis Efficacy against all episodes of malaria was analyzed by negative binomial regression with follow-up time as offset, allowing for interdependence between episodes within the same individual.Overall estimates were adjusted for study site as a fixed effect,whereas site estimates were unadjusted for covariates. Inter-sitevariation was evaluated by site interaction terms, and prespecified univariate analyses and multivariate models were used to explore the impact of covariates on post-vaccination anti-CS responses oron VE. Transmission intensity was defined in the models as themalaria incidence in control children or control young infants,depending on the age category included in the model. VE against all other clinical end points was estimated as a relative risk (RR) reduction with Fisher's exact p-values. VE over time was evaluated by Schoenfeld residuals p-values, Andersen-Gill Cox models with time-varying covariates, and incidence reduction by 6-mo periods.Vaccine impact was calculated as the difference in incidence between the RTS,S/AS01 and control groups, expressed per 1,000 children vaccinated for each 6-mo period of follow-up. Thecumulative number of cases averted over 18 mo was calculated bysumming the number of cases averted for each 6-mo follow-upperiod. The per-protocol population included all participants whoreceived three doses of vaccine and contributed to efficacy surveillance, starting 14 d after the third dose. The intention-to- treat (ITT) population included all participants who received atleast one dose of vaccine. The more specific primary casedefinition of clinical malaria was used for determination of VE.VE calculated using secondary case definitions is also reported. The co-primary end points of VE in infants and children, presented in prior publications, were described with 97.5% CIs; allother VE end points are presented with 95% CIs. A sensitivesecondary case definition (measured or reported fever in the prior24 h and P. falciparum parasite density .0 parasites/mm 3) was used for the evaluation of the impact of RTS,S/AS01 on clinical malaria because, in clinical practice, sick children who present to ahealth facility with any level of malaria parasitemia receivetreatment for malaria. Data were censored at the time ofadministration of a booster dose, 20 mo after dose 1, or at the date of emigration, withdrawal of consent, or death. Results Study Population Overall, 8,923 children and 6,537 young infants were enrolled. All randomized children and young infants were included in the ITT population, while 6,885 (77%) children and 6,003 (92%) young infants were included in the per-protocol population(Figures 2 and 3; Table S3). Baseline characteristics were similarin the two study groups but differed by site. ITN use was 78% inchildren and 86% in young infants (Figure S2, ITT).

Vaccine Efficacy in Children The incidence of all episodes of clinical malaria meeting the primary case definition during the 18 mo of follow-up in the per- protocol population was 0.69/person-year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 1.17/person-year in the control group, resulting in a VE of 46% (95% CI 42% to 50%), with overall estimates of VE consistent across case definitions and with the ITT analysis (ITT, VE = 45% [95% CI 41% to 49%]) (Tables 1 and S5; Figures 4, 5, and S3). Significant heterogeneity in VE was seen across sites, with VE ranging from 40% to 77% (interaction test, p,0.001; VE, p, 0.01 at all sites). VE in the ITT population ranged across sites from 41% to 70%. Analysis of site-specific VE in the per-protocol population did not suggest that this heterogeneity was driven by variations in transmission intensity (interaction between study group and transmission intensity, p= 0.66). Lower VE was associated with moderate anemia at baseline ( p=0.04) (Table S6). VE varied over time, being highest close to vaccination (Schoenfeld residuals p,0.001) (Figure S4), but it persisted throughout the observation period. The reduction in the incidence of clinical malaria by 6-mo periods was 68% (95% CI CI 19% to 33%) during months 13- 18 after vaccine dose 3. Corresponding values in the ITT population were 60% (95% CI 56% 35%) (Figures S5 and S6). VE against clinical malaria and severe malaria during the first 12 mo of follow-up is presented in Figure S8 and Table S15. VE against prevalent parasitemia, 18 mo after vaccination, was 31%(95% CI 17% to 42%) (ITT, VE = 29% (95% CI 15% to 51%) against severe malaria (ITT, VE against severe malaria = 34% [95% CI 15% to 48%]), 42% (95% CI 29% to 52%) against malaria hospitalization (ITT, VE against malaria hospitalization = 41% [95% CI 30% to 28%) all-cause hospitalization = 19% [95% CI 11% to 27%]) (Table 1). The incidence of severe malaria by 6-mo periods is shown in Figure S5. During the 18-mo follow-up period, the number of cases of clinical malaria averted per 1,000 children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01 in the ITT population ranged across sites from 37 to 2,365 (average for the 11 study sites: 829), and the number of severe malaria cases averted ranged from 21 to 49 (average across all sites: 18) (Figures 6-11; Table S8). The number of malaria hospitalizations averted per 1,000 children vaccinated ranged from 0 to 138 across sites (average across all sites: 43), and all- cause hospitalizations averted ranged from 23 to 132 (average across all sites: 52) during the same period (Table S8). Mortality was low; 107 children (1.2%) died during the observation period, 74/5,949 (1.2%) children in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 33/ 2,974 (1.1%) in the control group. VE was not demonstrated against all-cause mortality, malaria mortality, hospitalized pneu- monia, septicemia, or prevalent anemia, nor was there a detectable effect on childhood nutritional status or growth (Tables S7, S9, and S10; Figure S7). Vaccine Efficacy in Young Infants The incidence of all episodes of clinical malaria meeting the primary case definition during the 18 mo of follow-up in the per-protocol population was 0.71/person-year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 0.92/person-year in the control group, resulting in a VE of 27% (95% CI 20% to 32%), with overall estimates of VETable 2.

VE did not differ by study site (interaction betweenstudy group and site, p=0.17). VE waned over time (Schoenfeld residuals p,0.001). The reduction in incidence of clinical malaria by 6-mo period was 47% (95% CI 39% to 54%) 1- to 21%) during months 13-18 following dose 3.Corresponding values in the ITT population were 44% (95% CI37% 15% (95% CI 220% to 39%) against severe malaria (ITT, VE against severe malaria = 8%[95% CI 226% to 33%]), 17% (95% CI 27% to 36%) against hospitalization VE against malaria hospitaliza-tion = 13% [95% CI 17%) all-cause hospitalization = 5% [95% CI 27% to 15%]). A statistically non- significant increase in the incidence of severe malaria was observedin RTS,S/AS01 recipients in the last 6 mo of follow-up ( p= 0.17) (Figure S5). The number of cases of clinical malaria averted per 1,000 young infants vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01 in the ITT populationranged across sites from 210 to 1,402 (average for the 11 studysites: 449), and the number of severe malaria cases averted ranged from213 to 37 (average across all sites: 6) during the 18-mo follow-up period (Figures 6-9, 14, and 15; Table S8). One hundred seventeen young infants (1.8%) died during the 20-mo observation period, 83/4,358 (1.9%) infants in the RTS,S/AS01group and 34/2,179 (1.6%) in the control group. VE was not demonstrated against all-cause mortality, malaria mortality, hospitalized pneumonia, septicemia, or prevalent anemia, nor was there a detectable effect on nutritional status or growth (Tables S7, S9, and S10). Immunogenicity In children, post-vaccination anti-CS antibody mean titer (GMT) varied from 348 to 787 EU/ml across sites in the per- protocol population (Figures 16 and 17; Table S16), but post- vaccination titers did not explain the differences in level ofprotection ( p=0.24) (Table S11). Previous hepatitis B vaccination was not associated with a higher post-vaccination anti-CS antibody response ( p= 0.73; Table S12). However, younger age at the time of vaccination (5-11 mo versus 12-17 mo) and living in a higher transmission setting were associated significantly with higher post-vaccination anti-CS responses ( p,0.001 and p,0.001, respectively) (Table S12).

Safety SAEs were less frequent in the children vaccinated with RTS,S/ AS01 than in 24.3%), while no difference was found between vaccinated and control younginfants: incidence of meningitis persisted [15,16]. Meningitis wasreported as an SAE in 17 children (16 cases among the 5,949 children in the RTS,S/AS01 group and one case among the 2,974children in the control group [RR = 8.0 (95% CI 1.1 to 60.3)]). Nopathogen was identified in 11 cases, ten in the RTS,S/AS01 groupand one in the control group. A pathogen was identified in sixcases (four meningococcal, one pneumococcal, Haemoph- ilus influenzae ), all in the RTS,S/AS01 group. Six children with reported meningitis died, five in the RTS,S/AS01 group and onein the control group. Meningitis was reported as an SAE in 12young infants (nine cases among 4,358 young infants in theRTS,S/AS01 group and three among 2,179 in the control group[RR = 1.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 5.55)]). No pathogen was identified infive cases, three in the RTS,S/AS01 group and two in the control group. A pathogen was identified in seven cases (four pneumo- coccus and three salmonella), six in the RTS,S/AS01 group andone in the control group. Four infants with reported meningitisdied, two in the RTS,S/AS01 group and two in the control group.Meningitis cases were not temporally related to vaccination(Figure S9A). Most study sites reported 1-3 cases of meningitisduring the 18-mo follow-up period, while the site in Lilongwe, Figure 3. CONSORT diagram of infants aged 6-12 wk at enrollment followed until 18 mo post-vaccination.aScreening data had not been reported before the database freeze for the analysis published in 2011 for 22 infants in the 6-12-wk age category, and these participants werenot included in the 2011 CONSORT chart.bOne infant enrolled in the 6-12-wk age category who was reported to have received three doses of study vaccine (RTS,S/AS01 or comparator vaccine) was included in the per-protocol analyses reported previously, but was subsequently found to have received only the first dose of study vaccine.cTwo infants enrolled in the 6-12-wk age category who had been reported as ''attending Visit 16 (12 months post dose-3)'' in the 2012 CONSORT chart are reported as ''migrated/lost to follow-up'' in this CONSORT chart. In addition, one infant whowas reported as ''migrated/lost to follow-up'' in the 2012 CONSORT chart has been recorded as ''consent withdrawal'' in this CONSORT chart [15].doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1001685.g003RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine Trial: 18 Months Follow-up PLOS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 9 July 2014 | Volume 11 | Issue 7 | e1001685Malawi, reported 11 cases and the site in Kombewa, Kenya, reported five cases (Figure S9B). An overview of the analysesreported here is given in Table S17. Discussion RTS,S/AS01 provided protection against a range of predefined end points, including clinical and severe malaria, over an 18-mofollow-up period among children aged 5-17 mo at first vaccina-tion across a wide range of malaria transmission settings. VEagainst clinical malaria was 40% or higher in each setting butvaried significantly between sites. In contrast to previous phase 2trials, which found that efficacy decreased with increasingexposure [21,22], the variation in VE between study sites seenin this trial could not be explained by differences in the intensity ofmalaria transmission between sites, as measured by the incidenceof clinical malaria in control children or control young infantsapplied as an average transmission level for all participants at agiven site. However, there are several caveats to this finding. First,the presence of moderate anemia at enrollment, which may reflectmalaria exposure at the individual level, was negatively associatedwith VE. Second, in children, while there was no correlation foundbetween VE and transmission in a multivariate model, VEappeared higher at sites with a lower incidence of malaria(Figure 4). Differences in the incidence of clinical malaria betweensites may be influenced by various genetic and environmentalfactors independent of the transmission level. Differences in anti-CS antibody GMT across sites did not explain differences inefficacy.VE against clinical malaria was lower in young infants than in children. Severe malaria was more frequent, although the difference was not significant statistically, among young infant RTS,S/AS01 recipients compared with controls during the final follow-up period in this analysis, 12-18 mo after dose 3. This could be a chance finding or could indicate that the vaccineinterfered with the acquisition of natural immunity [23], an effect perhaps compounded by prompt access to diagnosis and treatment. Further follow-up is planned, and will include close monitoring of the 1/3 of participants who received the RTS,S/ AS01 primary vaccination series but not the RTS,S/AS01 booster dose. The current analysis has provided some clues as to why young infants respond less effectively to RTS,S/AS01 than children. Maternal antibodies are likely to have played a role, as young infants with detectable anti-CS antibodies at enrollment had a lower post-vaccination anti-CS response than young infants without detectable anti-CS antibodies at enrollment, and a highpost-vaccination anti-CS antibody titer was associated with VE in young infants. However, maternal antibodies cannot explain fully the lower anti-CS response in young infants, as those without detectable maternally derived anti-CS antibodies still had a lower post-vaccination anti-CS antibody GMT than did vaccinated children. Immune interference due to administration of RTS,S/ AS01 at the same time as EPI vaccines remains a possible factor.The fact that phase 2 trials showed that co-administration in one setting was associated with lower anti-CS responses than staggered administration in another setting supports this hypothesis [9,10].

Incontrast with findings from a phase 2 trial [26], we found noevidence that priming with hepatitis B vaccine in childrenexplained their enhanced anti-CS antibody response. VE waned over time in both young infants and children, as reported previously [15,16]. An analysis by 6-mo period showedthat the vaccine provided protection against clinical malaria throughout the follow-up period, but that there was a progressive decline in efficacy. However, these analyses need to be treatedwith caution; although the study groups were well matched duringthe first 6-mo period, this was not the case subsequently aschildren in the control group experienced more clinical malariathan children in the RTS,S/AS01 group, and thereby may haveacquired natural immunity, making the vaccine appear lesseffective by comparison. It will be important to determine whetherVE can be restored by a vaccine booster dose, which has beengiven after the 18-mo follow-up to half of the RTS,S/AS01recipients. The trial was conducted to a high ethical and clinical standard, with harmonization of procedures across sites [27,28]. Nonetheless,some anomalous findings were noted. The lack of VE among younginfants in Kintampo, Ghana, despite 47% VE among children anda post-vaccination anti-CS antibody GMT within the range seen at other sites, was unexpected, as was the lack of efficacy against prevalent malaria infection 18 mo post-vaccination in children atSiaya, Kenya. These may be chance findings but warrant further observation. Conducting this trial to high standards required facilitating access of trial participants to both outpatient and inpatient care;purchasing additional clinical and laboratory equipment; ensuringreliable supplies of essential medications, oxygen, and blood; andincreasing clinical staffing. Consequently, mortality was very lowin both study arms. This may explain why, in contrast to theresults of trials of other effective malaria control tools, such asITNs or prophylactic drugs, we did not find any impact of RTS,S/ AS01 on overall mortality [29,30] or on nutritional status [31]. Neither did we find an impact of the vaccine on the incidence ofhospitalized pneumonia or septicemia. The impact of RTS,S/AS01 on mortality and co-infections might be greater were thevaccine to be deployed in non-trial situations, where prompt, high-quality care is less readily available. The observed interaction between moderate anemia and decreased VE in older children is intriguing. As statedpreviously, anemia may be a sensitive indicator of individualexposure to malaria. Alternatively, anemia might indicate activemalaria infection, which can interfere with the development of arobust immune response to vaccinat ion [32]. Helminth infection is another frequent cause of anemia in toddlers and young children in sub-Saharan Africa, a nd helminth infection can also result in a reduced immunologica l response to vaccination [33]. Malnutrition is frequently asso ciated with anemia, but malnu- trition was not found to be a determinant of VE in our multivariate model. Figure 5.

Noobvious explanation for this association has been found, atemporal relationship to vaccination is lacking, and biologicalplausibility is low. A causal relationship cannot be confirmed orexcluded at this point. The occurrence of meningitis will befollowed closely during the remainder of the trial, with particularattention paid to the possible impact of a booster dose of vaccine. As with all large-scale, multicenter trials, this study had some weaknesses. Although strenuous efforts were made to standardizeclinical and laboratory methods across study sites, there may havebeen some variations in the clinical characteristics of casesrecruited at individual centers that could have contributed to thevariations in the level of VE seen across sites. It is possible thatvariations in factors such as the prevalence of co-infections(including HIV), micronutrient deficiencies, or socio-economic statuscould have contributed to the heterogeneity in immunogenicity andVE seen between sites, but these factors were not evaluated systematically. Finally, the incidence of clinical malaria ininfants was used as an indirect measure of the intensity ofmalaria transmission at each site, and it is possible that this isnot a very discriminatory factor, as it may be influenced byother variables such as the transfer of maternal antibodiesagainst malaria or access to treatment. A direct measure ofexposure such as the entomological inoculation rate might haveprovided a different ranking order between sites. Variations inthe immunogenicity and VE of RTS,S/AS01 between sitescould not be explained solely by variations in the level oftransmission of malaria, but the nature of other factors that may be involved remains to be determined. During 18 mo of follow-up, RTS,S/AS01 prevented many cases of clinical and severe malaria across the 11 sites in thetrial. Despite its lower efficacy in young infants, RTS,S/AS01also prevented a substantial number of cases of clinical malariain young infants.

Every year, more than 200 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, and more than 600,000 people, mainly children living in sub-Saharan Africa, die from thisparasitic disease. Malaria parasites are transmitted to people through the bites of infected night-flying mosquitoes and cause fever that needs to be treated promptly with anti-malarial drugs to prevent anemia (a reduction in red bloodcell numbers) and life-threatening organ damage. Malaria transmission can be prevented by using long-lasting insecticides sprayed on the indoor walls of homes to killthe mosquitoes that spread the malaria parasite or bysleeping under insecticide-treated nets to avoid mosquito bites and further reduce mosquito numbers. Widespread use of these preventative measures, together with the introduc-tion of artemisinin combination therapy (an effective anti- malarial treatment), has reduced the global burden of malaria by 45% in all age groups, and by 51% among youngchildren, since 2000. Why Was This Study Done? Unfortunately, the emer- gence of insecticide and drug resistance is threatening thisadvance in malaria control. Moreover, additional interven-tions\u2014specifically, effective malaria vaccines\u2014will be need- ed to eliminate malaria in the large areas of Africa where malaria transmission remains high. Currently, there is nolicensed malaria vaccine, but RTS,S/AS01, the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate, is undergoing phase 3 clinical trials (the last stage of testing before licensing) in infants andchildren in seven African countries. The RTS,S Clinical TrialsPartnership reported encouraging results on the efficacy and safety of RTS,S/AS01 during 12 months of follow-up in 2011 and 2012. Here, researchers report on the 18-month efficacyand safety of RTS,S/AS01. Vaccine efficacy (VE) is thereduction in the incidence of a disease (the number of new cases that occur in a population in a given period) among trial participants who receive the vaccine comparedto the incidence among participants who do not receive the vaccine. What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers randomly assigned 6,537 infants aged 6-12 weeks and 8,923 children aged 5-17 months to receive three doses of RTS,S/ AS01 or a control vaccine. During 18 months of follow-up,there were 0.69 episodes of clinical malaria (a hightemperature and parasites in the blood) per person-year among the children who received all the planned doses of RTS,S/AS01 (the ''per protocol'' population) and 1.17episodes per person-year among the control children\u2014a VE against clinical malaria in the per-protocol population of 46%. A similar VE was seen in an intention-to-treat analysisthat included all the enrolled children, regardless of whetherthey received all of the planned vaccine doses; intention-to- treat analyses reflect the real-life situation\u2014in which children sometimes miss vaccine doses\u2014better than per-protocolanalyses. In intention-to-treat analyses, the VE amongchildren against severe malaria (fever, parasites in the blood, and symptoms such as anemia) and hospitalization for malaria was 34% and 41%, respectively. Among infants, theVE against clinical malaria was 27% in both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses; the vaccine showed noprotection against severe malaria or hospitalization. In both infants and children, VE waned with time since vaccination. Across all the study sites, RTS,S/AS01 averted an average of 829 and 449 cases of clinical malaria per 1,000 children andinfants vaccinated, respectively. Finally, the serious adverseevent meningitis (inflammation of the tissues lining the brain and spinal cord) occurred more frequently in trial partici- pants given RTS,S/AS01 than in those given the controlvaccine, but the incidence of other serious adverse eventswas similar in both groups of participants. What Do These Findings Mean? These and other findings show that, during 18 months of follow-up, vaccina- tion of children and young infants with RTS,S/AS01 prevent- ed many cases of clinical and severe malaria and that theimpact of vaccination was highest in regions with thehighest incidence of malaria. They indicate, as in the earlier analysis, that the VE against clinical and severe malaria is higher in children than in young infants and suggest thatprotection wanes over time. Whether or not the vaccineplayed a causal role in the observed cases of meningitis cannot be determined from these results, and the occur- rence of meningitis will be followed closely during theremainder of the trial. Other study limitations (for example, variations in the clinical characteristics of participants from one center to another) may also affect the accuracy of thesefindings and their interpretation. However, by showing thateven a modest VE can avert a substantial number of malaria cases, these findings suggest that vaccination with RTS,S/ AS01 could have a major public health impact in sub-Saharan Africa.
