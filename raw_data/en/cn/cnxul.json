For the most part these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days. Listed below are vaccines licensed in the United States and side effects that have been associated with each of them. This information is copied directly from [CDC's Vaccine Information Statements](/vaccines/hcp/vis/index.html) (VISs), which in turn are derived from the [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices](/vaccines/acip/index.html) (ACIP) [recommendations](/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/index.html) for each vaccine. Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for [safety](/vaccinesafety/), and like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk and could put the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease.

Rarely, vaccination is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg, especially in older children when they receive their fourth or fifth dose.
