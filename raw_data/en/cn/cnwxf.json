Thank you for nourishing my zest for life and deepening my understanding of self love and connection : ) If you're reading this, you've come across an incredible organization that takes your hand upon arrival and holds it warmly until you depart. Each member of the Arkana staff offers their light and guidance in the most extraordinary way. They seem to have this knowing intuition of each individuals needs along their unique, spiritual journey. Their presence is a sincere gift - one that makes you feel completely safe, protected, comforted, respected and ready to jump into the ocean of your spiritual travels. This was my first time inviting the plant medicines of Ayahuasca, Hikuri (Peyote) and Sapo (Bufo Alvarius) into my body and spiritual practice.

Marakame Juan, Maestra Justina, Maestro Misael and Musician Ariel - Thank you for demonstrating selflessness, kindness and deep knowing. I will forever appreciate the healing atmosphere you orchestrated. Arkana helped me step into my authentic and genuine self. I'm more freed from past inhibitions. Strangers appear as divine creatures and I try to show them love by simply smiling. I feel more present and have harnessed the breath work exercises to bring calm and ease into my moments. I've got a long road ahead but Arkana has provided me the roadmap and foresight to endeavour on : ) Partaking in ceremony with the sacred plant medicines is no easy venture. It's soul surgery. I feel no need to look any further for my place of ceremony and healing. Arkana is my home and community. The world would be a much more loving and vibrant place if every human could spend a week there! My boyfriend and I both look forward to our next journey at Arkana Best wishes to you! May you find an open heart and awakened spirit : ) Much "}
