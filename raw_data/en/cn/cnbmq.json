Introduction Vaccination is known to prevent influenza infections [1,2] , and some studies argue that it also attenuates their course and reduces the need for intensive care treatment [3-5] , prevents cardiovascu- lar events [6,7] and respiratory complications [8]. However, the magnitude of the total effect on subsequent health outcomes, hos- pitalizations, mortality, and thus the overall impact on health is https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.06.019 0264-410X/ /C2112020 The Author(s).

Ulyte).Vaccine 38 (2020) 5187-5193 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Vaccine journal homepage: www.else vier.com/locate/vaccine debated, especially in older persons [9,10] . High-quality evidence is lacking, particularly for outcomes such as mortality, because randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are ethically questionable in the populations of greatest interest [11]. It is argued that a genuine uncertainty over the effect of the vaccination on mortality is not present, and vaccination is already broadly recommended for per- sonal and public health as part of standard care [12,13] . However, current ambiguity on the real-world effects of vacci- nation potentially undermines its uptake and could even con- tribute to vaccination coverage being low in many countries worldwide [14-16] . Without precise quantication of the expected effect, the potential benet of vaccination-related public cam- paigns and policies is also ambiguous. 1.1. Observational studies with administrative data The lack of real-world RCTs makes observational studies based on secondary data the next logical step. However, observational, especially cohort, studies are sometimes criticized as systemati- cally flawed due to unmeasured confounding [17-19] . The inability to completely rule out inherent biases, particularly when unspeci- c outcomes are studied, has resulted in some recommendations to avoid such studies altogether or to focus on test-negative design [18,20] . Nevertheless, observational studies of secondary administrative data can potentially contribute valuable information. Finding a suitable application for them is especially attractive as such data are readily available and could cover the whole population nation- ally or regionally. With appropriate planning (study design) and analysis strategy, observational studies can yield meaningful esti- mates of effect size and inform the research questions of future RCTs and other studies. Also, they could address outcomes that are unfeasible to investigate with an RCT due to low event rates. 1.2. Research question and aims of the study The goal of this study was to explore the value and role of sec- ondary claims data to inform the effectiveness of influenza vacci- nation in a systematic manner, thereby addressing recent methodological debates. We aimed to achieve sufcient reduction of threats to validity by carefully developing the study design according to the basic elements of the PICO approach: the selection of population, intervention, comparator group (control of con- founding), and outcomes. We compared the effect of vaccination on several health out- comes of varying specicity for influenza (all-cause mortality, specic hospitalizations with a respiratory infection or its potentialcomplication, and mortality after such hospitalizations). We were the most interested in the attenuating effect of vaccination on sub- sequent outcomes after an infection, such as mortality after influenza-related hospitalization. 2. Methods 2.1. Study framework and research question We explored how our broad research question could be speci- ed and answered with administrative claims data and the poten- tial biases reduced, by iteratively reviewing the components of the PICO approach and rening study design ( Fig. 1 )[21,22] . PICO approach is primarily used to formulate clinical questions [21], but can also be employed as a strategy to focus a research question. First, we considered the population - adult patients with chronic diseases for whom The Swiss Federal Ofce of Public Health (FOPH) recommends vaccination. We additionally analyzed the subgroup of/C2165-years-old persons with chronic diseases ( /C2165 subgroup). We hypothesized that the health status of older persons within this population would be dened better, as more health services are used, and thus, diagnoses are better captured in claims data. Second, we dened intervention as vaccination occurring between September 1 and December 31, 2014. In the models, we included vaccination as a time-varying exposure. Misclassication could not be avoided entirely, as some vaccination paid out-of- pocket may not be captured in the claims data. Third, to improve comparability of the vaccinated and non- vaccinated groups, we controlled for potential confounding and sequentially adjusted for (1) standard variables: age, sex, indica- tors of major chronic diseases, and number of pharmaceutical costs groups (PCG) in 2014, i.e., specic types of prescribed medications used as markers of chronic conditions [23], (2) additional variables of health care use and expenditure in the previous year (2013). The variables are described in detail in the next section. Fourth, we modelled all-cause mortality and specic hospital- izations as outcomes . We included both outcomes in a multi-state model to account for competing risks and investigate mortality after hospitalization. We expected specic hospitalizations and mortality after hospitalization to be more specic outcomes than all-cause mortality. Based on the rened research question, we formulated these hypotheses: that influenza vaccination would be associated with a smaller risk of mortality, specic hospitalization, and mortality after such hospitalization; that the effect will be greater on specic outcomes than all-cause mortality; and that the effect will be more pronounced during than after influenza season. We also expected Fig. 1. Iterative study improvement framework based on questions related to each element of PICO.5188 A. Ulyte et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 5187-5193the estimated effect to be more accurate in the /C2165 subgroup and after adjusting for additional variables. 2.2. Dataset and population We analyzed mandatory health insurance claims from the Hel- sana Group, covering approximately 1.2 million people (15% of the Swiss population). Basic mandatory health insurance in Switzer- land is provided by several private companies, Helsana Group being one of the largest. The Swiss Federal Ofce of Public Health (FOPH) recommends influenza vaccination for persons with increased risk for influenza complications (such as /C2165-year-old persons, patients with chronic diseases, pregnant women, and premature newborns) and those regularly in contact with such persons or with occupa- tional risk factors [13]. In this study, we included Helsana- insured patients older than 18 years with a clinical indicator of cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, neurologic, musculoskele- tal, hepatic or renal disease or immune deciency, as dened by the FOPH recommendations [13], for whom vaccination would be recommended. Indicators of these conditions were relevant PCG in 2014 and hospitalizations with a relevant diagnosis in 2013. Patients with incomplete insurance coverage in years 2014 or 2015, not surviving until September 1, 2014, receiving reimburse- ment for outpatient services via lump-sums in 2014 (which com- prises some patients living in nursing homes), asylum seekers, those living outside Switzerland, and Helsana employees were excluded. 2.3. Exposure (influenza vaccination), outcome and covariates For included patients, we screened for influenza vaccination claims (coded as J07BB02 with the Anatomical Therapeutic Chem- ical Classication System (ATC) [24]) between September 1 to December 31, 2014. A person was dened as immunized (effec- tively vaccinated) after two weeks from the claim. The beginning of the rst specic hospitalization in each period and death were recorded as outcome events. Specic hospitaliza- tions were identied by relevant Swiss Diagnosis-Related (SwissDRG, reflecting jointly major inpatient diagnoses andinterventions [25], referred to as hospitalization further on), which are detailed in the Supplementary Table 1a. The observation time was divided into three periods: before (September 1 - December 14, 2014), during (December 15, 2014 - May 3, 2015) and after (May 4 - August 31, 2015) the influenza season, based on the Euro- pean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) report [26]. An illustrative timeline of exposure and outcomes is shown in Fig. 2 . Additional explanatory variables were age, sex, number of PCG in 2014, binary variables of major chronic diseases, and variables of health care use and expenditure in 2013. Variables of major chronic diseases included indicators for cardiovascular, respira- tory, metabolic, neurologic, musculoskeletal, hepatic or renal dis- ease or immune deciency. Binary variables of health care use were: (1) an indicator of any hospitalization for acute disease, and (2) any stay in a nursing home. To reflect health care expendi- ture, we used the residuals of the total reimbursed expenditure in 2013, after modelling it with the predictive model used for Swiss risk equalization between health insurers [27]. This model uses variables of sex, age, and comorbidities to predict the annual health care expenditure. Thus, a positive residual could be an indi- cator of poor health status, independent of these variables. As the latter variables were included in the models as covariates sepa- rately, residuals instead of the total expenditure were used to pre- vent multicollinearity. 2.4. Sequence of data analysis Baseline characteristics for non-vaccinated and vaccinated patients (all and /C2165 subgroup) were calculated as percentages for binary and means with standard deviation for continuous vari- ables. Propensity models for vaccination were constructed but eventually not used due to low sensitivity. Separate Cox models were constructed for mortality and hospi- talizations, for all patients and the /C2165 subgroup. The effect of vaccination was stratied by time period. In addition, multi-state models including both death and hospitalizations, and thus consid- ering death after hospitalization, were run for all patients and the/C2165 subgroup. One expected effect of vaccination was attenu- ation of influenza infection and thus decreased mortality after Fig. 2. Observation period, intervention (vaccination) and outcomes timeline, The observation period was between Sept 1, 2014, and Aug 31, 2015. It was divided into three periods: before, during and after influenza season. Lines 1-5 represent example persons in the analyzed population. Dark blue represents vaccinated person-time (1,3,5). Vertical lines with * represent hospitalizations, regarded as events that happen on the hospitalization date. Death within the same time period as a hospitalization is a separate outcome in the multi-state model (4). The observation period ends on August 31, 2015 (1) or death, if earlier (2,3,4,5).A. Ulyte et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 5187-5193 5189hospitalization. Multi-state models can handle such multiple com- peting endpoints in a time-to-event analysis, and help to discern their interactions [28]. The analysis was done with R 3.6.0 [29]. The probability of vaccination is not constant through the before influenza season. Vaccination utilization is usually low before September, increases until mid-November and then decreases to low again by the end of December. Therefore, the probability of being vaccinated is not proportional to time in the before season. Furthermore, the relationship between the risk of mortality and propensity for vaccination might not be constant through the be- fore season. In consequence, a person with high mortality risk (i.e., terminally ill) might be disproportionally more likely to be vaccinated if surviving until December, as compared to surviving until October. For these reasons, we assumed that estimates of vac- cination effect would not be accurate in the before season and ana- lyzed only outcomes in the periods during and after influenza season. All procedures performed in the study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. Study data were anonymized before analysis. According to the national ethical and legal regulations, ethical approval was not required for this type of retrospective study. This was conrmed by a waiver of the competent ethics committee (Kantonale Ethikkommission Z\u00fcrich, dated January 11, 2017). 3. Results Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . Of 343,505 included persons, 22.4% were vaccinated, and 35.0% of 177,107 in the /C2165 subgroup. Vaccinated patients were older on average, had more morbidities, higher health care expen- ditures, and had been more frequently hospitalized for acute dis- ease or stayed in a nursing home in the previous year. Hazard ratios (HR) for vaccination effect on mortality and hos- pitalizations during and after influenza season are shown in Table 2 . In non-adjusted models, vaccination was associated with increased risks of events. Adjusted HR estimates for all patients and the /C2165 subgroup were similar. Adding covariates decreased HR both for mortality (away from null effect) and hospitalizations (closer to null effect). In the full model, the HR [95% CI] for mortal- ity during season was 0.82 [0.77-0.88] for all and 0.82 [0.77-0.88] for the /C2165 subgroup. It was closer to null effect after season. In contrast, HR for hospitalizations was greater than 1 during season,with a wider condence interval than for the mortality: 1.28 [1.15-1.42] for all and 1.22 [1.09-1.36] for the /C2165 subgroup. The estimates after season were closer to null effect, with slightly wider condence intervals, overlapping HR of 1. Effect estimates of the models are shown in full in Supplementary Table 2a. HR in multi-state models were similar to those in the single- outcome models ( Table 3 ). HR of mortality after hospitalization was below 1 for all and the /C2165 subgroup during and after season, with wide condence intervals overlapping HR of 1. In a sensitivity analysis, a wider and a narrower denitions of influenza season were applied, yielding similar estimates and con- dence interval bounds of the vaccination effect on mortality, hos- pitalizations, and mortality after hospitalizations (details in Supplementary File s 1a and 1b). 4. Discussion In this study, influenza vaccination was associated with lower mortality during as well as after the influenza season. During the influenza season, we observed an increased risk of hospitalizations with a respiratory infection or its potential complication for the vaccinated persons. Despite this seemingly paradoxical effect, multi-state models showed that mortality after such hospitaliza- tions was decreased, hinting at a potentially attenuating effect of vaccination. In other words, although vaccination may not prevent all infections and hospitalizations, influenza seemed to be less fre- quently fatal in chronically ill persons and those aged 65 years and older, if vaccinated. The observed vaccination coverage for patients with chronic diseases was lower than estimated in other studies (22.4% in this vs. 30% in a 2014 FOPH survey [30], and 23.4-42.5% for various chronic diseases in the 2012 Swiss Health Survey (SHS) [31]). It was more similar to other studies in the /C2165 subgroup (35.0% in this vs. 29% in persons /C2165 years in the FOPH survey, and 43.4- 52.0% in the SHS). The reasons for low vaccination uptake in Switzerland have been rarely studied in the general population. In a survey of Swiss health care workers, reporting similarly low vaccination rates, the most commonly stated reasons were fear of short-term adverse effects, insufcient evidence of benets, and fear of restricted right for self-determination [32]. Reduction of mortality risk in vaccinated persons has been fre- quently seen in other observational cohort studies, with widely ranging effect estimates [18]. We believe that we were able to Table 1 Baseline characteristics of chronically ill patients with recommended influenza vaccination in 2014.

Ulyte et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 5187-5193control for further confounders of health status than most studies by considering additional proxies for it: health care use and expen- diture variables. Few observational studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness have adjusted for these variables before. For example, Bellino et al. [33] found that health care expenditure was higher in vaccinated patients, and had a signicant effect in Poisson regres- sion models of mortality and hospitalization. In our study, although health care use and expenditure variables had a signi- cant effect in the survival models of mortality and hospitalizations, adding them to the models had almost no impact on the estimated vaccination effect ( Table 2 ). This could be partly because health care use and indicators of comorbidities (e.g., diagnoses) tend to correlate in claims datasets [34], and thus health care use might not add substantial explanatory information once the indicators of comorbidities are already in the model. Vaccination is usually associated with decreased risk for hospi- talization [35]. The seemingly paradoxical increase observed in our study could be due several reasons. First, it could reflect that vac- cinated patients had a higher risk of becoming infected (e.g., expo- sure in public spaces, work, or family) or suffer complications requiring hospitalization (e.g. impaired immune system), which was not captured by the available variables. Second, SwissDRG codes used to dene influenza-related hospitalizations might not be specic enough. Some hospitalizations could have been related to other infections instead - which would not be influenced by the vaccination, but could be higher in the vaccinated group due to comorbidities or other risk factors. Third, some hospitalizations could be driven by patient or physician preferences, although we deem this unlikely, as the selected SwissDRG codes reflect serious medical conditions rather than elective treatments. Although more hospitalizations were observed among vacci- nated persons in our study, mortality afterward was lower. This hints at a potential attenuating effect of influenza vaccination.We did not nd studies directly reporting such effect for vaccina- tion. However, some indirect observations suggest possible expla- nations. In a population-level study of specic hospitalizations and subsequent mortality in Norway, Ruiz et al. [36] observed higher influenza hospitalization rates but lower subsequent mortality for patients with type 2 diabetes compared to non-diabetic patients (although vaccination was associated with less frequent hospitalization in both groups). Potentially, type 2 diabetes in the Ruiz et al. study - and comorbidities not fully controlled for in vac- cinated persons in our study - lead to lower hospital admission thresholds and thus apparent increase in hospitalizations but not worse subsequent mortality. Decreased mortality and other severe outcomes, such as the need for intensive care treatment, in vaccinated patients after influenza-related hospitalizations have been observed in a variety of age and patient groups [3,37-39] , although not consistently so [40,41] . Our study was different from most of those referenced because we considered deaths not only immediately after hospital- ization, but during the whole influenza season (or after season per- iod). While the observed effect size was not statistically signicant in our study ( Table 3 ), this may be due to a small number of events. Our study was also different from those mentioned in that we used a multi-state model for mortality and hospitalizations, thereby considering the competing risks of these events. Compet- ing risks pose a problem when any other outcome than mortality is analyzed, particularly in older populations with high morbidity. We found only one comparable study that considered death as a competing risk for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and hospital length of stay [3]. However, we did not nd studies analyzing death as a competing risk for influenza-related hospitalization. While planning this study, we expected that the competing risk of death could result in seemingly paradoxically increased hospitalization risk in the vaccinated population. Although theTable 2 Hazard ratio estimates for the effect of vaccination on mortality and hospitalization.

Only the rst hospitalization in the specied season is considered. Standard covariates included age, sex, indicators of major chronic diseases, and number of PCG. Full model included the standard covariates as well as indicators of health care use (hospitalization for acute disease, stay in a nursing home) and expenditure in the previous year (residuals of the total reimbursed health care expenditure, as modelled with the current approach for Swiss risk equalization between health insurers).

Multi-state models consider multiple competing outcomes (hospitalization and death) in the same model. Time periods of during and after season were modelled separately. CI of HR in grey overlap 1.00. Patients that were hospitalized in a previous time period but died in the next one were denoted as H in the previous and as D in the next time period (not H?D), because partitioning of time periods creates an extra time interval between these events.A. Ulyte et al. / Vaccine 38 (2020) 5187-5193 5191paradoxical effect persisted, its size was slightly smaller (closer to null effect) in the multi-state model (compare Tables 2 and 3 ). In this study, we did not model the before season effect of vaccination. Although null effect of vaccination before season is argued to be essential as a check for residual confounding and the validity of an observational study [9], this condition could probably only be fullled in a randomized trial. Many observa- tional studies comparing the effect of vaccination before, during and after influenza season have found that the before season effect is the highest, while the after season effect is often smaller than during the influenza season [18]. Ultimately, different pop- ulations are compared in these periods, as deceased persons do not enter subsequent periods of analysis. Although using after season instead of before season estimates does not avoid this issue, analyzed patients in these periods at least have the same temporal window to receive vaccination and be exposed to influenza. Observational cohort studies based on secondary administra- tive data have been criticized in influenza effectiveness research as not suitable for eliminating confounding and bias. We aimed to improve the validity of our study by systematically and itera- tively reviewing its design and focusing research question in an effort to minimize bias. Explicit consideration of all the elements of the PICO could be used to improve other observational studies of influenza vaccination and beyond. The approach draws attention to the selection of specic outcomes and to the comparability of groups - a strategy similar, but not as explicit and structured as specifying an emulated target trial [42]. In contrast, PICO approach is not an independent study design strategy and does not provide guarantees (e.g., of eliminating all confounding). Instead, it pro- vides guidance for dening the research question that would be meaningful and feasible to answer with a given data source. 4.1. Limitations This study has several limitations. First, we cannot entirely rule out residual confounding, given the use of secondary administra- tive data. We controlled for PCG-assessed comorbidity, health care use, and expenditure; however, these are imperfect proxies of indi- viduals' health status [34]. Further confounders such as pneumo- coccal vaccination and the severity of measured comorbidities could not be controlled for. Second, misclassication could be pre- sent due to vaccination paid out-of-pocket. Vaccination provided before the deductible is exceeded is not reimbursed; in case the invoice is not automatically submitted to the health insurance, it is not recorded in the claims-based dataset. However, we included only people with chronic diseases, who are likely to exceed their deductible, especially by the time window of vaccination (September-December). Also, vaccination coverage in our study, particularly in older persons, did not differ substantially from that reported by other sources. Third, our dataset lacked outpatient diagnostic and inpatient test information. Therefore, we could not use even more specic outcomes, such as laboratory- conrmed influenza infection. Fourth, as baseline covariates such as chronic conditions and health care use were recorded once (at the end of 2013), we could not adjust for time-varying confounding. Finally, a general caveat of influenza vaccination effectiveness research is that the vaccine and prevalent virus match changes every year. In 2014/2015, it was rather low [26]. The comparability of results from different seasons is debatable. However, the pri- mary aim of this study was not to precisely estimate the effect size of a particular vaccine/virus match but to see if an attenuating effect of vaccination could be gleaned from administrative claims data in general.5. Conclusions In this study, influenza vaccination was associated with more frequent specic hospitalizations, but decreased risk of mortality overall and after such hospitalization in patients with chronic dis- eases. Our approach of iteratively considering each PICO element helped to consider various sources of bias in the study sequentially. The selection of appropriate, specic outcomes makes the link between intervention and outcome more plausible and can reduce the impact of confounding. Administrative data and cohort studies can be useful in influenza vaccine effectiveness research - if not for estimating precise effect sizes, then at least for uncovering poten- tial mechanisms of the effect in different populations. Further studies with administrative data on vaccine effectiveness should carefully consider the selection of outcome, population, and con- founding variables, in order to achieve the best possible study design.
