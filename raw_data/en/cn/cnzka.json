Meier DE . Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA. diane.meier@mssm.edu Abstract A small proportion of patients with serious illness or multiple chronic conditions account for the majority of health care spending. Despite the high cost, evidence demonstrates that these patients receive health care of inadequate quality, characterized by fragmentation, overuse, medical errors, and poor quality of life. This article examines data demonstrating the impact of the U.S. health care system on clinical care outcomes and costs for the sickest and most vulnerable patients. It also defines palliative care and hospice, synthesizes studies of the outcomes of palliativecare and hospice services, reviews variables predicting access to palliative care andhospice services, and identifies those policy priorities necessary to strengthen access tohigh-quality palliative care. Palliative care and hospice services improve patient-centered outcomes such as pain, depression, and other symptoms; patient and family satisfaction; and the receipt ofcare in the place that the patient chooses. Some data suggest that, compared with theusual care, palliative care prolongs life. By helping patients get the care they need to avoidunnecessary emergency department and hospital stays and shifting the locus of care to thehome or community, palliative care and hospice reduce health care spending for America'ssickest and most costly patient populations. Policies focused on enhancing the palliative care workforce, investing in the field's science base, and increasing the availability of services in U.S. hospitals andnursing homes are needed to ensure equitable access to optimal care for seriously illpatients and those with multiple chronic conditions. \u00a9 2011 Milbank Memorial Fund.

This article defines palliative and hospice care and describes some ofthe current challenges of integrating palliative care into other forms of care. It also considers outcomes that navigation might be expected to improve for patients receiving palliative care or enrolled in hospice. These outcomes include symptom relief; communication efficacy; transitions of care; and access to palliative care, hospice, and bereavement care for families. Although these outcomes may not have been specifically assessed in patients incancer navigation programs, they represent important outcomes for patients receivingpalliative care and their families. It is recognized that the types of outcomes that are important to track for patients and families receiving palliative care should be consistent with outcomes at other stages of illness.

What is the best practical survey method for the comparative assessment of palliative care services: results from a national quality assessment project in Korea. Shin DW , Choi , Park EC . Department of Family Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. Abstract There is an increasing need for the comparative assessment of palliative care services; however, few systematic empirical studies have been performed to determine the most feasible, representative, efficient survey method. To investigate the feasibility, representativeness, and efficiency of several survey methods. This study was performed as a part of a national initiative to develop a system to evaluate the quality of palliative care services. Three separate but related surveys ofpatients, caregivers, and bereaved family members were conducted. These surveys weredesigned to simulate an independent assessment in a nationwide quality evaluation project. The effective response rates for the patient, caregiver, and bereavement surveys were 30.4% (105 of 344), 46.5% (160 of 344), and 20.9% (501 of 2398), respectively. Subjects who responded to the patient and caregiver surveys were likely to have better physical and mental conditions, whereas subjects who responded to the bereaved familysurvey did not differ significantly from nonrespondents in regard to patient characteristics,except for a small difference in patient gender (females: 47.2% vs. 41.7%, P=0.028). Theaverage number of responses per institution was 3.2, 4.8, and 15.2, respectively. The cost of the patient and caregiver surveys was much higher than the cost of the bereaved family member survey. There were significant differences between the three methods. Despite the low response rate, our findings suggest that the bereaved family member survey hasstrengths in terms of feasibility and efficiency, and could be considered as a practical optionfor the comparative assessment of palliative care services by an independent body.

Through an intensive literature review, the author chose questions that measured aspects of physical, emotional, spiritual, social, or practical domains pertinent to hospice-palliative care for inclusion in the scale. Content validation of the questions was established by 15 hospice-palliative care professionals. A preliminary Hospice PalliativeCare Performance Scale (HPCPS) of 20 questions was administered to 134 pairs ofterminal cancer patients from 5 hospice palliative care units and their main family caregiver.A validation study was conducted to evaluate construct validity and internal consistency. Factor analysis showed 14 significant questions in five subscales; Physical, Emotional, Spiritual, Social, and Patient' rights. There were no significant differencesbetween the ratings by patients and family members except for three out of the 14questions. The measure demonstrated construct validity, and Cronbach's alpha of thesubscales ranged from .73 to .79. The HPCOS demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability. It can be used to assess effectiveness of hospice-palliative care for terminal cancer patients in practice and research.

Palliative care the treatment of end-stage renal failure. Werb R . Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. rwerb@telus.net Abstract Palliative care begins with establishing goals of care based on estimated prognosis in end- stage renal disease (ESRD). Patients with ESRD are increasingly characterized by olderage and multiple comorbid illnesses, and have a mortality rate 8 times higher than the general Medicare population. Dialysis patients are appropriate for palliative care because of their high mortality rate and high symptom burden. More patients and families are choosingnot to start or withdraw dialysis for multiple reasons, particularly in patients older than 60years. Advance directives and resuscitation directives are important in ensuringcompassionate and goal-directed palliative care of ESRD patients. Drug toxicities areavoidable by using appropriate drugs at the correct doses and dosing intervals. Copyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

National survey of the current provision of specialist palliative care services for patients with end-stage renal disease. Hobson K , Gomm S Specialist Palliative Care Team, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK. katiehobson@doctors.org.uk Abstract Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) experience a significant symptom burden and have complex needs. However, involvement of specialist palliative care (SPC) services with these patients has previously been shown to be limited. This studyassesses the current provision of and access to SPC services for ESRD patients in the UK and considers how the provision has evolved over recent years. A questionnaire was sent to the lead clinician for all UK adult hospital, hospice and community SPC services, identified from the Hospice and Palliative Care Directory 2008. Non-responders were mailed again after 5 weeks. Descriptive statistics andqualitative thematic analysis were performed. Three hundred and eighteen of 611 (52%) questionnaires were returned. Ninety- six per cent stated that SPC services have a role in caring for patients with ESRD. Two hundred and eighty-one of 318 (88%) accepted referrals, and 185 of 281 (66%) reported that 'none or few were referred'. Only 7% and 17% of respondents used specific ESRDreferral and treatment guidelines, respectively; whereas 79% used the Liverpool CarePathway for the Dying Patient. Seven per cent undertook joint renal and SPC multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings, and 3% held joint out-patient clinics. Forty percent of respondents proposed initiatives to improve palliative care for ESRD patients, with mutual education and collaborative working being key themes for improvement. The majority of SPC services accept ESRD patients, but limited numbers are referred. Respondents indicated that this barrier could be addressed by closerPublication Types, MeSH Terms PubMed - NCBI file:///C|/.../Desktop/Palliative%20Care%20for%20the%20Management%20of%20Chronic%20Illness%20PubMed%20Search%20Strategy.htm[12/16/2011 4:43:10 PM]collaboration and better communication and education between renal and SPC services.

Harrison K , Watson S . Hospice in the Weald, Pembury, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, UK. Kerry.harrison@hitw.org.uk Abstract The National Service Framework for Renal Services Part 2 identifies quality requirementsfor end-of-life care for individuals with kidney failure, recognizing the potential to forgecloser relationships between renal and specialist palliative care providers. This article describes a pilot project set up by two Clinical Nurse Specialists, one working in hospice specialist palliative care and the other in renal palliative care within an acute trust. Thepurpose of the pilot was to work in collaboration to run a streamlined nurse-led clinic thatwould meet the palliative care needs of chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage 5 patients andtheir carers. To achieve this the clinic would have to provide optimal symptom management,empower patients to make their own choices, and support them with advance care planning underpinned by the End of Life Care Strategy. The partnership also aimed to promote service improvement and practice development using transference of knowledge, skills, andexpertise. Initial informal feedback, including a very small patient survey, suggests that theclinic was well received by patients, carers, and other health professionals. The clinic isongoing and deserves more formal evaluation to encourage future service development.

While greater attention has been focused on advanced care planning, end-of-life decisions,conservative therapy and withdrawal from dialysis these must be supported by adequate palliative care incorporating symptom control.

They should be assured of adequate symptom control and palliative care whichever option is selected. No randomized controlled trials have been conducted in this area and only a small number of observational studies provide guidance; thus predicting which patients willhave poor outcomes is problematic. Those undertaking dialysis may benefit from being fullyaware of their choices between active and conservative treatment should their functionalstatus seriously deteriorate and this should be shared with caregivers. This clarifiestreatment pathways and reduces the ambiguity surrounding decision making. If conservative therapy or withdrawal from dialysis is chosen, each should be supported by palliative care. The objective of this review is to summarize published studies and evidence-basedguidelines, core curricula, position statements, standards and tools in palliative care in end-stage kidney disease. \u00a9 2011 The Authors.

[Assessment of the instrument Brasil. daimonteiro84@hotmail.com Abstract Hospice Care (HC) is given to patients out of therapeutic possibilities of cure,focusing on symptoms control and life quality. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) isan instrument to assess and monitor nine physical and psychological symptoms in patients in HC. The study aims to perform an integrative review on the assessment of health professionals and/or patients regarding the use of ESAS in cancer patients in Hospice Care.Eight papers have been localized at Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval SystemOnline (MEDLINE) between 1998 and 2009. The results displayed that although there arefew studies on this topic, the ESAS is a valid instrument to detect and monitor symptoms in HC, presenting some limitations. The results led to the importance of the study continuity in translation and cross-cultural adaptation of this scale to Brazilian Portuguese.

Resources and clinical practice guidelines are available to assist practitioners with incorporating palliative care into ESRD management. There is a large unmet need to alleviate the physical, psychosocial, and existential suffering of patients with ESRD. More fully integrating palliative care into ESRD management by improving end-of-life care training, eliminating structural and financialbarriers to hospice use, and identifying optimal methods to deliver palliative care are necessary if we are to successfully address the needs of an aging ESRD population.

The development and validation of a novel questionnaire to measure patient and family satisfaction with end-of-life care: the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP) Questionnaire. Heyland DK , Cook DJ , Jiang X , Day AG , Cohen SR ; Canadian Researchers at the End of Life Network . Department of Medicine, Kingston General Hospital, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. dkh2@queensu.ca Abstract The purpose of this study was to further validate a novel instrument to measure satisfaction with end-of-life care, called the Canadian Health Care Evaluation Project (CANHELP)questionnaire. Data were collected by a cross-sectional survey of patients who had advanced, life-limiting illnesses and their family caregivers, and who completed CANHELP, a global rating of satisfaction, and a quality of life questionnaire. We conducted factoranalysis, assessed internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha, and evaluated constructvalidity by describing the correlation amongst CANHELP, global rating of satisfaction andthe quality of life questionnaire scores. There were 361 patient and 193 family questionnaires available for analysis. In the factor analysis, we identified six easily interpretable factors which explained 55.4% and 60.2% of the variance for the patient andcaregiver questionnaire, respectively. For the patient version, the subscales derived fromthese factors were Relationship with Doctors, Illness Management, Communication,Decision-Making, Role of the Family, and Your Well-being. For the family questionnaire, the factors were Relationship with Doctors, Characteristics of Doctors and Nurses, Illness Management, Communication and Decision-Making, Your Involvement, and Your Well-being. Each subscale for each questionnaire had acceptable to excellent internalconsistency (Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.69-0.94). We observed good correlationsbetween the CANHELP overall satisfaction score and global rating of satisfaction(correlation coefficient 0.49 and 0.63 for patient and family, respectively) which was greater than the correlations between CANHELP and the quality of life instruments. We conclude that the CANHELP Questionnaire is a valid and internally consistent instrument to measuresatisfaction with end-of-life care.

Symptoms in the month before death for stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients managed without dialysis. Murtagh FE , Addington-Hall J, Edmonds P . Department of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, King's College London, London, United Kingdom. fliss.murtagh@kcl.ac.uk Abstract There is little evidence on the symptoms experienced by those with advanced (Stage 5) chronic kidney disease (CKD), managed without dialysis, as they approach death. As palliative care extends to noncancer illnesses, understanding symptom prevalence and severity close to death will clarify which symptom interventions are most needed and which elements of (largely cancer-driven) models of palliative care best translate into end-of-lifecare for this population. To determine symptom prevalence and severity in the last month of life for patients with Stage 5 CKD, managed without dialysis. Longitudinal symptom survey in three U.K. renal units, using the patient- completed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form (MSAS-SF). We calculatedthe prevalence of individual symptoms (with 95% confidence intervals [CI] to reflect sample size), plus MSAS-SF subscales, in the month before death. Comparison is made with previously published data on symptoms in the last month of life in advanced cancer, alsomeasured using the MSAS-SF. Seventy-four patients (mean age: 81 years; standard deviation [SD]: 6.8) were recruited (response rate: 73%); SD:5.7). \"Month before death\" symptom data were available for 43 (88%) of the 49 participants who died. Median time of data collection was 18 days from death (interquartile range: 12-26 days). More than half had and nausea (59%;44%-73%). Levels of distress correspond to prevalence, with the exception of dyspnea, which was disproportionately more distressing. The median number of symptoms reported was 16.6 (range: 6-27), rising to 20.4 (range: 7-34) if additional renal symptoms wereincluded. On average, psychological distress was moderate (mean MSAS-PSYCH: 1.55) butwith wide variation (SD: 0.50; range: 0.17-2.40), suggesting diverse levels of individualdistress. The prevalence of both physical and psychological symptoms and the number reported were higher than those in advanced cancer patients in the month before death. Stage 5 CKD patients have clinically important physical and psychological symptom burdens in the last month of life, similar or greater than those in advanced cancer patients. Symptoms must be addressed through routine symptom assessment, appropriateinterventions, and with pertinent models of end-of-life care.Publication Types, MeSH Terms PubMed - NCBI file:///C|/.../Desktop/Palliative%20Care%20for%20the%20Management%20of%20Chronic%20Illness%20PubMed%20Search%20Strategy.htm[12/16/2011 4:43:10 PM]2010 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

Psychological well-being and quality of care: a factor-analytic examination of the palliative care outcome College London, Department of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, School of Medicine at Guy's, King's College and St. Thomas' Hospitals, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.richard.siegert@kcl.ac.uk Abstract The Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS) is a widely used outcome measure in palliative care research, and has good psychometric properties. It has been used for clinical or research purposes in specialist cancer centers, nursing homes, day hospice units, and hospice settings in a growing number of countries. However, the POS has not yet been examined using factor analysis. The aim of the present study was to examine the internal factor structure of the POS. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were used for secondary analysis of two existing POS data sets of British patients, most of whom were cancer patients. We began with a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which indicated that the POS is not a unidimensional scale. This was followed by an exploratory factor analysis that suggested two factors-one reflecting a psychological well-being dimension and the other consisting of three items relating to the standard of professional care. A similar two-factorstructure also was identified in the second sample using CFA. The POS appears to capture two factors, psychological status and quality of care, and to have three items that function independently (family anxiety, symptoms, andpain control). Our findings suggest that future evaluations of palliative care services should include assessment not only of symptoms and well-being or quality of life, but also of quality of care, and that unidimensional measures will not capture all relevant aspects in palliativecare.

Preliminary report of the integration of a palliative care team into an intensive care unit. O'Mahony S , McHenry J, Blank . Palliative Care Service, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 3347 Steuben Avenue, 2nd Floor, Bronx, New York, NY 10467, USA. somahony@montefiore.org Abstract Nearly half of Americans who die in hospitals spend time in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the last 3 days of life. Minority patients who die in the ICU are less likely to formalizeadvance directives and surviving family members report lower satisfaction with the provision of information and sensitivity to their cultural traditions at the end-of-life. This is a descriptive report of a convenience sample of 157 consecutive patients served by apalliative care team which was integrated into the operations of an ICU at MontefioreMedical Center in the Bronx, New York, from August 2005 until August 2007. The teamincluded an advance practice nurse (APN) and social worker. A separate case-control study was conducted comparing the length of hospital stay for persons who died in the ICU during the final 6 months of the project, prior to and post-palliative care consultation for 22 patientsat the hospital campus where the project team was located versus 24 patients at the othercampus. Pharmaco-economic data were evaluated for 22 persons who died with and 43who died without a palliative care consultation at the intervention campus ICU to evaluate whether the project intervention was associated with an increase in the use of pain medications or alterations in the use of potentially non-beneficial life-prolonging treatmentsin persons dying in the ICU. Data was abstracted from the medical record with astandardized chart abstraction instrument by an unblinded research assistant. Interviewswere conducted with a sample of family members and ICU nurses rating the quality of end-of-life care in the ICU with the Quality of Dying and Death in the ICU instrument (ICUQODD), and a family focus group was also conducted.

Exploration of the patients' and families' needs identified significant spiritualneeds in 62.4% of cases. Education on the death process was provided to 85% of familiesby the project team. Twenty-nine percent of patients were disconnected from mechanical ventilators following consultation with the Palliative Care Service (PCS), 15.9% of patients discontinued the use of inotropic support, 15.3% stopped artificial nutrition, 6.4% stoppeddialysis and 2.5% discontinued artificial hydration. Recommendations on pain managementwere made for 51% of the project's patients and symptom management for 52% of patients.The project was associated with an increase in the rate of the formalization of advancedirectives. Thirty-three percent of the patients who received PCS consultations had 'do not resuscitate' orders in place prior to consultation and 83.4% had 'do not resuscitate' orders after the intervention. The project team referred 80 (51%) of the project patients to hospiceand 55 (35%) patients were enrolled on hospice, primarily at the medical center.

Median charges for the use of opioid medications were higher (p =0.01) for the intervention group but lower for use of laboratory (p = 0.004) and radiology tests (p = 0.027). We conclude that the integration of palliative care experts into the operation of critical care units is of benefit to patients, families and critical care clinicians.Preliminary evidence suggest that such models may be associated with improved quality oflife, higher rates of formalization of advance directives and utilization of hospices, as well aslower use of certain non-beneficial life-prolonging treatments for critically ill patients who are at the end of life.

End-of-life care preferences and needs: perceptions of patients with chronic kidney disease. Davison SN . Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada. sara.davison@ualberta.ca Abstract Despite high mortality rates, surprisingly little research has been done to study chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients' preferences for end-of-life care. The objective of this study was to evaluate end-of-life care preferences of CKD patients to help identify gaps between current end-of-life care practice and patients' preferences and to help prioritize and guide future innovation in end-of-life care policy. A total of 584 stage 4 and stage 5 CKD patients were surveyed as they presented to dialysis, transplantation, orpredialysis clinics in a Canadian, university-based renal program between January and April2008. Participants reported relying on the nephrology staff for extensive end-of- life care needs not currently systematically integrated into their renal care, such as pain and symptom management, advance care planning, and psychosocial and spiritual support. Participants also had poor self-reported knowledge of palliative care options and of theirillness trajectory. A total of 61% of patients regretted their decision to start dialysis. Morepatients wanted to die at home (36.1%) or in an inpatient hospice (28.8%) compared with ina hospital (27.4%). Less than 10% of patients reported having had a discussion about end- of-life care issues with their nephrologist in the past 12 months. Current end-of-life clinical practices do not meet the needs of patients with advanced CKD. Comment in Clin J Am Soc Nephrol.

Considerations in the care of older adult with chronic kidney disease. Fox KR . Abstract The incidence of renal disease is increasing at alarming rates. Older adults with co-morbid conditions are at increased risk for end stage renal disease with the resulting need for renalreplacement therapy. Nurses who care for the older adult must know how chronic kidney disease will affect the older adult and must be able to provide compassionate care at the end stage of life.

Validation of a core outcome measure for palliative care in Africa: the APCA African Palliative Outcome London, Education Centre, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9RJ, UK. richard.harding@kcl.ac.uk Abstract Despite the burden of progressive incurable disease in Africa, there is almost no evidence on patient care or outcomes. A primary reason has been the lack of appropriate locally-validated outcome tools. This study aimed to validate a multidimensional scale (the APCA African Palliative Outcome Scale) in a multi-centred international study. Validation was conducted across 5 African services and in 3 phases: Phase 1. Face validity: content analysis of qualitative interviews and cognitive interviewing of POS; Phase 2. Construct validity: correlation of POS with Missoula-Vitas Quality of Life Index(Spearman's rank tests); Phase 3. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha calculated twiceusing 2 datasets), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients calculated for 2 time points) and time to complete (calculated twice using 2 datasets). The validation involved 682 patients and 437 family carers, interviewed in 8 different languages. Phase 1. Qualitative interviews (N = 90 patients; N = 38 carers) showed POS items mapped well onto identified needs; cognitive interviews (N = 73 patients; N = 29carers) demonstrated good interpretation; Phase 2.

Caregiver QOL has been identified as a core outcome variable in studies of dying patients and their families, but few studies have assessed QOL among caregivers of patients with terminal illness, particularly those in hospice care. For this cross-sectional correlational study, 60 caregivers were recruited from two local in-home hospice programmes in the Midwestern United States. Self-report data were provided by caregivers using the Caregiver Quality of Life Index - Cancer, Spiritual Well-Being Scale, American Pain Society Patient OutcomesQuestionnaire, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Rating andMedical Outcome Study Social Support Survey to measure their QOL, spirituality, health status and social support. Caregivers' educational status, physical health status, spirituality and qualitative and quantitative social support, as a set, explained 42% of the variance in their QOL.Publication Types, MeSH Terms Publication Types, MeSH Terms PubMed - NCBI file:///C|/.../Desktop/Palliative%20Care%20for%20the%20Management%20of%20Chronic%20Illness%20PubMed%20Search%20Strategy.htm[12/16/2011 4:43:10 PM]CONCLUSIONS: RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:Caregivers with higher education, better physical health status, greater spirituality and more qualitative and quantitative social support, had a significantly better QOL. QOL for this sample of hospice caregivers was significantly predicted only by physical health status and spirituality, likely because of collinearity among the independent variables. Additional research is needed to explore the factors that sustain orpromote caregivers' QOL over time. In the delivery of hospice services, the family caregiver is both a vital member of the health care team and a recipient of care. Healthcare providers should therefore pay more attention to the health status and spirituality ofmajor caregivers, thus helping them maintain and improve their QOL.

A comparison of the quality of care provided to cancer patients in the UK in the last three months of life in in-patient hospices compared with hospitals, from the perspective of bereaved relatives: results from a survey using the VOICES questionnaire. Addington-Hall JM, O'Callaghan AC . School of Health Sciences, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton. jah@soton.ac.uk Abstract The importance of evaluating systematically the effectiveness of hospice care has been noted for at least 20 years. There is, however, limited evidence about whether and how thecare provided to terminally ill patients by in-patient hospices in the UK differs from that provided in NHS hospitals. In this article, we, therefore, present a comparison of hospice in- patient care and hospital care for cancer patients in the UK, from the perspective ofbereaved relatives who had experienced both types of care during the last 3 months of thepatient's life. The Office of National Statistics drew a random sample of 800 deaths in SouthLondon in 2002, and sent the person who registered the death (the informant) a Views ofInformal Carers - Evaluation of Services (VOICES) questionnaire 3-9 months after the death, with up to two reminders.

Informants answered the same questions about each admission and responses on these were compared. There were statistically significant differences between respondents' views of hospice and hospital care on eight out of 13 variables measuring aspects of satisfaction with care, with a trendtowards statistical significance on a further two: in all cases respondents rated hospice caremore positively than hospital care. There were no differences in the experience of pain and breathlessness in the two settings, but respondents rated pain control by the hospice as more effective. In comparison to hospital care, from the perspective of bereaved relatives, hospice in-patient care provided better pain control, better communication with patients and families, and better medical, nursing and personal care, which treated the patient with moredignity. Further research is needed to confirm these findings using a wider sample of in-patient hospices in the UK and including the perspectives of patients. Providing high quality care for terminally ill patients in acute hospitals remains an important challenge. Comment in Palliat Med. 2009 Apr;23(3):187-9. Palliat Med. 2010 Jul;24(5):548-50.

Symptom burden and quality of life in end-stage renal disease: a study of 179 patients on dialysis and palliative care. Yong DS , Kwok AO , Tse DM . Department of Medicine & Geriatrics, Caritas Medical Centre, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Abstract Palliative care for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is developing in Hong Kong. This is the first local study to explore the symptom burden and quality of life (QOL) of ESRD patientson chronic dialysis and palliative care. This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted on ESRD patients in a hospital in Hong Kong from January 2006 to April 2007. Data collected included demographics, socioeconomic status, modified CharlsonComorbidity Index (CCI), prevalence and intensity of 23 ESRD-related symptoms as ratedby numerical rating scale (0-10), Brief Pain Inventory and QOL by MOS SF-36. A total of179 ESRD patients completed the study; 45 patients (25.1%) were in the palliative care group and 134 patients (74.9%) in the dialysis group. The palliative care group were older (73.1 +/- 7.1 vs 58.2 +/- 11.4 years, P < 0.001), had marginally higher modified CCI (8.5 +/-1.9 vs 6.1 +/- 2.4, P = 0.05), had more diabetics (62.2 vs 35.8%, P < 0.001) and were ofpoorer socioeconomic status than the dialysis group. The mean number of symptoms was8.2 +/- 3.9 and 9.3 +/- 4.7 in the palliative care and the dialysis group, respectively (P =NS). Fatigue, cold aversion, pruritus, lower torso weakness and difficulty sleeping were the five most prevalent symptoms in both groups, and were also among the most intense symptoms. QOL was significantly impaired in both groups. Scores of all QOL domainscorrelated negatively with the number of symptoms (P < 0.001). Our ESRD patients underpalliative care and dialysis had overlapping symptom prevalence and intensity, significantsymptom burden and impaired QOL.

Comparing the perspectives of hospice professionals and family caregivers. Waldrop DP , Rinfrette ES . University at Buffalo School of Social Work, Buffalo, New York 14260-1050, USA. dwaldrop@buffalo.edu Abstract Hospice utilization lasting for 2 weeks or less before death is considered \"short.\" Short, late-stage hospice admissions have been viewed as inadequate for providing end-stage symptom management, maximal comfort, and a comprehensive focus on life closure and as an underutilization of the Medicare Hospice Benefit. The purpose of this study was to explore psychosocial dynamics during late-stage hospice admissions bycomparing the perspectives of hospice professionals and family caregivers. Salutogenicprinciples and concepts from Antonovsky's Sense of Coherence Theory (SOC) guided theinquiry. This exploratory, descriptive study involved a developmental design. First, hospice professionals' perspectives about psychosocial dynamics commonly observed in late-stage admissions were gathered. Themes were distilled into a Psychosocial Factors Checklist (PFC). Second, interviews that incorporated open-ended questions and the PFCwere conducted with 56 family caregivers of hospice patients who died from cancer within 2weeks of admission. Participant responses were transcribed and entered into Atlas tisoftware for data management and coding. Responses to the PFC were clustered around the SOC constructs (manageability, comprehensibility, meaningfulness) to create corresponding subscales. Interitem correlations were conducted to explore the associationsamong items. Late-stage admissions were a crisis (54%), chaotic (43%), emotional (80%), and a time of open communication (80%) and meaningful conversations (73%). 4.09) suggested that caregivers experienced moderate difficulty. Manageability included physical challenges, emotional responses, informational needs, andbenefits/resources. Comprehensibility emerged from medical results, visual signs, andhospice guidance. Meaningfulness was personal-individual, family-shared, and spiritual-existential. Hospice professionals and caregivers view late-stage admissions differently; they are a crisis for some but not all families. The development of aquick assessment tool for late-stage admissions has the potential for meaningful andeffective intervention when time is of the essence.

The United States now has more than1400 hospital-based palliative care teams and more than 4700 hospice programs. We use an illustrative case of a palliative care hospitalization and intervention for a middle-aged man with severe pain from spinal metastases to discuss 4 key questions that a primary carephysician faces in caring for the seriously ill patient with difficult symptom management: (1)Should I refer a patient to a hospital-based palliative care team or to hospice services fordifficult symptom management? (2) If the patient is referred to a hospital-based palliativecare team, what should I, as the primary care physician, expect? (3) When should I refer to hospice services a patient initially referred to a hospital-based palliative care team? and (4) How can I choose a hospice program that will provide competent, coordinated, andcompassionate patient- and family-centered care? Primary care physicians now may chooseamong hospice programs, and the programs may vary in their quality of care. Validated tools to measure patient and family perceptions of the quality of hospice care are now available but progress in defining and measuring the quality of hospice care is still neededbefore actionable information will be available to guide the choice of hospice programs forphysicians and consumers.

Reliability and validity of the Hospice Quality of Life Scale for Korean cancer patients. Kim SH , Choi YS , Lee J, Kim DY , Koh SJ . Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. Abstract The Hospice Quality of Life Scale (HQLS) for Korean cancer patients was developed as follows: 1) item generation by semi-structured interviews and review of existing scales, 2)item reduction by the Delphi method, and 3) reliability and validity test. The final HQLS consisted of 40 questions within 13 domains and the internal consistency was 0.41-0.93. The domain \"Family and Economy\" was uniquely separated from the general social issues,which reflects the family-oriented Asian culture. For construct validity, the HQLS scoresdiffered significantly according to their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PerformanceStatus (known-group validity). Convergent and discriminant success rates were optimal in nine and four subscales, respectively. Total and subscale scores were significantly correlated with the related subscales in the European Organization for Research andTreatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and the McMaster Quality of Life Scale, which supported theconcurrent validity. HQLS was approved as an efficient tool for assessing the quality of lifeof Korean cancer patients who were receiving hospice and palliative care.

MA, Wouters EF , and Care, Proteion Thuis, Horn, The Netherlands. daisyjanssen@proteion.nl Abstract Chronic diseases are nowadays the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Patients with end-stage chronic organ failure may suffer daily from distressful physical andpsychological symptoms. The objective of the present study is to systematically review studies that examined daily symptom prevalence in patients with end-stage chronic organ failure, with attention to those that included patients with either congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic renal failure (CRF). Thirty- nine articles (8 CHF, 7 COPD, 2 CHF and COPD, 22 CRF) have been included. Theincluded studies used various study designs. There was a wide range of daily symptomprevalence that may be due to the heterogeneity in methodology used. Nevertheless,findings suggest significant symptom burden in these patients. This review highlights the need for further prospective and longitudinal research on symptom prevalence in patients with end-stage CHF, COPD and CRF to facilitate the development of care programs.

Department of Adult Nursing, School of Health Sciences and Nursing, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. miyasita-tky@umin.net Abstract The aims of this study were to clarify (1) the quality of life (QOL) of community-dwelling patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers in home palliative care and day hospice settings, (2) the need for day hospice of home palliative care patients and caregivers, and (3) the satisfaction with day hospice by day hospice patients and caregivers. A cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers who were cared for at day hospice and home palliative care. Wemeasured the health-related quality of life using the SF-8, the need for day hospice of homepalliative care patients and caregivers, and the satisfaction with day hospice by day hospicepatients and caregivers. A total of 57 pairs of patients and caregivers participated in the study (day hospice, n = 23; home palliative care, n = 34). The physical and mental aspects of thepatient QOL were significantly lower than national standard value.

Planning for a good death: a neglected but essential part of ESRD care. Haras MS. Saint Xavier University School of Nursing, Chicago, IL, USA. Abstract Planning a \"good death\" is a neglected, but essential, part of the care of patients with endstage renal disease and their families. Many of these patients do not have advancedirectives and few utilize palliative care. Guidelines from medical and specialty nursing organizations regarding end-of-life (EOL) issues and palliative care have been developed, but they are not consistently used by the nephrology community. Nephrology nurses arefrequently positioned to begin EOL discussions with patients and families, and advancedpractice nurses are in a unique position to coordinate and facilitate a patient's transitionfrom chronic to terminal illness and to increase the likelihood that the patient and family experience a \"good death\". This article reviews the need for practice improvement in EOL care and a review of the current literature.

The Renal Supportive Care Team is a demonstration project that is designed to elicit and provide for the needs of dialysis patients and their families throughout the trajectory of their illnesses. Six focus groups, including medical health professionals, dialysis patients, family members, and bereaved family members, discussed how to promote improved palliative care and encourage hospice referral for patients with ESRD. Respondents agreed that there needed to be greater education of both patients and families regarding all aspects of the disease process, open communication, on-goingsupport between patients, families, and the staff, continuity of care, pain control, and assistance with advance care planning. Palliative and supportive care issues in ESRD need greater attention. PMID: 18501048 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Related citations Remove from clipboard 37.J Urban Health. 2008 May;85(3):443-51.

Two advance practice nurses conducted consultations on elderly patients who were found to have one or more \"palliative care triggers\" on initial screening. A standardized medicalrecord abstraction form was developed. Service utilization and survival were evaluatedusing the Clinical Information Systems of MMC. Activity of daily living items were developedfrom the Outcome and Assessment Information Set and the Palliative Care PerformanceScale (PPS). Risk factors for hospitalization and use of the ED were taken from the SIGNET model risk screening tool. Physical and emotional symptoms were evaluated using the 28-item Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale short form. Preliminary outcomes andcharacteristics are presented for 291 patients who completed the intake needs assessmentquestionnaire. Almost one third (30.9%) of the study cohort died during the project period. Most of the deaths occurred beyond the medical center (7.7% died in the medical center and 23.3% outside the medical center). Thirty percent of patients who died were enrolled on a hospice. Survival time was predicted by the presence of dyspnea, clinician prediction of death on the current hospitalization, psychosocial distress, and PPS scores. Chronically illpatients visiting an urban community ED had complex medical and psychosocial problemswith limited support systems and homecare services.

The presence of palliative homecare and hospice outreach services in the ED in urban community hospitals may provide aneffective strategy for linkage of elderly patients at the end of life with otherwise underutilizedservices.

Palliative care: misconceptions that limit access for patients with chronic renal disease. Jablonski A . Abstract There is an urgent need to incorporate palliative care into the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). These patients have a shortened lifespan and face end-of-lifedecisions as renal function declines and renal replacement therapy becomes necessary. They also experience a high symptom burden as a result of the illness as well as its treatment. Why, then, do patients with ESRD rarely receive expert palliative care servicesthat have been shown to enhance the quality of life of patients with other life-limitingillnesses? The lack of access to palliative care can be attributed, in part, to misconceptionsabout its philosophy and goals. It is hoped that clarification of these misconceptions will facilitate integration of palliative care into routine nephrology practice. Comment in Semin Dial. 2008 Mar-Apr;21(2):196.

Abstract As the numbers of patients presenting with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) increases, more are opting to withdraw from dialysis, often due to increased suffering and poorprognosis related to other comorbidities. Concurrently, other renal patients are deciding to forgo dialysis, recognizing that the burden of frequent dialysis may outweigh likely survival and quality-of-life benefits. Renal nursing is concerned with the health needs of individuals and their carers who are experiencing a progressive decline in renal function or who have lost renal function completely, and there is a focus on the provision of renal replacementtherapy such as haemodialysis. As more patients decide to withdraw from, or not to embarkon, dialysis, an enhanced approach to assessment and control of symptoms, as well as supportive management is required, including effective and high-quality palliative care. There is a necessity for renal nurses to change from disease management throughinterventions of a physiological nature to that of providing support and symptommanagement. This article discusses the supportive and palliative nursing care needs of apopulation largely unheard in the literature - patients with ESRD - and highlights the needfor further patient and carer-centred research in this area.

Maintaining quality of life at the end of life in the end-stage renal disease population. Germain MJ, Cohen LM . Departments of Medicine and Psychiatry, Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, MA 01107, USA. germain@bhs.org Abstract The rapidly advancing age of incident dialysis patient has coincided with a rising mortality rate during the first year of dialysis. This is occurring despite a steady decline in mortality ofprevalent patients. These statistics suggest that there is a subset of sick, elderly dialysis patients who will not survive the first 6 months of dialysis. It may be that these patients would be better served with a conservative, palliative approach that does not includeinitiation of dialysis. Even though hospice care is universally available to the Center forMedicare and Medicaid Services population, dialysis patients encounter many barriers toobtaining this benefit and have a hospice utilization rate only one quarter that of cancer patients. This article discusses the barriers to and goals of palliative care in the chronic kidney disease/end-stage renal disease population.

Use of the palliative outcome scale in Argentina: a cross- cultural adaptation Aires, Argentina. jeisen@fibertel.com.ar Abstract Although measuring outcomes is essential to ensuring palliative care effectiveness, there is an absence of properly validated measures in many countries. We undertook a cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Palliative Outcome Scale (POS) into a Spanish (Argentina) language and cultural context. The methodology used a sequence of phases: 1) verification of conceptual equivalence (literature review, professional interviews, and patientfocus groups); 2) multiple translations; 3) committee review; and 4) field testing.Psychometric analysis entailed evaluation of quantitative content validity, construct validity,staff and patients' ratings comparison, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, andresponsiveness to change. Conceptual equivalence was achieved. Multiple changes were introduced after the translations and field testing in 65 patients and 20 professionals. Content validity was high for all but one item. Construct validity against a validated quality-of-life measure (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality ofLife C-30) was confirmed (rho=0.74, P<0.0005).

Internal consistency was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha=0.68-0.69 and 0.66-0.73) for patient and staff ratings, respectively, and test-retest reliability showed very high agreement for every item (>0.80). The Argentine POS showed adequate responsiveness to change,although significant difference was reached for only 3 out of 10 items for patients and staff, respectively. Completion of the POS did not take more than 12 and 6 minutes for patients and staff, respectively. This study indicates that the Argentine POS is a valid and reliable measure of palliative care outcomes with advanced cancer patients.

Until recently, no nationally accepted guidelines or practices had been established to support assessment and management of this type of suffering. In 2007, the National Quality Forum published A National Framework and Preferred Practices forPalliative and Hospice Care Quality that included a list of preferred practices for assessingand treating symptoms of psychiatric illness, anticipatory grief and psychologic distress priorto death, and bereavement after the death, of the patient. While specialized care may be provided to patient and families in the context of advanced disease, all clinicians involved in palliative and end-of-life care are responsible for having a basic understanding of effectivelymanaging psychologic and psychiatric aspects of this care.

Department of Medicine, University of Urbana-Champaign, Carle Clinic, Urbana, IL 61801, USA. jean.holley@carle.com Abstract Palliative care is comprehensive, interdisciplinary care focusing on pain and symptom management, advance-care planning and communication, psychosocial and spiritualsupport, and, in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the ethical issues in dialysis decision making. End-of-life care is one aspect of palliative care and incorporates all of the previously mentioned components as well as hospice and bereavement care. ESRD patientsand their families are appropriate candidates for palliative care because of their highsymptom burden, shortened survival, and significant comorbidity. The usual pattern ofillness trajectory in ESRD is a progressive decline punctuated by episodes of acute deterioration prompted by sentinel events like limb amputation or myocardial infarction. Such events provide opportunities for advance-care planning and communication betweenproviders and patients and families. Although communication is an integral component ofpalliative care, little is understood about effective provider-patient communication, especiallyin estimating and discussing prognosis. Palliative care has much to offer toward improving the quality of dialysis patients' lives as well as planning for and improving the quality of their deaths. The palliative care issues of illness trajectory, communication, and hospice useamong ESRD patients will be reviewed.

B.Osse@kwazo.umcn.nl Abstract Short and convenient checklists are necessary tools to support and structure needs assessments in daily palliative practice. This study aims to develop a short version of the Problems and Needs in Palliative Care questionnaire (PNPC-sv); a self-report questionnaire for patients covering all dimensions of palliative care, to investigate their problems and (unmet) needs. The original Problems and Needs in Palliative Care questionnaire (PNPC) instrument is a comprehensive checklist of problems and needs for palliative care, and hasshown validity and reliability. With its 90 items, however, it is not always practical. Thus itwas abridged to a short version with 33 items. The validity and reliability are established with its item response, its internal consistency, and with its correlations with the original PNPC and with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality ofLife Questionnaire-Core 30 and COOP/WONCA quality-of-life measures. A secondaryanalysis was done with data from 94 patients with metastatic cancer who had completed thelong version. Each item in the PNPC represents a problem relevant to 25% of the patients or more. High correlations of PNPC-sv and PNPC domains demonstrate construct validity. The dimension reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha > 0.70), while two problem-aspect domains were less coherent. The PNPC-sv domains show convergent validity withcorresponding health-related quality-of-life domains. The PNPC-sv is a concise, patient-centred tool that helps to identify the problems affecting the patient's quality of life and needs for care. It identifies prevalentneeds for care and appears reliable. Further research should study the clinical effects of integrating the questionnaire into daily palliative-care practice.

The Short Form 36 and Hospital and Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire were completed by all patients. Unstructured interviews were (n = 35) were conducted separately with each patient and then their significant other. These were followed by a focus group discussion (n = 18) with the multiprofessional clinical team. Quantitative data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics and simple descriptive statistics. Allqualitative data were taped, transcribed and analysed using Colaizzi's approach toqualitative analysis. Deteriorating health status was the central theme derived from this analysis. It led to decreased independence, social isolation and family burden. These problems weremitigated by the limited resources at the individual's disposal and the availability of support from hospital and community services. Generally resources and support were perceived as lacking. All participants in this study expressed concerns regarding the patients' future andsome patients described feelings of depression or acceptance of the inevitability of imminentdeath. Patients dying from chronic illness in this study had many concerns and unmet clinical needs. Care teams were frustrated by the lack of resources available to them and admitted they were ill-equipped to provide for the individual's holistic needs. Some clinicians described difficulty in talking openly with the patient and family regarding the palliative nature of their treatment. An earlier and more effective implementation of the palliative care approach is necessary if the needs of patients in the final stages of chronicillness are to be adequately addressed.

Edinburgh Cancer Center, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. schater@doctors.org.uk Abstract A retrospective chart review was conducted in this pilot study of 35 patients who withdrewfrom dialysis and were followed by a palliative care team. Data included etiology of end-stage renal disease, comorbid illnesses, mode of dialysis and duration, survival time afterwithdrawal, reason for withdrawal, mental competency, symptom management, and the nature of death. Mean survival time was 10 days. The most frequent symptoms following withdrawal were confusion, agitation, pain and dyspnea. 1/3 of the sample were cognitivelyimpaired at the time of the withdrawal decision. 17% experienced suffering during thewithdrawal period, 24% had unrelieved symptoms, 19% psychological distress, while justover 1/3 of patients died alone. With the provision of palliative care, symptom prevalence in the last 24 hours dropped from 53 to 20% for pain, 68 to 33% for agitation and 46 to 26% for dyspnea. Opioids and benzodiazepines were used in the treatment of over 90% ofpatients. Palliative medicine has the potential to improve the care of patients whodiscontinue dialysis.

The literature relating to a renal patient's decision not to dialyse is sparse and the evidence base upon which to support effective nursing practice is currently weak.

Sherman DW , Doctoral Program and the Advanced Practice Palliative Care Master's and Post-Master's Programs, New York University, New York 10003-6677, USA. Abstract Although definitions of palliative care include quality of life as a central concern, little research has been published about both the quality of life of patients with advanced illness and their family members, and particularly the changes in their quality oflife over time. The aims of this prospective longitudinal pilot study were to: (1) establish the reliability of multidimensional quality of life instruments based on patients with acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and patients with cancer and caregivers; (2) identifydifferences in quality of life between patients with advanced AIDS and cancer, and theirfamily caregivers with consideration of mortality, attrition, and compliance rates; and (3)examine differences in demographic variables and their potential confounding effect when measuring quality of life. The sample included 101 patients with advanced illness (63 patients with advanced AIDS and 38 with advanced cancer) and 81 family caregivers (43 caregivers for patients with AIDS and 38 caregivers for patients with cancer). Data collection involved themonthly completion of the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL) for patients, and theQuality of Life Scale (QLS) for family caregivers.

Based on the MQOL, patients with advanced AIDS reported a lower total quality of life, and lower psychological quality of life, and a higher physical quality of life compared to patients with advanced cancer. There were no significantdifferences between patient groups on the one-item physical well-being subscale, or the existential well-being, and support subscales. Based on the QLS, AIDS caregivers reported greater overall quality of life, greater psychological well-being, and greater spiritual well-be- ing than cancer caregivers. There were no significant differences between AIDS and cancer caregivers with respect to physical or social well-being. From baseline entry into the studyto third month of participation, there were no significant changes in total quality of life scoresfor patient or caregiver groups, although trends indicated a moderately high total quality of life over time for all patient and caregiver groups. Fourteen of 63 (22%) patients with AIDS patients died, while 19 of 38 (50%) patients with advanced cancer died after enrollment. Forty-six of 63 (73%) patients with advanced AIDS withdrew for various reasons other than death at some point during the 12 month time frame of the study, while 15 of 38 (39%)patients with advanced cancer withdrew. There were significant differences on alldemographic variables for patients with advanced cancer and AIDS. Only religious affiliation was significantly related to quality of life for patients with AIDS, while gender was the only variable associated with quality of life for patients with cancer. There were significant differences on all demographic variables between caregivers with the exception of gender and living arrangements. Only the relationship between patients and caregivers and maritalstatus were significantly associated with quality of life for cancer caregivers. In palliative care research, the challenge is to design studies that will capture changes in the domains of quality of life over time, yet will minimize participantburden and subsequent attrition rates. By measuring quality of life as an outcome variable inpalliative care, health professionals can identify changes in the domains of quality of lifeover time for various patient populations and their family caregivers, and respond withappropriate interventions, which promote or maintain their quality of life even as death approaches.

This paper describes patient feedback (n=26) on medical, social andtherapeutic out-patient palliative care services provided at one such facility in Northern Ireland. Medical records of all attending patients (n=50) were reviewed, and patients completed a semi-structured questionnaire. Patients' comments on day hospice were largelypositive. A number of suggestions for new service activities were made, and the need foreducation of multi-professional team members was recognized. Respondents recognizedthat day hospice allowed respite care for the family. Patients were very appreciative of thecare that was offered--their concern for its continuance perhaps restraining any criticism they had. Such findings provide the opportunity for health professionals to gain further insights into day care to better meet patients' needs.

Abstract The numbers of patients with end-stage renal disease are growing, with a disproportionate increase among those who are elderly, dependent and with multiple co-morbidities. More of these patients are choosing to be managed conservatively, without dialysis. Palliative provision for these patients within UK renal services is limited, but the recent NationalService Framework for Renal Services (Department of Health, 2005) has promoted servicedevelopment. However, few models of service provision have been described. This articledescribes a retrospective review of a new service for conservatively-managed patients withend-stage renal disease. The range and complexity of the health needs of this population is demonstrated, and an example of service development described. A model of the stages of the conservative pathway and appropriate interventions was developed. The absence ofresearch evidence prevented development of formal audit standards, and highlighted theurgent need for evaluation of models of care.

Abstract In the United States, as in most developed countries, death is rarely unexpected. It usually occurs in older persons with chronic progressive illnesses that often are complicated by infections or exacerbations. Many patients with terminal illnesses choose palliative care to relieve symptoms, improve the quality of their lives, and strive for a peaceful death.

From a sample of a variety ofparticipants at a national conference on palliative care (n = 200), 101 subjects returned questionnaires (51 percent) yielding 100 usable completed forms from attendees who demonstrated an interest in palliative care and, in some cases, a high level of personal or professional experience. Survey results were analyzed on respondents' perceptions concerning barriers related to advance directives and the delivery of palliative care. Of the 13 obstacle statements, results show that respondents rated the top three barriers as 1) physician reluctance to make referrals (mean = 4.23), 2) physician lackof familiarity with availability and suitability of hospice (mean = 3.93), and 3) association of hospice with death (mean = 3.93). There was a statistically significant difference in scores for respondents from hospitals and respondents from hospices on their assessment ofbarriers for the association of hospice with death (t = -2.09, p < .05) and the lack ofinformation about the severity of or irreversibility of the patients illness (t = -2.78, p < .01).

Palliative care in end-stage renal disease: focus on planning, hospice referral, and bereavement. Holley JL . Department of Medicine, Nephrology Division, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA. jlh4qs@virginia.edu Abstract The components of palliative care in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) include pain and symptom management, advance care planning, psychosocial and spiritual support, andethical issues in dialysis. End-of-life care is not synonymous with, but rather a subset of palliative care. Advance care planning occurs within the patient-family relationship and is a dynamic process that prepares for death, strengthens interpersonal relationships, and allowsa patient to achieve control over his or her life. It is incumbent upon dialysis care providersto include advance care planning in overall care plans for their patients. Factorscontributing to the failure of advance care planning in ESRD patients will be discussed, as will hospice and ESRD, and opportunities for bereavement programs.

We carried out this survey to establish the current pattern of provision of palliative care for ESRD in the UK. An anonymous but numbered questionnaire concerning local palliative care provision was sent to clinical directors of all 69 UK renal units. All the questionnaires were returned. Only 27 (39%) units employ nursing or Professions Allied to Medicine (PAM) staff with palliative care for ESRD patients as aspecified part of their role. In 19 of these units, staff spend <4 h per week concerned with palliative care and only five units have staff working for >12 h a week in this role. Fifty-five (80%) units do not have a written protocol for palliative care. Anaemic ESRD patients withan expected survival of >3 months receive blood transfusion in 59 (86%) units, intravenousiron in 61 (88%) units and erythropoietin in 63 (91%) units. Only 37 (54%) units kept a record of patients seen by the unit staff but deemed not suitable for dialysis. There is a significant variation in provision of palliative care services across the UK. In some areas, access to palliative care is restricted to patients with malignantdisease, and ESRD patients are excluded.

Guidelines represent the consensus of leaders, often based on systematic reviews of the literature, regarding the \"state of the art.\" To assess the degree to which end-of-life care is integrated into nationally developed guidelines for chronic, noncurable, life-limiting diseases.

They were assessed by two reviewers for end-of-life content in 15 domains (e.g., epidemiology of death, symptom management,spiritual, family roles, and settings of care), the presence of eight specific terms dealing with palliative care, integration of palliative care information into the guideline, and descriptive variables. Not available. Each guideline was examined and rated on a 0-2 scale (0, absent content; 1, minimal content; 2, helpful content) using 15 end-of-life content domains. Scores from domains were summed and classified into 3 categories: 4 or less, minimal; 5-12,moderate; and more than 12, significant content. Results: Ten percent of guidelines hadsignificant palliative care content, 64% had minimal content, and 26% had moderatecontent. The least addressed domains dealt with spirituality, ethics, advocacy and family roles. When guidelines that dealt solely with prevention, acute exacerbations or complications of an illness, or specific treatment modalities were excluded 28% and 16% ofthese general guidelines (n = 58) had moderate and significant palliative care content,respectively, compared to 24% and 0% of all nongeneral guidelines. Similar results were found when analyzing the data by disease course or treatment focus. Only 14% of guidelines advised physicians to consider palliative care at a specific point in the disease course. Ninety-one percent of the guidelines mentioned death, dying, end of life, mortality, or terminal illness but only 36% mentioned palliation or hospice. Current national guidelines on nine chronic, life-limiting illnesses offer little guidance in end-of-life care issues despite a recent increase in attention to this aspect ofmedical care.

Department of Palliative Care and Policy, King's College London, Weston Education Centre, Cutcombe Road, London SE5 9RJ, UK. irene.higginson@kcl.ac.uk Abstract Various scales have been used to assess palliative outcomes. But measurement can still be problematic and core components of measures have not been identified. This study aimed to determine the relationships between, and factorial structure of, three widely used scales among advanced cancer patients. Patients were recruited who received home or hospital palliative care services in the south of England. Hope, quality of life and palliative outcomes were assessed by patients in face to face interviews, using three previously established scales - a genericmeasure (EQoL), a palliative care specific measure (POS) and a measure of hope (HerthHope Index). Analysis comprised: exploratory factor analysis of each individual scale, and all scales combined, and confirmatory factor analysis for model building and validation. Of 171 patients identified, 140 (81%) consented and completed first interviews; mean age was 71 years, 54% were women, 132 had cancer. In exploratory analysis of individual means, three out of the five factors in the EQoL explained 75% of its variability,Publication Types, MeSH Terms PubMed - NCBI file:///C|/.../Desktop/Palliative%20Care%20for%20the%20Management%20of%20Chronic%20Illness%20PubMed%20Search%20Strategy.htm[12/16/2011 4:43:10 PM]CONCLUSION:four out of the 10 factors in POS explained 63% of its variability, and in the Hope Index, nine out of the 12 items explained 69% of its variability. When exploring the relative factorial structure of all three scales, five factors explained 56% of total combined variability.Confirmatory analysis reduced this to a model with four factors - self-sufficiency, positivity, symptoms and spiritual. Removal of the spiritual factor left a model with an improved goodness of fit and a measure with 11 items. We identified three factors which are important outcomes and would be simple to measure in clinical practice and research.

Nephrology has justifiably taken pride in its reliance on internalbenchmarking and the use of quality targets to shape clinical practice innovations, and this article discusses the efforts that are being made to measure end-of-life care of dialysis patients. A tool called the Dialysis Quality of Dying Apgar is described that examines fivedomains (pain, nonpain symptoms, advance care planning, peacefulness, and time) whichare scored and then summed. A recent interdisciplinary workgroup of renal professionalshas commissioned a series of focus groups that have attempted to ascertain patient and family values and preferences for the management of terminal situations. The results are summarized, and they should hopefully form a basis for the development of additionalresearch and clinical measurement tools.

There has been a considerable growth in the number andrange of hospital palliative care teams (HPCTs) in the United Kingdom.

Quality assurance and clinical governance requirements have an impact on the monitoring of such teams, but so far there is no standardised way of measuring the amount and quality of HPCTs' workload. Trent Hospice Audit Group (THAG) is a multiprofessional research group, which has been developing standards and audit tools for palliative care since the 1990s. These follow a format ofstructure-process-outcome for standards and measures. We describe a collaborativeprogramme of work with HPCTs that has led to a new set of standards and audit tools. NineHPCTs participated in three rounds of consultation, piloting and modification of standardstatements and tools. The final pack of HPCT quality assurance tools covers: policies and documentation; medical notes review; questionnaires for ward-based staff. The tools measure the HPCT workload and casemix; the views of ward-based staff on the supportiverole of the HPCT and the effectiveness of HPCT education programmes, particularly inchanging practice. The THAG HPCT quality assurance pack is now available for use incancer peer review.

Recruiting patients into a primary care based study of palliative care: why is it so difficult? Ewing G , Rogers M, Barclay S , McCabe J, Martin A , Todd C . Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. ge200@cam.ac.uk Abstract In the UK, researchers' access to study populations and control over selection ofparticipants is becoming increasingly constrained by data protection and researchgovernance legislation. Intervening stages placed between researchers and the population they wish to study can have serious effects on recruitment and ultimately on the validity of studies. In this paper we describe our experiences of gaining access to patients for a studyof palliative care in primary care. Despite considerable time and resources dedicated torecruitment, a smaller than anticipated study sample was achieved. We found thatgatekeeping by ethics committees and practitioner control over sample selection were significant hurdles in accessing patients for the study. Gatekeeping responsibilities represent considerable challenges for researchers seeking to obtain a representative study sample,not just in palliative care, but for research in general in health care.

The primary aim of this study was to psychometrically validate an instrument for directlymeasuring the bereaved family's perception of the necessity for improvement in structural/procedural aspects of palliative care. Different sets of questionnaires were sent to 800 and 425 families who lost family members at one of 70 certified palliative care units inJapan in the development and validation phases, respectively, and 281 families of the lattergroup in the follow-up phase. The participants were requested to fill out a newly-developedCare Evaluation Scale (CES), along with outcome measures (the perceived experience and satisfaction levels) and potential covariates (the degree of expectation, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the Social Desirability Scale). We obtained485, 310, and 202 responses in the validation, and phases(response rates: 64%, coefficient alpha of 0.98; the intra-class correlation coefficient in the test-retest examination was 0.57. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed 10 subscales: physical care (by physicians, by nurses), psycho-existential care, help with decision-making (for patients,for family), environment, family burden, cost, availability, and coordination/consistency. TheCES subscales were only moderately correlated with the perceived-experience levels of corresponding areas (r=0.36-0.52 and 0.39-0.60, respectively). TheCES score was not significantly associated with the degree of expectation, the changes of depression, or the Social Desirability Scale. The CES is a useful tool to measure the bereaved family's perception of the necessity for improvement in structural/proceduralaspects of palliative care. The advantages of the CES are: 1) it specifically evaluates thestructure and process of care, 2) it directly identifies needed improvements, 3) it is not affected by the degree of expectation, depression, or social desirability, and 4) it has satisfactory psychometric properties.

However, there are no data on the need for these services among patients with end-stage heart failure receiving intermittent infusion of intravenous inotropes. The need for hospice and palliative care programs among patients in end- stage heart failure who receive intermittent infusion of inotropes is investigated. The study included all stable patients with refractory heart failure symptoms treated with inotropes in our outpatient unit. A total of 73 patients (65 +/- 12 years; leftventricular ejection fraction 22 +/- 9%; New York Heart Association class 3.6 +/- 0.4) wereseen during a 49-month period. Of these, 35 patients (48%) met hospice or palliative care evaluation criteria upon referral but were offered, and accepted, the alternative of parenteral inotropes. In all, 1,737 individual outpatient treatment sessions were given, with a mean of24 +/- 19 sessions per patient (range 5 to 118 sessions), representing a minimum of 9,948h of inotrope therapy. A total of 18 (25%) patients died, 6 (8%) patients were withdrawn from the program (3 by their primary physicians and 3 because of significant travel limitations); 4(5%) patients required continuous intravenous home therapy; and 44 (61%) patients were discharged with significant improvement in their heart failure symptoms. Only 7 of the 18 patients who died had received hospice or palliative care intervention, mainly for the sake ofcomfort and to ease the transition among family members. The rest of the patients werecomfortable and had accepted the natural evolution of their disease; they were notinterested in or did not require hospice or palliative care intervention. Of the patients discharged from the outpatient cardiac infusion unit, the interval free of heart failure symptoms after the final infusion treatment ranged from 201 to 489 days, with no need forhospitalization or emergency room visits. Our results demonstrate that intermittent infusion of intravenous inotropes can be safely administered and can improve symptoms in a significant number of patients,probably by slowing the natural progression of heart failure. Although the full clinical impactof inotrope therapy in an outpatient setting has not been fully defined, other nonhemodynamic-related benefits should be sought and investigated. Our results suggest that intermittent infusion of intravenous inotropes is one of the prominent variables thatrequires particular attention. In our experience, the institution of intermittent infusions ofintravenous inotropes can, in fact, modify end-stage heart failure symptoms that, in mostpatients, are currently perceived to lead to a terminal event. Thus, appropriate use ofintermittent infusion of intravenous inotropes may not only improve functional class and symptoms in a significant number of patients identified as terminal by their poor response to conventional therapy, but it may also facilitate better utilization of hospice and palliative careresources among patients with end-stage heart failure. Furthermore, the need for hospiceand palliative care in patients with heart failure should be revisited in view of adjuvanttreatment options such as intermittent infusion of intravenous inotropes.

As the health care emphasis has changed from intervening for acute illness to treating the adverse effects of chronic disease, our health care system has also somewhatshifted gears. Unlike serious acute illness, chronic illness generally does not lead to a swift death in a hospital, but rather to a prolonged course of symptom management in the home setting or a long-term care facility. In some situations, the patient or family are battling adisease process where death is inevitable. Although holding on for a cure, the patient andfamily may begin considering the option of a dignified and peaceful death. In the care ofrenal patients, nephrology nurses have an expanded and important role in assisting patients with their decisions concerning palliative and end of life care and in providing that care. Fortunately, resources are now available to assist with the coordination of a therapeutic planof care.

Renal disease is epidemic amongst Aboriginal Australians. The CentralAustralian Palliative Care Service, based in the remote town of Alice Springs, sees a high proportion of renal patients, with different demographic characteristics to those seen in urban palliative care services. A case history illustrates distinctive concerns for local serviceprovision, including communication issues, cultural requirements for maximizing quality oflife, and the need to provide care in remote locations. Palliation for end-stage renal failure(ESRF) patients should be based on standard principles, but modified in accordance with local practical requirements and community needs.

The effects of music therapy on the quality and length of life of people diagnosed with terminal cancer. Hilliard RE . Florida State University, Big Bend Hospice, USA. Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of music therapy on quality of life, length of life in care, physical status, and relationship of death occurrence to the final musictherapy interventions of hospice patients diagnosed with terminal cancer. Subjects were adults who were living in their homes, receiving hospice care, and were diagnosed with terminal cancer. A total of 80 subjects participated in the study and were randomly assignedto one of two groups: experimental (routine hospice services and clinical music therapy) andcontrol (routine hospice services only). Groups were matched on the basis of gender andage. Quality of life was measured by the Hospice Quality of Life Index-Revised (HQOLI-R), a self-report measure given every visit. Functional status of the subjects was assessed by the hospice nurse during every visit using the Palliative Performance Scale. All subjectsreceived at least two visits and quality of life and physical status assessments. A repeatedmeasures ANOVA revealed a significant difference between groups on self-report quality oflife scores for visits one and two. Quality of life was higher for those subjects receivingmusic therapy, and their quality of life increased over time as they received more music therapy sessions. Subjects in the control group, however, experienced a lower quality of life than those in the experimental group, and without music, their quality of life decreased overtime. There were no significant differences in results by age or gender of subjects in eithercondition. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between groups on physicalfunctioning, length of life, or time of death in relation to the last scheduled visit by the musictherapist or counselor. This study provides an overview of hospice/palliative care, explains the role of music therapy in providing care, and establishes clinical guidelines grounded in research for the use of music therapy in improving the quality of life among the terminally ill.

In this pilot study, we sought (i) to identify symptom burden, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and advance directives in extremely ill haemodialysis patients to determine their suitability for palliative care and (ii) to determine the acceptability of palliativecare to patients and nephrologists. Nineteen haemodialysis patients with modified Charlson co-morbidity scores of > or =8 were recruited. Each completed surveys to assess symptom burden, HRQoL and prior advance care planning. Palliative care specialists then visited patients twice and generated recommendations. Patients again completed the surveys, and dialysis charts were reviewed to assess nephrologists' (i) compliance with recommendations and (ii) documentation of symptoms reported by patients on the symptom assessment survey.Patients and nephrologists then completed surveys assessing their satisfaction withpalliative care. Patients reported 10.5 symptoms, 40% of which were noted by nephrologists in patients' charts. HRQoL was significantly impaired. Thirty-two percent of patients had living wills. No differences were observed in symptoms, HRQoL or number of patients establishing advance directives as a result of the intervention. Sixty-eight percent of patients and 76% of nephrologists rated the intervention worthwhile. Extremely ill dialysis patients have marked symptom burden, considerably impaired HRQoL and frequently lack advance directives, making them appropriate candidates for palliative care. Patients and nephrologists perceive palliative care favourably despite its lack of effect in this study. A more sustained palliative care intervention with alarger sample size should be attempted to determine its effect on the care of this population.

Abstract Medical professionals in nephrology are trained to think about improving quality and quantityof life with their patients, but only recently are they being urged to consider ways to improveend-of-life care. For many staff, this still feels contradictory. One nephrologist recently told these authors, \"I was trained to help people live, not to help them die.\" The RWJF Promoting Excellence in End-of-Life Care work group has investigated, accumulated, anddesigned resources to help renal teams improve in this challenging arena. Peer mentoring isone such powerful resource, and, once in operation, is cost free. In conjunction with renalsocial work and the renal team, peer mentoring is a wonderful program that can decrease anxiety and preserve caring relationships in our burgeoning dialysis communities.

Decisions to withdraw dialysis nowprecede 1 in 4 deaths of patients who have end-stage renal disease. Guidelines have been recently published to assist clinicians in making these complex and emotionally charged determinations, and they include: relying on shared decision making by all participants,obtaining informed consent, estimating the prognosis on dialysis, adopting a systematicapproach for conflict resolution of disagreements, honoring advance directives, and ensuringthe provision of palliative care.

To address these needs, theRenal Palliative Care Initiative (RPCI) was instituted at Baystate Medical Center, a largetertiary care hospital, and at eight dialysis clinics in the Connecticut River Valley. With the cooperation of a large nephrology practice, the Western New England Renal and Transplant Associates, a core group of physicians, nurses, and social workers were trained in palliativemedicine, and charged with the goals of developing and implementing innovativeinterventions. The RPCI's programs include symptom management protocols, advance careplanning, and bereavement services for families and staff. The Initiative is increasingcompletion of formal advance directives by the patient population, while staff and families are particularly pleased with annual renal memorial services. The RPCI experience has much to offer the practice of nephrology, and it is relevant to ongoing efforts to extendpalliative medicine beyond the traditional focus on cancer and AIDS.Publication Types, MeSH Terms Publication Types, MeSH Terms PubMed - NCBI file:///C|/.../Desktop/Palliative%20Care%20for%20the%20Management%20of%20Chronic%20Illness%20PubMed%20Search%20Strategy.htm[12/16/2011 4:43:10 PM]PMID: 12854953 [PubMed - from clipboard 84.J Palliat Med. 2003 Apr;6(2):315-20. Palliative Excellence in Alzheimer Care Efforts (PEACE): a program JW C , Sachs GA . University of Chicago, Section of Geriatrics, School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA. jshega@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu Abstract Hospice is the standard method for providing quality end-of-life care in the United States. However, studies reveal that persons with dementia are infrequently referred to hospice, that barriers exist to increasing hospice utilization in this population, and that patients with dementia would benefit from hospice or hospice-like services earlier in the disease course.The Palliative Excellence in Alzheimer Care Efforts (PEACE) program responds to thesedeficiencies, striving to improve end-of-life care of persons with dementia and to integratepalliative care into the primary care of patients with dementia throughout the course of theillness. The PEACE program is a disease management model for dementia that incorporates advance planning, patient-centered care, family support, and a palliative care focus from the diagnosis of dementia through its terminal stages. PEACE is coordinatedthrough the primary care geriatrics practice of the University of Chicago. Patients andcaregivers are interviewed every 6 months for 2 years, and a postdeath interview isconducted with caregivers. These interviews assess care domains important for the optimal care of persons with dementia and their caregivers. A nurse coordinator reviews interviews and provides feedback to physicians, facilitating enhanced individual care and continuousquality improvement for the practice. Initial feedback suggests patients have adequate paincontrol, satisfaction with quality of care, appropriate attention to prior stated wishes, anddeath occurring in the patient's location of choice. Families voiced similar high marks regarding quality of care. This program demonstrates an innovative model of providing quality palliative care for dementia patients and their caregivers.

Patients' ratings of quality and satisfaction with care at the end of life. Sulmasy DP , McIlvane JM. The John J. Conley Department of Ethics, St Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, St Vincent's Manhattan, 153 W 11th St, New York, NY 10011, USA. daniel_sulmasy@nymc.edu Abstract To elicit ratings of quality and satisfaction with care from medical inpatients, especially those near the end of life. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 84 seriously ill medical inpatients at 2 academic medical centers. Forty-five had do-not-resuscitate orders. Patients were interviewed using a valid and reliable instrument, the Quality of End-of-Life Care and Satisfaction With Treatment scale (scored from 1.0-5.0) and standard measures of symptoms, anxiety, depression, and delirium. Mean patient ratings of quality of care were higher regarding physicians than nurses (4.39 vs 4.24; P =.01). Mean patient ratings of satisfaction with physicians were alsohigher, but not significantly (4.53 vs 4.43; P =.32). In analysis of variance models, patient ratings of physician quality were lowest for patients with do-not-resuscitate orders who were treated by a house-staff service compared with other patients (P =.01). These patients werealso least satisfied with their physicians (P =.03). Nondepressed patients with privateattending physicians rated nursing quality the highest (P =.16). These patients also reportedthe highest satisfaction with nurses (P =.002). Quality and satisfaction were not related toseverity of illness, and pain was only weakly associated with satisfaction with physicians. Patients with do-not-resuscitate orders who were treated by a house-staff service gave the lowest ratings of physician quality and satisfaction. Only private patientswho were not depressed were highly satisfied with their nursing care. Further study isrequired to better understand these findings and whether they are amenable to qualityimprovement.

However, it is not known whether hospices are prepared to participate in research, nor is it known what barriers may prevent hospices from becoming involved in research. This nationwide telephone survey was conducted with a random sample of hospice organizations taken from a national database. Questions elicited the researchactivities in which hospices are involved, the resources that hospices have available for the ethical review of research, and perceived barriers to research participation. Of 88 hospices identified, 17 (19%) reported that they had participated in research in the past year. Hospices that participated in research were more likely to beurban, affiliated with an academic institution, and were more likely to have an inpatient unit.Hospices cited several barriers to research participation, including time commitments, staffing resources, ethical concerns, and burdens to patients and families. The most important concern was lack of staffing resources. Hospices indicated that they would bemost willing to support research regarding pain management and timing of referral tohospice.

A scale to measure satisfaction of bereaved family receiving inpatient palliative care. Morita T , Chihara S , Kashiwagi T ; Quality Audit Committee of the Japanese Association of Hospice and Palliative Abstract Although satisfaction is an important outcome of medical care, there are no validated tools to quantify family satisfaction with hospital-based palliative care. In this nationwide postalsurvey, an instrument to measure informal carer satisfaction with an inpatient palliative careservice was validated. A 60-item questionnaire was mailed to 1344 bereaved people who had lost their family members at 50 palliative care units in Japan, and 850 responses were analysed (response rate = 64%). The reliability, construct validity, and convergent validity ofthe scale were examined after the responses were randomly divided into two groups: atraining set used in the development phase (n = 500) and a testing set used in thevalidation phase (n = 350). The number of scale items was reduced from 50 to 34 through psychometric techniques in the development phase. In the testing sample, the overall Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the final 34-item scale was 0.98. A factor analysis revealedthat the scale consisted of seven subcategories: Nursing Care, Facility, Information,Availability, Family Care, Cost, and Symptom Palliation. The total score of the scale wassignificantly correlated with the degree of global satisfaction of the bereaved (Spearman's rho = 0.78). In conclusion, this 34-item scale, the Satisfaction Scale for Family Members Receiving Inpatient Palliative Care (Sat-Fam-IPC), has acceptable psychometric propertiesand would be a useful tool to measure carer satisfaction with an inpatient palliative careservice.Publication Types, MeSH 4:43:10 PM]PMID: 11969145 [PubMed - 90.J Healthc Qual. 2002 Jan-Feb;24(1):25-9.

The EORTC core quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30, version 3.0) in terminally ill cancer patients under palliative care: validity and reliability in a Hellenic sample. Kyriaki T . Relief and Palliative Care Unit, University of Athens, Areteion Hospital, 76 Vas. Sofias Ave., Athens 11528, Greece. mistakidou@yahoo.com Abstract In 1986, the European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC) initiated a research program to develop an integrated, modular approach for evaluating the quality oflife of patients participating in international clinical trials. The questionnaire was designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of 5 multiitem scales (physical, role, social, emotional and cognitive functioning)and 9 single items (pain, fatigue, financial impact, appetite loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea,constipation, sleep disturbance and quality of life). It was administered to the patients beforethe initiation of palliative treatment and then once again during the treatment. The validation of the questionnaire took place at Areteion Hospital, while the translation was conducted by the EORTC bureau. The final validation sample consisted of 120 cancer patients. Theclinical variable assessed was the performance status. The aim of our study was to assessthe applicability of this quality of life measurement on a Hellenic sample of cancer patientsreceiving palliative care. The results showed that the questionnaire was well accepted in thepresent patient population. In addition, the questionnaire was found to be useful in detecting the effectiveness of palliative treatment over time. The scale reliability was very good (pretreatment from 0.57-0.79, ontreatment from 0.56-0.75), especially for the functioningscale. In addition, very good validity was found in all the approaches used. Moreover, thefactor analysis results in a 6-factor solution that satisfies the criteria of reproducibility,interpretability and confirmatory setting. Performance status showed an improvement (p <MeSH Terms MeSH Terms PubMed - NCBI file:///C|/.../Desktop/Palliative%20Care%20for%20the%20Management%20of%20Chronic%20Illness%20PubMed%20Search%20Strategy.htm[12/16/2011 4:43:10 PM]0.0025) during the studied period. These results support that the QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) has proven to be a reliable and valid measure of the quality of life in Greek cancer patients receiving palliative care treatment.

Cohen SR , Boston P , Mount BM, Porterfield P . Division of Palliative Care, Department of Oncology, McGill University, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Canada. robin.cohen@mcgill.ca Abstract The primary goal of palliative care is to improve the quality of life (QOL) of people with a terminal illness. Previous studies of the impact of hospice/palliative care have documentedimprovement in physical and psychological symptoms, but not in overall QOL, due in part to the difficulties of measuring QOL. The McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL) was developed to assess QOL in persons with advanced illness. MQOL scores were determinedon admission and 7-8 days later for sequential eligible and willing patients admitted to fivepalliative care units. These 88 patients represented 8% of those admitted to the units duringthe study period. Following the final MQOL completion, patients were interviewed and askedto describe the nature of the changes in QOL they had experienced since admission.MeSH Terms MeSH Terms PubMed - NCBI file:///C|/.../Desktop/Palliative%20Care%20for%20the%20Management%20of%20Chronic%20Illness%20PubMed%20Search%20Strategy.htm[12/16/2011 4:43:10 PM]Significant improvements were found in the MQOL total score and subscale scores reflecting physical, psychological and existential well-being. In the interviews patients indicated that they had experienced changes in physical, emotional and interpersonal status, in spiritual outlook, and in their preparation for death. They also described the impact of the palliative care unit environment. This is the first study to demonstrate thathospice/palliative care can improve existential well-being in addition to psychological andphysical symptoms. It provides evidence in the patients' own words that improvements in QOL go beyond symptom control following admission to a palliative care unit. However, the study results are generalizable only to those few patients admitted who are well enough to complete a questionnaire 1 week after admission.

A preliminary study of the utility of the brief hospice inventory. Guo H , Fine PG , Mendoza TR, Cleeland CS . Pain Research Group, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1100 Holcombe Blvd. Houston, TX 77030, USA. Abstract The increasing number of palliative care patients necessitates a simple, reliable instrument to routinely measure outcomes among hospice patients. We tested the utility of the BriefHospice Inventory (BHI) to assess outcomes of hospice patients and estimations of patients' outcomes by nurse caregivers. In a prospective study, 145 home-based hospice patients were enrolled in the study from VistaCare Hospice. During the first week of admission,patients and nurse caregivers completed the BHI, which assessed patients' symptoms,satisfaction with care, and quality of life. Factor analysis supported a two-factor structure forthe BHI for patients and caregivers, including a symptom subscale and quality of life subscale. Patients with severe symptoms showed improvement on the symptom subscale, but not the quality of life subscale, during the first 2 weeks after admission. The BHI showsutility in measuring hospice patients' symptom severity and quality of life over time.

One family member for each of 237 critical care patients. Content and construct validity were examined on 37 items and 6 constructs thought to measure family satisfaction with the quality of critical care in hospitals. Initially, 14 items and 1 construct were removed from the questionnaire based on thisanalysis. It was then administered to 237 family members. Factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis using path models were performed. Internal consistency using Pearson correlations andCronbach's alpha, and discriminant validation were also yieldeda single eigenvalue >1 (3.712), whereas confirmatory factor analysis led to the finalinstrument being reduced to 20 items and 5 subscale constructs. One subscale (\"Comfort\") performed poorly, indicating the possible need for a four-factor model. Subsequently, internal consistency assessed by Cronbach's alpha was 0.9101 for the five-factor model and 0.9327 for the four-factor model. Subscale correlations were no lower than 0.750 for the five-factor model and 0.856 for the four-factor model. This study provides support that the Critical Care Family Satisfaction Survey-which yields five subscales, \"Assurance,\" \"Information,\" \"Proximity,\" \"Support,\" and\"Comfort\"--is reliable and valid. Using five constructs rather than four is recommended because of the following: a) the internal consistency loss of 0.0226 for the \"Comfort\" subscale is not enough to warrant its removal, b) a four-factor questionnaire can beadministered and totaled independently of this subscale, c) the need for the fifth construct isindicated by this study's results, and d) including the extra data may allow for more detailedanalysis.

Abstract To develop an outcome measure for patients with advanced cancer and their families which would cover more than either physical symptoms or quality of life related questions. To validate the measure in various specialist and non-specialist palliative care settings throughout the UK. A systematic literature review of measures appropriate for use in palliative care settings was conducted. In conjunction with a multidisciplinary project advisory group, questions were chosen for inclusion into the scale based on whether they measuredaspects of physical, psychological, or spiritual domains pertinent to palliative care, andwhether similar items had shown to be valid as part of another measure. A staff completed version was developed to facilitate data collection on all patients throughout their care, and a patient completed version was designed to enable the patient to contribute to theassessment of their outcomes when possible. A full validation study was conducted toMeSH Terms RESULTS: CONCLUSION:evaluate construct internal consistency, responsiveness to change over time, and test-retest reliability. Assessments were timed. Eight centres in England and Scotland providing palliative care, including inpatient care, outpatient care, day care, home care, and primary care. A total of 450 patients entered care during the study period. Staff collected data routinely on patients in care long enough to be assessed (n = 337). Of these, 262 were eligible for patient participation; 148 (33%) went on to complete a questionnaire. The Palliative Care Outcome Scale (POS), the European Organisation for Research on Cancer Treatment, and the Support Team Assessment Schedule. The POS consists of two almost identical measures, one of which is completed by staff, the other by patients. Agreement between staff and patient ratings was found to be acceptable for eight out of 10 items at the first assessment. The measure demonstratedconstruct validity (Spearman rho = 0.43 to 0.80). Test/re-test reliability was acceptable for seven items. Internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.65 (patients), 0.70 (staff)). Change over time was shown, but did not reach statistical significance. Thequestionnaire did not take more than 10 minutes to complete by staff or patients. The POS has acceptable validity and reliability. It can be used to assess prospectively palliative care for patients with advanced cancer.

Family caregiver quality of life: differences between curative and palliative cancer treatment settings. McMillan SC , Jacobsen PB . Psychosocial Oncology Program, University of South Florida H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida 33612-9497, USA. Abstract To compare the impact of cancer caregiving in curative and palliative settings on family caregiver quality of life (QOL), 267 family caregivers of cancer patients receiving curativetreatment were compared to 134 family caregivers of cancer patients receiving palliative treatment through hospice. Both groups completed a demographic profile in addition to two self-report QOL questionnaires. Patient performance status and disease site were alsorecorded. Family caregivers of patients receiving palliative care had significantly lower QOLscores and lower scores on physical health. Hierarchical multiple regressions showed thatafter accounting for patient performance status, treatment status accounted for no additionalsignificant variability in QOL scores. After accounting for caregiver level of education, treatment status accounted for no additional significant variability in physical health. These results suggest that the lower QOL scores of caregivers in the palliative setting are areflection of the patients' poorer performance status. The lower physical health scores ofcaregivers in the palliative setting appear to be a reflection of their lower educational level.Additional research is needed to evaluate the influence of specific demands of caregiving and emotional distress of the caregiver on caregiver QOL.

McMillan SC , Weitzner M. American Cancer Society Professor of Oncology Nursing, University of South Florida College of Nursing, Tampa, USA. Abstract Improving or maintaining the quality of life for persons with cancer is a major goal of end-of-life care; however, to measure quality-of-life outcomes, a valid and reliable measure is needed. The purpose of this project was to report the psychometric properties of the revised Hospice Quality of Life Index (HQLI), including validity and reliability for hospice patients with cancer. Data were collected from home care hospice patients with cancer (n = 255) and a group of apparently healthy adults in the community (n = 32). The revised HQLI is a 28-item self-report instrument that Well-being, Functional Well-being, and Social/Spiritual Well-being. Evidence for validity was provided in three ways. First, factor analysis confirmed the three subscales (Psychophysiological, Functional, and Social/Spiritual Well-being).Second, a weak significant correlation was found between the Easterm Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Rating scores and HQLI scores (r = .26; P = .00). Third, the HQLI was able to discriminate between hospice patients with cancer andapparently healthy adults (lambda = .34; P = .00). In addition, the mean scores of these twogroups were significantly different (t = 6.64; P = .00). However, only a minimal difference inscores was found on the Social/Spiritual Well-being subscale between the cancer andhealthy groups. Reliability for the revised HQLI was high for both the total scale (alpha = .88) and the subscales (alpha =.82-.85). Emphasis has been placed recently on understanding quality of life from the patient's perspective. The development of a valid and reliable tool can guide care givers in providing meaningful quality-of-life care. The HQLI provides patients theopportunity to express beliefs about quality-of-life issues and to maintain direction over acritical aspect of their care. Of note from this study, the significant difference between groups in functional well-being and minimal difference in social/spiritual well-being suggest that patients are able to appraise their functional abilities realistically and still maintain theirsocial network and spiritual beliefs. Indeed, it may be that patients give family relationshipsand spiritual beliefs greater focus during a terminal illness.

Quality of life of primary caregivers of hospice patients with cancer. McMillan SC . Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of life of a group of adults who were serving as primary caregivers for 118 hospice patients with cancer who were receiving hospice home care in west central Florida. The Caregiver Quality of Life Index, used in the study, includes items related to physical, emotional, social, and financial well-being. The Caregiver Qualityof Life Index was administered within 48 hours of admission to hospice and after 3 weeks ofhospice care (during week 4). Quality of life scores remained stable from admission to week 4. Item scores were highest for social well-being (74.7 and 69.7) and lowest for physical well-being (60.6and 63.7). No significant differences were found in item scores from admission to week 4. Quality of life of primary caregivers is negatively affected by caregiving, but the support provided by hospice care may help to ameliorate these effects.Health providers who are alert to caregiver needs and knowledgeable about the work of themultidisciplinary hospice team will be more likely to refer patients and caregivers toappropriate hospice care.

McCanse RP . Abstract The purpose of this study was to establish whether or not readiness for death, as an indicator of healthy dying, is a measurable concept. Review of relevant literature revealedconsensus regarding the universality of a human need for healthy dying. A theory of healthy dying was derived from the Rogerian paradigm. The McCanse Readiness for Death Instrument (MRDI) was constructed, which included indicators of physiological,psychological, sociological, and spiritual aspects of \"healthy\" field pattern as death isdevelopmentally approached. The MRDI was a 26-item structured interview questionnairewhich generated interval-ratio data through a visual analog scale. A pretest was conductedwith a sample of 9 volunteer patients drawn from a small suburban outpatient hospice. The MRDI was concurrently administered to dying individuals, their primary caregivers, and their primary hospice nurses. Correlations between dying individuals' scores and their primarycaregivers' estimates of patient death readiness as well as between patients and theirprimary hospice nurses were very encouraging. Cronbach's coefficient alpha for internal consistency reliability was .59. Content validity was supported by consensus of an expert panel of practicing hospice nurses. Construct validity was demonstrated through legitimateplacement of the concept, healthy death readiness, within the theoretical web whichsupported it. The MRDI was then administered to a sample of 31 terminally-ill individuals,their primary caregivers, and their primary hospice nurses drawn from larger, urban hospice populations in three geographic areas of the United States. The MRDI was also administered to a contrast group of 39 cardiac-impaired individuals who were not terminally-ill. Overall internal consistency of the MRDI was found to be quite favorable (alpha = .76).Debilitating illness and actual mortality in the study sample precluded and/or confoundedestimates of test-retest reliability. Convergent validity of the MRDI was indicated bysignificant correlations between patients' scores and primary caregivers' estimates (r = .35, p < .05) and between patients' scores and primary hospice nurses' estimates (r = .53, p < .01). Discriminant validity of the MRDI was demonstrated by a significant mean differencebetween the group of terminally-ill patients and the group of non-terminal, cardiac-impairedpatients (t = 1.76, p < .01).

Sixty-eight patient/caregiver dyads from one hospicewere asked to fill out the HQLI on admission and after 3 weeks of hospice care. Hospice experts evaluated the items on the tool to assess content validity. The content validity index (0.83) and the alpha coefficients (r = 0.87 and 0.83) supported the validity and reliability ofthe HQLI. Item analysis revealed items with which patients were most satisfied and aspectsof quality of life that were considered to be most important.

College of Nursing, University of South Florida, Tampa. Abstract To evaluate the effects of hospice services on the quality of life of primary caregivers and to evaluate the validity and reliability of a new tool. Exploratory, descriptive. A nonprofit hospice in Florida; clients are cared for primarily in the home. 68 adult primary caregivers of 68 patients with cancer enrolled in hospice care and 62 noncaregiving adults. Subjects were recruited on admission to hospice and completed the Caregiver Quality of Life Index (CQLI) and the Hospice Quality of Life Index (HQLI) on admission and during week four of hospice care. Caregivers' assessment of their own physical, social, financial, and emotional quality of life; patients' assessment of their physical, psychological,spiritual, social, and financial well-being. No significant differences were found in caregiver quality-of-life scores from admission to week four, and no correlations existed between quality-of-life scores and ageor education. A significant positive correlation was found between the caregivers' quality oflife and their estimate of the patients' quality of life. Evidence exists that the CQLI is validand reliable. Caregivers of terminally ill people with cancer can maintain their quality of life during the first month of hospice care. The caregiver's perception of the patient's quality of life may affect the caregiver's quality of life. When offering support to primary caregivers, the hospice team should include the four domains (physical, emotional, social, and financial) and should focus on the interrelatedness of the patient's and caregiver's quality of life.
