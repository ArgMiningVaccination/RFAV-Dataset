INTRODUCTION 1.1. Objective of the guideline This guidance document provides genera l principles on the setting and justification, to the extent possible, of a uniform set of specifications for herbal substa nces/preparations and herb al medicinal products to support applications for marketing authorisation or registration accord ing to Directive 2001/82/EC and Directive 2001/83/EC. It should be read in conjunction with the 'Guideline on quality of herbal medicinal products' (CPMP/QWP/2819/00 Rev 1 and EMEA/CVMP/814/00 Rev 1). A simplified registration procedure was established for traditional herb al medicinal products for human use under Directive 2004/24/EC. The quality of a medicina l product is independent of its traditional use, therefore all general principles of quality also appl y to traditional herbal medicinal products for human use. Traditional herbal medicinal products for human use may additionally contai n vitamins or minerals. Concerning these products, this guideline describes specific aspects linked to mixtures of herbal substances/ herbal preparations with vitamins and/or minerals. In addition, the quality, specifications and documentation for each vitamin and mineral have to comp ly with all relevant legi slation and guidelines. 1.2. Background A specification is defined as a list of tests, refere nces to analytical and biological procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria, which are numerical limits , ranges, or other criteria for the tests described. It establishes the set of criteria to which a herbal substance/preparation or he rbal medicinal product should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended us e. \"Conformance to specifications\" means that the herbal substances/preparation or herb al medicinal product, when tested according to the listed analytical procedures, will meet the listed acceptance criteria. Specifications are legally binding quality standards that are proposed and justified by the manufact urer and approved by regulatory authorities. Specifications are one part of a total control strate gy for the herbal substance/preparation and herbal medicinal product designed to ensure product quality and consis tency. Other parts of this strategy include thorough product characterisation dur ing development, upon which specifi cations are based, adherence to Good Agriculture Practice and Good Manufacturing Practi ce, and a validated manufacturing process, e.g., raw material testing, in-process testing, stability testing, etc. In the case of herbal medicinal products, specifications are generally applied to the herbal substance, to the herbal preparation and to the herbal medicinal pr oduct. Specifications are primarily intended to define the quality of the herbal substance/preparation and he rbal medicinal product rather than to establish full characterisation, and should focus on those characteristics found to be useful in ensuring the safety and efficacy of the herbal substance/prep aration and herbal medicinal product. 1.3. Scope of the guideline The quality of herbal substances, herbal preparations and herbal medicinal products is determined by the quality of the starting plant material, development, in-process controls, GM P controls, and process validation, and by specifications applied to them throughout developm ent and manufacture. This guideline addresses specifications, i.e., those tests, procedures , and acceptance criteria used to assure the quality of the herbal substances/preparations and herbal medi cinal products at release and during the shelf life. Specifications are an important component of quality a ssurance, but are not its only component. All of the considerations listed above are necess ary to ensure consistent production of herbal substances/preparations and herbal medicinal products of high quality. This guideline addresses only the marketing approval of herbal medicinal products (including fixed combinations); it does not address he rbal substances/preparations or he rbal medicinal products during the clinical research stages of product development but sh ould be viewed as useful points for considerations. CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 5/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 Guidance is provided with regard to acceptance crite ria, which should be established for all herbal substances/preparations and herbal medicinal products, i.e. universal ac ceptance criteria, and those which are considered specific to individual herbal substances /preparations and/or dosa ge forms. This guideline reflects the current state of the art at the time it has been written, and should not be considered all- encompassing. New analytical technologies, and modifi cations to existing technologies, are continuously being developed. Such technologies should be used when appropriate. 2. GENERAL CONCEPTS The following concepts are important in the devel opment and setting of specifications. They are not universally applicable, but each should be considered in particular circum stances. This guideline presents a brief definition of each concept and an indication of the circumstances under which it may be applicable. Generally, proposals to implement these concepts should be justified by the applicant and approved by the appropriate regulatory authority be fore being put into effect. 2.1. Characterisation Consistent quality for products of herbal origin can only be assured if the starting plant materials are defined in a rigorous and detailed manner. Characterisa tion of a herbal substance/preparation or herbal medicinal product (which includes a detailed evaluation of the botanical and phytochemical aspects of the plant, manufacture of the preparation and the herbal medicinal product) is therefore essential to allow specifications to be established, whic h are both comprehensive and relevant. Acceptance criteria should primarily be established and justified base d on information from batches used in pre-clinical/clinical studies or described in rele vant bibliographic data. Ho wever, data from batches used to demonstrate manufacturing consistency, rele vant development data, such as those arising from analytical procedures and stability studies as well as historical batch data may need to be taken into account, where available. Extensive characterisation usually is performed onl y in the development phase and where necessary following significant process change s. If necessary, at the time of submission, the manufacturer should have established appropriately characterised in-house reference materials (primary and working) which will serve for identification and determina tion of content of production batches. 2.1.1. Macroscopical/microscopical characterisation Includes features which distinguish the herbal subs tance from potential adulterants and substitutes. 2.1.2. Phytochemical characterisation Analytical data on constituents including constitu ents with known therapeutic activity as well as compounds suitable as active markers or analytical ma rkers. Includes chromatographic fingerprinting. 2.1.3. Impurities Impurities can be classified as follows: - impurities arising from starting materials (ac tive substances, excipients) and containers; - process related impurities arising from the manufacturing process. In addition, for herbal medicinal products the fo llowing groups of impurities s hould be addressed, if appropriate: Contaminants , which are impurities such as heavy metals, pe sticides, mycotoxins, fumigants as well as microbial contamination, including those arising from extraneous sources, and radioactive substances, if relevant. Degradation products , which in the context of this Guideline, due to the particular nature of herbal CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 6/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 medicinal product, should primarily address toxicol ogically relevant impurities arising from degradation of herbal substances/preparations. Residual solvents , which are impurities arising from manufacturing processes. 2.1.4. Biological variation Includes the use of historical batc h data and published information con cerning biological variation for justification of specification. 2.2. Design and development considerations The experience and data accumulated during the developm ent of a herbal substance/preparation or herbal medicinal product should form the basis for the setting of specifications. In general, it is only necessary to test the herbal medicinal product for quality attributes uniquely associated with the particular dosage form and the herbal substance or herbal preparation pr esent. For example, it may be possible to propose excluding or replacing certain tests on this basis. Some examples are: - reduced testing for pesticide residues where a herbal substance is grown under strict organic cultivation without pesticides etc and potential contamination from adjacent plantations has been eliminated, - excluding or reducing tests for microbial limits in herbal preparations such as extracts or tinctures depending on the ethanol content if ju stified by scientific evidence. 2.3. Pharmacopoeial tests and acceptance criteria The European Pharmacopoeia contains important requirements pertaining to certain analytical procedures and acceptance criteria that are relevant to herbal substances, herbal preparations and their herbal medicinal products. Wherever they are appropria te, pharmacopoeial methods should be utilised. 2.4. Periodic/skip testing Periodic or skip testing is the performance of specified tests at release on pre-selected batches and/or at predetermined intervals, rather than on a batch-to-batch basis. This represents a less than full schedule of testing and should therefore be justif ied and presented to the regulatory authority prior to implementation. This concept may be applicable to, for example, dissolution, residual solvents, and microbiological testing, e.g., for solid oral dosage forms. This concept may therefore some times be implemented post- approval in accordance with GMP and approval by the Regulatory Authority. 2.5. Release versus shelf-life acceptance criteria The concept of different acceptance criteria for releas e versus shelf-life specifications applies to herbal medicinal products. This concept can also apply in exceptional cases to herbal substances and herbal preparations, if justified. It pertains to the establis hment of more restrictive criteria for the release of a herbal medicinal product than are applied to the shelf- life. Examples where this may be applicable include assay and impurity (degra dation product) levels. 2.6. In-process tests In-process tests are tests, which may be performed dur ing the manufacture of either the herbal preparation or herbal medicinal product, rather than as part of the formal battery of tests which are conducted prior to product release. In-process tests, which are used for th e purpose of adjusting proces s parameters within an operating range, e.g., hardness and friab ility of tablet cores, which will be coated, are not included in the specification. Certain tests conducted during the manufact uring process, where the acceptance criteria are CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 7/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 identical to or tighter than the release requirement , (e.g., pH of a solution) may be used to satisfy specification requirements when the test is included in the specification. 2.7. Alternative procedures Alternative procedures are those whic h may be used to measure an attri bute when such procedures control the quality of the herbal substance/preparation or herbal medicinal product to an extent which is comparable or superior to the official procedure. Exam ple: for tablets that have been shown not to degrade during manufacture, it may be permissible to use a sp ectrophotometric procedure for release as opposed to the official procedure, which is chromatographic. However, the chromatographic procedure should still be used to demonstrate compliance with the acceptance criteria during the shelf- life of the product. 2.8. Evolving technologies New analytical technology, and modifications to ex isting technology, are conti nuously being developed. Such technologies should be used when they are consider ed to offer additional assurance of quality, or are otherwise justifiable. 2.9. Reference standard A reference standard, or reference material, is a substa nce prepared for use as the standard in an assay, identification, or purity test. In the case of herbal medicinal products, the refe rence standard may be a botanical sample of the herbal substance, a sample of the herbal preparation e.g. extract or tincture or a chemically defined substance e.g. a constituent with known therapeutic activity, an active marker or an analytical marker or a known impurity. The reference standard has a quality appr opriate to its use. The composition of reference standards of herbal substances and herbal preparations intended for use in assays should be adequately contro lled and the purity of a standard should be measured by validated quantitative procedures. Herbarium samples If the herbal substance is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia or in another Pharmacopoeia of a Member State, a herbarium sample of the whole plant or part of the plant, if the whole plant is a tree etc., must be available. 2.10. Statistical concepts Appropriate statistical analysis should be applied, when necessary, to quantitative data reported. The methods of analysis, including justification and ration ale, should be described fully. These descriptions should be sufficiently clear to permit independe nt calculation of the results presented. 3. GUIDELINES 3.1. Specifications: Definition and justification 3.1.1. Definition of specifications A specification is defined as a list of tests, refere nces to analytical or biological procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria, which are numerical limits , ranges, or other criteria for the tests described. It establishes the set of criteria to which a herbal substance, herbal preparation and herbal medicinal product should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. \"Conformance to specifications\" means that the herbal substance/preparation and/or herb al medicinal product, when tested according to the listed analytical procedures, will meet the listed ac ceptance criteria. Specifications are legally binding CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 8/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 quality standards that are proposed and justified by the manufacturer and approved by regulatory authorities. It is possible that, in addition to release tests, a specif ication may list in-process tests, periodic (skip) tests, and other tests, which are not alwa ys conducted on a batch-by-batch ba sis. In such cases the applicant should specify which tests are routinely conducted batch-by-batch, and which tests are not, with an indication and justification of the actual testi ng frequency. In this situation, the herbal substance/preparation and/or herb al medicinal product should meet the acceptance criteria if tested. It should be noted that changes in the specificati on after approval of the application will need prior approval by the regulatory authority. 3.1.2. Justification of specifications The setting of specifications for a herbal substance/prep aration and herbal medicina l product is part of an overall control strategy which includes control of raw ma terials and excipients, in-process testing, process evaluation/validation, stability testing and testing for consistency of batches. Wh en combined in total, these elements provide assurance that the appropria te quality of the product will be maintained. Since specifications are chosen to confirm the quality rather than to characterise the product, the manufacturer should provide the rationale and justification for including and/or excluding testing for specific quality attributes. The following points should be taken into consideration when establishing scientifically justifiable specifications. Specifications for herbal substances are linked to: - botanical characteristics of the plant (genus, species, variety, chemotype; usage of genetically modified organisms),parts of the plants, - macroscopical and microscopical characterisation, phytochemical characteristics of the plant part constituents with known therapeutic activity or mark ers, toxic constituents (identity, assay, limit tests) - biological/geographical variation - cultivation/harvesting/drying conditions (microbi al levels, aflatoxins, heavy metals etc) - pre-/post-harvest chemical treatments (pesticides, fumigants) - profile and stability of the constituents Specifications for herbal preparations are linked to: - quality of the herbal substance (as above) - definition of the herbal preparation (d rug extract ratio, extraction solvent(s)) - method of preparation from the herbal substance - constituents - constituents with known therapeutic activity or active or analytical markers, - other constituents (identification, assay, limit tests) - drying conditions (e.g. microbial leve ls, residual solvents in extracts) - profile and stability of the constituents - microbial purity on storage - batches used in pre-clinical/clinical te sting (safety and efficacy considerations) Specifications for herbal medicinal products are linked to: - quality of the herbal substance and/or herbal preparation - manufacturing process (temperature effects, residual solvents) - profile and stability of the active constituents/formulation in packaging - batches used in pre-clinical/clinical te sting (safety and efficacy considerations) CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 9/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 Specifications should be based on data obtained from lots used to dem onstrate manufacturing consistency. Linking specifications to a manufacturing process is im portant, especially with regard to product-related substances, product-related impurities and process-related impurities. Historical batch data should be ta ken into account where available. Changes in the manufacturing process and degradati on products produced during storage may result in a product which differs from that used in pre-clinical and clinical development. The significance of these changes should be evaluated. Due to the inherent complexity of herbal medici nal products there may be no single stability-indicating assay or parameter that profiles the stability character istics. Consequently the applicant should propose a series of product-specific, stability-indicating tests, the results of which will provide assurance that changes in the quality of the product during its shelf- life will be detected. The determination of which tests should be included will be prod uct-specific. Applicants are referr ed to the 'Note for guidance on stability testing of new drug substances and pro ducts' (CPMP/ICH/2736/99), the 'Guideline on stability testing of new veterinary drug su bstances and medicinal products (CVMP/VICH/899/99) and the 'Note for guidance on stability testing of existing activ e substances and related finished products' (CPMP/QWP/122/02 rev. 1 and EMEA/CVMP/846/99). 3.2. Universal tests/criteria Implementation of the recommendations in the followi ng section should take into account the ICH/VICH Guidelines 'Validation of analytical methods: de finitions and (CPMP/ICH/281/95 and CVMP/VICH/591/98). 3.2.1. Herbal substances Herbal substances are a diverse range of botanical mate rials including leaves, herbs, roots, flowers, seeds, bark etc. A comprehensive specification must be devel oped for each herbal substance even if the starting material for the manufacture of the herbal medicinal produc t is a herbal preparation. In the case of fatty or essential oils used as active substances of herb al medicinal products a specification for the herbal substance is required unless justified. The specifica tion should be established on the basis of recent scientific data and shoul d be set out in the same way as the European Pharmacopoeia monographs. The general monograph \"Herbal drugs\" (herbal substances) of the Eur opean Pharmacopoeia should be consulted for interpretation of the following requirements. The following tests and acceptance criteria are considered generally applicable to all herbal substances. a) Definition: a qualitative statement of the botanical source, plant part used and its state (e.g. whole, reduced, powdered, fresh, dry). It is also impor tant to know the geographical source(s) and the conditions under which the herb al substance is obtained. b) Characters: a qualitative statement about the organoleptic character(s) where characteristic and the macroscopic and microscopic botanical characters of the herbal substance. c) Identification : identification testing optimally should be able to discrimina te between related species and/or potential adulterants/substitutes, whic h are likely to be present. Identification tests should be specific for the herbal substance and are usually a combination of three or more of the following: Macroscopical characters, Microscopical charact ers , \u00a9EMEA 2006 10/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 d) Tests: Foreign matter Total Ash Insoluble in hydrochloric acid4 Water soluble extractive4 Extractable matter4 Particle size : For some herbal substances intended for use in herbal teas or solid herbal medicinal products, particle size can have a significant effe ct on dissolution rates, bioavailability, and/or stability. In such instances, testing for particle size distribution should be carried out using an appropriate procedure, and accepta nce criteria should be provided. Particle size can also affect the disintegration time of solid dosage forms. Water content: This test is important when the herbal substances are known to be hygroscopic. For non-pharmacopoeial herbal substan ces, acceptance criteria should be ju stified by data on the effects of moisture absorption. A Loss on Drying proce dure may be adequate; however, in some cases (essential-oil containing plants), a detection pro cedure that is specific for water is required. Contaminants: Inorganic impurities, toxic metals: The need for inclusion of tests and acceptance criteria for inorganic impurities should be studied during deve lopment and based on k nowledge of the plant species, its cultivation and the manufacturing process. Acceptance criteria will ultimately depend on safety considerations. Where justified, pr ocedures and acceptance criteria for sulphated ash/residue on ignition should follow pharmac opoeial precedents; other inorganic impurities may be determined by appropr iate procedures, e.g., atomic absorption spectroscopy. Microbial limits: There may be a need to specify the total count of aerobic micro-organisms, the total count of yeasts and moulds, and the abse nce of specific objectionable bacteria. The source of the herbal material should be taken into account when considering the inclusion of other possible pathogens (e.g. Campylobacter and Listeria species) in addition to those specified in the European Pharmacopoeia. Microbial counts should be determined using pharmacopoeial procedures or other validated procedures. The European Pharmacopoeia gives guidance on acceptance4 criteria. Mycotoxins: The potential for mycotoxins contamina tion should be fully considered. Where necessary suitable validated methods should be us ed to control potential mycotoxins and the acceptance criteria should be justified. Pesticides, Fumigation agents, etc. : The potential for residues of pesticides, fumigation agents etc. should be fully considered. Where necessary suitable validated methods should be used to control potential residues and the acceptance criteria should be justified. In the case of pesticide residues the method, acceptance criteria and gui dance on the methodology of the European Pharmacopoeia should be applied unless fully justified. 5Other appropriate tests4 (e.g. swelling index) e) Assay : In the case of herbal substa nces with constituents of known therapeutic activity or with active markers, assays of their content are required with details of the analytical procedure. Where possible, a specific, stability-indicating procedure should be included to determine the content of 4 These tests might not apply to all herbal substa nces and must be justified by the applicant. 5 These tests might not apply to all herbal subs tances and must be justified by the applicant. CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 11/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 the herbal substance. In cases where use of a non-specific assay is justified, other supporting analytical procedures may be used to achieve overall specificity if required. In the case of herbal substances where the constitu ents responsible for the therapeutic activity are unknown assays of analytical markers or othe r justified determinati ons are required. The appropriateness of the choice of mark ers should be justified. For exam ple, reference to the assay of a marker in the relevant monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia is an appropriate justification. 3.2.2. Herbal preparations Herbal preparations are also diverse in character ranging from simple, commi nuted plant material to extracts, tinctures, oils and resins. A comprehensiv e specification must be de veloped for each herbal preparation based on recent scientific data. The general monograph 'Herbal dr ug preparations' (herbal preparations) of the European Pharmacopoeia should be consulted for the interpretation of the following requirements. The following tests and acceptance criteria are considered generally applicable to all herbal preparations. a) Definition : a statement of the botanical source, and th e type of preparation (e.g. dry or liquid extract). The ratio of the herbal substance to th e genuine herbal preparation must be stated. b) Characters: a qualitative statement about the organoleptic characters of the herbal preparation where characteristic c) Identification : Identification tests should be specific fo r the herbal preparation, and optimally should be discriminatory with rega rd to substitutes/adulterants that are likely to occur. Identification solely by chromatographic retention time, for exampl e, is not regarded as being specific; however, a combination of chromatographic tests (e.g. HPLC and TLC-densitometry) or a combination of tests into a single procedure, such as HPLC/UV-diode array, HPLC/MS, or GC/MS may be acceptable. d) Tests : Water content: This test is important when the herbal preparations are known to be hygroscopic. The acceptance criteria may be justified with data on the effects of hydration or moisture absorption. A Loss on Drying procedure may be ad equate; however, in some cases (essential-oil containing preparations), a detection procedur e that is specific for water is required. Impurities Residual solvents : Refer to the European Pharmacopoeia General text on Residual Solvents for detailed information. Inorganic impurities, toxic metals : The need for inclusion of tests and acceptance criteria for inorganic impurities should be studied during deve lopment and based on k nowledge of the plant species, its cultivation and the manufacturing pro cess. The potential for manufacturing process to concentrate toxic residues should be fully addre ssed. If the manufacturing process will reduce the burden of toxic residues, the te sts with the herbal substance may be sufficient. Acceptance criteria will ultimately depend on safety cons iderations. Where justified, procedures and acceptance criteria for sulphated ash/residue on ignition should follow pharmacopoeial precedents; other inorganic impurities may be determ ined by other appropriate procedures, e.g. atomic absorption spectroscopy. Microbial limits : There may be a need to specify the total count of aerobic micro-organisms, the total count of yeasts and moulds, and the absenc e of specific objectionable bacteria. These limits should comply with those in the European Pharmacopoeia. Mycotoxins : The potential for mycotoxins contamina tion should be fully considered. Where necessary suitable validated methods should be used to control potential mycotoxins and the CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 12/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 acceptance criteria should be justified. Pesticides, Fumigation agents, etc.: The potential for residues of pesticides, fumigation agents etc. should be fully considered. Where necessary suitable validated methods should be used to control potential residues and the acceptance criteria should be justified. In the case of pesticide residues the method, acceptance criteria and gui dance on the methodology of the European Pharmacopoeia should be applied unless fully justified. e) Assay : In the case of herbal preparations with cons tituents of known therapeutic activity or with active markers, assays of their content are required with details of the analytical procedure. Where possible, a specific, stability-indicating procedure should be included to determine the content of the herbal substance in the herbal preparation. In cases where use of a non-specific assay is justified, other supporting analytical procedures may be used to achieve overall specificity, if required. For example, where a UV/VIS spectro photometric assay is used for anthraquinone glycosides, a combination of the assay and a su itable test for identification (e.g. fingerprint chromatography) can be used. In the case of herbal preparations where cons tituents of known therapeutic activity or active markers are not known, assays of analytical marker s or other justified dete rminations are required. The appropriateness of the choice of marker should be justified. 3.2.3. Vitamins and minerals in traditional herbal medicinal products for human use The following tests and acceptance criteria are consid ered generally applicable to traditional herbal medicinal products for human use containing vita mins/minerals as ancillary substances: a) Identification : Identification tests should establish the sp ecific identity of the vitamin(s) and/or mineral(s). b) Assays: Validated assays of vitamins and minerals are required. c) Impurities : Refer to the ICH 'Guideline on impurities in new drug products ' (CPMP/ICH/2738/99) and the European Pharmacopoeia General text on Residual Solvents for detailed information. Impurities arising from degradation of the vitamin(s) or mineral(s) should be m onitored in the traditional herbal medicinal product for human use. When it ha s been demonstrated conclusively by provision of a significant body of data, generated using appropriat e analytical methods, that the vitamin(s) and/or mineral(s) do not degrade in the specific formulation and under the specific storage conditions proposed in the application, degradation product testing may be reduced or elimin ated upon approval by the regulatory authorities. 3.2.4. Herbal medicinal products The following tests and acceptance criteria are consid ered generally applicable to all herbal medicinal products: a) Description : A qualitative description of the dosage form should be provided (e.g., size, shape, colour). The acceptance criteria s hould include the final acceptable appearance at the end of the shelf-life. If colour changes occur during storage, a quantitative procedure may be appropriate. b) Identification : Identification tests should establish the sp ecific identity of the herbal substance(s) and/or herbal preparation(s), in the herbal medi cinal product and optimally should be discriminatory with regard to substitutes/adulterants that are likely to occur Identification solely by chromatographic retention time, for example, is not regarded as being specific; however, a combination of chromatographic tests (e.g. HPLC and TLC-densitometry) or a combination of tests into a single procedure, such as HPLC/UV-diode array, HPLC/MS, or GC/MS may be acceptable. CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 13/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 In the case of herbal medicinal products containi ng powdered or comminuted herbal substances, microscopical and macroscopical characterisation c ould be used for identification in combination with other methods, if justified. c) Assay : In the case of products containing herbal s ubstances and/or herbal preparations with constituents of known therapeutic activity, validated assays of the content of these constituents are required along with details of the analytical pro cedure(s). Where appropriate , a specific, stability- indicating procedure should be incl uded to determine the content of the herbal substance(s) and/or herbal preparation(s) in the herbal medicinal produc t. In cases where use of a non-specific assay is justified, other supporting analytical procedures s hould be used to achieve overall specificity. For example, where a UV/VIS spectrophotometric assay is used e.g. with anthraquinone glycosides a combination of the assay and a suitable test for id entification (e.g. fingerprint chromatography) can be used In the case of herbal medicinal products containing he rbal substance(s) and/or herbal preparation(s) where the constituents with known therapeutic activit y are not known, validated assays of active or analytical markers or other justified determinati ons are required. The choice of such markers should be justified. In cases where a specific assay of each active substance of a herbal medicinal product is not possible other justified determinations are required (for example, in multi-component traditional herbal medicinal products for human use the same markers may be present in more than one herbal substance/preparation). d) Impurities : Refer to the ICH/VICH Guidelines on impurities in new drug products/Gui delines on impurities in new veterinary products (CPMP/ICH/2738/99 a nd CVMP/VICH/838/99 as revised) and the European Pharmacopoeia General text on Resi dual Solvents for detailed information. - Impurities arising from the herbal substance(s) a nd/or herbal preparations e.g. contaminants such as pesticide/fumigant residues, heavy metals , if controlled during the testing of the herbal substance/preparation, it is not necessary to test for these in the herbal medicinal product. - Similarly, residual solvent arising from the ma nufacture of the herbal preparation (e.g. an extract) need not be controlled in the herbal medicinal product provide d it is appropriately controlled in the extract specification. However, solvents used for example in tablet coating will need to be controlled in the dosage form. - In cases where degradation products of the herbal substance/preparation are evident (e.g. aglycones from hydroxyanthracene glycosides), they should be monitored in the herbal medicinal product. Acceptance limits should be stated for such degradation products When it has been demonstrated conclusively by provision of a significant body of data, generated using appropriate analytical methodologies, that th e herbal substance and/or herbal preparation do not degrade in the specific formulation and under the specific storage conditions proposed in the marketing authorisation, degrad ation product testing may be redu ced or eliminated upon approval by the regulatory authorities. e) Microbial limits : There is a need to specify the total count of aerobi c micro-organisms, the total count of yeasts and moulds, and the absence of specific objectionable bacteria. These limits should comply with the European Pharmacopoeia. The frequency of testing should be justified. 3.3. Specific tests/criteria In addition to the universal tests lis ted above, the following tests may be considered applicable to herbal CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 14/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 medicinal products on a case by case basis. Individual tests/criteria should be included in the specification when the tests have an impact on the quality of the herbal medicinal product for batch control. Tests other than those listed below may be needed in particular s ituations or as new information becomes available. 3.3.1. Herbal medicinal products Additional tests and acceptance criteria generally s hould be included for partic ular herbal medicinal products. The following selection presents a representa tive sample of both the herbal medicinal products and the types of tests and acceptance criteria, wh ich may be appropriate. The specific dosage forms addressed include solid oral herbal medicinal pr oducts, and liquid oral he rbal medicinal products. Application of the concepts in this guidel ine to other dosage forms is encouraged. 3.3.1.1. Tablets (coated and uncoated) and hard capsules One or more of these tests may also be a pplicable to soft capsules and granules. a) Dissolution/disintegration : In the case of immediate releas e herbal medicinal products for wh ich constituents with therapeutic activity are not known, the test for in-vitro active substance release can be omitted. For immediate release products containing herbal preparations, which are highly soluble throughout the physiological pH range, disintegration testin g may sometimes be sufficient. Disintegration testing is most appropriate when a relationshi p to dissolution has been established or when disintegration is shown to be more discriminating than dissolution. In such cases dissolution testing may not always be necessary, or may be proposed as a periodic test. It is expected that development information will be provided to support the r obustness of the formulation and manufacturing process with respect to the selection of dissolution vs. disintegration testing. Single-point measurements are nor mally considered to be suitable for immediate-release dosage forms. For modified-release dosage forms, approp riate test conditions and sampling procedures should be established. For example, multiple -time-point sampling should be performed for extended-release dosage forms, and two-stage tes ting (using different media in succession or in parallel, as appropriate) may be appropriate for de layed-release dosage forms. In these cases it is important to consider the populations of individuals or target anim al species who will be taking the herbal medicinal product (e.g., achlorhydric, elde rly) when designing the tests and acceptance criteria. Where multiple-point acceptance criteria are necessary, in vitro/in vivo correlation may be used to establish these criteria when human or target anim al species bioavailability data are available for formulations exhibiting different re lease rates. Where such data are not available, and drug release cannot be shown to be in dependent of in vitro test conditions, then acceptance criteria must be established on the basis of availa ble batch data. Normally, the permitted variability in release rate at any given time point should not exceed a total numeri cal difference of \u00b110% of the labelled content of herbal substance or herbal preparation (i .e., a total variability of 20%: a requirement of 50%\u00b110% thus means an acceptable range from 40% to 60%), unless a wider range is supported by a bioequivalence study. b) Hardness/friability : It is normally appropriate to perform ha rdness and/or friability testing as an in- process control. Under these circumstances, it is nor mally not necessary to include these attributes in the specification. If the characteristics of hardne ss and friability have a critical impact on herbal medicinal product quality (e.g., chewable tablets) , acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 15/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 c) Uniformity of dosage units : This term includes both uniformity of content and uniformity of mass; a pharmacopoeial procedure should be used. If appropriate, these tests may be performed as in- process controls; the acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. d) Water content : A test for water content should be in cluded when appropriate. The acceptance criteria may be justified with data on the effect s of or water absorption on the herbal medicinal product. In some cases, a Loss on Drying proced ure may be adequate; however, a detection procedure which is specific for water (e.g., Karl Fischer titration) is required. e) Microbial limits : Microbial limit testing is seen as an a ttribute of Good Manufacturing Practice, as well as of quality assurance. It is advisable to test the herbal medicinal product unless its components are tested before manufacture and the manufacturing process is known, through validation studies, not to carry a significant risk of microbial contamination. Reference should be made to the European Pharmacopoeia gene ral text on the Microbiological Quality of Pharmaceutical Preparations for guidance on acceptabl e limits. Periodic testing may be appropriate. Where appropriate, acceptance criteria should be set for the total count of aerobic micro-organisms, the total count of yeasts and moulds, and the ab sence of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Escheric hia coli, Salmonella, Pseudomonas ). Counts should be determined using pharmacopoeial or other validated procedures , and at a sampling frequency or time point in manufacture which is justified by data and experien ce. With acceptable scientific justification, it may be possible to omit microbial limit testing for solid oral dosage forms. 3.3.1.2. Oral liquids One or more of the following specific tests will no rmally be applicable to oral liquids and to powders intended for reconstitution as oral liquids. a) Uniformity of dosage units : This term includes both uniformity of content and uniformity of mass. Generally, acceptance criteria should be set for wei ght variation, fill volume, and/or uniformity of fill. Pharmacopoeial proce dures should be used. If appropriate, tests may be performed as in-p rocess controls; however, the acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. This c oncept may be applied to both single-dose and multiple-dose packages. The dosage unit is considered to be the typical dos e taken by the patient. If the actual unit dose, as taken by the patient, is controlled, it may either be measured directly or calculated, based on the total measured weight or volume of drug, divi ded by the total number of doses expected. If dispensing equipment (such as medicine droppers or dropper tips for bottles) is an integral part of the packaging, this equipment should be used to measure the dose. Otherwise, a standard volume measure should be used. The dispensing equipmen t to be used is normally determined during development. For powders for reconstitution, uniformity of mass testing is generally considered acceptable. b) pH : Acceptance criteria for pH should be provide d where applicable and the proposed range justified. c) Microbial limits : Microbial limit testing is seen as an a ttribute of Good Manufacturing Practice, as well as of quality assurance. It is advisable to test the herbal medicinal product unless its components are tested before manufacture and the manufacturing process is known, through validation studies, not to carry a significant risk of microbial contamination. Reference should be made to the European Pharmacopoeia gene ral text on the Microbiological Quality of Pharmaceutical Preparations for guidance on accept able limits. Periodic testing may be appropriate. With acceptable scientific justification, it may be possible to omit microbial limit testing for CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 16/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 powders intended for reconstitution as oral liquids. Where appropriate, acceptance criteria should be set for the total count of aerobic micro-organisms, total count of yeasts and moulds, and the abse nce of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Escheric hia coli, Salmonella, Pseudomonas ). Counts should be determined by pharmacopoeial or other validated procedures , and at a sampling frequency or time point in manufacture which is justified by data and experience. d) Antimicrobial preservative content : For oral liquids needing an antimicrobial preservative, acceptance criteria for preservative content must be stated. These criteria should be based on the levels necessary to maintain microbiological product quality throughout the shelf life. The lowest specified concentration of antimicrobial preserva tive should be demonstrated to be effective in controlling micro-organisms by using the Europ ean Pharmacopoeia antim icrobial test. Release testing for antimicrobial preservative c ontent should normally be performed. Under certain circumstances, in-process testing may suffice in lieu of release testing. When antimicrobial preservative content testing is pe rformed as an in-process test, th e acceptance criteria should remain part of the specification. Antimicrobial preservative effectiveness should be demonstrated during development, during scale- up, and throughout the shelf-life (e.g., in stability testing: see the 'Note for guidance on stability testing of existing active substa nces and related finished prod ucts' (CPMP/QWP/122/02 rev. 1 and EMEA/CVMP/846/99); 'Note for guidance on in-use stability testing of human medicinal products' (CPMP/QWP/2934/99); 'Note for guidance on in-use stability testing of veterinary medicinal products (excluding immunological veterinary medicinal products) (EMEA/CVMP/424/01)), although chemical testing for preservative cont ent is the attribute normally included in the specification. e) Antioxidant preservative content : Release testing for antioxidant content should normally be performed. Under certain circumstances, where jus tified by developmental and stability data, shelf life testing may be unnecessary, and in-process testi ng may suffice in lieu of release testing. When antioxidant content testing is performed as an in -process test, the acceptance criteria should remain part of the specification. If only release testing is performed, this decision should be reinvestigated whenever either the manufacturing procedure or the container/closure system changes. f) Extractables : Generally, where development and stabilit y data show no significant evidence of extractables from the container/closure system, elim ination of this test may be proposed. This should be reinvestigated if the cont ainer/closure system changes. Where data demonstrate the need, tests and accepta nce criteria for extractables from the container- closure system components (e.g., rubber stopper, cap liner, plastic bottle, etc.) are considered appropriate for oral solutions packaged in non-gla ss systems, or in glass containers with non-glass closures. The container/closure components shoul d be listed, and data collected for these components as early in the development process as possible. g) Alcohol content : Where it is declared quantitatively on the label in accord ance with pertinent regulations, the alcohol content should be specified. h) Dissolution : In addition to the attributes recommended immediately above, it may be appropriate (e.g. where constituents of the herbal substance or herbal preparation are sparingly soluble) to include dissolution testing and acceptance criteria fo r oral suspensions and dry powder products for resuspension. The testing apparatus, media, and conditions should be pharmacopoeial, if possible, or otherwise justified. Dissolution procedures using either pharmacopoeia l or non-pharmacopoeial apparatus and conditions should be validated. CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 17/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 Single-point measurements are normally considered suitable for immediate-release dosage forms. Multiple-point sampling, at appropriate intervals, should be performed for modified-release dosage forms. Acceptance criteria should be set based on the observed range of variation, and should take into account the dissolution profiles of the batche s that showed acceptable performance in vivo. Developmental data should be c onsidered when determining the need for either a dissolution procedure or a particle size distribution procedure. Dissolution testing may be performed as an in-pro cess test, or as a release test, depending on its relevance to product performance. The discussi on of dissolution for solid oral dosage forms (above), and of particle size distribution (immediat ely following), should also be considered here. i) Particle size distribution : Quantitative acceptance criteria and a procedure for determination of particle size distribution may be appropriate for oral suspensions. Developmental data should be considered when determining the need for eith er a dissolution procedure or a particle size distribution procedure for these formulations. Particle size distribution testing may be performed as an in-process test or as a release test, depending on its relevance to product performance. If these produc ts have been demonstrated during development to have consiste ntly rapid drug release characteri stics, exclusion of a particle size distribution test from the specification may be proposed. Particle size distribution testing may also be pro posed in place of dissolution testing; justification should be provided. The acceptance criteria should in clude acceptable particle size distribution in terms of the percent of total particles in given size ranges. The mean, upper, and/or lower particle size limits should be well defined. Acceptance criteria should be set based on the obser ved range of variation, and should take into account the dissolution profiles of the batches that showed acceptable performance in vivo, as well as the intended use of the product. The potential for particle growth shoul d be investigated during product development; the acceptance criteria should ta ke the results of these studies into account. j) Redispersibility : For oral suspensions, which settle on storage (produce sediment) acceptance criteria for redispersibility may be appropriate. Sh aking may be an appropriate test. The procedure (mechanical or manual) should be indicated. Time required to achieve resuspension by the indicated procedure should be clearly define d. Data generated during product development may be sufficient to justify skip lot testing, or elimination of this attribute from the specification. k) Rheological properties : For relatively viscous solutions or suspensions, it may be appropriate to include rheological properties (viscosity) in th e specification. The test and acceptance criteria should be stated. Data generated during product development may be sufficient to justify skip lot testing, or elimination of this attribute from the specification. l) Specific gravity : For oral suspensions, or relatively visc ous or non-aqueous solutions, acceptance criteria for specific gravity may be appropriate. Tes ting may be performed as an in-process control. m) Reconstitution time : Acceptance criteria for reconstitution tim e should be provided for dry powder products, which require reconstituti on. The choice of diluent should be justified. Data generated during product development may be sufficient to ju stify skip lot testing or elimination of this attribute from the specification. n) Water content : For oral products requiring reconstitution, a test and acceptance criterion for water content should be proposed when appropriate. Loss on drying is generally considered sufficient if the effect of absorbed moisture vs. water of hydr ation has been adequately characterised during the development of the product. In cer tain cases (e.g. essential-oil containing preparations) a more specific procedure (e.g., Karl Fischer titration) is required. CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 18/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 3.3.1.3 Herbal Medicinal Products containing exclusively herbal substances (e.g. herbal teas) One or more of these tests may be applicable to he rbal medicinal products containing exclusively herbal substances. a) Loss on drying : To be specified depending on the plant parts present in the herbal medicinal product, if not performed on the herbal substance. b) Identification : Identification tests (e.g. chromatogra phic methods) must establish the specific identity of the herbal substance(s) in the he rbal medicinal product and optimally should be discriminatory between the different herbal substa nces and with regards to substitutes/adulterants that are likely to occur. Microscopical and macr oscopical characterisation can be used to support identification, if justified. c) Purity : Relevant adulterants and subs titutes should be determined (e.g. when toxic adulterants or substitutes are known). d) Uniformity of mass/Average mass of the sachet (e.g. herbal tea): Generally, acceptance criteria should be set for weight variati on and/or fill volume. Pharmacopoeia l procedures should be used. If appropriate, tests may be performed as in-pro cess controls; however, the acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. This con cept may be applied to both single-dose and multi- dose products. The dosage unit is considered to be the typical dos e taken by the patient. If the actual unit dose, as taken by the patient, is controlled, it may either be measured directly or calculated, based on the total measured weight or volume of herbal s ubstance, divided by the total number of doses expected. If dispensing equipment is an integral pa rt of the packaging, this equipment should be used to measure the dose. Otherwise, a standard volume measure should be used. The dispensing equipment to be used is normally determined during development. e) Assay : In the case of such herbal medicinal products containing herbal substa nces with constituents of known therapeutic activity, validated assays for these constituents are required along with details of the analytical procedure(s). Where possible, a specific, stability-indicating procedure should be included to determine the content of the herbal s ubstance(s) in the herbal medicinal product. In cases where use of a non-specific assay is justifie d, other supporting analytical procedures should be used to achieve overall specificity. (e.g., a UV/VIS spectrophotometric assay for anthraquinone glycosides in combination with fingerprint chro matography for identification). In the case of products containing herbal substance(s) where th e constituents with known therapeutic activity are not known, assays of active or analytical markers or other justified determin ations are required. The choice of such markers should be justified. For herbal medicinal products c onsisting of one herbal substance without any excipients, the assay can be included in the specification of the herbal substance, if justified. Finally, in cases of multi-component herbal medi cinal products where an assay of each herbal substance is not possible, the applicant must jus tify how reproducibility of the finished product is guaranteed and tested. f) Particle size : A suitable specification has to be given by the manufacturer. g) Microbial quality : Microbial limit testing is seen as an attribute of Good Manufacturing Practice, as well as of quality assurance. It is advisabl e to test the herbal medicinal product unless its components are tested before manufacture a nd the manufacturing process is known, through validation studies, not to carry a significant risk of microbial contamina tion. Reference should be CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 19/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 made to the European Pharmacopoeia genera l text on the Microbiological Quality of Pharmaceutical Preparations for guidance on acceptable limits. Periodic testing may be appropriate. Where appropriate, acceptance criteri a should be set for the total count of aerobic microorganisms, the total count of yeasts and m oulds, and the absence of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Escheric hia coli, Salmonella, Pseudomonas ). Counts should be determined using pha rmacopoeial or other validated proce dures, and at a sampling frequency or time point in manufacture which is justified by data and experience . CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 20/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 4. DEFINITIONS Acceptance criteria: Numerical limits, ranges, or other suitable measures for acceptance of the results of analytical procedures. Constituents with known therapeutic activity: are chemically defined substances or groups of substances which are generally accepted to contribute s ubstantially to the therapeu tic activity of a herbal substance, a herbal preparation or a herbal medicinal product. Degradation product: Any impurity resulting from a chemical change in the composition of the active substance brought about during manufacture and/or stor age of the active substance/ medicinal product by the effect of, e.g. light, temperature, pH, water, or by reaction with an excipient and/or the immediate container closure system. Due to the particular na ture of herbals, for herbal substances/ herbal preparations/ herbal ts in general only toxicologically relevant degrada tion products must be specified. Drug extract ratio (DER): means the ratio between the quantity of herbal substance used in the manufacture of a herbal preparation and the quantity of herbal preparation obtained. The number (given as the actual range) written before the colon is the rela tive quantity of the herbal substance; the number written after the colon is the relative quantit y of the herbal preparation obtained. Extraction solvents: are solvents which are used for the extraction process. Genuine (Native) herbal preparation: refers to the preparation without excipients, even if for technological reasons the genuine herbal preparation is not available. However, for soft and liquid herbal preparations the genuine herbal preparation may c ontain variable amounts of (extraction) solvent. Ratio of herbal substance to genuine herbal preparation (DER genuine): is the ratio of the mass of the herbal substance to the quantity of the resulting genui ne herbal preparation. The number (given as the actual range) written before the colon is the relative qua ntity of the herbal substance; the number written after the colon is the relative quantity of the herbal preparation obtained. Herbal medicinal products: any medicinal product, exclusively c ontaining as active substances one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more such herbal substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations. Herbal preparations: are obtained by subjecting he rbal substances to treatments such as extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purification, concentration or fermentation. These include comminuted or powdered herbal substances, tinctures , extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudates. Herbal substances: all mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichen in an unprocessed, usually dried form but sometimes fresh. Ce rtain exudates that have not been subjected to a specific treatment are also considered to be herbal s ubstances. Herbal substances are precisely defined by the plant part used and the botanical name according to the binomial system (genus, species, variety and author). Herbal teas: consist exclusively of one or more herb al substance(s) intended for oral aqueous preparations by means of decoction, infusion or m aceration. The preparation is prepared immediately before use. Herbal teas are usually s upplied in bulk form or in sachets. Impurity: (1) Any component of the herbal substance wh ich is not the entity defined as the herbal substance. (2) Any component of the herbal prepara tion/herbal medicinal product that is not the entity defined as the herbal substance/ preparation or an excipient in the herbal preparation/herbal medicinal product. CPMP/QWP/2820/00 Rev 1 \u00a9EMEA 2006 21/21 EMEA/CVMP/815/00 Rev 1 Markers: are chemically defined constituen ts or groups of constituents of a herbal substance, a herbal preparation or a herbal medicinal product which ar e of interest for control purposes independent of whether they have any therapeutic or pharmacological activity. Markers serve to calculate the quantity of herbal substance(s) or herbal preparation(s) in the Herbal Medicinal Product if the marker has been quantitatively determined in the herbal substance or herbal preparation. There are two categories of markers: Active markers are constituents or groups of constituents which are generally accepted to contribute to the therapeutic activity. Analytical markers are constituents or groups of constituents that serve fo r analytical purposes. Quantification: means adjusting the herbal preparation to a defined range of constituents exclusively achieved by blending different batches of herbal subs tances and/or herbal preparations (e.g. quantified extract). Solvent: An inorganic or an organic liquid used for the preparation of solutions or suspensions in the manufacture of a herbal preparation or the manufacture of a herbal medicinal product. Specification: A list of tests, references to analytical procedures, and appropriate acceptance criteria which are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described. It establishes the set of criteria to which a herbal substance/preparation or herbal medicinal product should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. \"Conformance to specifications\" means that the herbal substance/preparation and/or herbal medicinal product, when tested according to the listed analytical procedures, will meet the listed acceptance criteria. Specifications are binding quality standards that are agreed to between the appropriate governmental regulatory agency and the applicant. Specific test: A test which is considered to be applicab le to a particular herbal substance/preparation or a particular herbal medicinal pr oduct depending on their specific pr operties and/or intended use. Standardisation: means adjusting the herbal s ubstance/preparation to a defi ned contents of a constituent or a group of constituents with known therapeutic activ ity respectively either by adding excipients or by blending batches of the herbal substance and/or herbal prepara tion (e.g. standardised extracts Traditional herbal medicinal products: are medicinal products for human use that fulfil the conditions laid down in article 16a (1) of Di rective 2001/83/EC, as amended. Unidentified impurity: An impurity which is defined solely by qualitative analytical properties, (e.g., chromatographic retention time). Universal test: A test which is considered to be potentially applicable to all herbal substances/preparations, or all herb al medicinal products; e.g., appearance, identification, assay, and impurity tests.
