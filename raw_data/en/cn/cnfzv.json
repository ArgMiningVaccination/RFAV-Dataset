LITOVITZ, MD, SVEN A. NORMANN, PharmD, JOSEPH C. VELTRI, PharmD In 1983, the American Association of Poison Con- trol Centers (AAPCC) piloted a project to collect epi- demiological data on poison exposures reported to poison centers nationwide.' Sixteen participating poison centers reported 25 1,012 human poison expo- sures during that year. Forty-seven centers partici- pated in the National Data Collection System in 1984, reporting 730,224 human poison exposures.2 The data presented herein reflect 900,513 human poison expo- sures reported in 1985 to 56 participating poison centers. CHARACTERIZATION OF PARTICIPATING CENTERS Of the 56 poison centers that participated in the 1985 AAPCC National Data Collection System, five submitted data for only a portion of the year. Twenty of the 56 centers were certified as regional poison control centers by AAPCC during the data collection interval. Annual center call volumes (human poison exposure cases only) ranged from 1,066 to 55,547 (mean 16,616).

A total population of 113.6 million was served by the participating centers including portions of 35 states and the District of Columbia (Fig. 1). Noting the 238.7 million estimated United States population during 1985, the data presented represent an estimated 47.6% of the human poison exposures reported to poison control centers in the United States each year. Thus, the 900,513 human poison exposures reported in this database can be extrapolated to predict a na- tionwide incidence of human poison exposures in ex- TABLE 1.

Extrapolations from the frequency of reported poisonings to the frequency of actual poi- sonings occurring annually in the United States cannot be made from these data alone, as considerable variations in poison center penetrance were noted. In- deed, assuming all centers reached the penetrance level of 20.2 poisonings/l,000 population reported by one center, then 4.8 million poisoning would have been reported to poison control centers in 1985. Be- cause of the growth and development of this relatively new data collection project, with variable (increasing) center participation from year to year, the data do not directly identify a trend in the overall incidence of poisonings in the United States. However, an analysis of data from 40 centers that participated for the en- tirety of 1984 and 1985 indicates a 10.9% increase in reported poison exposures from 1984 to 1985 within the regions served by these 40 centers. REVIEW OF THE DATA The 900,513 human poison exposures reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) National Data Collection System in 1985 represent the largest poison exposure database ever compiled in the United States.

Two unlikely sites of poisonings, health care facilities and schools, accounted for 4,842 and 7,264 poison exposures respectively. Poison center peak call volumes were noted from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, although call frequency remained consis- tently high between 9:00 AM and 10:00 PM, with 83.1% of calls logged during this 13-hour period. The age and sex distribution of human poison expo- sure victims is outlined in Table 2. One- and two-year- old children together constituted 39.1% of reported cases, and 63.4% of cases involved children under six years of age. A male predominance is found among children less than 13 years old, but the gender distri- bution is reversed in teenagers and adults. A single substance was implicated in 93.3% of re- ports, and only 1.3% of patients were exposed to more than two possibly poisonous drugs or products (Table 3). Most cases of human exposure were acute (98.5%), as were most poison-related fatalities (94.8%). (Chronic exposures were arbitrarily defined as repeated exposures to the same toxic substance or a single exposure lasting longer than eight hours.) The vast majority (89.9%) of poison exposures were accidental; suicidal intent was present in 5.1% of cases (Table 4). Whereas accidental poisonings out- numbered both intentional poisonings and adverse re- actions in all age groups (Table 5), the ratio was lower in teenage and adult cases. In contrast, of the 328 human poisoning fatalities reported, this ratio was re- (Text continues on page 439.) TABLE 4.

Ingestions accounted for 79.2% of poison exposures (Table 7), followed in frequency by dermal exposure, ophthalmic exposure, inhalation, bites and stings, and parenteral exposure. The 328 fatalities included 250 ingestions (76.2%), 37 (O.O%), and seven unknown exposure routes (2.1%). In addition, 11 victims (3.4%) had multiple exposure routes. Table 8 displays the symptom assessment at the time of the initial call to the participating poison center. In addition to the 24.9% of patients with symptoms clearly related to the exposure, symptoms developed during the subsequent course in 19,173 ini- tially asymptomatic patients. Thus, symptoms deli- nitely related to the exposure eventually developed in 27.0% of patients. The majority of cases reported to poison centers were managed in a non-health care facility (74.9%), usually at the site of exposure, the patient's own home (Table 9). Treatment in a health care facility was ren- dered or recommended in 22.1% of all cases, and of these 51.7% involved treatment and release, 17.2% in- volved admission for medical treatment, and 2.2% involved admission for psychiatric care; 9.0% re- fused referral, and 19.8% were lost to follow-up.

LITOVITZ ET AL W 1985 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORT older age groups. Table 11 compares medical outcome and reason for exposure, demonstrating the greater in- volvement of intentional exposures in cases with a major effect or fatality. Table 12 outlines the use of initial decontamination procedures, specific antidotes, and measures to en- hance elimination in the treatment of patients reported in this database. These must be interpreted as min- imum frequencies of use because of the limitations of telephone data gathering. Ipecac syrup was adminis- tered in 15.0% of cases. In children, ipecac syrup was most often administered outside a health care facility (Table 13). A summary of the 328 fatal exposures is presented in Table 14. Each of these cases was abstracted and/or verified by the reporting center. Only fatalities deemed to be \"probably\" or \"undoubtedly\" related to the exposure are included. Confirmation of the cause of death by a post-mortem report was obtained in 36% of cases. A review of the fatality data demon- strates frequent deaths from antidepressant drugs, an- algesics, street drugs, sedative hypnotics, and carbon monoxide. Where many substances were implicated in a single case, an effort was made to list substances in roughly the order they were felt to have contributed to the death. That determination, however, could not always be made. Abstracts are provided for selected cases at the end of this report (see Appendix). Tables 15 and 16 provide comprehensive demo- graphic data on patient age, reason for exposure, med- ical outcome, and use of a health care facility for all 900,513 human exposures presented by category. Table 15 focuses on non-pharmaceuticals; Table 16 fo- cuses on drugs. The categories most frequently impli- cated in poison exposures were cleaning plants (75,005) and cos- metics (52,020). Exposure frequencies often represent only market shares of products or home availability and should not be interpreted as toxicity data. In- stead, the medical outcome data, especially the fa- tality rate, should be used for this purpose. For ex- ample, plants were the third most common category of implicated substances, but only two fatalities were documented in this group. Also of note, a nearly two- fold increase in deaths from street drugs and stimu- lants occurred as compared with 1984, including 18 cocaine fatalities. Interestingly, although there were more fatalities from aspirin ingested alone than from acetaminophen alone, the mean age of the acetaminophen fatalities was 36.5 years compared with 63 years among the aspirin deaths. No children were involved in either group. One wonders whether this reflects relatively greater aspirin utilization among the elderly, or only the influence of prior cardiovascular disease on aspirin overdose survival. References 1.

Appendix: Abstracts of Fatal Poisoning Cases Case 1. A 2-year-old girl ingested up to 4 ounces of eth- anol (tequila) at an unknown time. Child had a cardiopulmo- nary arrest in the emergency department (ED) and was resus- citated. Initial blood ethanol concentration was 263 mg/dl, then was 208 mg/dl four hours later. Results of other toxico- logical analysis were negative. Admission glucose level was 1,269 mg/dl. Pupils were fixed and dilated, and the patient remained on a ventilator. The patient died approximately 20 hours after presentation. Case 2. A 2-year-old boy was found in respiratory arrest with open bottles of isopropyl alcohol and finger nail polish remover. Cardiac arrest was also noted when the ambulance arrived. Cardiorespiratory resuscitation was successful, but pupils remained fixed and dilated. re- mg/dl; blood less than 5 mgldl. Chest radiographs showed left atelectasis. The child was pronounced brain-dead. Case 7. A 35year-old man reportedly ingested 10 diphen- hydramine (50 mg) capsules. He was hospitalized in a psy- chiatric ward. Approximately 11 hours later, the patient was found convulsing. and he then sustained a respiratory ar- rest. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he was comatose, intubated, placed on a ventilator and given sodium bicarbonate and dopamine. Toxicological analysis revealed a methanol level of 94.8 mg/dl (14 hours after admission). Ethanol therapy was then started via naso- gastric tube. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were started 21 hours after admission to hospital. The patient re- mained comatose with fixed, dilated pupils and died on the fourth hospital day. Post-mortem examination confirmed diagnosis of methanol poisoning. Case 11. A 59-year-old man was found comatose on the street and brought to the ED following a possible ingestion of one glassful of antifreeze (ethylene glycol) at an unknown time. Prior suicide attempts were also reported. Upon initial presentation, the patient was unresponsive to all stimuli, blood pressure was 90/O mm Hg, pulse was 60/min, and res- Initial Ethylene glycol levels were not available. Treatment included ethanol therapy for several days and hemodialysis. Acidosis persisted despite massive doses of sodium bicarbonate. Seizures developed and were treated with diazepam and phenytoin. On the seventh hos- pital day, a computerized tomography scan structures symmetrically with cortical edema.\" The patient remained in ICU on daily dialysis as his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine continued to climb, reaching 451 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE W Volume 4.

The patient was initially intubated and re- mained on a ventilator until day 6, at which time he was weaned from the ventilator. The patient had repeated bouts of sepsis, emanating either from the upper respiratory tract or urinary tract, with no change in renal status. The patient died on the 26th hospital day. Case 12. A 77-year-old woman became confused and drank ethylene glycol antifreeze instead of lemonade. She was found comatose at home and taken to a local ED 12 hours after the ingestion. Toxicological analysis results were negative except for ethylene glycol, and the urine was nega- tive for crystals (but positive for erythrocytes). The patient was started on intravenous (IV) ethanol and dialysis. Initial ethylene glycol level was 355 mg/l. Pre-dialysis level was 210 mg/l and dropped to ~25 mg/l over four hours. Patient devel- oped acidosis and decreasing urinary output. Hemodialysis was resumed the next day. She remained acidotic with pH values of 7.22 to 7.26 despite treatment with sodium bicar- bonate. The patient remained unresponsive, hypotensive, anuric, and on a ventilator until she died on the third hos- pital day. An autopsy confirmed ethylene glycol poisoning. Case 15. A 24-year-old man ingested an unknown quan- tity of an alkaline cyanide reagent obtained from his place of employment. He presented to an ED approximately 30 minutes after the exposure with a burn on one lip and my- driasis, but no respiratory distress. Within 10 minutes of ar- rival he experienced a respiratory arrest and became aci- dotic. Since a cyanide antidote kit was not available in that emergency department, amyl nitrite was administered and the patient was transported to another facility. He died en route. Case 17. A 29-year-old man was found unresponsive and asystolic. A suicide note and small unlabeled vial of white powder were found with the patient. The time and route of the exposure were unknown. He was treated with epineph- rine, sodium bicarbonate, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and intubation, then transported to an ED, where he required defibrillation. The patient sustained multiple car- diac arrests. The toxicology laboratory eventually identified the white powder as 91% potassium cyanide and 5% potas- sium hydroxide. Blood cyanide level was 250 pg/dl, thiocyanate level was 12 pg/ml (time after exposure unknown). Ten grams sodium thiosul- fate were then given without effect, and the patient died on the second hospital day. Case 20. A 33-year-old man ingested ethylene glycol (un- determined amount and time). The patient presented to the ED hyperglycemic (600 mg/dl) and in metabolic acidosis (PH 7.00). Toxicological analysis revealed an ethylene glycol level of 38 mg/dl. Therapy included oral ethanol and hemodialysis. His blood glucose was difficult to control, frequently exceeding 400-500 mg/dl. No oxalate crystals were present in numerous urinalyses. The patient remained comatose during the entire admission, developed severe renal failure, and died eight days after admission. Case 25. A 33-year-old man ingested an unknown quan- tity of sodium azide less than an hour before admission and was hypotensive (90150 mm Hg) with a heart rate of 120/min and respirations of 40/min. He was hypertonic, diaphoretic, and salivating. An hour after arrival at the hospital, the pa- 452 tient was comatose with a metabolic acidosis (pH 7.1) and dilated pupils. He was intubated but breathing spontane- ously. Six after ingestion, junctional rhythmn disturbances, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations developed. Blood pressure was 66 mm Hg (systolic). Treatment included gastric lavage, 300 mg sodium nitrite IV. lidocaine, and dopamine. The patient died ten hours after ingestion. Case 26. A 35-year-old man ingested sodium azide (unde- termined amount and time). Patient was lethargic and disor- iented with severe acidosis unresponsive to approximately 45 amps of sodium bicarbonate. and hypotensive despite ag- gressive pressor therapy. The patient died in cardiogenic shock. Case 27. A 38year-old man ingested 2 tablespoons of so- dium azide one hour before admission. The patient began experiencing seizures in the ambulance. Upon arrival in the ED, he was comatose and in severe respiratory distress with ventricular fibrillation and heart block. Gastric lavage was performed. Severe hypotension was unresponsive to dopa- mine. Naloxone was given with no response. The patient died 90 minutes after ingestion from cardiac arrest. Case 28. A 46year-old man presented with 95% total body surface area burns after falling into a heated vat (195\" F) of 5% sodium hydroxide at work. Despite standard burn therapy, the patient died 13 days after admission because of renal and cardiac failure and septicemia. Case 29. An 86-year-old woman presented with vomiting and diarrhea an hour after ingesting five grams of sodium silicofluoride, mistaking it for sugar. Serum calcium shortly after arrival was 5.0 mEq/l. Initial treatment included intra- venous fluids and calcium. Upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding developed but resolved spontaneously (hemat- ocrit 46%). Initial ECG showed sinus rhythm with non-spe- cific ST and T wave changes, but QT prolongation devel- oped with episodes of polymorphous ventricular tachy- cardia. Four hours after ingestion, cardiac arrest occurred (a few seconds after rigid laryngoscopy was performed). Serum calcium fell to 4.2 mEq/l, then rose to 12.6 mEq/l after treatment. Lengthy resuscitative attempts were unsuc- cessful, and the patient was pronounced dead six hours after the ingestion. Post-mortem examination revealed hemor- rhage of the gastric mucosa and perirenal soft levels were: blood. 0.3 kidney. mg/dl; 0.7 mg/dl; gastric, 38.0 mg/dl. Case 31. A 15-year-old woman was found by paramedics with two bottles of white crystals, one labeled sodium ni- trite, the other sodium benzoate. Patient was in cardiopulmo- nary arrest with fixed and dilated pupils. Initial carboxyhemoglobin level was 22% and methemoglobin level 72.6%. Case 32. A 29-year-old woman presented after ingestion of sodium hydroxide drain cleaner crystals with severe ne- crosis of mouth and pharynx and bleeding ulceration of mouth. Endoscopy showed black eschar from pharynx to duodenum with tracheal involvement. Total gastrectomy and feeding jejunostomy were performed. The course was complicated by bleeding and possible ARDS. which im- proved by the 7th hospital day. Two days later she devel- LITOVITZ ET AL n 1985 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORT oped pneumonia. The patient died on the 13th hospital day from presumed aortic rupture. Case 34. A 24-year-old man who ingested approximately 3'/4 cup of Iye and slashed his wrists and neck presented in hypovolemic shock with bloody emesis, lip burns, and ab- dominal pain. He developed respiratory complications and was placed on a ventilator for approximately ten days. Bums were evident throughout the GI tract, necessitating gastrectomy, duodenectomy, proximal jejunectomy, and treated with sTe- roids, antibiotics, and hyperalimentation. He developed a ruptured aorta and renal failure and died 30 days after the exposure. Case 35. A 45-year-old man, owner/operator of a dry cleaning business, was found unconscious on the floor in a 40 gallon perchloroethylene spill. Initial care was compli- cated by hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia. Re- suscitation including rewarming successfully restored his cardiovascular status, but the patient never regained con- sciousness and was pronounced brain-dead. Case 36. A 29-year-old man accidently ingested a hydro- fluoric acid containing rust remover that he mistook for water. Approximately 40 minutes later the patient was to- tally unresponsive, cyanotic, and asystolic. Resuscitation was unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead 90 minutes after the ingestion. Laboratory results available later included: calcium, 3.1 mg/dl; bicarbonate, 12 mEq/l; and plasma fluoride, 35.2 mg/l (normal less than 0.1 mg/l). Case 40. A 65-year-old woman patient with a known his- tory of yellow dye allergy was in anaphylactic shock and seizing uncontrollably after having eaten orange crackers two hours before. The patient received diphenhydramine, epinephrine, and aminophylline. The patient died approxi- mately 72 hours after ingestion. Two years before this inci- dent, the patient had experienced cardiopulmonary arrest from a similar exposure. Cases 44-45. Two 20-year-old adults fell asleep in the back of a camper pickup truck where a propane space heater was used to keep them warm. A third adult was driving the truck and drove all night before stopping in the morning at a restawant. The victims were found in cardio- pulmonary arrest, one in asystole, the other in an idioven- tricular rhythm. Both were hypothermrc (35-35.5\" C) and failed to respond to resuscitation. Case 49, A 37-year-old man was found dead in his resi- dence, and later a carbon monoxide leak was found in the furnace. The victim's carboxyhemoglobin level was 66.7%. Three other family members with depressed mental status were also found in the home, but they survived. Case 68. A 32-year-old woman ingested 8 ounces of a ro- den&de (arsenic trioxide) one hour before admission. The patient had severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg. Initial treatment included gastric lavage and activated charcoal followed by dimercaprol. Her condition continued to deteriorate requiring mechanical ventilation and dopamine and levarterenol to maintain blood pressure. The patient died on the fifth hospital day. Case 69. A 40-year-old man was discovered near a roden- ticide (arsenic trioxide 1.5%) in an unresponsive state (unde- termined amount and time of ingestion). He was transported to a medical facility and upon arrival was found to have no vital signs. Resuscitation and gastric decontamination ef- forts were unsuccessful. Autopsy verified the presence of arsenic and pathological changes consistent with arsenic poisoning. Case 70. A 40-year-old male gardener inadvertently drank an unknown, foul tasting liquid from a beverage container while on the job. He was admitted with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Ten days after the incident, accidental inges- tion of paraquat was suspected. Supportive treatment was insufficient to sustain the patient as respiratory status wors- ened. The patient died 45 days after exposure. The medical examiner's report attributed death to pulmonary fibrosis secondary to paraquat poisoning. Case 71. A 39-year-old man presented to an ED with dyspnea and abdominal pain 3.5 hours after drinking one pint of paraquat. His abdomen was distended, and he had dark urine and polyuria. Laboratory results included: pH, 7.23; PO*, 2.3 n&d!; potassium, 2.7 mEql1; osmolal gap, 38. The patient was hyperventilating and gagging on arrival.. Pulse was 12Olmin with 80 PVCs/min and hyperten- sion. Ipecac was given, and supplemental oxygen was with- held. Vomiting and diarrhea developed 11.5 hours after ad- mission. Ethanol infusion was given. Several hours later, the patient became hypoxic; ventricular fibrillation devel- oped, and resuscitative efforts were unsuccessful. Case 72. A 16-year-old man presented in coma and in car- diac arrest after sniffing freon with friends. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. Post-mortem report demonstrated pulmo- nary congestion. Case 75. A lZmonth-old girl presented to the ED coma- tose, dusky, and with bilateral rales 90 minutes after in- gesting an unknown quantity of lamp oil (100% kerosene). Initial blood gases and chest radiograph showed respiratory acidosis secondary to hypoventilation and respiratory dis- tress syndrome. Gastric lavage yielded a large amount of oily material smelling of kerosene. The patient was main- tained on a ventilator with aminophylline and antibiotics for 27 days. High volumes of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were delivered causing a right pneumothorax, cor- rected by the placement of a chest tube. Laboratory tests revealed high liver enzyme values throughout her hospital- ization. The patient died on the 27th day. Case 76. An 89-year-old man ingested approximately 12 ounces of paint thinner (mineral spirits) that he thought was juice. Patient was found unconscious on the kitchen floor and on presentation to the ED responded only to deep pain. He was cyanotic, hypoventilating, in atria1 fibrillation (pulse, 94/min; blood pressure, Hg; pH, PcoZ, Hg; mEql1) and a radiograph showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Activated charcoal and cathartics were given, blood pressure im- proved to 122/60 mm Hg (pulse improved to 88imin) after sodium bicarbonate, dopamine and IV fluids were adminis- tered. He was placed on PEEP, but his condition continued to deteriorate and he died on the second hospital day. An autopsy demonstrated chemical pneumonitis. Cases 80 and 81. A 12-year-old and a 13-year-old girl were found in school by a janitor after alleged exposure to tri- chloroethane. No spontaneous pulse or respirations were 453 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE W Volume 4, Number 5 n September 1986 present. Cardiovascular function was restored in an ED. Li- docaine was given for periodic ventricular tachyar- rhythmias, and dopamine was given to maintain blood pres- sure. Body temperature initially was 32.2\" C. Respiration was mechanically assisted, and spontaneous respiration oc- curred only occasionally. Over the next few days, no neuro- logical activity was observed, and life support was discon- tinued. Case 82. A 27-year-old male exterminator was applying chlorpyrifos under a house. The patient became unconscious and was taken to the ED in cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardio- pulmonary resuscitation was performed for approximately 20 minutes; the patient remained asystolic. There were no signs or symptoms of an organophosphate poisoning. Post- mortem examination revealed significant levels of phenyl- propanolamine that the patient had been taking therapeuti- cally. It was postulated that the patient had inhaled the fumes from the pesticide solvent and developed cardiac ar- rhythmias secondary to myocardial sensitization (from the solvent and PPA). Case 83. A 29-year-old man ingested % pint of diazinon and presented in cardiopulmonary arrest an hour later. Treatment included gastric lavage, activated charcoal, atro- pine (10 g over 52 hours), 2-PAM, and intubation with as- sisted ventilation. Aspiration pneumonia and ventricular ar- rhythmias developed, and the patient died 56 hours after ad- mission. Case 85. A 15month-old boy, while playing in the front yard, ran to his mother and complained that he didn't feel well. He then had a convulsion and stopped breathing. Car- diopulmonary resuscitation was initiated by the mother. an ambulance was summoned, and he was taken to the ED where he was found to have bradycardia, pinpoint pupils, and hypersalivation. Chest radiograph was normal. The pa- tient received atropine and gastric lavage. Over the next three hours. he experienced cardiopulmonary arrest many times, but was finally stabilized, intubated, and placed on a ventilator. Atropine therapy was continued, and 2-PAM was administered. Naloxone was given without results. Plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase activities were undetectable. Over the next two days, a drop in urinary output was treated with furosemide and mannitol, and hypotension was treated with dopamine. Three days after the incident, an electroen- cephalogram (EEG) showed no electrical activity, and life- support systems were discontinued. Subsequent laboratory analyses showed fonofos in the patient's gastric aspirate and urine, and also on his shirt. Case 87. A 33-year-old man ingested 8 ounces of a mos- quito repellant containing diethyl-meta-toluamide. One to two hours later, he experienced a cardiorespiratory arrest and developed DIC. The patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator. On day 2 he became hyperglycemic (blood glucose 250 mg/dl) and developed status epilepticus, which was treated with phenytoin. He developed cerebral edema and died nine days after ingestion. Case 88. A 26-month-old boy presented in cardiopulmo- nary arrest 7.5 hours after allegedly ingesting dishwashing liquid. Approximately 15 hours after exposure, the child began demonstrating tongue and upper arm fasciculations. Organophosphate toxicity was suspected, and cholinesterase levels were drawn. Plasma cholinesterase was 0.2 (normal 454 1.3-4.5), erythrocyte cholinesterase was 3.9 (normal 8.6- 12.8). Salivation reported 15.5 hours after inges- tion. Administration of 2-PAM was advised at this point, al- though there is no record of such administration. The child died on the second hospital day. Autopsy confirmed or- ganophosphate poisoning. Case 90. A 30-year-old woman ingested an unknown quantity of a sodium fluoride roach killer. About two hours later. she had the abrupt onset of rigidity and a possible sei- zure and developed ventricular fibrillation. She was given 2-3 g of calcium chloride but could not be resuscitated. Au- topsy report revealed a tissue fluoride level of 7.4 mg/l and a gastric fluoride level of 18 mg/l. Cases 91-94. Four Mexican farm workers, ages 27, 31, 38. and 42 years, were admitted to the hospital after eating wild mushrooms in North San Diego County four days be- fore admission. The mushrooms were described as large with a white cap. Patients were staying for the past several days at a downtown shelter where they were described as having been very sick with severe vomiting. Upon arrival at the hospital. they were all disoriented with evidence of se- vere hepatotoxicity, (Their serum ranged from 5,000 to 20,000 times ranged from 70 to 100 seconds; serum creatinine ranged from 1.4 to 3 mg/dl.) They were treated with activated charcoal and sup- portive care. Peritoneal dialysis was begun because of an- uria. Three patients died two days after admission from pro- found hypotension and bradycardia followed by asystole. which was unresponsive to resuscitative efforts. The fourth patient died seven days after admission. No mushroom samples were available for identification; however, mycolo- gists reported that samples of Amanita ocreata had been found in the area. Case 97. A 38-year-old woman who was depressed and had domestic problems, was found in a coma with labored respirations in her basement. Near her was an empty con- tainer of furniture refinisher 5%). She had last been seen well approximately 16 hours before. Initial presentation included a blood pressure of SO/O mm Hg, respiratory rate of 30/min, pulse of 90/min, and a rectal temperature of 33.9\" C. She was acidotic (PH 7.0 after initial sodium bicarbonate). Treatment included IV fluids, dopa- mine, levarterenol, gastric lavage, ethanol. leucovorin, and peritoneal dialysis. Her pupils remained fixed and dilated, and hypotension persisted. Initial laboratory results (DIG) and acute hemolysis developed, and the patient died approximately 40 hours after presenta- tion. Case 98. A 5-year-old girl was found dead in the morning by her parents. The child had been playing in an area around their residence on the evening prior to death. Before going to bed, the child had complained of not feeling well and double vision, which the parents attributed to a \"cold.\" Upon autopsy, a large quantity of plant material was found in the stomach that was identified as Conium maculatum (poison hemlock). Case 99. A man in his twenties ingested Cicuta maculata LITOVITZ ET AL n 1985 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORT (water hemlock) for nourishment in the backwoods Yellow- stone National Park. The patient was 90 minutes from a health care facility. One hour after exposure, when the health care facility was initially contacted, he was experi- encing seizures every 15-20 minutes and was comatose; pulse was 170/min, and breathing was labored. Cardiopul- monary resuscitation was performed for an hour while the patient had seizures every 10 minutes. No medications were available for administration, and resuscitative efforts were unsuccessful. Case 101. A 15-month-old boy was found with a 2-ounce bottle of gun bluing (unknown amount ingested). The child vomited lo-15 minutes after the ingestion. He was subse- quently lavaged and then became stuporous. Activated charcoal was administered, after which the child vomited and aspirated. Thereafter, the child developed a cardiopul- monary arrest and could not be resuscitated. At autopsy, findings consistent with aspiration pneumonitis were found along with the following serum levels: methanol, undetect- able; pg/dl (normal lo-20 pg/dl). The cause of death was listed as se- lenium poisoning. Case 108. A 38-year-old man ingested approximately 30 acetaminophen/diphenhydramine capsules two days before admission, as well as several more the following day. He also ingested 6 to 7 acetaminophen 500 mg tablets over this period. On admission, the patient was lethargic with a respi- ration rate of 32/min, a pulse of 105 beats/m& a blood pres- sure of 148188 mm Hg, a temperature of 35.9\"C, a pH of 6.97, PcoZ of 25 mm Hg, HCO, of 5.7 mmol/l, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dl, prothrombin time of 46.2 seconds (control, 13 seconds), partial prothrombin time of 76.1 seconds (control, 33.6 seconds) a platelet count of 16,000/mm3, a hemoglobin value of 16.3 g/dl, a hematocrit of 51%, and The acetaminophen serum concentra- tion approximately hours after ingestion was 68 kg/ml. N-acetylcysteine, sodium bicarbonate, and vitamin K, were administered. The patient's condition began to deteriorate. Hematemesis and melena developed. At 24 hours following admission, his liver edge became palpable, and his serum creatinine continued to rise. He became confused and in- creasingly combative. He was then sedated, and nasogastric (NG) tube, packed cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets were administered. The patient continued to bleed extensively. On the morning of the third hospital day, the patient became hypotensive re- quiring dopamine, then experienced a cardiac arrest that was unresponsive to resuscitation. Post-mortem examina- cardiomegaly, and bilateral pulmonary congestion. Case 130. A 26-year-old man with recent depression pre- sented after several hours of vomiting. Patient rapidly dete- riorated from sinus tachycardia to ventricular fibrillation and experienced a seizure. Laboratory results from samples drawn on initial presentation but only available after death were: salicylate level, 96 mg/dl; repeat salicylate, 147 mg/dl; normal electrolytes; normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); pH, 7.46; Pco,, 31 mm Hg; and Po,, 105 mm Hg. The patient died 1.5 hours after presentation, still with no diagnosis. An au- topsy showed pulmonary edema and multiorgan hyperemia. Urine toxicology screen revealed amoxapine. Post-mortem serum salicylate level was 212 mg/dl. Case 139. A 13-year-old girl ingested 50 mg of colchicine 22 hours before presenting with nausea, vomiting, and diar- rhea. She was initially alert and oriented. Two days later she became progressively more hypotensive and died, despite therapy with fluids and pressor agents. At autopsy, she had pulmonary edema with pleural and cerebral edema. Case 140. A 42-year-old man, known to be a substance abuser, ingested an unknown amount of colchicine in a street-prepared gel used for \"colchicine-dipping\" (the prac- tice of marijuana growers of treating the seeds prior to planting, purportedly to increase THC content of the plant). This occurred approximately 21 hours prior to his death. He presented to ED the same day complaining of nausea, vom- iting, and diarrhea. He was sent home after a brief evalua- tion, but re-admitted later that day with breathing diffi- pulmonary edema, severe acidosis (PH 6.8) and hy- potension, and died eight hours later. Serum colchicine test results were negative, but colchicine was detected in the myocardium on post-mortem examination. The medical ex- aminer listed the cause of death as diffuse myocardial ne- crosis secondary to acute colchicine intoxication. Involve- ment of other drugs was not excluded. Case 141. A 64-year-old man ingested 40 ibuprofen (600 mg) tablets over a day and presented with guaiac positive emesis, confusion, and tachycardia (120imin). Blood pres- sure and respirations were normal. Laboratory studies dem- onstrated an anion gap and a respiratory alkalosis mEq/l; pH, 7.47). Toxicologic analysis revealed an ibuprofen level of 15.8 &ml (blood) and no sa- licylates were present. Treatment included gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and magnesium citrate. The next day, the patient had a distended colon and was experiencing renal failure (BUN 112 mg/dl, creatinine 3.2 mg/dl, potas- sium 3.6 mEq/l). Septic shock developed. The patient died three days after the ingestion. Case 142. A Gyear-old child presented to ED with a Lac- eration of the lip and was given a combination of meperidine 30 mg, promethazine 15 mg, and chlorpromazine 15 mg. Ten minutes after injection, the vital signs were reported as being within normal limits. Later, the child's lip was in- jected with 40 mg lidocaine with epinephrine. Ninety minutes after the initial injection and during the suturing procedure, the child was found to be in cardiac arrest with asystole. Resuscitative efforts were unsuccessful. Case 155. A 2-year-old girl was found comatose and cya- notic, and was transported to an ED where CPR was per- formed. Initially, there was no history of an ingestion, but it was later discovered that the child was found near empty bottles of erythromycin and lidocaine 2% viscous. Patient was placed on a ventilator and required dopamine and do- butamine. Lidocaine blood concentration four hours after ingestion was 4.1 p,g/ml. Methemoglobin concentration was 1.1%. Twenty four hours after admission the patient was de- termined to have a necrotic abdomen and brain death. It was discovered that the child had been receiving lidocaine viscous for mouth ulcers over a period of 4 days (swallowing 455 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE n Volume 4, Number 5 W September 1986 each dose.) The child died approximately 27 hours after ini- tial presentation. Case 170. A 24-year-old woman ingested 5 g of amitripty- line and 5 g of doxepin and was found unconscious and seizing five hours later. Evaluation in the ED revealed a blood pressure of 60 mm Hg systolic (Doppler), QRS in- terval greater than 0.3 seconds, continuous tonic/clonic sei- zures, and a pH of 6.98. Treatment included intubation with mechanical ventilation, cardiac monitoring, sodium bicar- bonate, dopamine, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and magnesium citrate. Despite attempts to control seizures with 70-80 mg diazepam, 8 mg physostigmine, 1 g phe- nytoin, and 400 mg phenobarbital, completely subsided. Patient's acidosis was sufftciently corrected; how- ever, maximum blood pressure attained was only 90 mm Hg. Temperature rose to 42.2\" C rectally, with no response to external cooling, aspirin, or acetaminophen. Initial catheter- ization yielded 45 ml of bloody urine but no further urinary output. The patient died 19.5 hours after admission. Urinary drug screen revealed cannabinoids, while amitriptyline and aspirin were found in the gastric contents. Case 182. An 18-year-old woman ingested 2.5 g of amoxa- pine. She presented 3.5 hours later with lethargy and a pulse of 140-150/min. The patient was lavaged, and activated charcoal was administered. The patient then began experi- encing seizures and was unresponsive to diazepam, pheno- barbital, and phenytoin. Status epilepticus persisted for ap- proximately seven hours. Temperature rose to 42.1\" C. A brief episode of ventricular tachycardia occurred during placement of a CVP line. The patient was declared brain- dead on fourth hospital day. Case 186. A 60-year-old woman was reported to have in- gested unknown amounts of amoxapine, thiothixene, and aspirin. She presented with seizures and developed status epilepticus. Treatment included diazepam, physostigmine, activated charcoal, magnesium citrate, intubation. pheno- barbital, and phenytoin. There were no ECG abnormalities until, following prolonged seizure activity, the patient devel- oped bradycardia and experienced a cardiac arrest. Fol- lowing the patient was decerebrate, febrile (42.p C), and hypotensive requiring a dopamine drip. An EEG showed no activity. The patient died the following day. Case 198. A 27-year-old man ingested 10 doxepin cap- sules and developed coma, seizures, widened QRS complex and tachycardia. Blood pressure was 85 mm Hg systolic, and pH was normal. The patient was intubated, lavaged, and given activated charcoal, diazepam, physostigmine, do- pamine, levarterenol, and sodium bicarbonate. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, and diazepam were administered in attempt to treat seizures. Core temperature increased to 41.7\" C and was brought down to 37.3\" C with a cooling blanket. The patient was paralyzed with pavulon. Urine was brick red. The patient continued to deteriorate over next two days with supportive care until death. Autopsy confirmed dox- epin overdose. Case 203. An 18-month-old boy ingested a \"whole bottle\" of imipramine (50 mg tablets) approximately 30 minutes before arrival in the ED. While gastric lavage was being attempted, the patient had a seizure and cardiac ar- 456 rest. Lorazepam, dopamine, sodium bicarbonate, and anti- arrhythmics were administered, and the child was stabi- lized. He was comatose with a normal sinus rhythm, but remained hypotensive. Approximately 5.5 hours later, he developed a widened QRS complex, had a blood pressure of 60/40 mm Hg on dopamine, and had no urinary output. So- dium bicarbonate and physostigmine were administered. The patient continued to deteriorate, developing seizures and arrhythmias that did not respond to treatment, and died 27.5 hours after ingestion. Case 217. A 55-year-old woman presented with a lithium concentration of 4.88 mEq/l following treatment for a bi- polar affective disorder. She presented in the ED awake but uncommunicative with clonus and positive Babinski re- flexes. Her blood pressure was 140/106 mm Hg, pulse was 106/min, respirations were 16/min, repeat lithium level was 4.6 mEq/l, leukocyte count was 24,600/mm3. and BUN was 41 mg/dl. She had a urinary tract infection, and her urinary screen was positive for amoxapine and ethanimate. Con- comitant acute and chronic overdose were assumed. Serum lithium was reduced to 0.6 mEq/l in two hours by dialysis. Further treatment included urinary alkalinization with so- dium bicarbonate, mannitol. acetazolamide, gentamicin. and blood transfusions. While some increase in kidney function was seen, the mental status never improved. The patient died on the sixth hospital day. Case 219. A 20-year-old woman taking lithium 600 mg tid and haloperidol 10 mg qid collapsed in the psychiatric clinic, and was comatose and dehydrated. Her blood pressure was 90-100 mm Hg systolic, pulse was 116/min, Na was 172 mEq/l. K was 5.4 mEq/l, BUN was 12 mg/dl, creatinine was 7.2 mg/dl, and lithium was 3.7 mEq/l. No decontamination was done initially. The patient received fluids, but no im- provement was observed. Hemodialysis was performed on the third hospital day. The patient remained in critical and unstable condition. She suffered cardiac arrest on the third day and was resuscitated. Dopamine was required to main- tain blood pressure. The patient died on the fourth hospital day. Case 220. A 27-year-old man ingested approximately 90 loxapine capsules and presented a few hours later alert. ori- ented, anxious, with slurred speech and extrapyramidal symptoms. He was given diphenhydramine, then had a grand ma1 seizure 10 minutes after arrival in the ED and was comatose afterwards. Gastric lavage was performed. His condition continued to deteriorate; he became acidotic and was given sodium bicarbonate, then suffered a cardiac ar- rest 1.5 hours after presentation and could not be resusci- tated. Blood was positive for phenobarbital, and urine was positive for phenobarbital and diphenhydramine. An au- topsy confirmed loxapine overdose. Postmortem loxapine blood level was 0.42 mgidl and the stomach and the bile also contained loxapine. Case 225. A 27-year-old man was comatose and hypoten- sive when he presented approximately eight hours after in- gestion of an unknown amount of phenelzine. Pupils were fixed and dilated, and anuria was evident. Patient was ini- tially hyperthermic (42.2\" C), but then became hypothermic (32.2\" C). Patient was lavaged, but no charcoal was given. LITOVITZ ET AL M 1985 AAPCC ANNUAL REPORT Blood pressure was maintained with vasopressors, and he- modialysis was performed. The patient's condition con- tinued to deteriorate. Three cardiac arrests occurred, and the patient died on the third hospital day. An autopsy con- firmed phenelzine overdose. Case 244. An M-year-old woman ingested digoxin (un- known amount, unknown time). Patient was lethargic and in atria1 fibrillation with occasional PVCs. No gastrointestinal decontamination was done. Heart rate was 150-160 beats/ min. Ventricular fibrillation developed, and the patient died approximately two hours after admission to hospital. Di- goxin level was 29 ng/ml. Case 245. A 12-month-old girl ingested nifedipine (un- known amount, unknown time). Patient was hypotensive on presentation with a heart rate of 150/min and depressed res- pirations. Patient became lethargic within 7 minutes of ar- rival and had a cardiorespiratory arrest. Resuscitation in- gluconate, transthoracic pacing, but was unsuccessful. Case 247. An 18-year-old woman arrived at the ED in sei- zures with a pulse of 50/min and a stable blood pressure after ingesting SO-60 propranolol80 mg tablets. Initial treat- ment included gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and ca- thartics. The patient then went into cardiorespiratory arrest and was revived with sodium bicarbonate, epinephrine, and cardioversion. The patient was admitted to the ICU on a glucagon drip with a pulse of 80-90/min. Respirations were poor with bronchospasm, pupils were fixed and dilated, and the patient remained unresponsive. Aminophylline was ad- ministered. Twelve hours after initial ED presentation blood pressure dropped to 60 mm Hg, pulse rose to 120/min, and dopamine was administered. Eighteen hours later, on the second hospital day, the patient had a cardiorespiratory ar- rest and died. Case 257. A 3-year-old girl ingested an undetermined number of ferrous sulfate 300 mg tablets. Three hours after ingestion, the initial serum iron level was 3,805 kg/d1 and the child responded only to deep pain. Blood pressure was normal and urinary output was good. The child was lavaged with sodium bicarbonate and received activated charcoal. An exchange transfusion was performed. Within eight hours the iron level decreased to 856 pg/dl, and the child was treated with intravenous deferoxamine. At approximately 21 hours after the ingestion, the patient became hypovo- lemic secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. At 26 hours after ingestion, the child suffered two cardiac arrests. The child died two days after the ingestion. Case 258. A 20-month-old girl ingested 4 ounces of phen- ylpropanolamine/chlorpheniramine syrup. The babysitter had no ipecac syrup so gave sodium bicarbonate. Serum so- dium concentration on admission was 184 mEq/l. The pa- tient's temperature was 42.2\" C. Two hours later, the tem- perature was 41.1\" C on a cooling blanket, and the patient was in status epilepticus. Cardiopulmonary arrest occurred 14 hours after the ingestion. Resuscitation was attempted for two hours. Case 259. A 13-year-old girl arrived in the ED in cardio- pulmonary arrest. She had been found unresponsive at home after ingesting loperamide. Resuscitative efforts were unsuccessful. Post-mortem edema and a serum phenobarbital concentration of 65 Case 260. A 15year-old boy ingested approximately 80 cyclobenzaprine tablets and presented in coma unresponsive to any stimuli, with hypothermia, tachycardia, and dilated pupils 8 to 12 hours later. Initial therapy included lavage, activated charcoal, and cathartics. The patient stabilized but continued to be unresponsive. He became agitated after a test dose of physostigmine (2 mg). At approximately 20 hours after ingestion, the patient developed severe respira- tory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema. Cardiac ar- rest ensued and resuscitation was successfully performed. He died on the eighth hospital day. Final diagnosis was death caused by massive cerebral edema and anoxic brain- stem damage secondary to cyclobenzaprine overdose. Case 265. A 9-month-old girl ingested three to five chlor- promazine 100 mg tablets and presented with lethargy, be- coming progressively unresponsive an hour later. Treatment included gastric lavage and activated charcoal. No radio- opaque tablets were observed on a radiograph. The child's condition worsened. Seizure activity was treated with phe- nytoin, and the child had to be intubated. The patient suf- fered a cardiorespiratory arrest but was resuscitated and stabilized. Her condition continued to deteriorate, and she remained unresponsive. Dopamine was infused to maintain blood pressure. The patient died 20 hours after ingestion. An autopsy confirmed cause of death. Case 274. A 25year-old woman presented 19 hours after ingesting 30 haloperidol (20 mg) tablets alert and oriented with blood pressure 118/90 mm Hg and a pulse of 88/min. She had vomited several times prior to presentation. Treat- ment included activated charcoal in sorbitol. The patient was admitted to a psychiatric unit following \"medical clear- ance.\" Twenty-five hours after ingestion, patient had no an- ticholinergic symptoms and QRS complex was not wide. The patient died during the night. The medical examiner re- ported death as \"accidental-idiosyncratic reaction to medi- cation.\" Case 285. A 48-year-old woman with a history of a myo- cardial infarction nine months before, was alert but lethargic when admitted to the intensive care unit after an ingestion of unknown drugs. Initial therapy included lavage and acti- vated charcoal. Several runs of ventricular tachycardia were observed, which responded to lidocaine, procainamide, or cardioversion, with subsequent maintenance of normal sinus rhythm on phenytoin and lidocaine. The initial serum thioridazine level was 5,008 ng/ml (therapeutic, 250-1250 ng/ml). The patient died two days after admission because of refractory ventricular tachycardia. Case 291. A 21-year-old man ingested an unknown quan- tity of cocaine 30 minutes before admission in an attempt to hide the substance from police. Upon arrival in the ED, the patient was in full cardiorespiratory arrest, resuscitated, and placed on a ventilator. The patient remained comatose with fixed and dilated pupiis. Gastrointestinal decontamination with gastric lavage, activated charcoal and cathartic was performed. Over the next 12 hours, the patient's body tem- 457 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE n Volume 4, Number 5 n September 1986 perature increased to 42.8\" C. and he began suffering unre- mitting tonic-clonic seizures unresponsive to diazepam and phenytoin. The patient then developed DIC, began bleeding uncontrollably, and required fresh frozen plasma and whole blood. Toxicology screen revealed cocaine 0.2 mg/l, lido- Caine 37 mg/l, phenytoin 4.4 mg/l, and morphine 130 p,g/l. The patient died on the second hospital day. Post-mortem examination confirmed multiple drug overdose. Case 294. A 25-year-old man ingested 3 to 5 g of cocaine approximately 3 to 4 hours before presentation. The patient was comatose and on a ventilator with a blood pressure of 60 mm Hg systolic and ventricular fibrillation. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and dopamine and norepinephrine therapy was begun. By the second hospital day the patient was experiencing renal failure and undergoing peritoneal di- alysis. He remained unresponsive and died on the fourth hospital day. Case 297. A 29-year-old man presented to an ED in car- diac arrest an hour after ingesting a 5-g bag of cocaine in a suicide attempt. Six hours after resuscitation, the patient was on a ventilator, was unresponsive to pain, his pupils were fixed and dilated, and he was hyperthermic (40.1 ' C) and had seizures poorly controlled by diazepam. Blood pressure at this time was 120/80 mm Hg on dopamine. Acti- vated charcoal was given. Serum cocaine level was 27.5 mg/ml. Sodium pentothal by continuous infusion was uti- lized successfully to control seizure activity. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and an EEG two days after ingestion showed brain death. The patient died six days after admission. Post-mortem report confirms cause of death as mixed drug ingestion and bronchopneumonia. Urine was positive for cocaine, phencyclidine, and mari- juana. Case 316. An 18-year-old woman ingested a street drug MDMA (Ecstacy) at a night club. She was brought to the ED in cardiopulmonary arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, but the patient could not be resuscitated. On examination, there was evidence of massive pulmonary edema. A small amount of ethanol and MDMA were present on post-mortem examination. Case 324. An elderly, debilitated man was inadvertently administered 30 ml hexachlorophene in 90 ml water via naso- gastric tube. He vomited spontaneously. Respiratory dis- tress was not observed. The patient was suctioned immedi- ately but received no other therapy. He died within 10 minutes of the exposure. Post-mortem examination revealed signs of aspiration; hexachlorophene was not detected in serum. Case 325. A 30-year-old man ingested approximately 2 ounces of oil of wintergreen 12 hours before admission. He presented with a respiratory rate of 40/min, a PO, of 80 mm Hg, a Pco, of 10 mm Hg, and a pH of 7.4. Initial salicylate level was 77 mg/dl approximately 12 hours after ingestion. The patient was breathing on his own on admission. Diag- nosis was ARDS. Respiratory status deteriorated within 12 hours after admission. The patient was given sodium bicar- bonate and intubated as his pH fell to 7.19. Dialysis was thought to be too risky at that time because of the critical condition of patient. Approximately 12 hours after admis- sion, the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension and died. Case 326. A 37-year-old woman ingested one teaspoon of oil of wintergreen four hours before admission to \"treat a cold.\" Upon presentation, the patient was alert and ori- ented, with a history of vomiting, a respiratory rate of 201 min, and a blood pressure of 138/80 mm Hg. Salicylate levels were 80 mg/dl (six hours after ingestion) and 128 mg/dl (14 hours after ingestion). Treatment included diuresis and sodium bicarbonate. Coma and hyperventilation devel- oped. The patient died approximately 16 hours after the in- gestion. 458 "}
