Our efforts have led to identification of personal mitigation strategies (chemoprevention, personal monitoring) for pollutant -induced disease, providing scientific support for regulatory approaches to mitigate pollutant -induced disease at the state and national level . We also have identified and examined genetic, biological, behavioral and societal risk factors that increase risk for pollutant -induced disease. These studies are undertaken within a unique collaborative relationship with the Division of Environmental Public Health of the National Health and Environmental and Effects Research Laboratory of the US EPA. We have also had significant collaborations with NIEHS. My second (and related) research focus is examination of inflammatory processes and mechanisms in the respiratory tract and extending basic science findings to humans. This includes developing and performing innovative and high quality pre- clinical an d clinical investigation of novel treatments for lung and allergic diseases. These research interests are broadly focused on the biology of airway and systemic inflammation and lung function in humans, with emphasis on asthma, allergic disease and immunological processes in the lung, employing translational, clinical and epidemiological methods to examine these questions with four interrelated foci of interest. Of note, I have developed a number of model airway challenge protocols with ozone, endotoxin, particulate matter and allergen, which allows for screening of potential interventions, testing sensor devices, and identification/confirmation or genetic or physiologic risk factors for pollutant -induced and airway disease. In general, the strength of my r esearch capabilities is in carrying out translational and clinical investigation. In directing the UNC Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology, I also am committed to developing programs and systems by which investigators with translational, cellular, molecular, epidemiological , behavioral and engineering skills work in concert to address these questions. In addition to our long standing collaborations with the EPA, we have undertaken a collaboration with North Carolina State Universit y engineers, resulting in my being named as Medical Director of the NSF Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Advanced Self -Sustaining Integrated Sensor Technologies (ASSIST) which is led by engineers at North Carolina State University , focused on developing personal monitors for environmental exposures and physiological responses. This effort also involves significant collaborations at the University of Virginia, the Pennsylvania State University, Florida International University and i ndustry partners. Our role is to identify medical applications (mHealth, research and disease specific David B Peden CV 8/5/16 Page 49 applications) and do initial phase I testing of developed monitors using our environmental challenge capabilities. The CEMALB is also one of the foundi ng members of the new Marsico Lung Institute, led by Richard Boucher, MD Director of the Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research and Treatment Center . This builds on our collaborations with the CF center in translational research on airway diseases, and also includes the medical and pediatric pulmonary divisions. The Marsico Lung Institute has developed a non -profit research company, Spirovation, to catalyze early phase development of lung therapies. These experiences, coupled with my clinical expertise in pediatrics and allergy/immunology (across all ages) has led to my involvement with the NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, initially leading the Child Health Core, then the Patient and Clinical Interactions Resource ( which now includ es the C hild Health Service, the C linical and Translational Research Center and Patient Recruitment Service ). More recently, my experience in collaborating across a wide range of disciplines (immunology, cell biology, toxicology, sociology, psychology, burn surgery, and engineering), co -chairing both the review leading to the founding of the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology and the search for its inaugural chair, and the alignment of the Curriculum in Toxicology (Directed by Ilona Jaspers) with the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology have led to my being appointed to an institutional role for translational research. This role involves my leading the Team Science service of the NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute and serving in the School of Medicine Office of Research as Senior Associate Dean for Translational Research. In this research leadership role, I work to identify areas in which multi -disciplinary translational team approaches c an be employed to address important health care and environmental questions and needs. This draws on my personal research and leadership experience, with all levels of faculty and researcher. TEACHING STATEMENT: During my medical and scientific education, I have had many mentors and role models to look to in developing my teaching style and methods. I have had opportunity to examine teaching in the form of formal lectures, \"apprenticeship\" -type activities (inpatient ward rotations, graduate school laboratory work), mass media presentations and small group discussion formats. In almost all of these formats, I found that teachers who were able to articulate a respect for the needs and viewpoint of the learners in the audience were almost always the most ef fective teachers. Their teaching style, be it lecture, ward rotation or other venue, would engage interaction with the audience and invite questions or comments. Conversely, lectures that were essentially restatement of items in textbooks were usually not effective. Using these broad examples, I have tried to employ an interactive, open style of course and subject matter presentation. In addition to the teaching style, I think it is important to outline how the material being presented may be useful for the learners. That is different from simply mandating that it is important. For example, I will point out examples how the subject matter may be employed in practical situations that may be faced by the members of the learner audience. When presenting a lect ure, I try to find areas of common understanding between the learning audience and myself . David B Peden CV 8/5/16 Page 50 Given that my area of expertise is allergy and clinical immunology, this often involves explaining immune response, relating it to clinical states that the learner s (usually medical or other health care students) have some experience, and then reinforcing how immune response is relevant to that disease state. I take a similar approach when speaking about allergic disorders. I also invite questions and interaction, both to engage the audience and also to be confident that the initial teaching points are generally understood so that they can be built upon in subsequent discussion. I also feel it is essential to not simply outline the \"basics\" of a given topic, but t o incorporate very new information, including material from current literature searches. This is important not only to keep the lecture current, but also to demonstrate that no field is ever completely understood and that ongoing review is essential to continued competence in a given area. One very real benefit I get from educational activity is the opportunity to update my own fund of knowledge. Likewise, an interactive teaching style often leads to questions from learners that require real thought and investigation on my part to address. This process not only allows advancement of didactic knowledge, but also reinforces to the learner the value of their point of view in the learning process. In 2005 , I accepted the first fellows into the Allergy and Imm unology Training Program at UNC. We have rapidly grown to become one of the premier programs in the country, especially for persons interested in developing research expertise in phase I human studies focused on either food allergy or on the health effects of environmental pollutants. In the course of developing the allergy program, we have had to develop an entire curriculum which was approved both at the local (UNC) and national (ACGME) levels. This has included a didactic curriculum, methods of evaluati on of trainees, faculty and staff, and clinical rotations. Since that time, new recruits (and a program graduate) now lead the program. I remain involved as division chief and as preceptor of the Pediatric Allergy/Immunology Continuity Clinic. To date, we have had 10 graduates and all have pass ed the national certifying examination. I am also very involved in graduate student and post -doctoral fellow education. The Curriculum in Toxicology was aligned with the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology in 2012. Even before that time, I was frequent asked to serve as Chair or Member of numerous Toxicology PhD and MS committees. Since then, I remain a frequently called upon member of the Toxicology Curriculum faculty to serve as a mentor or c ommittee chair. I also provide organizational support to the program, which is led by Ilona Jaspers, Deputy Director of the CEMALB. I also have joint faculty status in Microbiology/Immunology and serve on committees for this department as well. As noted above, we have an active Allergy/Immunology program, with required research activity for trainees. I have been the primary research mentor for a number of these fellows. I also am a senior faculty mentor for a number of junior faculty, who in turn are engag ed in education of allergy/immunology and postdoctoral fellows. Another significant opportunity for teaching is peer instruction at grand rounds and other didactic presentations (workshops and seminars and national specialty meetings). Key elements in an effective didactic presentation to peers are similar to those ci ted above. These include using a clear and organized lecture style, identifying key goals of the learners (what do they want out of the experience), addressing the goals of the audience, engaging the audience by asking questions and presenting very novel information. Also important is to be available after the presentation for a time so that people can pose specific questions or discuss specific clinical situations.

I have been involved in programs for the general public (asthma presentations in the Mini-Medical School program, EPA open house nights) and for school nurses and teachers (I review asthma and allergy issues for the Carrboro- Chapel Hill School System). I have also led development of an asthma action plan form and an asthma education booklet for use by patients (or parents of patients) with asthma. The asthma actio n plan is also a tool used by housestaff in daily management of their asthma patients. In summary, I view teaching as a dynamic, interactive process. Engaging the learners and respecting their needs, knowledge and experience are important in developing a comfortable teaching environment. Encouraging active participation by learners and providing cutting edge information on a given topic are the most important goals for teaching. "}
