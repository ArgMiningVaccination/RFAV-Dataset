Work from <strong>snow</strong> surface to ground2. Tare the density scoop3. Make first density measurement so that the next density measurement starts at an even10cm (ex. <strong>snow</strong> depth = 43 cm mark first density measurement from 43 to 30 cm, <strong>snow</strong>depth = 47 cm mark first density measurement from 47 to 40 cm)4. Each density measurement then is every ten cm on the tens (e.g., 40 to 30 cm).5. Stagger the density measurements laterally6. Near the ground there may be rocks or bushes that interfere with the density scoop, somove laterally if necessary7. If there is a void at the <strong>snow</strong> ground interface measure density from 15-5cm or simply usethe same value you got for 20-10 cm for 10-0 cm.Measure Snow Temperature1. Calibrate thermometers in an ice bath.2. As you are measuring the density, place a thermometer in the shaded top 2 cm, the middleof the density measurement height, and the middle of the next density height3. Allow thermometers a few minutes to equilibrate4. Leapfrog the thermometers through the middle of the density measurement heights with thefinal measurement having the thermometer at the <strong>snow</strong>/ground interface.5. Avoid measurements near exposed or buried bushes6. Here's what you are doing: density measurements every 10 cm on multiples of tens, withtemp measurements every 10 cm in the middle of the density measurement. Thus, the tempmeasurements are at 5's (e.g., 35, 25, 15, 05 cm). And with measurements at the top andbottom of the <strong>snow</strong>pit.Identify Stratigraphy1. Work from top down. Clean <strong>snow</strong> surface with shovel.2. Using knife or edge of card to first vertically identify layers and delineate. Then go backand sample each unique layer.3. Estimate Hardness (Fist, 4-Fingers, 1-Finger, Pencil, Knife, Ice) - use Symbols in ObservationGuidelines \u00a72.5.34. Estimate Grain Size (in mm) using <strong>snow</strong> <strong>crystal</strong> card and magnifying loop - seeObservation Guidelines \u00a72.5.55. Identify Grain Shape: New Snow, Fragments, Rounded, Faceted, Depth Hoar, Surface Hoar,Melt-Freeze Forms, Ice - use Symbols in Observation Guidelines \u00a72.5.4. Subcategories (andcorresponding symbols) are in Appendix F. Relate these to succession of processes: Temperature Gradient (TG), Equitemperature (ET),Wet Snow Metamorphism (WM), Ice & Crust Formation - see Tables & Figure next page, andObservation Guidelines App. F.6. Estimate Liquid Water - use Classes in Observation Guidelines \u00a72.5.6Test Pack for BlockingData entered into SnowPilot back at the Lodge (see last "}
