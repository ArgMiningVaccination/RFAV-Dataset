When a resident enters a nursing facility, he/she experiences the loss of home and belongings. Familiar things create a positive and h ome-like environment. The staff should encourage the resident to bring items from home, as space permits. B. The room should be arranged according to resident preference, as possible. C. The resident s' personal belongings should be safeguarded, as possible. D. Types of beds may vary in each facility. Most beds have controls to raise, lower and adjust positions. A low bed may be used for a resident at risk for falls. E. Temperature of the resident's room /environment should be considered. The resident's condition and preferences should determine the appropriate temperature. F. Lighting should be sufficient for the resident's needs/preferences. Indirect lighting is preferable, in that glare causes fatigue, and contributes to confusion and the potential for falls. G. The resident's environment should be cleaned of spills immediately, as spills are safety hazards contributing to falls. H. Excessive noise levels in the environment can provoke irritation and problematic behaviors. Facilities should maintain equipment in good repair and refrain from overhead paging. I. Fresh ice water should be maintained and within reach in an effort to encourage hydration, unless the resident's fluids are restricted by the physi cian. (thicken liquids) J. The call light should be placed within the resident's reach upon completion of care/staff assistance. K. Defective or unsafe equipment should be taken out of service and reported to the nurse immediately. Page 55 of 307 II. Unoccupied Bed (see CARE SKILLS # 12) A. Bed making Tips 1. Carry clean linens away from your body and uniform. 2. Do not shake linens when making bed. 3. Do not place clean or dirty linens on the floor. 4. Do not place clean linens on a dirty surface. 5. Check for personal belongings between the linens before removing them from the bed (i.e. dentures, glasses, hearing aid, etc.). 6. Remove gloves after handling dirty linens. A new pair of gloves should be worn to handle clean linens. 7. Avoid bringing unnecessary linens into a resident's room. Unused linens are considered contaminated once they have been in someone's room. Do not attempt to use them in another resident's room, as transferring linens from room to room increases the spread of germs and infection. Discard unused linens as you would soiled linens . 8. Always change soiled linens. Urine, feces, food, et c. that remain on linens can cause irritation and sores to develop on the resident's skin. 9. Report damaged or odorous m attress to charge nurse immediately. 10. Ensure mattress is free of urine/feces/other body fluids. Clean mattress as needed per facility policy. III.

Remove anything that might cause odors or become safety hazards, such as trash, clutter, spilled fluids, etc. Page 56 of 307 E. Clean up spills promptly. F. Report signs of insects or pests when observed. G. Fall Preventi on - to reduce the risk of falls 1. Clear all walkways of clutter and cords . 2. Use non- skid mats when needed. 3. Assist residents to wear non- skid socks or shoes. Make certain shoes are tied and fit properly . 4. Ensure residents wear clothing that fits proper ly (e.g. not too tight, not too loose, or not too long) . 5. Keep frequently used items in reach of resident . 6. If ordered, ensure any devices or alarms are in plac e and functional per the care plan . 7. Lock wheelchairs before assisting residents to transfer . 8. Offer to toilet resident frequently/according to toileting schedule to prevent unassisted attempts to toilet . 9. Visual cues or devices may be used, such as a large face clock, calendar, etc. Familiar pictures, symbols, or personal items may be displayed or hung to assist the resident with cognitive impairment to recognize his/her room, restroom, closet, etc. IV.

Report to charge nurse low fluid intake Page 60 of 307 d. Approximately 2000- 2500cc daily E. Passing Fresh Ice Water (see CARE SKILLS #1 5) Ice pitchers should be refilled/refreshed at least once every shift, or more frequently if needed. Always check the resident's care plan for special instructions before fil ling the pitcher. 1. Individuals on thickened liquids also need thickened water; prepackaged, thickened water can be kept cool at the bedside per facility policy ; if prepackaged water is not available, be sure to thicken liquids according to facility polic y and the consistency ordered for the resident . 2. Be sure the ice scoop is stored properly when not in use. It should not be left in the ice when filling the resident's pitchers. 4. Make sure the resident's water is placed within reach when returning it to the room. 5. Know your residents. If the container is too heavy for the resident to hold, then they won't be able to use it. Provide a smaller container such as a cup or glass. F. Role of the Nurse Aide 1. Review the diet card before serving the meal to the resident to confirm correct diet . 2. Encourage resident to eat as much of their meal as possible . 3. Note foods resident avoids or dislikes and report to the nurse . 4. Be aware of food brought in to the resident from an outside source and potential conflict with ordered diet; report to charge nurse as needed. 5. Record food intake according to facility policy . 6. Remind resident to drink often or offer ice/popsicles, when not on restriction . 7. Have fresh ice water available and within the resident's reach at all times unless on a fluid restriction. G. Promoting the Use of Proper Feeding Technique/Assisting a Resident with Special Needs Page 61 of 307 NOTE - The caregiver should provide any necessary care and offer to assist the resident to toilet prior to meal servi ce in an effort to promote a positive experience. 1. Serving a Meal Tray (see CARE SKILLS #1 6) a. Provide oral care before meals. Residents may eat better if they have a clean mouth. b. Always check the diet card and the items on the tray before taking the tray to the resident. c. As a safety precaution, never leave a resident who needs to be fed unattended with a tray. d. If a resident refuses to eat, or even if he/she is not in the facility (in the hospital, on a home visit) when the tray arrives, you are not allowed to eat their food. e. Clothing protectors are optional. Ask their preference and honor their decision. f. Inform the nurse i f the resident complains about the flavor/taste of thickened liquids . g. Never blow on a resident's food to cool it. I nstead, try spreading the food out over the plate. The increased surface area helps cool the food quicker. Cutting food into smaller pieces also helps it to cool faster. h. Encourage residents to do as much for themselves as possible. i. Be sure residents are provided with their necessary assistive devices during each meal. j. Inform resident of food items on tray, especially if meal is pureed or mechanically altered.

The student will be able to describe the various manners in which oxygen is supplied for a resident. II. The student will be able to describe necessary safety precautions to be implemente d when oxygen is in use. Key Terms : Combustion - the process of burning. Oxygen - a chemical that is found in the air that has no color, taste, or smell, and that is necessary for life. Flammable - easily ignited and capable of burning quickly. Content : I. Oxygen Use A. Oxygen is prescribed by a physician; however, a nurse may initiate oxygen in response to a medical emergency. B. Nursing assistants are never allowed to stop (refers to turning oxygen off and/or removing t he nasal cannula or mask from face/nostrils) , adjust (refers to increasing or decreasing the amount of oxygen the resident receives), or initiate (refers to turning oxygen on and/or placing the nasal cannula in nares or the mask on the face) the use of oxy gen. Nursing Assistants m ay provide care, such as washing the face or oral care. Ensure NC or mask is properly positioned in nares or on the resident's face after care. C. Nasal Cannula - Delivery of oxygen through a long tubing from the source to the cannula , with prongs placed in each nostril and the tubing tucked behind the resident's ears. 1. Observe for irritation behind the ears, as the tubing can cause skin breakdown. Notify the nurse, if observed. 2. Provide nasal cannula care per facility policy and resident care plan. (see CARE SKILLS # 17) Page 68 of 307 D. Mask - delivery of oxygen through a long tubing from the source to a mask placed on the resident's face with a band around the back of the head. 1. Observe for irritation around the face mask and notify the nurse, if observed. E. Concentrator - a device that sits on the floor and plugs into the wall which changes air in the room into air with more oxygen. F. Liquid Oxygen - at extremely cold temperatures, oxygen changes from gas to a liquid. The liquid oxygen is stored in a vessel similar to a thermos. A large central unit is located in an area away from electrical equipment that is well ventilated. Liquid oxygen can be trans -filled to a bedside unit or can be trans -filled into a portable unit. 1. Contact with liquid oxygen or its vapors can quickly freeze tissues. It is common to see vapors when filling a small vessel from the large vessel. The vapors evaporate quickly and then are harmless. To prevent injury, never touch liquid oxygen, or the frosted parts of liquid oxygen vessels. Avoid getting the vapors in your face. G. Portable Tank - oxygen that is stored as a gas under pressure in a cylinder equipped with a flow meter and regulator to control the flow rate. This system is generally prescribed when oxygen therapy is required in emergency or for a short period of time (e.g., during transport). Compressed oxygen tanks are under extreme pressure and must be kept upright and handled with care. H. Vaporizers/Humidifiers - A vaporizer works by heating water unti l it turns into hot steam, a humidifier creates a cool mist. Either one may be prescribed by a physician to loosen congestion of the resident. 1. When humidifiers and vaporizers are in use, they must be kept clean. Germs thrive wherever there is water, thus, the device must be periodically drained and cleaned according to facility policy. Otherwise, the bacteria that accumulate can become vaporized into the air and affect the resident's lungs, where they can cause infection. 2. Prepare vaporizer/humidifier according to manufacturer's instructions. 3. Position vaporizer/humidifier on the bedside stand or nearby table. 4. Plug vaporizer into electrical outlet. 5. Steam should be permitted to flow generally into the room. Page 69 of 307 6. Frequently check the water level; refill as necessary. 7. Clean vaporizers/humidifiers routinely according to facility policy. I. CPAP/BIPAP - Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) is respiratory ventilation used to treat breathing disorders and supply a consistent pressure on inspiration and expiration. As mechanical ventilation, CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), or BIPAP (Bi -level Positive Airway Pressure) machines, are devices which help residents inhale more air into the lungs. Both of these devices are used for the treatment of medical disorders like COPD, pulmonary edema, et c. Settings of the machines are prescribed by the physician and may only be administered and adjusted by the licensed nurse. J. Ventilator - a machine that supports breathing. These machines are mainly used i n hospitals. Ventilators deliver oxygen into the lungs and remove carbon dioxide from the body. Carbon dioxide is a waste gas that can be toxi c. The ventilator breathes for people who have lost all ability to breathe on their own. Settings of the ventilator are prescribed by the physician and may only be adjusted by the licensed nurse. K. Safety Precautions 1. Remember oxygen supports combustion. 2. Fire hazards should be removed from the resident's room when oxygen is in use. 3. Never allow candles or open flames in the area where oxygen is in use. 4. Never allow smoking in the area where oxygen is in use. 5. Do not use electrical equipment (e.g., electric razors, hairdryers, electric blankets, and electric heaters) in an oxygen -enriched environment . Electr ical equipment may spark and cause a fire. 6. Do not use flammable products such as rubbing alcohol, or oil - based products such as Vaseline\u00ae near the oxygen. Use a water - based lubricant to moisten the resident's lips or nose.

Perineal Area - the area of the body between the genitals and the anus. Content : I. Bathing and Shampooing Points to Remember (see CARE SKILLS #1 8-22) A. Bathing is an opportunity to observe the resident's skin. Should a concern, such as lice, a new bruise, blister, rash or open area be noted, the nurse must be notified immediately . B. The resident's face, hands, underarms, and perineal area should be washed at least daily. C. The elderly may bathe only twice a week . Since their skin produces less perspiration and oil , frequent bathing could cause excessive dryness. D. Before beginning the bathing process, the caregiver should make certain the room is warm enough and all linens and supplies are gathered so the resident is not left alone. E. Respect the resident's privacy when transporting to and from the shower room and during the shower or bath. Be certain the resident's body is not unnecessarily exposed. F. If no-rinse soap or shampoo is used, be sure that it is diluted and/or used per manufacturer's instructions. Page 89 of 307 G. Never leave the resident unattended during bathing. H. Keep the water clean and at a comfortably warm temperature. I. Back rubs are often performed after bathing. They are a good way to help the resident relax, improve circulation, and decrease pain. When using lotion /oils for back rubs , be sure to warm in hands before applying to resident's skin. J. Hair should be shampooed at least weekly, unless otherwise noted in care plan. Hair should be combed daily and kept neat at all times. K. Not all residents can get out of bed to have their hair shampooed in the shower, tub, etc. There are hair products available so that water is not needed when shampooing hair in bed. Follow care plan to ensure proper hair products are being used when shampooing hair in bed. L. Do not use oils, lotions, powder, or other products that can cause the surface of showers, tubs, whirlpools, etc. to become slippery. M. Whirlpool baths increase circulation and promote wound healing. Be sure to follow manufacturer's instructions for filling the tub with water, getting the resident in and out of the tub, and for general use of the whirlpool tub. N. Always check the resid ent's care plan before providing care. Be sure to follow the care plan instructions at all times. II. Perineal and C atheter Care Points to Remember (see CARE SKILLS #19 ) A. Always wash from front to back. B. Be sure to change linens if they are soiled. C. Allow the resident to clean themselves if possible, assisting as needed. D.

Always allow the resident to do as much as possible for themselves. 2. Allow the resident to make choices and respect those choices. 3. Be sensitive to established routines of the resident, incorporating those routines into daily care, as possible. 4. Oral care (including denture care) must be performed at least twice a day, but it's recommended to occur more often. Unconscious oral care should be performed more frequently to keep resident's mouth moist. 5. Oral care reduces the number of pathogens in the mouth, improves the resident's sense of well -being and appearance and improves sense of taste, enhancing appetite. Page 92 of 307 6. Oral care eliminates particles from beneath the gums, preventing injury and improving ability to chew and consume meals. 7. Dentures should be handled carefully and stored in cool , clean water in a labeled denture cup when not in use. Be sure that the cup is kept in a safe place. Always follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning dentures. 8. The caregiver should observe for ill -fitting dentures and report concerns to the nurse. Ill -fitting dentures could affect speech and chewing ability, thus, ultimately affecting meal consumption and contributing to potential weight loss. 9. More frequent oral care is needed for residents who are unconscious, breathe through their mouth, are being given oxygen, are in the process of dying and/or are NPO. 10. Observe and report to nurse: irritation, raised areas, coated or swollen tongue, sores, complaint s of mouth pain, white spots, loose/chipped or decayed teeth. 11. Be certain that the resident wants you to shave him /her or assist him/her to shave before you begin. 12. Wear gloves when shaving a resident. 13. Be sure to dispose of razors in the sharps container accordingly. 14. Always use hair care products that the resident prefers for his/her type of hair. 15.

Report any unusual findings to nurse before continuing procedure. 17. Support the foot and ankle when providing foot care. 18. Poor circulation occurs in the resident with diabetes. Even a small sore on the foot can become a large wound. 19. Careful foot care, including regular daily inspection is important. 20. During foot care, the feet should be checked for irritation or sores and reported to the nurse, if observed. Page 93 of 307 21. Soak feet in warm water to soften nails. Remove feet one at a time and wash, using a soapy washcloth. Be sure to rinse soap from feet prior to drying them. 22. Toenails are to be cut straight across with heavy nail clippers. **Check with the charge nurse before trimming the resident's toenails. Residents with poor circulation to the feet or diseases such as diabetes will usually have their toenails trimmed by a podiatrist. For re sidents without these problems, you will need to trim the toenails regularly.

Ensure bedside commode is in good repair, clean and odor free and has intact rubber stops to prevent commode from moving with resident weight, potentially causing a fall. 2. After assisting a resident to toilet, it may be necessary for the nursing assistant to perform perineal care. a. Ensure the resident can stabilize while standing, utilizing a walker, side grab bars, and/or with the assistance of a second caregiver utilizing a gait/transfer belt. b. Make sure that the resident is standi ng firmly, with their feet spread apart. c. Wipe from front to back, using a different part of the washcloth for each stroke. Change the washcloth as necessary. d. Rinse the resident's perineum and pat it dry prior to raising undergarments or applying a brief. B. Bedpan/Fracture Pan (see CARE SKILLS #35 ) 1. A fracture pan is a bedpan that is flatter than a normal bedpan. It is used for residents who cannot assist to raise their hips onto a Page 96 of 307 regular bedpan. When using a fracture pan, position with the handle towar d the foot of the bed. If the resident cannot help, roll the resident onto their far side, slip the fracture pan under the hips and roll the resident back toward you onto the bedpan. 2. A standard bedpan is positioned with the wider part of the pan aligned with the resident's buttocks. C. Urinal (see CARE SKILLS #36) 1. Keep urinal in easy reach of resident. 2. Empty and clean urinal after each use. 3. Avoid using hot water to rinse the urinal. D. Bowel and Bladder Training 1. Incontinent residents may be identified as candidates for bowel and bladder training. If so, the following guidelines will apply: a.

CNA s are NOT allowed to disconnect the urinary drainage bag and/or tubing from the catheter. Only licensed nurses are allowed to change the drainage and/or leg bag. 3. Privacy bags should be used for residents with catheters. a. Privacy bags keep the catheter bag and its contents hidden from visitors and others in the facility, which improves privacy and dignity. b. Privacy bags help secure the drainage bag to wheelchairs, beds, etc., so that the drainage bag never touches the floor. 4. Be sure that the tubing and urinary drainage bag are not dragging or touching the floor as residents ambulate, especially when in a wheelchair. G. Urine Specimen Collection (see CARE SKILLS #38 ) 1. Random urine specimens do not have to be collected directly into the specimen container. Also, it is not necessary to clean the resident's genitalia before collecting the specimen. (Urine can be poured into the container from a bedpan, bedside commode, urinal, etc.) Clean- catch specimens are collected directly into the specimen container and should not include the first and last part of the urine voided. 2. If a clean -catch (midstream) urine specimen is ordered, using the towelettes supplied, the caregiver will assist the resident to clean the area around the meatus. For females, separate the labia. Wipe from front to back along one side. Discard the towelette. With a new towelette, wipe from front to back along the other side. Using a new towelette wipe down the middle. For males, clean the head of the penis. Use circular motions with the towelettes. Clean thoroughly, changing the towelette after each circular motion. D iscard after use. If the male is uncircumcised, pull back the foreskin of the penis before cleaning. Hold it back during urination. Make sure it is pulled back down after collecting the specimen. Ask the resident to begin urination, but to stop before urination is complete. Place the container under the urine stream and ask the resident to begin urinating again. Fill the container at least half full. Remove the Page 98 of 307 container and allow the resident to finish urinating in bedpan, urinal or toilet. H.

CARE SKILLS : Transfer Using Mechanical Lift - #53 Transfer to Stretcher/Shower Bed - #54 Transfer: Two Person/Lift - emergency only - #55 Review Question --- Lesson #16 1. The manufacturer's instructions state the mechanical lift can safely b e used by two qualified staff persons to transport a resident. The facility's policy states two qualified staff members are required to transport a resident. You were trained on how the lift functions and are competent to use it. Mrs. Smith would like to g et up in her wheelchair. You have the lift ready to assist in the transfer . Cindy, another CNA, is coming to help with the transfer. F ive minutes have passed, and Cindy has not arrived . It is acceptable for you to transfer Mrs. Smith by yourself. (True or False) Page 111 of 307 Lesson # 17 (2 hours) Title: Resident's Environment Lesson Objectives: I. The student will be able to demonstrate compet ence in making an occupied bed. Key Terms : Occupied Bed - bed made w hile a resident is in the bed. Content : I. Occupied Bed (see CARE SKILLS #56 ) A. Points to Remember 1. Wrinkles from the linens can cause problems with circulation and result in sores on the resident's skin. Keep sheets as wrinkle- free as possible. 2. Always le ave extra room at the foot of the bed for the toes to move freely. 3. Use safety precautions to ensure that the resident does not fall out of the bed. Follow facility protocol regarding side rails. 4. Keep the resident covered throughout the procedure to ensure privacy and comfort are maintained. 5. Before beginning an occupied bed change, check to see if the resident has tubes or lines attached to them. If so, be sure that the lines aren't being pulled or pinched during the linen change. a. Move the drainage bag to the side of the bed that the resident will be facing while the linens are being changed. Before moving to the second side of the bed, be sure to move the bag, so that the resident will again be facing it once turned onto their other side. 6. The CNA is never allowed to stop a feeding pump or to disconnect the feeding tube for any reason. If necessary, have the nurse stop the pump or disconnect the lines. Always be sure to notify the nurse when you are finished, so that the resident's feeding ca n be resumed. 7. Report to the nurse if the resident refuses to have the linens changed, or if the resident complains of pain before you begin. Page 112 of 307 CARE SKILLS : Occupied Bed - #56 Review Questions --- Lesson #17 1. Wrinkled sheets under a resident do not cause problems for their skin? (True or False) 2. You are beginning an occupied bed change for Mrs. Smith, who has an indwelling catheter with a urinary drainage bag attached. Which side of the bed should you place t he bag on, if you are about to turn Mrs. Smith onto her left side? Page 113 of 307 Lesson # 18 (2 hours) Title: Skin Care/Pressure Prevention Lesson Objectives: I. The student will be able to explain t he importance of an intact integumentary system and basic skin care. II. The student will be able to describe residents at risk for skin breakdown. III. The student will be able to describe the need for pressure reducing devices. Key Terms : Bony Prominence - area of the body where the bone is in close proximity to the skin (e.g., ankles, hip bones, elbows, etc.). Dermis - inner layer of skin. Epidermis - outer layer of skin. Friction - skin repeatedly rubs another surface. Integumentary System - skin and as sociated structures that form a natural protective covering for the body Offload - assisting a resident to stand, to completely remove the pressure from the area; Any process in which pressure on the appendage is reduced Pressure Point - any area on the body that bears the body's weight when lying or sitting and where a bone is close to the skin's surface. Pressure Sore (also called \"Bed Sore\" or \"Decubitus Ulcer\") - a localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue. Usually occurs over a bony prominence as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear and/or friction. Reverse Push -Up - asking a resident to lift up off their buttocks using their arms in a reverse push- up. Shear - skin stays in one position, but underlying bone and tissu e roll in the opposite direction. Subcutaneous tissue - the lowest layer of skin; fatty tissue. Page 114 of 307 Content : I.

Wound or ulcer xiv. Redness or broken ski n between toes or around nails. II. Risk Factors f or Skin Breakdown A. Sensory Perception 1. The ability to feel pressure. In general, people move regularly to keep pressure from building up. 2. Individuals with limited sensory perception may not realize they have not moved for a while, which increases their risk for pressure ulcers. Medications, medical conditions, or mental status may all cause an individual's sensory perception to change. B. Moisture 1. Healthy skin stays clean and dry. Individuals at risk of pressure ulcers may have skin that stays moist because of incontinence (urine or stool) or perspiration (sweat). When an area at risk for a pressure ulcer is moist, a pressure ulcer is more likely to form. Page 117 of 307 C. Activity 1. Activity means an individual's ability to physically move (like walking). Individuals who can walk rarely get pressure ulcers. Individuals who are bedfast or chair bound are at higher risk of developing pressure ulcers. D. Mobility 1. Mobility refers to the ability to change and control body position. Individuals with good mobility move their bodies regularly. Individuals who are immobile or have limited mobility are at greater risk for developing pressure ulcers because they cannot move to relieve the pressure. E. Nutrition 1. Everyone needs to eat the right food and drink enough liquids to stay healthy. Individuals who do not eat enough of the right foods or drink enough of the right liquids are at greater risk for pressure ulcers because their bodies do not have the energy they need. F. Friction and Shear 1. Friction happens when skin rubs another surface over and over (like a rough wheelchair seat rubbing the back of the individual's leg). 2. Shear is similar to friction, but it occurs when skin stays in one position but the underlying bone and tissue roll in the opposite direction (like someone sliding across a bed). 3. The rubbing and pulling of friction and shear break down the skin, which contributes to pressure ulcer s. Pressure ulcers are more likely to develop when there is increased shear or friction. G. Additional Risk Factors 1. Chronic conditions or illnesses (diabetes, cancer) - body is fighting several problems at once. 2. Age- skin becomes fragile and breaks d own easily. 3. Medical devices - the device may rub the skin over and over or cause pressure to that area. Page 118 of 307 4. Depression or mental illness - Higher risk due to individuals neglects their own care. 5. History of pressure ulcers - old pressure ulcer scars make the skin in that area weaker and more likely to break down. III. Pressure Ulcer Development A. Skin breakdown can develop when individuals stay in one position for too long (as little as two hours) without shifting their weight. B. The pressure of body weight reduces blood supply, causing skin and surrounding tissue to become damaged or even die. C. Pressure ulcers can be painful. They can cause infection, damage to muscle and bone, and even death. 1. For the stages of pressure sores, please refer to the picture in the Appendix A. D. Treatment can take weeks, months, or years. IV. Prevention of Skin Breakdown A. Observe skin upon admission and during the provision of daily care 1. Skin Inspection (See CARE SKILLS # 57) a. Drape resident to allow you to see, feel and smell the area you are inspecting. This can easily be done when the individual is dressing or undressing. b. Remove pressure - Lift heels, turn or move t he individual to inspect the skin. i. Report to the nurse if you find redness that is not relieved within 15 minutes of removing pressure. c. Inspect - Focus on bony prominences, where pressure ulcers are most likely to develop. Observe and prevent skin - to-skin contact. Additional areas at risk are the ears, under the breasts, the scrotum , and any skin- to-skin contact. d. Note observations and report to the nurse - When a potential problem is observed, notify the nurse for assessment of the area. Page 119 of 307 i. Report areas of discoloration, blisters, skin tears, changes in the way the skin feels, or any other area(s) of concern. B. Encourage and maintain nutrition and hydration. C. Manage moisture by providing prompt care. D. Minimize pressure. 1. Pressure -reducing mattress 2. Pressure -reducing cushion to chair a. Heel boots - specialty devices that surround the feet and calves and create a cushion between the heels and the bed. They should not be used with residents who walk. The manufacturer's instructions must be followed. b. When using any device, check the other areas of t he legs to ensure you are not moving the pressure to another area, like the calves. 3. Other pressure- reducing devices a. Use pillows to float heels (See CARE SKILLS #58 ) when residents are in bed. Pillows should also be used to help reduce pressure under top arm when resident is side- lying. b. Bed cradles (See CARE SKILLS #59 ) can be used to keep covers from touching toes when residents are in bed. Be sure to use per manufacturer's instructions and drape top covers over the cradle properly. E. Prevent Fri ction and Shearing 1. Do not pull residents across surfaces when repositioning or transferring. 2. Use the draw sheet to turn, lift, or move residents who are in bed. 3. Ask for assistance when turning, lifting, or moving residents. F. Identify resident s who have been assessed by nursing as \"at risk\". 1. Braden Scale- standardized risk assessment tool completed by the nurse. Page 120 of 307 2. Newly -admitted residents are likely to fall into this category, due to the number of risk factors they face and the sudden chang e(s) in their body.

The student will be able to demonstrate competence in proper feeding techniques and provision of assistance for the resident with special nee ds. II. The student will be able to explain the importance of following care guidelines for a resident receiving tube feedings and observations of resident condition that must be reported, if observed. Key Terms : Aspiration - inhalation of food or drink into lungs which has the potential to cause pneumonia or death. Gastrostomy Tube (G -Tube) - tube placed through the abdomen directly into the stomach and used to provide nourishment. Jejunostomy (J -Tube) - tube placed into the second part of the small intestines and used to provide nourishment. Nasogastric Tube - tube placed through the nose to the stomach and used to provide nourishment. PEG (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy) - tube placed endoscopically, directly into the stomach and used to provide nourishment. Often called a \"G -tube\". Content : I. Promoting Proper Nutrition and Hydration A. Fluid Balance 1. Observe for signs of dehydration and report to the nurse: a. Mild symptoms (include but are not limited to): thirst, loss of appetite, dry skin, flushed skin, dark colored urine, dry mouth, fatigue or weakness, chills. b. Advancing dehydration symptoms (include but are not limited to ): increased heart rate, increased respirations, decreased sweating, decreased urination, increased body temperature, extreme fatigue, muscle cramps, headaches, and nausea. Page 122 of 307 c. severe dehydration symptoms (include but are not limited to)- muscle spasms, vom iting, racing pulse, shriveled skin, dim vision, painful urination, confusion, difficulty breathing, seizures. 2. Observe for and report to the nurse signs of fluid overload which may include: a. stretched and shiny -looking skin over a swollen area, increased abdomen size (ascites), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (pulmonary edema), tightness of jewelry, clothing or accessories, low output of urine, even when the resident is drinking as much fluid as normal, a dimple in the skin covering the swollen area that remains for a few seconds after the pressing finger has been released. b. Symptoms of more serious fluid overload include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath when lying down, coughing, cold hands or feet. c. Measure Intake & Output accurately. II. Promoting the Use of Proper Feeding Technique/Assisting a Resident with Special Needs (See CARE SKILLS #6 0) NOTE - The caregiver should provide any necessary care and offer to assist the resident to toilet prior to meal service in an effort to promote a positive experience. A. Tips for f eeding 1. As a safety precaution, never leave a resident who needs to be fed unattended with a t ray. 2. Add salt, pepper, sugar, condiments, etc., to the resident's preference and in accordance with their prescribed diet. Adding the extra flavor can help increase their appetite. 3. Reheat food if necessary. 4. Do not eat while feeding residents. 5. Avoid talking to coworkers, or others in the room, as it can make the resident feel neglected or unimportant and cause them to stop eating. Page 123 of 307 B. Assistive Devices 1. Plate guards 2. Utensils with enlarged (built -up) handles 3. Drinking cups (nosey cups) 4. Divided plates 5. Non-skid plate/place mat C. Visually impaired 1. Speak in a normal tone while facing the resident. 2. Read menu to the resident. 3. Position their food on the plate according to hands of a clock. Explain where food items are on plate. 4. When feeding the resident, ask them to open their mouth at appropriate time. 5. When feeding the resident, tell them what food you are giving them. D. History of stroke 1. Place food in resident's sight. 2. Supply assistive device(s), as appropriate, t o unaffected side. 3. Report any difficulty swallowing and observe for signs of choking. 4. Report to nurse coughing and/or observed pocketing of food. 5. When feeding the resident, make sure the resident swallows before giving more food. 6. If resident's mouth is paralyzed, place food on the unaffected side when feeding. E. History of Parkinson's Disease 1. Supply assistive devices, as appropriate. 2. Food and drinks should be placed within reach. 3. Assist the resident as needed; promote independence. Page 124 of 307 III. Caring for a Resident with a Tube Feeding and the Resident at Risk for Aspiration A. Tube Feedings 1. Feeding tubes are used when food cannot pass normally from the mouth into the esophagus and then into the stomach. The resident who is unable to take food or fluids by mouth, or is unable to swallow, may be fed through a tube. The two types of tubes most commonly used in long -term care facilities are nasogastric tubes and gastrostomy tubes. 2. A nasogastric (NG) tube is a tube that is placed thro ugh the nose into the stomach. (\"Naso\" is the medical term for nose and \"gastric\" means stomach.) It may be abbreviated as NG tube. An NG tube may also be used by the nurse to suction and remove fluids from the body. 3. A gastrostomy tube (g -tube) is a tube that is placed directly into the stomach for feeding. A small surgical opening is made through the abdominal wall into the stomach, and the tube is sutured to hold it in place. This type of tube is often used for a resident who may need tube feedings for a long time. The abbreviation for a gastrostomy tube is G -tube. This tube can also be called a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube. 4. Usually the NG tube or the G -tube will be attached to an electronic feeding pump that controls the flow of fluid. Most pumps have an alarm that s ounds when something is wrong. You must notify the nurse immediately if the alarm sounds. 5. The resident who has a feeding tube should be observed frequently. If the pump is not working properly, the resident may receive the wrong amount of food or the fluid may enter too quickly. This can cause nausea, vomiting, and aspiration. The NG tube may have moved out of the stomach and into the lungs. Aspiration pneumonia may result if feeding enters the lungs. 6. Residents with feeding tubes are often NPO. NPO is the abbreviation for nothing by mouth. PO is the abbreviation used when a person can have something by mouth. 7. Do not give the resident who has a feeding tube anything to eat or drink without checking with the nurse. 8. The NG tube is uncomfortable and irritating to the nose and throat. The G - tube may become dislodged from the stomach, or the skin Page 125 of 307 may become irrit ated at the site of insertion. Infection can occur with either tube, if infection control practices are not carefully followed. 9. The resident with a feeding infusing should not lie flat. The head of the bed should be elevated at least 30\u00b0. Some procedures will need to be changed slightly for the resident with a feeding tube. For example, an occupied bed cannot be flattened to change the linen or to provide incontinence c are with the feeding infusing. If the bed must be flattened, seek the nurse's assistance to t urn off the pump prior to the procedure and turn the pum p back on after the procedure. Your major responsibility concerning the resident with a feeding tube is to make regular observations and promptly report any problem. 10. Report any choking or coughing to the nurse immediately. B. Observations to be reported to the nurse immediately: 1. Nausea 2. Discomfort during the tube feeding 3. Vomiting 4. Diarrhea 5. Distended (enlarged and swollen) abdomen 6. Coughing 7. Complaints of indigestion or heart burn 8. Redness, swelling, drainage, odor, or pain at the tube insertion site 9. Elevated temperature 10. Signs and symptoms of respiratory distress 11. Increased pulse rate 12. Complaints of flatulence (gas) C. Comfort Measures 1. The resident with a feeding tube is usually NPO. Dry mouth, dry lips, and sore throat are sources of discomfort. The resident's care plan will include frequent oral hygiene and lubricant for the lips. Page 126 of 307 D. Risk of Aspiration 1. Any resident with ordered thickened liquids, a pureed or mechanical soft diet, or having a diagnosis of esophageal reflux, GERD, or respiratory difficulty is a resident who is at risk of aspiration. The caregiver must always elevate the head of the bed or assist the resident to an upright position prior to offering food or fluids if the resident is at risk of choking/aspiration. Should a resident begin to cough, gurgle or regurgitate, attempts to feed should STOP and the nurse should be alerted immediately to assess the resident. 2. Residents at risk of choking/aspi ration should be encouraged to sit up or remain with the head of the bed elevated for at least 30 minutes (or as long as tolerated) following consumption of food or fluids. 3. Know your residents and ensure residents receive snacks, meals and fluids at the ordered consistency. CARE SKILLS : Feeding - #60 Review Questions --- Lesson #19 1. Name two symptoms of dehydration. 2. When a tube feeding is infusing, the head of the bed must be elevated. (True or False) Page 127 of 307 Lesson # 20 (8 hours) Title: Basic Nursing Skills (Vital Signs, Height and Weight) Lesson Objectives: I. The student will be able to demonstrate competence in completion of initial steps to be taken prior t o initiating a procedure as well as final steps following any procedure executed. II. The student will be able to demonstrate competence in taking and recording vital signs. III. The student will be able to demonstrate competence in measuring and recording height and weight. Key Terms : Apical Pulse - located on the left side of the chest, under the breastbone; taken with a stethoscope. Brachial Pulse - located at the bend of the elbow, used for taking blood pressure measurement. Carotid Pulse - located on either side of the neck, supplies the head and neck with oxygenated blood. Diastolic Blood Pressure - the phase when the heart relaxes; the pressure in the arteries between heartbeats . bottom number of blood pressure reading Expiration - exhaling air out o f the lungs. Hypertension - high blood pressure. Hypotension - low blood pressure. Inspiration - breathing air into the lungs. Orthostatic Hypotension - a drop in blood pressure when a resident suddenly rises from a lying to a sitting or standing position. Pulse Oximetry - a procedure used to measure the oxygen level (or oxygen saturation) in the blood. It is considered to be a noninvasive, painless, general indicator of oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues (such as the finger, earlobe, or nose). Radial pulse - the pulse site found on the inside of the wrist. Respiration - the process of breathing air into lungs and exhaling air out of the lungs. Page 128 of 307 Systolic Blood Pressure - the phase when the heart is at work, contracting and pushing blood from the left ventricle; the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats ; top number of a blood pressure reading Content : I. Initial Steps - These are consistent steps to be taken prior to executing any procedure with a resident. (See CARE SKILLS #1). A. Includes asking the nurse about the resident's needs, abilities and limitations. B. Includes following infection control guidelines and providing the resident privacy during care. II. Final Steps - These are consistent steps to be taken following the completion of any procedure with a resident. (See CARE SKILLS #2). A. Includes ensuring the r esident is comfortable and safe. B. Includes removing supplies and equipment from the resident's room and reporting any unexpected findings to the nurse and documenting care provided. III. Vital signs provide important information A. How the body is functioning B. How the resident is responding to treatment C. How the resident's condition is changing D. Taking and Recording Vital Signs 1. Temperature (oral, axillary, tympanic) - the measurement of heat in the body affect ed by time of day, age, exercise, emotional state, environmental temperature, medication, illness and menstruation. Types of thermometers include glass, electronic with probe cover, paper/plastic tape, tympanic with probe cover. Glass thermometers are seld om used. NOTE* A facility may have specific instructions in regard to equipment to be used and/or the cleaning and disinfection of common use equipment for those residents who require isolation. The facility policies should be followed in regard to residents in isolation. Page 129 of 307 a. Oral (by mouth) - normal range 97.6 to 99.6 F (See CARE SKILLS # 61) b. Axillary (placed in the armpit) - normal range 96.6- 98.6 F (See CARE SKILLS # 62) c. Aural/tympanic (placed in ear) - normal range 98.6- 100.6 F d. The above ranges are for general use. Report values that are more than 2.4 degrees from the resident's baseline (normal) temperature. 2. Pulse rate is the measurement of the number of heart beats per minute - Normal range 60 - 100 (See CARE SKILLS # 63) a. Affected by age, sex, emotions, body position, medications, illness, fever, physical activity and fitness level. i. Pulse points most often used are: carotid, apical, radial, and brachial ii. When taking the pulse rate , note the rate (number of beats per minute) , rhythm and force. 3. Respirations/Respiratory Rate - the measurement of the number of times a person inhales per minute - Normal rate is 12- 20 (See CARE SKILLS # 63). a. Affected by age, sex, emotional stress, medication, lung disease, heat and cold, heart disease, and physical activity. b. When taking respirations, note rate (number of respirations per minute; rhythm (the regularity or irregularity of breathing); and character (the type of breathing, such as shallow, deep or labored). c. Without r emoving your fingers from resident's wrist (or stethoscope from resident's chest), count respirations after taking pulse, so that the resident is unaware that their breathing is being monitored. d. If resident is agitated or sleeping, place hand on resident's chest to feel it rise and fall during breathing. 4. Pulse Ox - A pulse oximeter continuously measures the level of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the arterial blood. (See CARE SKILLS # 64) Page 130 of 307 a. Affected by poor circulation, movement, bright lig ht, nail polish and fake nails (if probe is placed on finger). b. Place probe on opposite arm of blood pressure cuff. c. Normal ranges are typically between 95% -100% but can vary from person to person. Report an increase or decrease in oxygen levels to the nurse. 5. Blood Pressure - A measurement of the force the blood exerts against the walls of the arteries. Normal range for Systolic blood pressure is 90 -139; Normal range for Diastolic blood pressure is 60-89. (See CARE SKILLS #65 ) a. Abnormally high blood pressure is called hypertension. Measurements higher than 140/90 are considered high for adults. b. Abnormally low blood pressure is called hypotension. Measurements below 90/60 are considered low for adults. c. Electronic equipment may provide both odd and even numbers for someone's BP . However, a manual cuff only displays even numbers. d. The above ranges are for general use. It is important to know the resident's baseline (normal) BP range and to report values obtained outside of that range to the nurse. * Caution: If resident has a history of mastectomy or has a dialysis access, the blood pressure is not to be taken on the affected side/extremity. IV. Measuring Height and Weight A. Height (See CARE SKILLS # 66) 1. Residents who are able to stand should utilize a standing balance scale. 2. Residents who are unable to stand should be measured while lying flat in bed. Height can be determined by using a tape measure to measure the distance between a mark made at the top of the resident's head and one made at the bottom of the resident's feet. 3. Residents who are unable to lay flat in bed should be m easured using a tape measure. Follow the procedure used by the facility to determine height in this manner. Page 131 of 307 B. Weight - (See CARE SKILLS # 67) 1. Have resident wear the same type of clothing each time he/she is weighed. 2.

The student will be able to explain the need for monitoring physical restr aint use and routine release. III. The student will be able to describe devices which are enabling versus restrictive. IV. The student will be able to explain the potential negative outcomes of side rail use. Key Terms : Chemical Restraint - any drug that is used for discipline or convenience and not required to treat medical symptoms. A drug used to restrict the freedom of movement of a resident or sedate a resident. Convenience - any action taken by the facility to control or manage a resident's behavior with a lesser amount of effort by the facility and not in the resident's best interest. Discipline - any action taken by the facility for the purpose of punishing or penalizing residents. Entrapment - the act of getting caught in or trapped in something. Medical Symptom - an indication or characteristic of a physical or psychological condition. Physical Restraint - any manual method or physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment attached or adjacent to the resident's body that t he individual cannot remove easily which restricts freedom of movement or normal access to one's body. Side Rail - a barrier device attached to the side of a bed. Page 134 of 307 Content : I. Physical Restraint A. Resident Rights - The resident has the right to be free from any physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience, and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms. B. Types - \"Physical restraints\" include, but are not limited to, leg restraints, arm restraints, hand mitts, soft ties or vests, lap cushions, and lap trays the resident cannot remove easily. Also included as restraints are facility practices that meet the definition of a restraint, such as: 1. Using side rails that ke ep a resident from voluntarily getting out of bed; 2. Tucking in or using Velcro to hold a sheet, fabric, or clothing tightly so that a resident's movement is restricted; 3. Using devices in conjunction with a chair, such as trays, tables, bars or belts, t hat the resident cannot remove easily, that prevent the resident from rising; 4. Placing a resident in a chair that prevents a resident from rising; and 5. Placing a chair or bed so close to a wall that the wall prevents the resident from rising out of the chair or voluntarily getting out of bed. C. Medical Symptoms/Rationale for Use - an indication or characteristic of a physical or psychological condition for which the device improves the resident's function or quality of life. D. Guidelines for Applying Restraints (See CARE SKILLS #68 ) 1. A restraint shall be applied by an individual who has been properly trained, according to facility policy. 2. A restraint shall be applied in a manner that permits rapid removal in case of fire or another emergency. 3. Check pulse in area to ensure circulation is not occluded (cut off ) 4. Nursing Assistants can only use/apply restraint when instructed to do so by the charge nurse. Page 135 of 307 E. Monitoring and Release 1. A record of physical restraint and seclusion of a resident shall be kept. 2. Each resident under restraint and seclusion shall be visited by a member of the nursing staff at least once every hour and more frequently if the resident's condition requires. If the restraint is not applied correctly, the resident can suff er serious injuries or even death. It is important to check the resident frequently (every 15 minutes) to ensure that circulation and bony prominences are not affected by the restraint. If the restraint is not removed frequently, the skin in the area can easily become irritated and even begin to breakdown. Restraints can also affect the resident mentally. They can cause the resident to suffer from anxiety, stress, depression, sleep disturbances, and loss of dignity. 3. Each physically restrained or secluded individual shall be temporarily released from restraint or seclusion at least every two (2) hours or more often if necessary except when the resident is asleep. * When the resident in restraint is temporarily released, the resident shall be assisted to am bulate, toileted, or changed in position as the resident's physical condition permits. F. Self-Releasing Devices - Devices used as a reminder that the resident needs to call for assistance and/or to assist to keep the resident seated; the resident can self -release the device upon request. Thus, the device does not restrict freedom of voluntary movement. G. Side rails - Side rails sometimes restrain residents. The use of side rails as restraints is prohibited unless they are necessary to treat a resident's medical symptoms. Residents who attempt to exit a bed through, between, over or around side rails are at risk of injury or death. The potential for serious injury is more likely from a fall from a bed with raised side rails than from a fall from a bed wher e side rails are not used. They also potentially increase the likelihood that the resident will spend more time in bed and fall when attempting to transfer from the bed. The same device may have the effect of restraining one individual but not another, depending on the individual resident's condition and circumstances. For example, partial rails may assist one resident to enter and exit the bed independently while acting as a restraint for another. Orthotic body devices may be used solely for therapeutic pu rposes to improve the overall functional capacity of the resident. Page 136 of 307 H. Entrapment Zones 1. Ensure that the resident do es not get caught between the bed and/or mattress and/or side rails. Being trapped between the spaces can result in serious injury or deat h. 2. Refer to the picture in the Appendix to identify zones on the bed where entrapment can occur. I. An enclosed framed wheeled walker, with or without a posterior seat, would not meet the definition of a restraint if the resident could easily open the front gate and exit the device. If the resident cannot open the front gate (due to cognitive or physical limitations or because the device has been altered to prevent the resident from exiting the device), the enclosed framed wheeled walker would meet th e definition of a restraint since the device would restrict the resident's freedom of movement (e.g. , transferring to another chair, to the commode, or into the bed). The decision on whether framed wheeled walkers are a restraint must be made on an individual basis. CARE SKILLS Application of Physical Restraints - #68 Review Questions --- Lesson #21 1.

Dementia - a general term that refers to serious loss of mental abilities, such as thinking, remembering, judgement, reasoning, and communicating. Dementia is not a normal part of aging. D. Alzheimer's disease - a progressive, degenerative and irreversible disease. Alzheimer's disease is caused by the formation of tangled nerve fibers and protein deposits in the brain. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by stages: 1. Stage 1 - no impairment (normal function) - the resident does not experience any memory problems. 2. Stage 2 - very mild cognitive decline (may be normal age- related changes or earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease) - the resident may feel as if he or she is having memory lapses - forge tting familiar words or the location of everyday objects. 3. Stage 3 - mild cognitive decline (early stage Alzheimer's can be diagnosed in some, but not all, individuals with these symptoms) - friends, family or co -workers begin to notice difficulties. a. Noticeable problems coming up with the right word or name. b. Trouble remembering names when introduced to new people. c. Having noticeably greater difficulty performing tasks in social or work settings. d. Forgetting material that one has just read. e. Losing or misplacing a valuable object. f.

Become confused about where they are or what day it is. 6. Stage 6 - severe cognitive decline (moderately severe or mid- stage Alzheimer's disease) memories continues to worsen, personality changes may take place and individuals need extensive help with daily activities. At this stage, residents may: a. Lose awareness of recent experiences as well as of their surroundings. b. Remember their own name but have difficulty with their personal history. c. Distinguish familiar and unfamiliar faces but have trouble remembering the name of a spouse or caregiver. d. Need help dressing properly and may, without supervision, make mistakes such as putting pajamas over daytime clothes or shoes on the wrong feet. e.

Stage 7 - very severe cognitive decline (severe or late -stage Alzheimer's disease) - in the final stages of this disease, residents lose the ability to respond to their environment, to carry on a conversation and, eventually, to control movement. They may still say words or phrases. At this stage, residents need help with much of their daily personal care, including eating or using the toilet. They may also lose the ability to smile, to sit without support and to hold their heads up. Reflexes become abnormal. Muscles grow rigid. Swallowing impaired. II.

Eating/Meals Helping with Nutrition : Many people with Alzheimer's have challenges with eating. An individual might lose his/her appetite or the ability to evaluate if food is too hot or cold. In addition, an individual might forget that he/she has eaten and ask you for another meal. The individual may be experiencing physical difficulties t hat are causing the changes in eating habits. Sores in the mouth, poor -fitting dentures, gum disease or dry mouth may make eating difficult. Individuals will lose the ability to recognize and use utensils appropriately. To ensure the individual with dementia is receiving the proper nutrition, you must work to prevent eating and nutrition problems. Consult with the individual's physician and/or dietician for guidance. 1. Schedule meals at regular times. 2. Provide adequate lighting and space. 3. Avoid delays - have meal ready, i.e., pre -cut, opened cartons or packages. 4. Watch temperatures - avoid very hot foods. 5. Simple (white) dishes, no extra items which could confuse resident. 6.

Common sleep changes Many people with Alzheimer's experience changes in their sleep patterns. Scientists do not completely understand why this happens. As with changes in memory and behavior, sleep changes somehow result from the impact of Alzheimer's on the brain. Many older adults without dementia also notice changes in their sleep, but these disturbances occur more frequently and tend to be more severe in Alzheimer's. There is evidence that sleep changes are more common in later stages of the disease, but some studies have also found them in early stages. Sleep changes in Alzheimer's may include: 1. Difficulty sleeping. Many people with Alzheimer's wake up more often and stay awake longer during the night. Brain wave studies show decreases in both dreaming and non -dreaming sleep stages. Those who cannot sleep may wander, be unable to lie still, or yell or call out, disrupting the sleep of their caregivers. 2. Daytime napping and other shifts in the sleep- wake cycle. Individuals may feel very drowsy during the day and then be unable to sleep at night. They may become restless or agitated in the late afternoon or early evening, an experience often called \"sun -Page 168 of 307 downing.\" Experts estimate that in late stages of Alzheimer's, individuals spend about 40 percent of their time in bed at night awake and a significant part of their daytime sleeping. In extreme cases, people may have a complete reversal of the usual daytime wakefulness -nighttime sleep pattern. B. Contributing medical factors A person experiencing sleep disturbances should have a thorough medical exam to identify any treatable illnesses that may be contributing to the problem. Examples of conditions that can make sleep problems worse include: 1. Depression 2. Restless legs syndrome, a disorder in which unpleasant \"crawling\" or \"tinglin g\" sensations in the legs cause an overwhelming urge to move them. 3. Sleep apnea, an abnormal breathing pattern in which people briefly stop breathing many times a night, resulting in poor sleep quality. * For sleep changes due primarily to Alzheimer's disease, there are non-drug and drug approaches to treatment. Most experts and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) strongly encourage use of non- drug measures rather than medication. * Studies have found that sleep medications generally do not improve overall sleep quality for older adults. Use of sleep medications is associated with a greater chance of falls and other risks that may outweigh the benefits of treatment. C. Non-drug treatments for sleep changes Non-drug treatments aim to improve sleep routine and the sleeping environment and reduce daytime napping. Non- drug coping strategies should always be tried before medications, since some sleep medications can cause serious side effects. To create an inviting sleeping environment and promote rest for a person with Alzheimer's: 1. Maintain regular times for meals and for going to bed and getting up. 2. Seek morning sunlight exposure. 3. Encourage regular daily exercise, but no later than four hours before bedtime. Page 169 of 307 4. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. 5. Treat any pain. Be alert to verbal and non -verbal cues for pain. 6. Make sure the bedroom temperature is comfortable. 7. Provide nightlights and security objects. 8. If the person awakens, discourage staying in bed while awake; use the bed only for slee p. 9. Discourage watching television during periods of wakefulness. 10. 12 Tips to promote Regular Sleep Patterns a. Try keeping bedtime rituals consistent. b. Go to bed at similar times each night. c. Close blinds to demonstrate differences in light lev els. d. Keep lighting dim. Use night lights if there is a safety problem or the dark promotes anxiety. e. Relaxing in a bathtub or having a warm shower can promote sleep. f. A peaceful evening with less stimulation may encourage sleep. Play any music softl y, choose relaxing music, T.V . programs. g. A snack before bed may help. Hunger can wake and make a person restless. h. Restrict caffeine and excess intake of fluids before bedtime. i. Use the bathroom before going to bed. j. Restlessness during the night may be due to hunger, the need to go to the bathroom, heat or cold, discomfort. k. Discourage naps in the day. If a nap is important try to limit the time. l. Encourage exercise and stimulating activities in the day. Page 170 of 307 Review Questions --- Lesson #25 1.

Page 284 of 307 CARE SKILLS # 64: PRACTICAL USE OF THE PULSE OXIMETER (Lesson #20) STEP - Initial Steps: Turn the pulse oximeter on: it will go through internal calibration and checks. RATIONALE 1. Select the appropriate probe with particular attention to correct sizing and where it will go (usually finger, toe or ear). 1. If used on a finger or toe, make sure the area is clean. Remove any nail varnish. 2. Connect the probe to the pulse oximeter. 3. Position the probe carefully; make sure it fits easily without being too loose or too tight. 3. If possible, avoid the arm being used for blood pressure monitoring as cuff inflation will interrupt the pulse oximeter signal. 4. Allow several seconds for the pulse oximeter to detect the pulse and calculate the oxygen saturation. 5. Look for the displayed pulse indicator that shows that the machine has detected a pulse. Without a pulse signal, any readings are meaningless. 6. Once the unit has detected a good pulse, the oxygen saturation and pulse rate will be displayed. 7. Like all machines, oximeters may occasionally give a false reading - if in doubt, rely on your clinical judgment, rather than the machine. 7. The function of the oximeter probe can be checked by placing it on your own finger. Aide is to record pulse ox % (as in other vital signs) . 9. Adjust the volume of the audi ble pulse beep to a comfortable level for your theatre - ever use on silent. 9. Always make sure the alarms are on. 10.

Rest resident's arm, level with heart, palm upward on comfortable surface. 3. A false low reading is possible, if arm is above heart level. 4. Wrap proper sized sphygmomanometer cuff around upper unaffected arm approximately 1- 2 inches above elbow. 4. Cuff must be proper size and placed on arm correctly so amount of pressure on artery is correct. If not, reading will be falsely high or low. 5. Put earpieces of stethoscope in ears. 5. Earpieces should fit into ears snugly to make hearing easier. 6. Place diaphragm of stethoscope over brachial artery at elbow. 7. Close valve on bulb. If blood pressure is known, inflate cuff to 20 mm/hg above the usual reading. If blood pressure is unknown, inflate cuff to 30 mm/hg past the point of occlusion. 7. Inflatin g cuff too high is painful and may damage small blood vessels. 8. Slowly open valve on bulb. 8. Releasing valve slowly allows you to hear beats accurately. 9. Watch gauge and listen for sound of pulse. 10. Note gauge reading at first pulse sound. 10. First sound is systolic pressure . 11. Note gauge reading when pulse sound disappears or changes. 11. Last sound is diastolic pressure. 12. Completely deflate and remove cuff. 12. An inflated cuff left on resident's arm can cause numbness and tingling. If you must take blood pressure again, completely deflate cuff and wait 30 seconds. Never partially deflate a cuff and then pump it up again. Blood vessels will be damaged and reading will be falsely high or low. Page 286 of 307 13. Accurately record systolic and diastolic readings. 13. Record readings immediately so you won't forget.

Page 289 of 307 CARE SKILLS # 68: APPLICATION OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS (Lesson #21) STEP - Initial Steps: Check the resident's care plan/closet care plan first. RATIONALE 1. Check with the nurse before gathering supplies. Verify the type of restraint that was ordered for the resident. The NA should ensure that he/she was properly trained by the facility on how to use the restraint per the manufacturer's instructions and facili ty's policy. 1. NA/CNA can only use/apply restraints when instructed to do so by the charge nurse. Ensures that the correct restraint will be used, as ordered by the physician. NA/CNA should not apply a restraint that he/she has not received training for . Although restraints appear the same, manufacturers can provide different instructions/guidance for use and application. Improper application can result in serious harm and/or death for the resident. 2. Do initial steps. 3. Follow manufacturer's ins tructions and facility's policy on applying the restraint. 3. Same as previously stated. 4. If resident is in bed, be sure to tie restraint to the part of the bed that moves with the resident. Never tie restraints to side rails or the fixed part of the bed frame (that does not move with the resident when repositioning). 4. Tying restraints to the fixed portion of the frame or to side rails will cause the restraint to tighten as the bed is moved for positioning. This can cause discomfort, pain, and probl ems with circulation and lead to more serious concerns. 5. Make sure that the restraint is not too tight.
