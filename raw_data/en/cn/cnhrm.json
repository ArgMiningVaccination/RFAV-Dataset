Topic summary contributed by volunteer(s): John A respiratory infection occurs when respiratory epithelium lining the upper and/or lower tract are overcome by a virus, bacteria, or fungus. Upper respiratory infection is usually not serious, like the [common \"cold\"](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/common-cold) or sinus infection. On the other hand, lower respiratory tract infection may be serious or even life threatening, such as [pneumonia](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/pneumonia/) where pus fills the air sacs. Things that may increase the risk of respiratory infection are strenuous [exercise](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/exercise), [asthma](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/asthma), [allergies](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/allergies), and [immune suppression](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function) (i.e., from cancer, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medications). Recent studies have strongly suggested that [children](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/children) with asthma have fewer flare-ups and steroid usage when they go on a [plant-based](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/plant-based-diets) diet rich in [fruits](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/fruit), [vegetables](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vegetables), and grains, and eliminate animal products ( [meat](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/meat), fish, dairy, [eggs](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/eggs)). There are things we can do to protect ourselves from respiratory infection, such as hand washing and avoiding others' coughing and sneezing fits. Even [gargling](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/gargling/) helps rinse away potential invading organisms. Other preventative measures are moderate exercise, which may strengthen the respiratory epithelium, and controlling asthma and allergies.

Burning incense has been found to generate about four times the particulate matter as burning cigarettes. We need to reform the food system before it's too late. There may be an even deadlier pandemic threat waiting in the wings...of chickens. What should we expect in the coming months and years with SARS-CoV-2? Twenty different materials put to the test. Can pets like cats and dogs get infected and be infectious? My recipes for DIY hand sanitizer and surface disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2. How long can the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus survive on surfaces like paper? Zinc may help slow the replication of other coronaviruses, but what about SARS-CoV-2? Are there immune-boosting foods we should be eating? There are things you can do right now to reduce your risk of falling seriously ill and dying from this disease. What does the clinical course of COVID-19 look like for both those who survive and those who don't? What can we learn from other countries and the 1918 pandemic to slow COVID-19? Why can't we stop COVID-19 like we stopped SARS and MERS, the other two 21st century coronavirus outbreaks? The next coronavirus pandemic may come from pigs not pangolins. The role wet markets, wildlife trafficking, and pangolins have played in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. The role live animal markets and the trade in exotic animals have played in the emergence of deadly coronavirus outbreaks. In the last 17 years, there have been three new deadly coronavirus epidemics, but where do emerging diseases emerge from? How to treat the cause by preventing the emergence of pandemic viruses in the first place (a video I recorded more than a decade ago when I was Public Health Director at the HSUS in Washington DC). Alternate-day modified fasting is put to the test for lifespan extension. What you have to know about the safety of marijuana edibles. On a puff-by-puff basis, cannabis smoke deposits four times more tar in the lungs than tobacco, but does this translate into increased cancer risk? Cannabis vapor has less tar, but may contain more ammonia. What happens to respiratory symptoms when regular users of joints, blunts, pipes, and bongs switch to a vaporizer? There is unequivocal evidence that regular cannabis smoking causes acute lung inflammation, but what are the long-term consequences? What's the best household cleaning product to use? How might we improve immune function in children and adults under physical or psychological stress? The amount of beta-glucan fiber in just a dusting of nutritional yeast a day is put to the test in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the prevention of common childhood illnesses. A book purported to expose \"hidden dangers\" in healthy foods doesn't even pass the whiff test. There is a food that offers the best of both worlds\u2014significantly improving our ability to detox carcinogens like diesel fumes and decreasing inflammation in our airways\u2014all while improving our respiratory defenses against infections. Unlike most antiviral drugs, green tea appears to work by boosting the immune system to combat diseases such as genital warts (caused by HPV) and the flu (caused by the influenza virus). Given the role our gut bacteria can play in affecting our weight, having family and friends who are obese may not just be socially contagious, but actually contagious. In this \"best-of\" compilation of his last four year-in-review presentations, Dr. Greger explains what we can do about the #1 cause of death and disability: our diet. Vegetables tested head-to-head to see which boosts immune function best. The green algae, chlorella, may help attenuate the drop in immune function antibodies associated with over-strenuous exercise. Compared to bananas, does eating kiwifruit decrease the incidence and severity of upper respiratory tract infections? Improvements in natural killer cell immune function may explain both the anti-cancer benefits of exercise as well as the apparent anti-virus effects of the green algae chlorella. Whole fruits and vegetables were compared to both antioxidant pills, as well as supplements containing fruits and vegetable extracts, for their ability to treat seasonal allergies, improve lung function, and control asthma. A study involving more than a million kids suggests the striking worldwide variation in childhood rates of allergies, asthma, and eczema is related to diet. The levels of arsenic, banned pesticides, and dioxins exceeded cancer benchmarks in each of the 364 children tested. Which foods were the primary sources of toxic pollutants for preschoolers and their parents? Athletes who overtrain may put excessive stress on their bodies, and become more susceptible to respiratory infections. But, the fiber found in nutritional and brewer's yeast may prevent this immune decline in marathon runners. "}
