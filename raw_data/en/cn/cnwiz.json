You can check ISO-compliance with the microchip manufacturer. Note: If your pet's most recent rabies vaccination before traveling to the EU is a \"booster\" rabies vaccination (rather than \"primary\"), you are responsible for providing all relevant rabies vaccination certificates to prove there was no lapse in coverage since the \"primary\" rabies vaccination. Your pet should travel with all relevant rabies vaccination certificate(s), and it is strongly recommended the microchip number is recorded on all rabies vaccination certificate(s). After any \"primary\" rabies vaccination, your pet must wait 21 days before traveling to the EU. Your pet can travel to the EU less than 21 days after a \"booster\" rabies vaccination, but then the previous rabies vaccination must also be included on the health certificate. Want to simplify your paperwork? Ask your veterinarian to give your pet a 1-year rabies vaccination (after scanning the microchip) at least 21 days before your travel to the EU but less than one year before your travel date (for example, 3-6 months before travel date). That way, no matter the rabies vaccination history, you only have to keep up with one vaccination certificate instead of several! Doing it this way also makes it easier for the [USDA endorsement office](/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/endorsement-offices/pet-travel-service-centers) to review, which means you get your endorsed certificate back faster. If your pet is less than 16 weeks old and cannot meet the above requirements, [click here](/aphis/pet-travel/by-country/eu/pet-travel-young-pets/eu-young-pets). Declaration: The final page of the EU Health Certificate contains a Declaration that must be completed and signed by the pet owner or designated person** before the pet travels to the EU. The Declaration must accompany the pet and health certificate to the EU. **Designated person is a family member, friend, or other person authorized by the owner to travel with the pet. Note: If a Military Veterinarian* issues the health certificate, USDA endorsement is not required. However, the Military Veterinarian must issue the \"non-commercial\" health certificate within 10 days of arrival in the EU, or the \"commercial\" health certificate within 48 hours of the pet leaving the U.S. *Military Veterinarian is defined as a Veterinary Corps Officer or civilian GS-0701 series government veterinarian employed by the U.S. Army Veterinary Service working at military treatment facilities. It does not apply to Army Veterinary Service non-appropriated funds or Department of Defense civilian contract veterinarians. After your pet's Accredited Veterinarian has issued the EU health certificate, you must have the health certificate endorsed by a [USDA Endorsement Office](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/service-centers-endorsement-offices). The USDA Endorsement Office will be able to provide specific information about the process and fees associated with the endorsement of the EU health certificate. Learn more about [Endorsement Fees](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/pet-travel-info-and-guidance-document/pet-travel-endorsement). Dogs must be treated for tapeworms by an Accredited Veterinarian BEFORE traveling to Finland, Malta, or Ireland (including Northern Ireland), or Norway. Note: The Accredited Veterinarian cannot issue (sign) the Anti-Echinococcus treatment table until they administer the tapeworm treatment. The following applies to pet birds traveling to the EU in a group of five or less. The pet bird was isolated from other birds under the USDA Accredited Veterinarian's supervision for at least 30 days prior to leaving the United States. [Veterinary Health Certificate for Pet Birds Option 1 - CLICK HERE](/pet-travel/health-certificates/eu-deu-pet-bird-30d-option1-hc.pdf) The pet bird was isolated from other birds for at least 14 days prior to leaving the United States AND tested for Avian Influenza H5 and H7 antigens or genomes with a virus isolation or RT-PCR test. Regardless of test type used, both a cloacal swab and an oropharyngeal swab must be taken by the USDA Accredited Veterinarian at least 7 days after the 14-day isolation starts. Testing must occur at a NVSL or [National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) approved laboratory for Avian Influenza](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahln/downloads/ai_lab_list.pdf).
