Frontier Nursing University requires faculty, staff, and students attending on-campus events to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 according to CDC Guidelines and as permitted by applicable law unless an exemption has been granted. This includes employees and all students attending Clinical Bound and/or Frontier/DNP Bound. Frontier/DNP Bound and Clinical Bound attendance is required to be in-person. Accepting our Offer of Admission includes a requirement to attend an in-person three-day student orientation called Frontier/DNP Bound. The session is held on our beautiful campus in Versailles, KY. Frontier Bound is an exciting session where you meet your classmates, faculty, and staff. Time is spent learning skills needed for distance education, making lifelong friends, reviewing courses, asking questions, and developing your plan to be a successful Frontier student after returning home. Each Frontier/DNP Bound session brings students together from all over the United States with a different group of students arriving on campus each week. We know from our research that attending the on-campus orientation results in a better student experience and improved success as an FNU student. On May 11, 2023, the United States Department of Health and Human Services ended the COVID public health emergency. The agency reported that COVID-19 is no longer the disruptive force it once was and that since January 2021, COVID-19 deaths have declined by 95%, and hospitalizations are down nearly 91%. As a result, FNU is updating its review process for vaccine exemptions beginning Summer 2023 term. FNU will continue to require that all students, faculty, and staff members attending on-campus events are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, unless a reasonable accommodation has been approved. The policy intends to comply with all applicable laws and is based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and state and local health authorities. Individuals who believe they may qualify for an exemption to FNU's vaccination policy will have the opportunity to submit their exemption request form as part of their new student onboarding process. Any student submitting an exemption request must also sign and submit an attestation indicating they understand their vaccination status may impact their ability to secure clinical placement and FNU can not guarantee that a student will secure a clinical site that does not require a COVID vaccination. FNU is committed to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (and corresponding state laws) and will grant reasonable accommodations where they do not cause an undue hardship or pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Will boosters be required? Not at this time. I had the COVID-19 virus and have the antibodies, am I required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination? Yes Who do I submit my COVID-19 vaccination card to? CastleBranch. CastleBranch is an external company and you will receive directions as part of your onboarding Frontier Bound requirements in your Offer of Admission. What is the deadline to submit proof of vaccination? The same time all other Frontier Bound requirements are due. Requirements and deadlines will be provided with your Offer of Admission. What happens if proof of vaccination isn't submitted by the deadline? Failure to submit the required prerequisite health documentation by the published deadline date (provided in your Offer of Admission) will generate a rescission of your Offer of Admission. Is there an option to submit a religious or medical exemption? Yes. Vaccine exemptions completed by a medical provider or a request for a religious exemption can be submitted with other onboarding requirements after applicants have accepted their offer of admission to an FNU program. Frontier Nursing University will evaluate exemption requests on a case-by-case basis. Any applicant/student submitting an exemption request must also sign and submit an attestation indicating they understand their vaccination status may impact their ability to secure clinical placement and FNU can not guarantee that a student will locate a clinical site that does not require a COVID vaccination. Any approved exemptions will be shared with student clinical sites, as this is a part of the affiliation agreement between FNU and clinical sites. Not receiving the required immunizations may impact a student's ability to secure clinical placement and FNU can not guarantee that a student will locate a clinical site that does not require a COVID vaccination. What is the probability that religious or medical exemptions will be approved? Exemptions are reviewed on a case by case basis and results of requests are confidential between FNU and the applicant. Any student submitting an exemption request must also sign and submit an attestation indicating they understand their vaccination status may impact their ability to secure clinical placement and FNU can not guarantee that a student will locate a clinical site that does not require a COVID vaccination.
