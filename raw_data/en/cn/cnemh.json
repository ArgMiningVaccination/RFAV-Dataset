Good for the whole community Building networks, connecting in with comm unity groups, families, friends Involving family networks in th e person's support, and helping fam ilies avoid isolation Recognising that there is risk in living, but not being to o risk averse in promotion , for example support staff by not being too punitive Helping staff recognise what t hey might be able to do creatively/differently Prevention Connectedness, promoting people's networks and relationship building. Celebrities speaking out help this. Education , for example about risks of drugs. Early intervention , for example in primary scho ol. Resilie nce and self -care programs , for example people knowing to go early to their GP. Education about different roles, services, options in the mental h ealth system. People don't know who does what Early wraparound services Lack of servic es/uneven spr ead of services , for example more community follow up makes a lot of difference Work/life balance. Incorporating meaningful activities into one's life Research into what is working well for people Respite activities Working out what is a normal response to life a nd what is a mental illness , for example need to recognise that life should have a range of emotions. It's normal not to always be happy. Recognising that life events have an impact and this is often normal.

Partic ular difficulties for people accessing public services and getting labelled ' non-compliant ' Personal control of reco very can make a difference , for example people having access to funds to buy services Wait lis t for specialised services , for example eating disorders, sub-acute Some beds are occupied by people who could live in community if the right support was available Support services are not currently always frequent enough/well enough resourced to give continuity More integrated access to a mix of public and private services , for example Occupational Therapists, Social Workers and Physiotherapists Some times programs have stopped , for example Living Well.

Providing mental health services concurrent with other needs , for example housing Slow shifts in culture and tolerance regarding mental health issues leading to increase in people 'coming out' with mental health issues. Need more information (facts) to back up stories Stigma Not a great sense about 'what is possible'. 'Can do' attitude needs promotion across all communities and populations. Youth is promoted greatly but not cons istent campaigning for adulthood. There appears to be more promotion for mental health in childhood which disappears for adulthood. Diversity in promotion messages is needed. Frontline of support should be with GPs - but it's hard to find a GP who is knowl edgeable. 51 Incorporate mental health knowledge into education system to combat negative messages from media. For example what will happen when receive treatment. Media messages are improving though need increased encouragement and knowledge by GPs. Preventi on Bringing mental health knowledge into curriculum in education system will help increase skills, knowledge to identify early signs of mental illness and treatment knowledge. Peers/young people go into schools and talk about lived experience with mental i llness to raise awareness would be a more powerful way to connect with young people and influence young people's views of mental illness Tertiary students need to build mental health knowledge into tertiary educations Health support systems at universities are useful. Media, websites to disseminate information regarding mental health. Monitoring programs for tertiary students to assist retainment of people at education systems. Life events. For example redundancy Broader social determinants. For instance, e ngage broader government departments as services can only do so much. Partnerships with other government departments. Flexible working hours plus healthy workplaces shifting to expectation of constant availability. Need to build resilience, self -care, fami ly. Provide a toolbox for responding to these workplace demands. Recognise the fact I can't fit on my own, where I go to get support. Prevention of condition and prevention of escalation of mental illness. Incorporate personal responsibility and understand ing of mental illness of/for recovery process. 'What can I do to maintain my wellbeing?' Treatment should incorporate prevention! Treatment Accommodation for people with mental illness, vulnerable groups such as ethnic/non English background. Training in mental health professionals. Greater incorporation of mental health into medicine and physical health. Referral to health services for people with comorbidity (mental health + physical health). Inclusion criteria for services, should be consumer focused. Funding for services, availability of services to consumers. The concerns of treatment (pharmacological) as a fix, no structured multifaceted approach. Value for money with services, assessment and efficiency in mental health services. Delivery of services in rural areas, helping people navigate through the health system. Continuity of care. For example transferring services when changing address. Files not being transferred. Rehabilitation Relationship is crucial to ASSETTS care/treatment model. Invest time and energy in building relationship with people before reaching 'treatment' stage. Rehab concept not really embedded in mental health setting and services. 52 What is difference between rehab and recovery (I hope I can live a good life)? What is the aim of r ehab? Participating in the community. Choice is necessary to recovery. Personal choice central to recovery. Navigation of mental services is very difficult for consumers and carers. Postcode systems catchment systems problematic Inclusion criteria is probl ematic where people excluded. Label of rehab not used anymore Inequalities of support for disadvantaged groups. Recovery Peer support so important - some models of this but not enough. Small peer support workforce - expansion of this is needed. Where is personal health worker? Usually carers fill these roles of navigation. Not-for-profit plus government systems - both sectors. Identifying personal needs, individual planning. Don't do recovery by diagnosis but by individual needs. Recovery needs to occupy 'p romotion' space to foster hope in promotion stage. Is recovery sitting more in a community setting? Or a state issue? A commonwealth issue? Hospital setting needs to be viewed as a component of system, not THE system. Services have to meet outputs for fund ing. Quality measurement is divorced from people's recovery but married to outputs of services (contradictory). Mindfulness Resources available during recover from a mental illness. Recovery is an individual plan, not a blanket process. Workshop two - priority issue Client chosen recovery goal drives the aim and design of treatment. Care -coordination consumer focused (person) Self-investment in mental wellbeing (connectivity) Quality and value of services (breadth of services) Client chosen recovery goal dr ives the aim and design of treatment.

Rural and remote In order to provide as much opportunity to capture the specific issues for rural and remote populations, a separate dedicated video conference session was held. A total of seven sites across WA registered for the video conference. Four sites contributed on the day: Wheatbelt (Northam) Goldfields (Kalgoorlie) Kimberley (Bro workshops were coordinated from the Graylands Hospital site and co -facilitated by WA Country Health Service (WACHS), Head Office personnel and a Health Strategy and Networks staff member. Due to unforeseen circumstances the sta rt of the video conference session was delayed. This culminated in having to modify the program to two workshops: Workshop one: brainstorming of the general regional issues brainstorming of the drug and alcohol issues (full transcript in the supplementary report ). Workshop two - brainstorming priority issues for their region. In Workshop one, sites were asked to provide feedback on what they identified as their regions specific issues. Each site then shared their issues with the other regions. During the co urse of the workshops the lead facilitator listened and organised the issues into themes (section 3.4) . These were fed back to the participants at the end of the workshops for verification and agreement. 3.1 Site specific issues ( general) 3.1.2 Goldfields (Kalgoorlie) Attraction and retention of staff to enable provision of services Disparity across the region about what other support services exist. For example, Bay of Isles Community Outreach Inc (BOICO ) in Esperance but not Kalgoorlie Staffing and staff qualifications also an issue for non -government organisations. A specific program may succeed in the Eastern states but in Kalgoorlie. For example, Headspace is a good step forward but very dependent on capacity of the consortium members. 3.1.3 Pilbara (Karratha) There is a lack of non -government organisations and it is hard for those who are available due to lack of accommodation, poor staff retention. There is a lack of recovery enabling activities for clients. Adoption of hobbies is a significant feature of recovery. There is a lack of consumer and carer positions and support for these. Lack of administrative staff so clinicians end up doing this type of work Lack of ability to gain learning experience. Looking forward to joining networking activities 85 Join in research activities and included in outcomes as well as research trials. permission to travel not given because of lack of funding Walgett Aboriginal Medic al Service ( WAMS ) - looking to extended training into rural area. Mental Health and Drug and Alcohol sectors to connect. 3.2.4 Wheatbelt (Northam) Recruit and retention Access to clinical psychologist/psychiatrist poor particularly for adolescence speciali ties Good NGO access and potential to strengthen with good access to clinical psychiatry State -wide forums good but not implemented well There is a local AMS so access to Aboriginal specialists is good Not able to fill to establishment A change in policy and procedures mean time is invested in change and implementation. A big task for small s ervices to implement everything. For example, the Mental Health Act requires giving people accurate information. To engage in policy and procedure implementation of a ny type. We need WACHS H ead Office to lead a process to roll out to all services. Small services, could engage in a working grou p but a better process is for WACHS to write a draft for consultation. 3.1.4 Kimberley (Broome) Agreed with Central Office overv iew WACHS very lean and resourceful at getting services on the ground, sometimes to their detriment. What can we consistently offer in terms of training and development? We need a standardise approach. What standard do we want and what do we need to deli ver that standard? For example, these are the type of CAMS, Drug and Alcohol Adolescent services we want, to this standard so we require these resources to achieve that. Need established clinical governance and resources to support this governance. State bas ed services need to pool dollars together to deliver state -wide services into the regions. We are reliant on locum services that are poor investments as locums are transient so do not establish a service, but if delivered to regions by a state body a bette r service could be provided. ABF - model for acute services in remote area causes great head -aches for hospital based services. Interphase with Commonwealth funded programs: how do state and federal services work better together to deliver state based ser vices into the regions. Too much time spent recruiting and retraining - can't get off the treadmill There is no doctor in the region. The state needs to decide on a best practice model. Suicide, su icide prevention an issue in this region. NGOs working in mental health need to proliferate but need assistance to develop. So we need to house NGO and state services together. Area Head Office needs to assist regions as an umbrella governance organisation. 86 3.1.5 WA Country Health Service (Perth) Lack of standard isation of process and communication across region, for example establishment of effective standard mental health data collection and communication tools is required. Agree with staffing issues raised by the regions Need to look at dif ferent ways to provid e services, for example tele-mental health . Need to establish a process to identify gap and develop solutions We need to partner with NGO s and other agencies. For mental health budget deficits and surpluses: We need to develop an agreed process for use of surpluses in one area on deficits in others. Roll out of Mental Health Act also an issue for us SSAMHS Program - how to guide it into base budget Stokes review initiatives roll out an issues for us Performance monitoring Clinical indicators are required fo r measurement of service Engage CAMS Engagement of consumers and carers Rely heavily on NGO s and Population Health to do MH prevention and promotion . Central Office needs a stronger role in these areas Link in better with metro services. Particularity thos e labelled state -wide - we need better links. Rural /metro transfer between mental health beds Investing in workforce recruitment and retention, education and professional development. Future funding - SSAMS - Aboriginal MOC implementation across regions me tro / country pathways Tele-mental health - Need more support from Telehealth services based in Subiaco for technical support. Infant mental he alth: lack of resources for child and youth clinical services should be considered prior to focusing on promotion /prevention Consumer/ carer engagement lacking - hard for WACHS sites to pick up initiatives. Too many things come for sites to respond to. Hard to involve self, le t alone try to engage others. P erhaps something the Health Network could work on. 3.2 Site s pecific issues (drug and alcohol specific issues ) Graylands (Suite 3): o Agree with Broom e regarding AOD . o Need to identify what we need, how much it will cost then adequately fund. o MHC review = need double current FTE is required o Need to staff to meet triage d services needs in a timely manner. o Need to also consider Mental Health of workforce. More support demanded from central office but central office needs support to. Pilbara (Karratha): o Did have a good Drug and Alcohol Service now ceased as part of amalgam ation with Mental Health Services. Mission Australia has the contract for services but are not able to get up and running properly. The gap is picked up by mental health 87 staff who are now overwhelmed. Now a high risk from a governance perspective - all ser vices need to be around the table to discuss and develop solutions Kimberley (Broome): o Recommend considering the Geraldton Population Health Model which is interesting Wheatbelt (Kalgoorlie): o Has good relationship with NGO o There is currently an uncoordinat ed approach to new initiatives such as sharing buildings. 3.3 Rural and remote priority issues In Workshop two, participants were asked to state the priority issues for their region. The priority issues for each region are as follows: 3.1.1 Goldfields (Ka lgoorlie) Recruitment and retention of staff. Changing expectation and demand on services. Need for agreement on the type of service the region should offer and be realistic about what can be provided by the particular region. Explore opportunities to lin k with other regions or NGOs to meet expectations. WACHS sites need to be resourced to support NGOs more to create linkages and partnerships. Professional development and training - difficult to access in practice, for example permission to travel is rest ricted, the electronic classroom is not as effective as it might be. Invest more centrally in the dissemination of information around new policy and procedures. 3.1.2 Pilbara (Karratha) Growing number of problems to address but fewer staff to address them. Lack of NGOs so the general public expect the state health system to provide everything, for example Mission Australia: Drug and Alcohol can afford staff but not housing. Also, Mental Health Week puts pressure on state staff. Many clients are homeless so treatment and recovery is hampered. Some professional development sessions/requirements are difficult to design as staff need to be all things to all people - but there is no staff. For example the 'staff recruitment freeze' left us with no services in Ro ebourne. It is hard to look beyond core business. 3.1.3 Wheatbelt (Northam) More support for SSAMHS programs into core business. What does that look like? How do SSAMHS staff work with clinical staff? Staffing and recruitment - lack of NGO services means w e are constantly asked to do everything for everyone. How much could be standardised and rolled out by region not site? 88 Video conference is not a solution as most outer Wheatbelt sites cannot access the bandwidth required. If offered generally by WACHS with Northam as a central hub, this would increase access for other towns like Bencubbin. 3.1.4 Kimberley (Broome) Remodel remote Mental Health Services to overcome current flaws, for exampl e mental health and primary care interface for service delivery. What staff do we have/what staff do we need in the regions, for example multi -skilled and flexible. Having staff with dual qualifications in place is essential for all regions. Regional staff should have primary care, mental health and drug and alcohol qualific ations with services all on the same page, inclusive of aged care and AMS. Locums funded by Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Programs (MSOAP) (Federally funded) - are not consistent, so clients have many new service providers and constantly need to r e-tell their story, build rapport etc. 3.1.5 WA Country Health Service (Perth) Staffing and housing - 26th parallel subsidies should also apply for Kalgoorlie, Collie and Katanning. Need collaboration between the Department of Health and Homeswest. Espera nce did have four mental health houses but now has none. 3.4 Rural and remote themes The lead facilitator shared the list of themes that had emerged having listened to the workshops. The following themes were recounted to participants for verification and agreement: Recruitment and retention of staff via: o Addressing mental health across the life -course and, drug and alcohol skill set deficits by re -modelling to create a multi -skilled and flexible workforce. o Housing that meets the needs of a transient workf orce. o Assist staff to cope with the changing expectations of their role particularly in regard to supporting NGOs and the need to be 'all things to all people' by centralising and standardising some processes. Education and training: outreach is a better m odel for roll out of reform initiatives such as the Mental Health Bill 2013 , the new Western Australia Mental Health, and Alcohol and Other Drug Services Plan 2015 -2025 and Stokes Review 2012 initiatives. Clarification and articulation of what statewide se rvices are. For example what does service 'X' look like, who is responsible for it, within it and where is it best located? What are state services as opposed to non -government services? Consumer and carer engagement. Benchmarking of services. Centralised methods to assist establishment of NGOs in the rural and remote areas. Consideration of the implications of ABF on acute hospital services. Better integration, navigation, monitoring of workforce, culture and service delivery across the state. 89 3.5 Video co nference feedback Wheatbelt (Northam) Found this useful. Good to see others have similar issues. Pilbara (Karratha) Agree with Wheatbelt. It's great to be listened to. Goldfields (Kalgoorlie) Valuable to identify the issues but this is not the first time these have been raised. Grappling with how The network might make a difference so interested to participate in fu ture discussions about what the network can do? Kimberley (Broome) Happy to be involved. We have solutions but no means to employ them. WA Co untry Health Service (Perth) Found this session useful. Unclear about how the mental health network will work. 90 4. Burning issues responses A broad range of 'Burning issues' have been collected and are recorded verbatim . These w ill be considered by the C o-Leads as part of the process which will help identify priority areas the Network can support. Diagnosis of mental health issues for Aboriginal people especially in remote non -Engli sh speaking places like n orth and the top end of WA . Teen/Youth - preven tative care - suicide and self -harm prevention - drug and alcohol abuse. Consistency of funding. The mental health older adults in transitional care beds (awaiting placement) have the same access to rehabilitation as mainstream geriatric patients. Lack of housing options - no long term plans/vision to solve this issue. Early diagnosis is the key to prevention. Teen/Youth - Treatment of alcohol and other drug issues with co -morbidities. The need for a unified approach between Mental Health Services and Dru g and Alcohol Services. Teen/Youth - Prevention - Helping Aboriginal youth/communities to identify emerging mental health difficulties and then connect to appropriate services. Dementia - should be prioritised further. Prevention and its importance in ad dition to recovery (particularly important for perinatal and infant mental health). The system is not a caring system. People without a mental health issue don't understand people living with mental health conditions. *Do something* - stop talking about it and do something at the coal face. Freedom to take risks in a risk -averse environment (creative treatment options). IT - huge issues across all areas. Who is responsible for doing promotion and prevention and how do we evaluate it in an outcomes funded world? The likelihood/vulnerability/consequences for children of adults with mental health issues. Such children are at risk of being overlooked , for example triage/assessment/intake of adults with mental health issues rarely includes questions to discov er if the adult has children or establish if the children are safe in the short, medium and long -term. Coordination of welfare and mental health services - Often operate separately. This can occur with mental illness, children in care with mental health i ssues, and in young people who are leaving care. The issues are so interwoven it is unfortunate the systems are so separate. Perhaps invite young people along to the Network ( for example as part of their school credits) to contribute to this discussion. Prevention of mental health long term requires a focus on wellness, building resilience, boundary protection and Mindfulness. Youth - Aboriginal mental health workers when well supported in a team and given an equal voice can markedly increase the service s capacity to attract, and retain Aboriginal clients and these workers are valuable across the episode of care: o identifying young people o strengthening links with community and relevant services o providing ongoing cultural consultation. One Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mental Health Worker is not enough. 91 Use of Home Medication Review for all people over the aged of 65 discharged from hospital. (Evidenced based research with Department of Veterans Affairs). Alcohol and Drug not one of true domains but is front and centre in mental health. We need to acknowledge work that has been done and increase the funding. Stigma with health professionals. Over prescription of anti -depressants/chemical imbalance. Social issues which affect mental health/can ca use mental illness. Acknowledgement and respect of the traditions of the cultures when following policy/regulations. This can be damaging to the family relationship and contributing to mental health issues. For example children sleeping in bed with parent s resulting in claims of child abuse or children touching adults for comfort as traditionally taught. For six years I've been treated like a m ushroom. \"Typical silo effect\". I'm looking for mentorship and to be educated so I can learn and grow to help my c ommunity. Needs of lesbian, gay, transgender, transsexual or questioning youth and making services 'queer' friendly. Pressures on Psychiatrists - patients reports etc... have a repository of what is available in community , for example service mapping what e ach suburb has available for referrals. We have had plans and maps. We have talked, and talked, and talked etc.; we now need to progress the recovery of the mental health system. Let's act - no more maps, plans or mapping. Recorded by a facilitator on be half of a participant - Somehow the Mental Health Network needs to develop a reputation as a source for testing 'appropriateness' of messages out in the community , for example the Bethlem Insanity Hospital display at the Royal Show. Even though the sector protested and the community managed to get the name of the ride changed, the original name stayed in the program and Royal Show advertising. If the Royal Agriculture Society had contacted the mental health sector prior to setting up the display then they w ould have saved on millions of dollars and the printed message would not still be out in the street. Recognition of multiple adverse experiences especially during childhood as causal to adult mental health issues for example: o viewing of mental health 'sym ptoms' from the childhood developmental psychology point of view. o attachment and bonding as core to future healthy psychology. Recognition that secure, insecure and/or disorganised attachment styles be recognised in primary alcohol and other drug/mental health assessments as indicative of trauma. Trauma recovery approach additional and underlying emergency intervention capacity built for long, medium term support and ongoing and same provider via counselling - solution - self-directed funding. o focus on t rauma o recognise alcohol and other drugs as 'self -medicating' o provide money and mentoring for self -directed funding. Mental health and intellectual disability - people who have a diagnoses of both. The problem that this causes for individuals (the game of 'ping pong' ), needs to stop disabilities versus mental health. The need for mental health clinicians to understand the complexities of the co -existing disorders and the need for more clinicians to understand intellectual disability. Current focus on ment al health reform and Mentally Impaired Accused (MIA) Act equals a contradiction unless MIA legislation changes. 92 Housing tenure (co -ordinati on) - homelessness needs to be addressed and improved. We want to provide more early intervention services but so m any of our programs have eligibility criteria which require individuals to have a severe and persistent mental illness. This means that individuals must evidence a long history of mental illness which prevents early intervention services. Teenage/Youth - Options for assessment and treatment of young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are currently very limited. ASD is under -diagnosed and not clearly managed in mental health services or disability - particularly the higher functioning ASD ( for ex ample formerly diagnosed as Asperger's). 93 This document can be made available in alternative formats on request for a person with a disability. \u00a9 Department of Health 2014 Copyright to this material is ves ted in the State of Western Australia unless otherwise indicated.
