In an effort to return to campus safely, we have been encouraging our students, staff, and faculty to get vaccinated and submit their proof of vaccination sooner than later. Well, later has come, and the deadline to submit your vaccination information is Monday, August 16, 2021 by 11:59 p.m. (PST). Per the UC Office of the President, all students must be vaccinated for COVID-19 for the 2021-2022 academic year. The new [SARS-CoV 2 Vaccination Policy](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/5000695/SARS-CoV-2_Covid-19), which took effect on July 15, 2021, came in response to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases across the state and the nation. Thank you to all of our students who have received their COVID-19 vaccination and uploaded their proof to the patient portal. Your support in this critical, yet timely, process is greatly appreciated. A safe campus return is essential. If you have not submitted your proof of vaccination or submitted a [request for a medical and religious exemption](https://ucriverside.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9tcvooIXRELloYm), the deadline for compliance is Monday, August 16, 2021 by 11:59 p.m. (PST). Please check your status and confirm your vaccination has been uploaded at [https://studenthealth.ucr.edu/covid-19](https://studenthealth.ucr.edu/covid-19). Vaccines are available at Student Health Services every Friday from 1-3:30 p.m. To schedule an appointment, please contact the COVID Hotline at (844) 827-6827. If you choose not to comply by August 16th, there will be serious and immediate consequences that will adversely affect current/future registration, enrollment status, and access to campus facilities. If non-compliance persists, an increase in consequences will occur, including interim suspension, which is a suspension of student status and privileges that includes exclusion from classes and other university activities. Please act now! Your compliance is required. The safety and well-being of our campus community, including students, staff, and faculty remain a top priority. We can all do our part to ensure our campus remains a safe and healthy environment for all. For more information, visit "}
