It is characterized by movements that are low impact, flowing, circular, and easy to learn. Outwardly graceful, the movements require coordination and synchronization of a calm but alert mind, and a relaxed body. In conjunction with deep abdominal breathing, the practice of these flowing movements can offer body/mind benefits to practitioners, with virtually no negative side effects (Mayo Clinic Staff 2012).
