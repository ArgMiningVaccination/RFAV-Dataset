Long hours and high pressure take a severe toll onthe human body. We're starting to see concerns here in the U.S. about the effects of extreme working patterns. It's increasingly common to see people working two, sometimes three jobs to make ends meet. And office workers don't necessarily have it much better. \"Sitting is the new smoking\" is aphrase coined to describe the negative healthimpact of sitting in a chair for eight hours a day. By some estimates, a sedentary job might takeyears off your life, increasing the odds ofcontracting diabetes and various types of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Rising healthcare spending and curtailed worker productivity are related outcomes of these trends, so it's not surprising to see employers taking an interest in the form of employee wellness programs, standing desks, andworker incentive programs to use gym memberships. So who is missing here? The allopathic medical community is not positioned to help. Because the workplace interventions most needed arethose that address general wellness and office ergonomics.Doctors who treat musculoskeletal problems and employ postural correction, those skilled in stance and gait, and who understand physical therapy solutions are exactly whoare most needed. And isn't that what chiropractors do betterthan anyone else? In this issue of ChiropracticEconomics, we'll show you where some of these opportunities are and what you need todo to take advantage of them. You might need additional training, or maybe just the right business plan. Some arealready specializing in this area\u2014why not you, too?

BY BRENDA SLOVIN, DC THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT AFFECT ONE 'S LOVE LIFE , including lack of sleep, toxins, and job or home stress. A decrease in libido is often traced to excess stress,which has an impact on the adrenalglands. There are more chemicals involved with sexuality than estrogen andtestosterone. To counteract the amountof stress patients put on their mindsand bodies, lifestyle changes andnutritional support can help themrestore their passion and rebuild theirdesire for intimacy. Adrenalglandsandhormones Many people think about the ovariesand testes when they think aboutsexual hormones. The ovaries produceestrogen and progesterone, while thetestes make testosterone. Although thisis true, the adrenal glands also play alarge part in producing these hormones.The adrenal glands are located at thetop of each kidney and are responsible for a lot more than many wouldimagine. There are two main parts of the adrenal gland: the medulla (innerportion) and the cortex (outer portion). The cortex produces steroids, or stress hormones, which promotefluid balance and regulate bloodsugars. It is in the cortex where womenmake their own testosterone and didehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Certainly, the amount of testos- terone women make is much smallercompared to men; however, it is still asignificant player in the female libido.Many women who suffer fromprolonged illness-related or emotional stress often find that they have a muchlower libido than before. The inner portion of the adrenal glands, the medulla, is responsible formaking adrenaline. This generates the\"fight-or-flight\" response and its physiological effects including increased heart rate, fluttery stomach,sweaty palms, anxiety, and insomnia. This is the primary reason the adrenal gland is known as a stress gland, so it'sno wonder it affects sexuality. Most people would say that when they are stressed, the furthest thing from their mind is sex. It's important to note, according to stress researcher Hans Selye, MD, that any kind of stress affects the adrenals. Stress can be caused by poor diet, chronic illness, lack of quality sleep, or pressure at work or in the home. Theadrenal glands release hormones necessary to deal with stress; however, prolonged periods of tension and angst on the body and mind will deplete the required stores. People use up their adrenal reserves when under extended stress, which means that their blood sugars begin to16 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMRESEARCH RESULTS drop. This tells the brain to signal the adrenal glands to release more adren-aline into the bloodstream to mobilizefat to the liver, which will then covertit to sugar. As blood sugar goes backup, the body is loaded with adrenaline,which has its own side effects.Studies have shown that people feel more amorous when on vacation, astheir stress levels are lower. They are able to relax more and catch up onsleep. Not surprisingly, during the hustle and bustle of everyday life, many couples say they are too tired to havesex. They would benefit from planning a vacation, or a \"staycation,\" becausethe rule of thumb for restoring the adrenals is \"rest is best.\" Both men and women can be affected by a decreased libido due tostress. It especially impacts men who have had prostate issues or surgery, or are taking medications that interferewith erections. Further, when men worryabout sexual performance, adrenalinepours into the bloodstream and anxietyfurther depletes sexual desire. Stressing about physical appearance will also affect libido. Obesity is influ- enced greatly by the adrenal glands. Ifthe body cannot mobilize fat to makeenergy, then the adrenal gland becomes dysfunctional. 1 For fat to turn into sugar, the adrenal cortex must be functioning properly. If the adrenals are overworked and fat accumulates, then excess intakeof carbohydrates and other sugars are used to gain some of that energy back. The cycle continues when a persontakes in too many carbohydratesbecause, instead of coming from the liver, sugar comes from the pancreasand calories are stored as fat. Healthyadrenalglands To maintain an optimal sex life, it isnecessary to manage stress. Patientswho want to get their love life back ontrack should make stress reduction apriority. This may be easier said than done, but it is not impossible. First steps might include resolving family and spousal conflicts, repairing broken relationships, finding ways to enjoy work, thinking positively, helpingothers, and getting good quality rest.Increasing one's sense of spiritualitycan help, too. This is the practice ofgetting in touch with one's self and engaging in self-care. Meditation, yoga, and walking are good options\u2014any Patientswhowanttogettheirlovelifebackon trackshouldmakestressreductionapriority.RESEARCH RESULTS activity that helps a person relax can promote a spiritual mindset. In addition to behavioral changes, adjustments to the diet are equally important. Certain types of foods and toxins can influence the adrenals. Proper supplementation can not onlyhelp the adrenal glands to workproperly but also improve the entire body. Basic components of a healthierdiet include the following: Additive-freesalt. Even those with heart conditions can consume somesalt. This has been verified through various meta-studies. 2Salt levels are controlled by the adrenal glands. If a person doesn't take in sufficient salt, then the adrenal glands have to work harder to hold salt in the body.Healthy salt levels promote healthysugar levels. Propercholesterollevels. Patients should not cut out all cholesterol. Lowcholesterol, in fact, is more dangerous than high amounts. Steroids are made from cholesterol, and all of the sex hormones are steroids. Leanprotein. This provides a good source of cholesterol as well. It is a high-carbohydrate diet that raises badcholesterol, not a high-cholesterol diet. Supplementationfor adrenalglandhealth There are some naturalsupplements a person can take toimprove adrenal gland health,especially face of constantongoing stress. The adrenal cortex hasthe highest concentration of vitamin Cin the body. 3For patients suffering adrenal fatigue, 3,000 to 5,000 mg ofvitamin C before bed is recommended.Those under a particularly great amountof stress can take even more than that. Vitamin B5 (also called pantothenic acid) is essential to healthy adrenalgland function. Patients can take atleast 500 mg two to three times a day.This can help with energy, colds,allergies, and sexual drive. Some health food stores sell adrenal extracts, which can be extremely helpful. Cortex tablets can give energy without being over-stimulating. Tablets for the whole adrenal gland are also helpfulfor energy, but these types of supplements should not be taken late in the day as they can interfere with sleep. 4 A popular supplement for the adrenal glands is DHEA. This is a major hormone produced in theadrenal cortex. It declines naturally with age, but when supplemented itimproves energy and sexual drive. Another adrenal hormone that is good is pregnenolone. It helps withmood, vision, hearing, and memory. A direct precursor to testosterone is androstenedione. This is short-lived in the body; however, it can have an advantageous effect on sexuality. When recommending supplements, hew toward high-quality versions, asthe cheaper ones tend to be loaded with fillers and chemicals. Lower qualitysupplements can even do more harmthan good.

PALMER, \"The art, science, and philosophy of all things natural.\" The philosophy of chiropractic reaches beyond its own profession and into all natural healthcare modalities. However, chiropractic hasits own language and it can beintimidating. Most patients don't know that the word subluxation actuallymeans: sub (less than) + lux (light) +ation - (the action of). In other words, the action of having less light. The literal definition paints apicture of a less functioning nervoussystem. A patient who truly under-stands this concept converts tochiropractic for life. Why would anyone want to have a subluxation if itleads to feeling dim?Partnershipinhealth For the record, I am not a chiropractor; I am a functional nutritionist. But after studying the chiropractic philosophy, I realized that we speak the samelanguage. The body is innately intelli-gent and designed to be not only self-healing and self-regulating, but also avehicle to harbor all of life's unlimitedpotential. In order for a patient to receive the full potential of a chiropractic adjust-ment as well as food, they would lead alifestyle that includes proper sleep,hydration, a positive mental attitude,and most importantly, propernourishment and nerve supply. Everywhere you turn today there are different opinions about what consti-tutes a healthy diet. For the sake of thisarticle, assume a healthy diet means eating food that has traditionallyprovided the human body withnutrients, instead of modern highly processed, food-like products. The diet of your patient directly impacts your effectiveness as a health-care practitioner, whether you are a chiropractor or a functional nutritionist. A body that is fed whole foods and whole food nutritional supplements canutilize their macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals to buildand rebuild all the tissues of the body;the very same tissues that receive nervous system impulses. Does healthy tissue receive a chiropractic adjustment better than damaged or diseased tissue? R.W. Stevenson believed it did, as noted in his ChiropracticTextbook : Nourishyourphilosophy Incorporating nutrition with chiropractic just makes sense. BY JENNIFER FRANCO, CN, ACN22 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CEnTRAL \"In order to have perfect function and metabolistic vibration, the structure must be sound.\" He continues by discussing soundness, \"Depletion is the abnormalshrinking of a cell that has once beennormal size; or it is depreciation ofsoundness or construction. Depletedcells can be repleted; they can comeback. The functions involved arenutritive (trophic) and reparatory.\" 1 This exemplifies and defines for patients the philosophy that chiro-practors and nutritionists hold true:The body is self-healing and self-regulating when it is free of nerveinterference and properly fed. Supportingfunction While the need for nutrition in yourchiropractic practice can be exploredfrom both a historical and philosoph- ical perspective, it is also important to also focus on the benefits it brings to a practice. One advantage of bringing nutrition into your practice is the potential for your patients to become truly healthy. Chiropractors and nutritionists worksynergistically. As your patients continueto be adjusted and receive nutritionaleducation about the benefits of wholefoods and whole food nutritionalsupplements, they will begin to under- stand how both of these things together make a difference in the way they feel. Additionally, having a nutritionist in the office provides a level of expertiseto inform your patients about theproper diets and nutritional protocolsto specifically support function in theirbodies. This may ultimately result inpatients who receive and hold theiradjustments better, and thrive in life as a healthy optimally-functioning person. Feedingyourbottomline Another benefit of adding nutrition is the revenue effect. Providing nutrition services is something that can help to create additional value to yourchiropractic care plans and may add handsomely to your top and bottom line. Nutritional programs can be structured in many ways. For example, profit may be derived from a nutritionservice fee collected, as well as profitfrom the sale of supplements. Bringing a nutritionist on board canOneadvantageofbringingnutritionintoyourpractice isthepotentialforyourpatientstobecometrulyhealthy. 24 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMPRACTICE CEnTRAL also help differentiate your practice from others in the area. A nutritionist canconduct nutrition visits with patientsone-on-one, as well as nutritionalworkshops in the office and in thecommunity. This may establish your clinic as a leader in nutritional careand attract patients to your practice. Benefitsforall There are many ways to incorporate anutritionist into your practice. Youcould hire a nutritionist as a part-time or full-time member of your staff. Alternatively, you could partner with a nutritionist in your area and create a referral service that is beneficial for both parties. If it fits your practice better, there are also companies you can collaborate with virtually. These companies are a resource for training you and your staff, and providing asupport system for your patients. The bottom line is that a nutri- tionist's ability to educate, empower,and feed people, especially chiropractic patients through nutrition, supportsand enhances what you do as achiropractor.

BY AMY STANKIEWICZ Humanengineering 26 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMWork-related injuries are nothing new\u2014 over the years, workers' compensation costs have continued to soar for companies ofnearly any size and in virtuallyevery industry. Not surprisingly, these companies continue to search for new and inno- vative ways to alleviate work-relatedinjuries and make their employeesmore productive, engaged, and healthy.How can a chiropractor's knowledgeand expertise step in to help? From providing sound occupational safety information in the form of acorporate trainer to engaging in thesale of ergonomic and related officeequipment, there are many ways youcan contribute to this growing field. You have a number of options, such as augmenting your current practice byoffering ergonomic products andresources to patients and companies,or by entering this field full-time as apaid, certified specialist focusedexclusively on improving workers'productivity and lives. Thebusinesssideofergonomics PaulLevy president of the clinical services division at Humanscale says his company focuses on the business ofergonomics, assisting chiropractors ineducating patients about the impor-tance of working well. The companyalso specializes in training chiropractors to be resellers of its ergonomicallydesigned equipment as part of anoverall effort to achieve wellness. \"We are a designer and manufacturer of ergonomic tools,\" Levy says. \"Ourprimary focus has always been to reachcorporate America. If you have a fixed-height monitor (one that isn't adjustable and is sitting on a desk), how will youaccommodate for different people who use it?\" He says his company isconcerned with the \"fit between people and their work.\" That's what the science of ergonomics is. According to Levy, ergonomic tools dohelp prevent work-related injuries. And because chiropractors are educatedabout body mechanics as they relate towork environments, \"We felt it was essential to begin teaching chiropractors about these products,\" he says.\"Furthermore, we've developed a certification train-the-trainer CEU course designed to help chiropractorsidentify postural risks associated withlong-term computer use. \"In addition to having conversations with their patients, we want chiro- practors to have the tools they need to help people have fewer incidents of pain,\" Levy says. Web-basedresources. Levy's firm will soon offer a patient portal that willreflect the language chiropractors use and the conditions they treat. Theportal will also be available to chiro-practors who are interested in embed- ding it into their own practices' websitesso that patients can see information congruent with what their chiropractors provide. \"When a patient comes to a chiro- practor's office with a musculoskeletal issue, the chiropractor is already askingthe patient how they work,\" Levy says.If the chiropractor's own site can rein-force the education they're providingto their patients, it helps position theDC as an expert in this area. Levy's site also includes a section on standing desks and related officeequipment. \"Chiropractors have beensaying that many patients are asking,'Should I be standing more at my office or sitting?' Research is showing anumber of health concerns\u2014including those related to metabolic syndrome\u2014 that correlate with working in pooroffice conditions.\" He also hears chiropractors saying that they already tell their patients to get a good office chair, one that issupportive, and he wants to give chiro- practors more information on suchchairs. Levy says: \"A good office chair, for instance, should allow people to freely change their posture without making a lot of adjustments to thechair itself.\" Levy's website is also expanding to include a section for employees whowant to talk to their human resourcesdepartments about ergonomic wellness.This, in turn, will reinforce the message to corporations about the importanceof ergonomically sound workequipment. Trainingtosell. Levy admits that he is still working to determine how much these products\u2014and related educatio n\u2014 interest chiropractors, as well as how much chiropractors think thistechnology can impact their business. \"We are trying to figure out how much time a DC wants to spend onthis,\" Levy says. \"They want to know how the product works and they wantto use it, but they want to rely on us to do the selling for them.\" A typical product package would consist of a standing desk with a chair and a monitor positioned at the rightheight. Because the first step is selling chiropractors on the benefit of reselling these products to companies, \"We tell chiropractors that if you want to know what it is like to sit in a good way, you must do it yourself,\" Levy says. If you're planning to advise patients to purchase this type of equipment, consider bringing these products into CHIROECO.COM S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 2728 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMyour own office to see how they interact with your employees' ability tosit with good posture. \"They need toembrace these ergonomic products,both for their own employees as wellas for their patients.\" Ultimately, you can make a real difference in alleviating work-relatedinjuries, and it should be possible to make a profit at the same time. And if transactions are occurring through adoctor's practice, it establishes a trust factor for patients and corporationsalike. Anergonomicseducation DennisDowning, CEO of Future Industrial Technologies, takes work-related injury prevention and education to a new level; his companyoffers membership and formalcertification for chiropractorsinterested in this endeavor. \"We've certified over 1,000 chiro- practors throughout the United States and Canada on how to go into organ- izations and help them reduce theseverity and frequency of muscu- loskeletal disorders,\" Downing says.Since 1992, his company has worked almost exclusively with chiropractors in helping small-to-medium-sized and Fortune 500 companies lower their workers' compensation costs bypreventing work-related injuries through training and education. \"The beauty of our program is that a chiropractor can go into a company and help as a true professional injury prevention specialist,\" Downing says.\"Instead of being a treating physician, they are a professional injury preventionspecialist who can help to reduce acompany's workers' compensation costsby 30 to 70 percent.\" He notes that acompany obtaining these kinds of results would be likely to consider having such a specialist be thecompany doctor. \"There are so many benefits for a competent and confident chiropractorto reduce injuries in the workplacethrough education,\" he adds. \"And thisMeettheexperts PaulLevy is president of the clinical services division at Humanscale, in New Y ork, New Y ork. humanscale.com DennisDowning is founder and CeO of Future Industrialt echnologies, in Santa Barbara, California. backsafe.com DonConant , DC, is the owner of Corporate Chiropractic Works International, in portsmouth, New Hampshire.corporatechiroworks.com CHIROECO.COM S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 29 in turn gives the chiropractor's practice tremendous exposure.\" Thelogisticsofcertification. According to Downing, the first step towardcertifying appropriate chiropractors inthis field is to teach them their ownvalue. \"We learned very quickly that we had to teach chiropractors that theywere valuable, that they truly can helpa company reduce workers' compen- sation costs,\" he says. had toask 'What would that be worth?'We had to help chiropractors be wortha lot of money to corporate America.\" Since 1992, Downing has worked to implement a system that enables chiro-practors to achieve the confidence andskills they need to succeed in thisarena. He paired with two DCs todesign an office ergonomics training program, as well as an ergonomicstraining program for non-office people.\"Combined, these are two curricula that our chiropractors use when they go out into corporate America and help companies reduce injuries,\" he says. Downing works with chiropractors in two ways: His firm helps DCsprocure their own corporate contacts,and can also provide opportunitiesthrough its own marketing efforts. \"Basically, we combined the art of training with the science of biome- chanics and stretching instructions,\"Downing says. Because chiropractors have an innate bent toward teaching people, they are the perfect medium to deliver the message.Expertadvice. Downing's advice to any chiropractor thinking about entering this field is simple: Don't be an amateur, don't go out unprepared, and don't fakebeing a professional injury prevention specialist. Instead, first get educated on what you need to know, including knowing who in the company will buyinto your program. \"You also need to know what to charge,\" he says, as there are no free programs when you can save companies so much money. But that also means you have to deliver a meaningful program that ensures companies get what they are promised. Being a chiropractor is a physical profession that's tough on the body. A corporate injury prevention specialist can earn good money without theYoucanmakearealdifferenceinalleviatingwork-relatedinjuries,andit shouldbepossibletomakeaprofitatthesametime.30 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMphysical demands of delivering adjustments. \"But you have to like toteach people, and it's nice to have acuriosity of what people do for aliving,\" Downing says. Gettinginonthegroundfloor DonConant, DC, owner of Corporate Chiropractic Works International, hasbeen a practicing chiropractor for 15 years, three of which have been spentas an on-site chiropractor for compa-nies around the country. \"My wife and I are both in practice. We have the experience of being on-site and taking care of employees invarious companies, and we're lookingto expand that to get into othercompanies,\" he says. \"I think it isfantastic for a chiropractor to add thisarea of expertise to a practice, whether you are a solo practitioner or you havean associate with you. There are a lot of chiropractors looking for ways to add patients and increase revenue, and this is an effective way to do so.\" In terms of training and education of healthcare providers, Conant saysthat his company markets only to DCs.\"We show chiropractors how to get new companies on board, as well as what to say to them and what presentations to give. We also provide training on what to expect with regard to day-to-daypatient interactions.\" Adayinthelifeon-site. In the course of a day, Conant says that he focuses onproviding adjustments and teaching employees how that can help themmaintain a healthy body. He also goes into companies to teach people why they should be under regular chiropractic care. \"We tell themhow they're less likely to get injured at work, and we tell them how spinal hygiene is similar to dental hygiene,\" he explains. Conant understands working people are busy, and employers are looking to have them accomplish more with less time and fewer resources. There's a trend toward creating a convenienceatmosphere at work, for making sureemployees are happy and healthy attheir jobs and staying well now ratherthan reacting after they get hurt. \"Wethought that if we go to where peopleare most of their time, we could createa huge on-site practice,\" he says.Thosecompanieswhochosetoenactaprogramareoftensurprised athowmanyemployeestakeadvantageoftheservice. 32 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMEndlessopportunity. Currently, Conant and his wife work on-site in 15 companies, and they are looking forothers to help them in this area ofpractice. \"Mostly, we want to equipother chiropractors so that they can goout and do this same thing in theircommunities,\" he says. In Conant's view, the opportunity for chiropractors to make a significantcontribution in this field is endless.What's more, you can be selectiveabout which clients you opt to accept.And to be successful? \"I suggest you meet as many company owners andhuman resources folks as you can,since these will be the ones who buyinto your vision and the resultingbenefits it provides.\" There are numerous positives to getting started working in this arena.Companies will generally be pleased that they don't have to do a lot to get aprogram established, and for the DC,the effort to promote wellness and a proactive approach to health andwellness is minimal. Those companieswho chose to enact a program are oftensurprised at how many employees take advantage of the service. When workplace safety and ergonomics are addressed, employees feel better and are happier at the jobs, which ultimately leads to them beingmore productive at work. That's thebest return on investment an employercould hope to gain. AMY STANKIEWICZ is a freelance writer based in cleveland. She has written for trade publications for more than 15 years.

You must create a host of activities that bring new patients intoyour practice. This process is known as integrated marketing, and it aims atcreating awareness and helping tobuild your brand. In today's wiredworld, traditional approaches toadvertising such as listing in the YellowPages are not efficient at bringingpatients to your door. On the other hand, one of the most efficient methods for building yourbrand is to have a purposeful website.Most patients are now using the powerof their keyboards to find healthcareprofessionals. With over one billion searches conducted daily, the internet is delivering more information to patients today than they have ever had before.This is one of the most cost-efficient ways to promote your brand. And unlike your practice, a website is avail- able 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But while websites are efficient for marketing, there are many mistakes chiropractors make with them. Sometypical mistakes are: /trianglertMany DCs, thinking can createtheir website themselves, make basicdesign errors. /trianglertMany DCs don't know how to ensurepatients can find them on the internet. /trianglertMany DCs tend to make their sitestoo wordy, thinking that will attractmore patients. /trianglertSome DCs don't believe in the powerof the internet and opt to ignore it asa marketing tool. Realize that, statistically speaking, you only have about five seconds tomake an impression on a patientvisiting your online portal. Therefore, it is imperative to sidestep the four largest pitfalls in developing yourwebsite. Thenamegame One of the biggest issues when devel- oping your website is choosing a name. It is ironic how so many chiropractorschoose names such as Holistic Health,Comprehensive Chiropractic, Healing Arts, or Beyond the Back. While these kinds of names sound interesting, remember what the patient is looking for: a doctor. For this reason, having your name be part of the page address (URL) is a recommended strategy. Patients won't be looking for the name of the practice but rather the doctor of chiropracticand the healing modalities he or she Frontandcenter Good chiropractors avoid bad web mistakes.

According to the website tracking firm Royal Pingdom, there are morethan 1 billion web pages and morethan 250 million domain nameregistrations. Given that amount oftraffic, you need to set yourself apartfrom the competition. Being on the internet is about brand building and being available.You must make it easy for patients tofind you. DoctorAnneConnor.com orBillSmithDC.com are more likely tostand out. Usetherightlure If you want to hook the best fish, youneed the proper bait. Your website canuse myriad techniques to capture attention, and one of the best is using keywords that patients are likely to use when searching. For example: Yourpotential patients are likely searching for terms such as back pain, stressmanagement, knee stiffness, and neck pain. In a recent review of over 150 chiropractic websites, it was noted that many chiropractors fail to mention the patient issues they address. The sites speak of subluxation, the doctor's yearsin practice, and laser and decompres- sion machines. But because they lack wording identical to that being sought by patients, they are likely being passed over. To find the right search terms, use keyword tool finders such as thoseoffered by Google. These free web resources can help you understand regional and global search terms so there is a match between what patients want and what you provide. In addition, these words must be placed organically (in the descriptive site text) and technologically (hiddenin the source code) so your site rises to the top of the search chain. Createmagnetism Words create emotion, and the rightwords can generate magnetism thatattract your perfect patient. To that end, be less prescriptive and start thinking like a patient yourself. Patients are seeking outcomes, they seek results, and they seek value. But unless they've been to a chiro- Wordscreateemotion,andtherightwordscangenerate magnetismthatattractyourperfectpatient.38 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMMARKETING MATTERS practor before, they're likely to be unfamiliar with terms such as sublux-ation, adjustment, and decompression.What they are usually looking for is anexplanation of their health concernsand how you can address them.Therefore, the wording on your sitenot only has to match the keywordspatients search for but also align withtheir desired outcomes. Also, don't overestimate the powerof testimonials. You can get almost anyone to say nice things about you.Instead, consider case studies that demonstrate how you solve patients'problems in your practice. Whitespaceistheplace When it comes to the amount of text on your website, less is more. Think about the brevity of social media sitessuch as Facebook and Pinterest. Theconstant flood of emails and socialmedia updates pounds the average person with over 7,000 messages a day. Patients are likely to be just as busy as you are, so keep your messaging shortand to the point. Use the white space on your website to your advantage. Limit the text in paragraphs to 50 to 60 words. The most important information should beabove the fold, i.e., on the screen before a patient needs to scroll. And every page on your site must have a purpose, a mission thatprovides value to the patient. Try tohave a call to action on every page too.Tell patients what you want them to doand tell them how to do it. Themoneymagnet Another way to make your websitemore powerful is to have a \"money magnet.\" This is a free giveaway toencourage patients to give you their email addresses. Psychologist Robert Cialdini defined the \"law of reciprocity\" in his book ThePowerof Persuasion. The idea is that if you provide your prospective patients withsomething, they are more likely to giveyou something in return. Use a web form to offer something like a free posture analysis or a booklet, so prospective patients giveyou their name and email address before they can download it. This way you develop trust and a relationship. Building an effective website will attract prospective patients, decreaseyour marketing labor, and increase patient volume. If you take the time tobuild it right, they will come. DREW STEVENS , phD, is a renowned marketing mentor for chiropractors. Stevens transforms struggling chiropractors into wealthy champions.

For tax purposes, the predominant types of enterprise structures are the regular C corporation,its pass-through small-business cousin,the S corporation, a partnership, limited liability company (LLC), or sole practi-tioner (akin to the sole proprietorship). To choose among those entities is to choose among significant differencesin federal income tax treatment. Butthere is more to choosing the rightstructure for a practice than taxconsiderations. Not only will thedecision have an impact on how muchis paid in taxes but it also affects theamount of paperwork required, thepersonal liability you will face, andyour operation's ability to raise money.State and local licensing requirementsmust also be taken into account.Thetaxquestion Of all entities, the regular C corporationis generally subject to the toughest taxbite because the earnings of an incor-porated practice or business are taxed twice. First, a corporate income tax is imposed on the practice's net earningsand then, after the earnings are distrib-uted to the shareholder(s) as dividends,each shareholder must pay taxesseparately on his or her share of thedistributions. Naturally, a corporation can reduce or even eliminate its federal incometax liability by distributing its incomeas salary to shareholders\u2014employeeswho actually perform services for thecorporation. Although this can reducetaxation at the corporate level, thosewho receive profits from a corporationin exchange for services must pay taxon the amount received, which istreated as salary. Fortunately, there is some relief available to individual shareholders who currently benefit from the new, lower tax rate on dividends. This scheme of taxation differs radically from that applied to S corpo-rations, partnerships, LLCs, and sole practitioners or proprietorships. These entities are often referred to as \"pass- through\" entities and do not pay an entity-level tax on their earnings. Only the principals in these practices are taxed on their share of the entity'searnings. Goingitalone Although the easiest structure to create is the sole practitioner involving just one individual, liability concernsfrequently eliminate this entity from the starting gate. This is a shame Rightfromthestart T o achieve maximum success, structure your practice correctly. BY MARK E. BATTERSBY46 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMMONEY MAnAGEMEnT because the tax aspects of being a sole practitioner can be especially appealing.Income and expenses from the practiceare included on the sole practitioner'spersonal income tax return. What'safriendfor?Partnership If the practice will be owned andoperated by several professionals,partnerships warrant a close look.Partnerships come in two varieties:general and limited. In a generalpartnership, the partners manage thepractice and assume responsibility forthe partnership's debts and otherobligations. A limited partnership hasboth general and limited partners. One of the major advantages of a partnership is the tax treatment itenjoys. A partnership does not pay taxon its income but \"passes through\" allprofits or losses to the individualpartners. Each partner is required toreport profits from the partnership onhis or her individual tax return. Eventhough the partnership pays no incometax, the partners must complete and file a partnership informational return,Form 1065. Personal liability is obviously a concern for many chiropractors,especially those making use of ageneral partnership for their practice. Similar to a sole practitioner, general partners are personally liable for the partnership's obligations and debt. Partnerships are also more expensive to establish than sole proprietorships and often require more extensive legal and accounting services. Incorporatingandprotecting Using the corporate structure for a chiropractic practice is, as mentioned,more complex and expensive than for other types of practice entities. The resulting corporation is, however, anindependent legal entity separate fromits owners. The biggest benefit from incor- porating is the liability protection itprovides. Although the courts are increasingly \"reaching behind\" the corporate structure, for the most partthe debt of an incorporated practice isnot considered its principal's debt. Corporations also continue indefi- nitely, even if one of the shareholdersdies, sells his or her shares, or becomes disabled. Of course, on the downside, there is the double-tax paid at both federal and state levels. Notalwayssmall:Scorporations An S corporation is merely an incor-porated practice that has chosen to betreated as a partnership for tax purposes. It offers some appealing tax benefitswhile providing its principals with theliability protection of a corporation. With an S corporation, income and losses are passed through to share- 48 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMMONEY MAnAGEMEnT holders and included on their individual tax returns. As a result, there is justone level of federal income tax to pay. On the downside, S corporations are subject to many of the same require-ments corporations must follow. Thisresults in higher legal and accountingfees. They must also file articles ofincorporation, hold meetings for direc-tors and shareholders, keep corporateminutes, and allow shareholders tovote on major corporate decisions. Personalservicecorporations Professional athletes, entertainers,chiropractors, and other professionalshave long benefited from being profes-sional corporations. It is no secret thatmany chiropractors incorporatebecause of liability concerns. As a largenumber of those incorporated entitiesinvolve the services of the chiropractor,they are frequently labeled as \"personalservice corporations\" by the InternalRevenue Service\u2014a designation that asurprising number of chiropractorshave not found to be a deterrent. Identifying certain PSCs as \"qualified\" and taxing them at a flatrate of 35 percent was the govern-ment's way of reducing incentives forprofessionals to shelter part of theirincome in a corporate entity with a lower marginal tax rate. But PSCsremain popular as they afford protection against many forms of liability\u2014andcontinue to provide the tax benefits of an incorporated practice. NolimitstotheLLC While S corporations remain the mostpopular type of entity, the limited liability company (LLC) introduced in1997 is fast becoming the entity of choice among many professionals andbusinesses. An LLC is a hybrid entity,bringing together some of the best features of both partnerships andcorporations. LLCs were created to provide busi- ness owners with the liability protectionthat corporations enjoy without thedownside of double taxation. The earnings and losses of an LLC passthrough to the owners and are included on their personal income tax returns. Although similar to an S corporation, an LLC has no limit on the number of shareholders. In fact, any \"member\" or shareholder of the LLC is allowed afull participatory role in a chiropractic practice's operation. To set up an LLC, articles of organ- ization must be filed with the secretaryof state where the practice or business will operate. Some states also require the filing of an operating agreement, which is similar to a partnership agreement. As is the case with partnerships, LLCs do not have perpetual life. Somestates stipulate that the operation must dissolve after 30 or 40 years. Technically, an LLC dissolves whenever a member quits, retires, or dies. Despite its popularity and its many benefits, an LLC also has disadvantages. And because an LLC is a relatively new type of entity, its tax obligations vary by state. GrouppracticesandthePSC Professionals in group practices areoften more concerned about liability exposure for the malpractice of theirco-owners than themselves. Although a PSC, LLC, or S corporation mayshield a chiropractor from claims against his or her personal assets, theassets inside the practice often remain at risk. For this and other reasons,professionals often form multiplepersonal service corporations when engaging in group practice. Generally, each professional forms a separate PSC in which the individual owns 100 percent of the stock in his or her corporation. The overall group 50 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS S e p t e m B e r 1 , 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMMONEY MAnAGEMEnT practice can then be organized as a firm under one of the followingmethods: /trianglertEach PSC owns a partnership interestin a firm organized as a partnership, /trianglertEach PSC is a member of a grouppractice organized as an LLC, or /trianglertEach professional owns stock in an Scorporation. In turn, the S corporation contracts with the separate PSCs forprofessional services.Decisions,decisions Entities with more than one member are allowed to elect their corporatestatus on their annual tax returns.Thus, an entity that is a partnershipunder state law may elect to be taxedas a regular C corporation or even asan S corporation for federal taxes byusing Form 8832 (Entity ClassificationElection). Unfortunately, under these check-the-box regulations, entitiesformed as corporations may not electto be treated as another kind of entity. Changing circumstances, changes in tax law, and even the success of a practice can\u2014and should\u2014prompt areassessment of the type of taxable entity a chiropractor and his or her practiceoperates as. It makes sense to ensureyou are using the best entity to provide your practice and yourself with the most liability protection, benefits, and consistently lowest tax bill possible. MARK E.

This request came after therelease of healthcare compliance-related studies, which demonstratedsignificant vulnerability to patients,providers, and practices. 1 The studies revealed reasons to be increasingly concerned about patientprivacy, such as inappropriate access toor disclosure of protected information, data breaches, exposure to fraud,identity theft, medical record theft, andother harmful occurrences. Theseissues also pose significant risk topractices in the form of damagedpractice and patient relationships, investigations, and audits as well as costly penalties. The many conveniences that come with technology also come with respon- sibilities to healthcare facilities. Thoughpatient privacy has long been animportant topic in healthcare, a lack ofenforcement has largely left this crucialelement on the back burner in manypractices. Furthermore, advancementsin technology have also compoundedrisk and vulnerability, makingcompliance a priority. Limitedrisk In the past, the patient privacy risksmentioned above were pretty muchlimited to the possibility of a personwalking into a practice and taking offwith patient files. Risk, in that case,was limited to the number of patient records a person could carry out the door. Therefore, basic opening and closing procedures together with a responsible workforce were sufficient protections. While there were other risks to consider, such as claims being mailed out to the wrong payer, in general therisks and the potential impact to a large group of patients were minimal. Changingtimes Now businesses are operating in a world where masses of protected health information (PHI) are created, main- tained, stored, and transmittedelectronically. This extends beyond EHR software and includes scanning, email, electronic claims transmission, backup and storage, portable devices Riskybusiness Why you should make compliance a priority.

Access is no longer limited to someone being physically on site tocarry information off, but can nowoccur from just about anywhere, frommishandlings inside a practice tocybercriminals outside the U.S. Also,the number of patients at risk ofunauthorized exposure could potentiallyinclude your entire patient database. Newpriorities As mentioned, the OCR has the urgenttask of ensuring that compliance is apriority for healthcare providers. Intheir assessment, the reason complianceis not a foremost concern in manyhealthcare facilities is partly becauseenforcement efforts by investigativeorganizations have been lacking. To resolve this gap, the OCR has teamed with more agencies andimplemented protocols that allow themto conduct more investigations, quicklyrespond to potential reports or findingsof non-compliance, and sharpen thesting to noncompliant covered entitieswith fines and other types of penalties.The OCR is highly motivated to makethis a priority, not only to preserve theintegrity of PHI but also to collect millions of dollars each year frompenalties assessed for noncompliance. Some of the steps the OCR is taking to improve oversight of covered entitiesinclude: /trianglertFully implementing the permanentHIPAA audit program, /trianglertDeveloping a more efficient methodto search for and track coveredentities, and /trianglertExpanding outreach and educationefforts, including targeting thehealthcare industry. The OCR has been proactive in its approach and successful due tocovered entities (from all medicalspecialties) lagging in appropriatetraining, implementation, andevaluation of customized complianceplans. Current investigations arefocused on many areas, including: /trianglertConfirm the covered entity has recently completed a comprehensive Security Risk Assessment. /trianglertConfirm action items identified within the Security Risk Assessment have been completed or are on a reasonable timeline to completion. /trianglertIf the organization has not imple-mented any of the addressable security standards, confirm withinthe organization policies andprocedures why the addressable implementation standard was not reasonable and appropriate, and whatalternative security measures were implemented. /trianglertEnsure the organization has imple-mented an appropriate breach notification policy that meets standards. /trianglertEnsure healthcare providers haveimplemented the Notice of PrivacyPractices per the methods required by HIPAA privacy regulations. /trianglertVerify healthcare providers have appropriately implemented policies and procedures to preserve theintegrity of PHI (both electronic andotherwise), including internalworkforce PHI communications. /trianglertConfirm appropriate training hasbeen performed and appropriatelylogged. /trianglertConfirm that appropriate policiesand procedures for security safeguards are in place per the administrative,physical, and technical safeguardguidelines. /trianglertConfirm appropriate inventory and inventory security logs are completed, up to date, and meet requirements. /trianglertConfirm appropriate backup systems,disaster recovery plans, and other activity monitoring plans are in place. Practices must understand the risks they are taking if compliance is not a priority. Again, the risks to your patients and your practice can have a costlyand stressful ripple effect. Althoughimplementing a compliance program may seem daunting at first, once in place you'll find maintaining it is straightforward, and it will be morecost effective than the alternative. Obtain support and guidance if needed to develop and maintain a compliance program and be a proactive participant in complianceplan development. Purchasing a prepackaged binder with the intent ofcustomizing it is unlikely to suffice for most practices, and can be damaging in the event of an audit. There are many software and training options out there that can help younavigate the complexities of HIPAA compliance. Heed the warnings and ensure compliance in your practice.

His messagewas simple: It doesn't matter whetheryou agree with gravity or not\u2014it worksevery time. Science, when applied to our under- standing as chiropractors on how webelieve and then act, is simple. We havea brain that is connected to nerves.These nerves are connected to cellsand organs. They work better whenconnected to the source. Our next subject of discussion was the philosophy of chiropractic. Herewe ventured on discourse regarding the \"religion\" of chiropractic. My friend and I agreed that the religion ofchiropractic in the end serves no one.Alienation of the very people we aretrying to evangelize is the usual result. What we do and say must make sense. Deification and hyperbolediscredits the reality of our profession.This does not diminish in any way thesacrifices and genius of the chiropractic pioneers who have preceded us;however, appropriate and truthfully defined narration of our chiropractichistory must be the minimum standard. Finally there is the art of what we do. Here we spent the bulk of our time. The old joke of \"How many techniques are there in chiropractic?\" Answer: \"Take the number of chiropractors and multiply by two,\" is close to the truth. In our observation, not only is there a large number of ways to \"correct thesubluxation\" but there is an even largernumber of ways to define the term. Mywife, also present during our chat, was quick to offer that in her 30 or so years as a spouse, consumer, and often- frustrated defender of chiropractic, she had yet to hear a clear consensus as to what constitutes a subluxation. How many doctor's reports and health talks had she been a privy to? And still she had difficulty in sharing the chiropractic story with friends andfamily. Then we got to the meat of the matter. My friend was at our place inMontana to get adjusted. He had justdriven over 500 miles to get thosecouple of adjustments, easily passingup several hundred chiropractic officesin the process. Our recent move toMontana had apparently put him in aworld of hurt. \"You would think that I could find someone closer at home to do it right.\"But in his opinion he could not\u2014hence the 1,100-mile road trip. He teaches technique seminars, largely from frustration and a deepconcern that the art and the adjustingskill of the average chiropractor arepoor to say the least. My consulting and locum work have given me a similar impression. It is often gratifying, however, as many times a patient will be genuinely surprised at how effective a specific adjustment can be. As an instructor for a couple of decades in very specific chiropractic analysis and full-spine adjusting, my concern for theprofession is there as well. True, it takes many years to hone the skills introduced in college, but thepoint is that our profession has a way to go yet to excel in the delivery of what our philosophy says we have to offer. Science, philosophy, and art. These are three spokes in a wheel that, if balanced, leads to effective communi-cation and public understanding. Our delivery of chiropractic must begin and end in how precisely and effectively we can deliver the adjustment. All the other stuff must take second place.
