Hi Betty, what do you attribute your success to? The old adage of 'you are only as strong as your weakest link\" speaks to the success behind Back Benders. I feel that a powerful team plays a large role in the success of a business. I think of my business as an extension of my family, except with my business I can actually choose who I want to be part of that family. I'm very blessed to have a group of highly skilled, compassionate and like-minded women as part of my team. Each of them has unique gifts that they bring to the table. As an all-woman multidisciplinary practice, passions can run high but they are tempered with grounded spiritual work. There is an undercurrent of calm and connection that I think is crucial when offering body work. The practitioner needs to be centered and grounded to give the therapeutic work and the client needs to be able to receive. What we do is a ritual energy exchange. At the root of Back Benders, this is what my team understands and delivers to each client only adding value to our work and contributing to the success of my practice. Alright, so for those in our community who might not be familiar with your business, can you tell us more? Back Benders is an Integrated Chiropractic Studio that prides itself on providing conscious, intentional body work and heart centered services. Clients know as soon as they walk in the door they will be taken care of. From the moment they smell the aromatic essential oils and see all the crystals on display they usually take a big refreshing belly breath and that makes me so happy. Knowing that my office can provide such a visceral response gives me life. The type of sessions I provide offer highly individualized care. I combine conventional Chiropractic with alternative bodywork modalities such as vibrational healing, Pilates and crystal healing to design treatments that meet the need of each unique person. Now 10 years in, we have built an amazing practice. Due to current circumstances I think every small business has had to learn to pivot with the changing times. I'm really proud of my team. We've recently just launched Back Benders Virtual Studio, providing at-home Mat Pilates over Zoom, and remote Biofield Tuning sessions. In addition, we have a sister business, The Auric Fields which has a robust online shop that continues to add naturally made and responsibly sourced self-care products. The COVID 19 pandemic has changed every person on earth and particularly impacted small businesses the most. As a Chiropractor I am grateful to be considered an essential business and I have been able to see patients on a part time basis each week, and look forward to increasing my schedule once it's safe to do so. Half of my business has had to close, such as the massage portion but, fortunately, the Pilates is able to continue virtually, although not at full capacity. Whether online or in-person with a new set of protocols and sanization practices in place, our core values of intentional wellness and conscious care still ring true, and we're grateful to offer our clients and patients support during these challenging times. Any great local spots you'd like to shoutout? I love to be outdoors and I have 3 dogs so anywhere I can hike and walk is always on my list. I would definitely take guests to Griffith Park and do the hike up to the Observatory. The view is amazing and I just love to nerd out in the observatory itself. Some other great spots are in my neighborhood. There are the secret stairs in Eagle Rock and Pasadena. Then there's the hike at Chantry Flats and you have to see the waterfall at Monrovia Canyon park. The beaches are also another great escape, particularly Malibu and Newport. I'm a foodie but I cook a lot so I would definitely treat them to some good home cooking. Some local spots that are my favorites are Casa Bianca and sweets from Colorado donuts, both in Eagle Rock. One thing you must know about me, I love pizza and donuts! I would also take a trip to China town for some ambiance and delicious dim sum. I can't ignore my roots so a car ride to some authentic Mexican food at La Placita Olvera where you can literally find anything. There are also some amazing Mexican eats in my hometown of East Los Angeles, such as, Liliana's Tamales, El Tepeyac and La Mascota for some authentic pan dulce (Mexican sweet bread). Who else deserves some credit and recognition? Obviously, my team deserves a shout out. Their contributions make Back Benders the diversified healing space that it is. Also, my patients and clients who entrust their health and wellbeing to us. Last, but not least, my husband and sons. They support me 100% of the time whether I'm at work someone:](https://shoutoutinterviews.com/la/recommendations) ShoutoutLA is built on recommendations and shoutouts from the community; it's how we uncover hidden gems, so if you or someone you know deserves recognition please let us "}
