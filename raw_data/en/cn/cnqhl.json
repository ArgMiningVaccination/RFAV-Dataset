Older people can also be more sensitive to certain medications. To help you make better informed decisions about your medications, and to lower your chances of overmedication and serious drug reactions, the American Geriatrics Society Health in Aging Foundation recommends that older people be cautious about using the following types of medications, including some that can be purchased without a prescription (over-the-counter). | | Medication | | Reason | | USE WITH CAUTION NonSteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) AVOID regular, long-term use of NSAIDs |NSAIDs can increase | the risk of bleeding stomach ulcers.
