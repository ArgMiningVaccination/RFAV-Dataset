This year, our community and our colleagues continued to face challenges, as the COVID- 19 pandemic persisted. But, we persevered, with SPHP adjusting to meet existing and new needs in the community. The mission of St. Peter's Health Partners is to \"serve together in the spirit of the gospel as a compassionate and transforming healing presence within our communities.\" As such, we focus on community health and well-being to improve the health of the entire population, especially the needy and vulnerable. SPHP takes this responsibility seriously, as we have a strong commitment and responsibility to the communities we serve, including our patients and colleagues. St. Peter's Health Partners strives to be a leader in optimizing wellness and equity and eliminating disparities in our communities. We do this by leveraging resources and partnerships; focusing on those who are poor and vulnerable; and addressing the social influencers of health. St. Peter's Health Partners invested over $91 million in community health in Fiscal Year 2021, with our community health and charity care programs providing health improvement services, community education and direct care to uninsured, low- income and other vulnerable populations in the Capital Region. Through virtual and in-person programming, we've provided food assistance, prescription assistance, cancer and other health screenings, and advocated for healthier communities. We continued operation of the Social Care Hub to address the mental, physical, and emotional needs of patients during the pandemic. Our Faith Community Nursing program helped our most vulnerable patients and community members realize better health outcomes. The arrival of the COVID- 19 vaccines in late 2020 brought hope and optimism to our colleagues, patients, and community. St. Peter's Health Partners, together with Trinity Health and other local community-based organizations, worked on COVID- 19 vaccination outreach, education, and distribution. The \"It Starts Here\" campaign raised awareness about the benefits and accessibility of the vaccine, particularly in more vulnerable communities. Our efforts reached 11,804 people. We are grateful for the opportunities we have to serve our community, providing compassionate care and dedicated stewardship to the Capital Region and beyond.James K. Reed, MD President and CEO Katherine A. DeRosa Vice President, Mission Services About St. Peter's Health Partners People-centered, integrated care is at the heart of St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP).

These efforts included preventive services; community partnerships; the preparation of future health care professionals; uncompensated care, research and clinical trials; programs that impact well-being and health status; and efforts to meet the health needs of the uninsured, low-income and other vulnerable populations. Costs associated with our COVID- 19 response are included as part of the categories below.Hospital community benefit refers to initiatives and activities undertaken by nonprofit hospitals to improve health in the communities they serve. Community benefit activities must meet at least one of the following criteria: Improve access to health care services Enhance the health of the community Advance medical or health knowledge Relieve or reduce the burden of government or other community health efforts * Initiatives marked with an asterisk (*), while still serving the community, are not included in the total CB spend, in accordance with IRS guidelines. 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 1Responding to a Pandemic COVID CARE KITS FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP) Community Heath & Well-Being (CHWB), in partnership with the Interfaith Partnership for the Homeless, Joseph's House and Shelter, the Joseph's House Street Outreach Van, and the Homeless and Travelers Aid Society, distributed COVID Care Kits to the homeless populations in Albany and Rensselaer counties. The kits contained multiple items to help people stay safe during the pandemic, including hand sanitizer, face masks, and vaccine information cards. Those facing homelessness are at high risk of severe illness from the virus, and a large number don't have access to information about available vaccines or means to protect themselves from getting sick. Through funding this project, we are living our core values, especially Reverence and Commitment to Those Who are Poor. Additionally, CHWB provided funding to Joseph's House to install portable handwashing/sanitizing stations in high-volume homeless areas in the cities of Albany and Troy. CREATION OF A REMOTE LEARNING PROGRAM* For many colleagues with school-age children, balancing work with school closures and remote learning was a struggle at an exceptionally critical time. Throughout the 2020-21 school year, SPHP provided a remote learning program to school-age children of our colleagues. The Mercy Auditorium on the St. Peter's Hospital campus was converted into a socially distanced learning environment. Students were provided with breakfast, lunch, and snacks, and computers, if needed. The program was implemented by Community Health and Well-Being and Mercy Cares For Kids. Financial assistance was available for colleagues in need. VIRTUAL SUPPORT GROUPS OFFER CRIME VICTIMS A SENSE OF SAFETY In FY 21, St. Peter's Crime Victim Services (SPCVS) offered ten online support groups to help victims and survivors of crime foster connections during the pandemic. The goal of these support groups was to help victims and survivors throughout the Capital Region and across New York state learn coping skills, develop wellness strategies, and access support from the safety and comfort of their own homes. The groups focused on a variety of topics including: the power of music and art in wellness, body- mindfulness, healthy relationships, navigating trauma and addiction, and more. Participation was confidential and the program was offered at no cost. 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 2VIRTUAL HEALTH VISITS The COVID -19 pandemic drastically changed health care. Efforts to limit the spread of the virus through social distancing - as well as anxiety about entering health care facilities with COVID-positive patients - kept many people from seeking care for ongoing medical needs, including routine visits. However, the need to ensure good health has never been more important. In response to those concerns and needs, SPHP expanded our virtual health services to better connect patients with their health care providers during the COVID- 19 outbreak and beyond. St. Peter's VirtualCare, open to both established and new patients, uses secure telehealth technology to safely connect providers with patients using audio and video from the comfort of the patient's own home. Virtual visits are accessible through a smartphone, tablet, or computer with audio and video capabilities and a stable internet connection. Virtual access remains an option even as face-to-face visits return. SPHP'S MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY PROGRAM RECOGNIZED FOR BEST PRACTICES While COVID -19 vaccination efforts continue across New York state, expanding effective treatment for current coronavirus patients remains a key priority. On Dec. 3, 2020, SPHP became the first health care institution in New York's Capital Region to offer monoclonal antibody therapy, an FDA-authorized treatment for COVID -19. Melissa Fiorini, M.D., emergency medicine and critical care physician for SPHP, oversees the clinic on the Albany Memorial Campus and has been a driving force in enabling its expansion. This effort includes coordinating care for uninsured or homeless patients, not only arranging treatment but also temporary housing. Expanding infusions to several SPHP skilled nursing facilities is another important component to caring for those most vulnerable in the community. Treatment involves the intravenous administration of bamlanivimab or the combination of casirivimab and imdevimab. So far, research has shown that in certain people, these new drugs may help symptoms improve sooner and might lessen the likelihood that they will need hospitalization. The drugs are currently authorized for emergency use by the FDA based on limited phase II study data that showed monoclonal antibody treatment may decrease emergency department visits or hospitalizations. To date, SPHP's monoclonal antibody infusion clinic has treated more than 500 patients. \"IT STARTS HERE\" During FY 21, SPHP worked on COVID -19 vaccination outreach and education. CHWB, in conjunction with Corporate Communications and Trinity Health, launched a campaign titled \"It Starts Here.\" The campaign focused on populations disproportionately affected by COVID -19 infections and death, mainly communities of color, and people who are poor and underserved. \"It Starts Here\" supported local 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 3communities in accelerating vaccination efforts by raising awareness, educating the public, and offering the vaccine in community accessible locations, particularly for communities of color and those who are vul - nerable. CHWB collaborated with and supported local community-based organizations through grant funds awarded by Trinity Health; these funds assisted in building community capacity to vaccinate, as well as increase awareness and availability of the COVID vaccine. COVID-19 VACCINE POP-UP CLINICS SPHP partnered with multiple local organizations to hold COVID -19 vaccination clinics throughout the Capital Region. SPHP administered more than 150 vaccinations in February and March at Kennedy Towers, a senior housing development in Troy. The vaccine was available to tenants ages 65 and older from Kennedy Towers, Kane Apartments, Conway Court, Peter M. Guenette Apartments for Veterans, and Taylor Apartments. All eligible tenants who wanted to receive the vaccine were accommodated. In April, SPHP administered 500 vaccinations at Siena College in Loudonville. This clinic opened in response to the vaccination eligibility expanding to those age 16 and older. St. Peter's Health Partners Medical Associates (SPHPMA) operates Siena College's student health services clinic, which serves students and therefore serves our community. Both clinics were aimed at protecting our community by increasing vaccine accessibility to traditionally underserved communities who are at highest risk of severe disease. \"It was really an incredible effort. We received the call from the Governor's office on January 28, asking us to help facilitate a site in Rensselaer County. Within days, our tremendous team \u2014 from logistics, pharmacy, patient care, security, and more - was able to stand up a site and bring the vaccine to those who need it most in our community.\" \u2014 Matthew Miles, M.D., who oversees SPHP's COVID vaccine response, on the Kennedy Towers clinic. Addressing Social Needs COMMUNITY RESOURCE DIRECTORY As a member of Trinity Health, SPHP has a focus on serving all the people in our diverse communities, with a mission to serve those who are poor and vulnerable. Part of achieving this mission is providing the Community Resources Directory, an online tool that can be used to find local resources to meet the needs of our patients, colleagues, and those living in the communities we serve. Trinity Health partners with the Aunt Bertha organization to provide this tool. This directory, located on the SPHP website, allows anyone in the community to find and connect to free/reduced-cost community resources across all domains of need - from food pantries to temporary housing to job training and much more. Patients can connect with community partners on the site, sharing their contact information and letting the organization know that they need assistance. CARE FOR VULNERABLE PATIENTS AND COLLEAGUES CHWB staff established a system to check on the well-being of patients and colleagues under quarantine orders due to COVID -19. Our team screens for wellness and social needs. If the individual is experiencing any 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 4increase in COVID symptoms, we put them in touch with their health care provider. If they screen positive for any social needs, we link them to our Social Care Hub for assistance. The SPHP Social Care Hub was created in response to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic and increasing needs of our community. The Hub is a collaboration with SPHP's CHWB and Social Work Service Line. This Hub provides referrals for our patients, colleagues, and community members in need of resources such as food, housing, transportation, or child care. EMERGENCY ABSENTEE BALLOTS FOR INPATIENTS CHWB aided inpatients whose hospitalization was going to prevent them from accessing the voting polls for the November 3 election. At each patient's request, CHWB helped by contacting the patient's local county Board of Elections to complete a phone application for an emergency absentee ballot and helped mail completed absentee ballots, enabling patients to participate in their civic duty. PRESCRIPTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM The SPHP Prescription Assistance Program assists our uninsured or underinsured patients with obtaining long-term prescription medications that they may otherwise not be able to afford. Our Prescription Assistance Specialists help our patients access the free or low-cost programs that are currently available through pharmaceutical companies. During FY 21, the program assisted 1,440 individuals in obtaining their medication at low or no cost. SAFETY NET HEALTH CENTERS Safety Net Health Centers provide health care to a community or population that is vulnerable, at risk, or high need. SPHP currently operates eight Safety Net Health Centers that provide health and dental care to the under-insured and uninsured population. Operation of our Safety Net Health Centers promotes access to primary care services and other health services for those who are poor and vulnerable and those who lack access, and upholds our mission, vision, and core values. LANGUAGE ACCESS Our Patient Experience and Language Access teams worked with nursing and clinical staff to ensure standard communication processes for our patients and their families during times of no visitation. Colleagues used iPads for online Zoom and Skype calls between patients and their families. COLLEAGUE CARE TEAM* SPHP Mission and CHWB contributed significantly to our Colleague Care Team, a group working to gather and disseminate information concerning the many ways SPHP and Trinity Health supports its colleagues. Some accomplishments of the Colleague Care Team include: Resiliency Rounds (peer-to-peer support by visiting colleagues personally or virtually), information sheets and postcards encouraging the use of Carebridge, CHWB resources, and Spiritual Care. In addition, many local businesses graciously provided meals for our front-line workers during the pandemic. 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 5Combating Food Insecurity FOOD DISTRIBUTION SPHP along with Regional Food Bank of Northeastern New York, Catholic Charities Tri-County Services, and other community partners, supported and promoted food drops throughout the Capital Region. In FY 21, there were more than 100 food drops held, serving more than 67,000 households ( 200,000+ people). At each event, community members were screened for food insecurity and other social needs and resources were provided to meet these needs. FOOD FARMACY CHWB, funded through the Mother Cabrini Grant, operated a Food Farmacy program. The Farmacy provides food insecure patients, who also have a chronic disease, with a week's worth of healthy food and weekly education sessions. Our goal is to teach our patients how to make healthy choices, as well as educate them on the proper food choices to be made with their current disease. At the end of the first cohort (November 2020 ), the participants' A 1Cs dropped an average of 2.1% per participant. After the success of the first cohort, a second cohort was started in June in conjunction with SPHP Diabetes and Endocrine Care. In addition, a physical food pantry is located on the Albany Memorial Campus for those in need of shelf-stable food items. EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM In September 2020 , SPHP began a new food program that provides food insecure patients (who either present at one of our Emergency Rooms or various outpatient departments) a bag with three days' worth of healthy, shelf-stable food upon leaving SPHP's care. It also offers the patient a chance to be referred to one of our Social Workers so they can receive further assistance in any needs they may have. Since the initiation of the program, 85 bags have been handed out, assisting 140 people in total. In December 2020 , the Hildegard Medicus Cancer Center in Troy and the St. Peter's Hospital Cancer Care Center in Albany opened Food Closets with the goal of assisting food insecure cancer treatment patients. Cancer patients represent an especially vulnerable population because a lack of food poses risks impacting treatment, quality of life and survival. The CCCs provide a bag of food to anyone with food insecurity. The bag contains non-perishable items for breakfast, lunch and dinner and provides at least three days' worth of food. Patients can get a bag every week as needed throughout their treatment. To date, we have served more than 75 individuals and plan to continue the program indefinitely. Patients through this program are also connected with a Cancer Care Navigator to ensure long-term assistance is available. 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 6SENIOR FOOD PROGRAM In FY 21, SPHP ran a pilot program for a Senior Food Program at Ohav Shalom Senior Apartments. This program provided seniors who screened positive for food insecurity, and have an underlying metabolic condition, a bag of healthy fruits, vegetables and dairy every other week. SPHP partnered with the Regional Food Bank to deliver the food, along with educational materials for the participants to read/watch. The program received very positive responses from the participants. Reducing Health Inequities RACISM: A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS By advocating for racial justice, SPHP and Trinity Health are taking action to end systemic racism. We have joined others across the nation in declaring racism a public health crisis. We are addressing the racial inequities of COVID- 19 and advancing access to comprehensive health care for all. Declaring racism a public health crisis is an important first step toward making systemic policy change. BIRTH EQUITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT SPHP Maternity Care, located at St. Peter's Hospital and Samaritan Hospital, is excited to be a part of the New York State Birth Equity Improvement Project (NYSBEIP), a learning collaborative to develop and implement the best, safest, and most equitable care for Black birthing people in New York state. Goals of this project are to identify how individual and systemic racism impacts birth outcomes at our hospitals and take action to improve both the experience of care and perinatal outcomes of Black birthing people in the communities we serve. CELEBRATING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION Celebrating Diversity and Inclusion is an important aspect of SPHP, including Mission Services. Our quarterly interfaith programs are designed to expand our knowledge and understanding of the many religious traditions embraced by our patients and within our communities. These events highlight health-related topics with the perspectives of three world religions: Christianity (Catholicism), Islam, and Judaism. Interfaith program topics included end-of-life care within the religious traditions and the spiritual practice of fasting in honor of the Muslim celebration of Ramadan, the season of holy fasting. 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 7 Health Screenings MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING DAYS SPHP encouraged female colleagues and their spouses over the age of 40 to get screened for breast cancer during its free fall mammography days. Uninsured and underinsured colleagues were encouraged to participate. THE CANCER SERVICES PROGRAM The Cancer Services Program of the Greater Capital Region (serving Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, and Saratoga counties) provides free breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screenings to eligible, uninsured people (meeting certain criteria). In FY 21, 228 patients were screened through this program. Out of the 228 screenings, seven cancers were diagnosed, and four precancerous polyps were removed. The clients with a cancer diagnosis were enrolled into the NYS Medicaid Cancer Treatment Program (MCTP) to provide coverage for the duration of their cancer treatment. PROSTATE SCREENING In September 2020 , SPHP held a free screening, including a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test and physical exam, for men 50-75 years old, 40 years or older with a family history of prostate cancer, or 40 years or older and of African American descent. SPHP screened 18 men for prostate cancer. Supporting our Community INTERFAITH PARTNERSHIP FOR THE HOMELESS SPHP is committed to providing access to healthy meals to our most vulnerable community members and has provided funding for all food and nutrition expenses at the Interfaith Partnership for the Homeless (IPH) shelter on Morton Avenue in Albany. This shelter serves approximately 250 guests per year. PARTNERING WITH EQUINOX During October 2020 , SPHP provided funding for two projects of Equinox, a nonprofit community organization in the Capital Region serving adults and youth with chemical dependency, victims of domestic, individuals living with mental illness, and homelessness. First, CHWB and the Center for Philanthropy provided $10,000 to help fund the Annual Thanksgiving Community Dinner, serving more than 10,000 of our lonely, homebound, or homeless neighbors. In addition, 25 colleagues volunteered to help deliver these meals during the week of Thanksgiving. The second project addressed technology at Equinox's Domestic Violence Shelter, increasing the internet bandwidth. Each year, approximately 180 adults and 90 children find safety and needed assistance at the shelter. CHWB provided funding to enhance the current internet services in order to accommodate increased use of the internet by residents and their children for virtual learning, job searches, resource connections, and entertainment. Our donation will help to meet the expanded needs of residents to support them on their journey to health and independenceSINCE THE PROGRAM STARTED IN 2017 278 Colleagues screened 2 Early-stage cancers detected 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 8SUPPORTING LOCAL SCHOOLS Prior to the beginning of the school year, CHWB received a request for inhaler spacers for students with asthma at Averill Park and Brunswick school districts in Rensselaer County. (A spacer is a device that makes using an inhaler easier and more effective.) The pandemic and recommendations not to nebulize medications led the school districts to identify the need for spacers to be used with the student's inhalers. SPHP provided 60 spacers to both school districts. Often health insurance plans will only cover the cost of one spacer. With the provided spacers, children can leave one at home and one at school. Impacting Children Through Youth Initiatives MERCY CARES FOR KIDS* Mercy Cares For Kids (MCFK) focused on providing care to families during the pandemic. In spring of 2020 , many day care centers temporarily closed their doors. MCFK remained open and worked with families who decided to keep their children home during the pandemic. With the decline in enrollment, MCFK shifted to provide emergency child care to essential workers and a program for school-age children of SPHP colleagues. The children have continued to brighten the days of our neighbors the Sisters of Mercy. They created cards, posters, small gift bags for different occasions, and centerpieces for their Easter tables. During the Week of the Young Child, MCFK celebrated the children as heroes and paraded around the center and up to the Sister's courtyard. Some came outside to wave to the children and to cheer them on. MCFK has been fortunate throughout the pandemic to remain open due to the diligence of the teachers and families in care as well as the support from SPHP. BACKPACK PROGRAM Since 2018, CHWB has sponsored a back-to-school backpack program. SPHP pro - vides backpacks and basic supplies to the Pediatric Safety Net practices, who pass out the backpacks to families in need. In FY 21, 225 backpacks were distributed to children in need, including children of SPHP colleagues. SOCCER FOR SUCCESS Led by the Troy Boys & Girls Club, the program was made possible by a gift from SPHP and a grant from the U.S. Soccer Foundation. The grant offered the U.S. Soccer Foundation's Soccer for Success after-school mentoring program at select Boys & Girls Clubs throughout the Capital Region. The free program targets children from kindergarten through eighth grade, and aims to teach kids the fundamentals of soccer, as well as help them establish healthy habits and develop critical life skills. With COVID- 19 protocols in place, the program remained operational. During FY 21, 730 children participated in the program and 74 percent of the participants maintained or reduced their BMI levels. 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 9 CREATING BREASTFEEDING FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES (BABY CAF\u00c9) SPHP's Creating Breastfeeding Friendly Communities (CBFC) project, offers a variety of breastfeeding education and support services to nursing mothers in the greater Capital Region. Due to the pandemic, the in-person Baby Caf\u00e9s pivoted to a virtual environment, an approach that addressed the needs of new mothers from a distance. Virtual options have been especially helpful for women living in remote areas or with limited transportation access. With the help of a Rubin Family Foundation grant, CBFC was able to train four women of color to become Certified Lactation Consultants. They will be instrumental in supporting Baby Caf\u00e9 efforts in communities of color. CREATING HEALTHY SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES The Creating Healthy Schools and Communities grants help designated school districts in the greater Capital Region. The grants support wellness policies to ensure the districts have resources they need to successfully implement physical activity and nutrition standards, combating childhood obesity. For example, SPHP worked with school districts to provide playground stencils for structured physical activity during recess and conducted a virtual \"Project Adventure\" training for staff to build more purposeful play and team building into the school day. SPHP helped provide kitchen equipment to schools in order to offer healthier food options kids would enjoy, including a smoothie bar. In 2021, SPHP was awarded five more years of this funding and an additional Highmark Blue Shield grant to expand the work in additional school districts. Striving to Promote & Provide Wellness Programs in our Communities DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM In FY 21, the grant-funded Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) increased enrollment by 42 percent. The program received CDC full recognition for five years. DPP is now a Medicare DPP supplier and will begin getting reimbursed for our services through Medicare in 2022 . DPP also entered in a partnership with Albany County to deliver a total of five programs exclusively to Albany County residents over the next two years. DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM: FY21 227 Participants8 Sessions4% Average group weight loss 204 Minutes weekly physical activity 2,521 Total pounds lost 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 10THE BUTT STOPS HERE The Butt Stops Here (BSH) is an award-winning community smoking-cessation program developed by SPHP in 2001. In spring 2020 , with in-person programs on pause, SPHP staff - along with several community partners - developed a virtual (online) version of the program. Among other things, we wondered if smokers who were previously unable to attend an in-person group, such as those living far from a meeting site, would be interested in joining. The answer was a resounding yes. Public response throughout upstate NY has far exceeded our expectations. In 2020 , we scheduled 19 groups to meet popular demand. And in the first six months of 2021, The Butt Stops Here held 15 groups. New groups continue to be offered. So far, more than 1,000 smokers have registered for the virtual program. PROMOTING EVIDENCE-BASED TOBACCO DEPENDENCE TREATMENT HSTFNY, a grant-funded program of SPHP, enhances the reach and delivery of evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment (TDT) throughout the greater Capital Region. The program provides technical assistance to behavioral health, medical, and community-based organizations with a special emphasis on underserved and vulnerable populations. We collaborated this year with Alliance for Positive Health, which serves individuals living with or affected by HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses in a 15-county region. This population is known to be two to three times more likely to smoke cigarettes. CAPITAL DISTRICT TOBACCO-FREE COMMUNITIES Capital District Tobacco-Free Communities (CDTFC) and Tobacco-Free Communities | Delaware, Otsego & Schoharie, are NYS Department of Health grant-funded programs of SPHP. These programs utilize community action and advocacy. During the past year, Capital District Tobacco-Free Communities added 352 more healthy, smoke-free housing units in the Capital Region. These policies build support for the smoke-free norm for residents and those most vulnerable to the health hazards of secondhand smoke. In addition, we saw three more municipalities, the Town of Niskayuna and the villages of Scotia and Cooperstown, adopted 100% tobacco and vape free policies for their parks, recreation areas and municipal grounds. A Healing Presence Faith Community Nurse Program In July 2020 , SPHP implemented a Faith Community Nursing (FCN) Program, a free community-based health ministry offered to individuals of all ages who are associated with a faith or community congregation or have a desire to integrate spirituality into their care. The program focuses on the intentional care of the spirit, prevention or minimization of illness, promotion of health, and maintenance of wellness. A special focus is placed on care to the elderly, frail, vulnerable, and at-risk patients who may lack the human and financial resources or knowledge to care for or advocate for themselves. 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 11In addition to inpatient support, the FCN Program provides weekly education and support to patients admitted to the St. Mary's Campus Addictions Services Unit. To date, there have been 36 educational and support events impacting 346 individuals. The FCN Program collaborates with the parishes of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany and congregations of other faith traditions in the Capital Region, offering support and educational programs to both new and established parish nurse/FCN programs in our community. Fully funded through a grant from the Mother Cabrini Foundation, the FCN program is part of the CHWB and employs three part-time Faith Community Registered Nurses. The program assisted nearly 1,000 individuals in FY 21. SPIRITUAL CARE* The COVID -19 pandemic restricted hospital visitation from family and friends and Spiritual Care. Using iPads assigned to COVID- 19 positive patients, Chaplains were able to minister to those isolated patients while preserving PPE and protecting their own health. Additionally, the Virtual-Chaplaincy also enabled chaplains to support the families of isolated patients via video calls. The success of the program lead to an invitation from Trinity Health to be a beta test location for future tele-chaplaincy programs. COMMUNITY GARDENS* The pink blossoms of a Kwanzan cherry tree will forever serve as a tribute to the lives lost during the COVID- 19 pandemic and to the dedicated front-line workers who continue to tirelessly serve our patients, our community, and one another. The trees, one planted at St. Peter's Hospital and the other at Samarian Hospital - St. Mary's Campus, were purchased by the SPHP Wellness Committee to honor the struggles our colleagues and our community have endured throughout the past year. The trees reflect SPHP's core values of Justice, including fostering right relationships to promote the common good including sustainability of the Earth, and Stewardship, wherein we honor our heritage and hold ourselves accountable for human and natural resources entrusted in our care. The inscription on the plaques marking both trees read: We honor those lost, We celebrate those who served, and, despite the tragedy of COVID- 19, we remember ... Love never ends. ( 1 Cor. 13:8) 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 12MEDITATION GARDEN* The St. Mary's Auxiliary and SPHP's Wellness Committee, together with Facilities, transformed the outdoor garden area at Samaritan Hospital - St. Mary's Campus into a beautiful respite space. Colleagues, patients, and visitors can enjoy the fountain, abundant flowers, and quiet outdoor seating area while they de-stress and recharge. THE SAINT JOHN'S BIBLE SPHP hosted the Heritage Edition volume of The Saint John's Bible, the first hand-scribed bible in 500 years. The books are a limited edition, museum- quality work of art and biblical scholarship - one of only 299 sets in the world. At St. Peter's, the presence of the Bible, with its beautiful illuminations and calligraphy, enhances the healing environment in our common spaces. St. Peter's has also prepared several illuminations on special paper that can be taken into a patient's or resident's room, providing inspiration in our patient care spaces and residences. Throughout FY 21, SPHP Mission Services and Spiritual Care hosted a monthly page turning of the Bible (Prophets Volume) which features a reading and reflection offered by colleagues. Due to social distancing guidelines, this monthly event is recorded and posted on our social media pages for all to enjoy. 2021 COMMUNITY BENEFIT | 13315 South Manning Blvd., Albany, NY 12208 | sphp.comFor more information, visit SPHP.com/CHWB or contact the Community Health & Well-Being Program at SPHPSMCHWB@sphp.com 12/21 100 HA Member of Trinity Health "}
