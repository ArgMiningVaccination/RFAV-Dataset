And it can lead to gaps in patient care.Hartford Hospital has invested in a tool to help providers improve communication. It is a HIPAAcompliant texting service called TigerText,and we are offering it to the medical staff at no charge.TigerText allows a provider to send brief text messages, with patient identifiers, to another provider onthe system. Examples of texts include quick reports of a procedure, notification of discharge,questions about medications, etc. There is an option to alert people if you are on vacation, and thenotices that are sent are marked as read when they are opened by the recipient.We are anxious for all of our Medical Staff to enroll in this free application. It is VERY easy to use,even for those of us who have problems with new technology. We urge everyone to register and geton this useful and HIPAA compliant system today-it will make your job easier and improve patientsafety.Here is a TigerText Request form with directions on how to get TigerText:. You can downloadthe form hereFor further help with this, feel free to contactJohn.Rogalsky@hhchealth.org (860-972-3207).Any problems not resolved by the TigerText Help line can be referred to Dr. Marc Palter atMarc.Palter@hhchealth.org.TigerText SupportFor Hartford Hospital users, TigerText support can be obtained by calling the Hartford HealthCare helpdesk at 860-545-5699 and choosing option #6; or by calling TigerText Pro support directly at 650-564-4722.For issues related to password recovery, a helpdesk call is required and will be routed to the Mobilityteam.Hartford Hospital Media CoverageMedia Coverage Wrap-UpKen Bruno, Hartford HealthCare Rehabilitation Network, was interviewed on NBC CT about whatHHC is offering at this year's Hartford Marathon. 15 of 22Dr. Patricia DuFusco was featured in a story in the Hartford Courant about a new drug that canminimize side effects of breast cancer treatment.Read the story here.

The gas doesn't block outlabor pain as anesthesia would; rather it changes your perception of the pain, making it seem moretolerable.Hartford HealthCare began using nitrous oxide during labor and delivery in June. Nitrous oxide is alsoavailable through Yale New Haven Hospital's Vidone Birth Center in New Haven and the MiddlesexHospital Pregnancy and Birth Center in Middletown.In the HHC SystemBackus Cancer Survivors Day highlights supportThe Day, October 1Prevention, support, recovery: these were the themes of The William W.

Health Care News In the RegionCHA Provides Issue Briefs on Hospital PrioritiesCHA Update, Oct. 14Just three months into the current fiscal year, Connecticut is already facing a budget deficit that isconservatively estimated at $77.9 million. This latest estimate was reported last week by the legislature's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis(OFA), which also estimated an $80 million reduction in personal income tax collections and areduction in the sales tax revenue of $39 million.Although the deficit as it stands now only represents a small fraction of the state's overall budget, ithas provoked some sharp words from Republicans in the General Assembly and set the stage forwhat will likely be a difficult legislative session.In preparation for the upcoming legislative session, the Connecticut Hospital Association (CHA) hasreleased a series of Issue Briefs highlighting an array of topics important to hospitals, including somethat are specifically related to state funding, such as Hospitals and Taxes, How Hospitals are Paid,and Hospitals for a Healthy Economy. The briefs are being distributed to lawmakers and othersinterested in hospital legislative priorities.The ten briefs cover a wide swath of topics. In addition to the three listed above, they are:ConnecticutHospitals are Evolving; Hospitals Serve our Communities; Hospitals and Health Equity; Hospitals andPopulation Health; Hospitals and Mental Health; Hospitals and Substance Use Treatment;and Hospitals: Delivering Safe, Reliable, Quality Healthcare.Injuries, deaths from hospital errors drop 3 percentFairfield Citizen: October 18Injuries and deaths from hospital errors fell 3 percent statewide between 2014 and 2015.But there were increases at individual hospitals - including Bridgeport Hospital and St. Vincent'sMedical Center - and the overall number is still higher than it was a few years ago.That's according to the latest adverse events report from the state Department of Public Health. Theannual report tracks the number of incidents in which people were harmed while receiving care at20 of 22area hospitals. There were 456 such incidents in 2015, down from 472 in 2014, and 534 in 2013.The number is still higher than it was in 2012, when there were only 241 such incidents, but that's notnecessarily cause for concern, said Mary Reich Cooper, chief quality officer for the CT HospitalAssociation.\"That initial increase (between 2012 and 2013), we think, is due to improvements in reporting,\" shesaid.The subsequent decline, Cooper said, is likely because hospitals and other healthcare agencies haveput an increased emphasis on safety. However, she concedes that the problem of hospital errors is farfrom fixed.\"Our goal is zero (adverse events),\" Cooper said. \"Preventable harm to even one patient is one toomanyCT News Junkie: ConnectiCare Tries Different Approach To HealthWhat if there was an Apple Store for your health?
