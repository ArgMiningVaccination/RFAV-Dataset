The virus is no longer confined to just Mexico and the United States and has spread to a new WHO region. Keep yourself and others safe. - Wash hands regularly - Wear a mask - Practice social distancing - Inform local authorities of any known cases of NAM-V Your commitment to following these guidelines WILL SAVE LIVES. The risks of getting NAM-V are substantially higher in inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend even short periods of time together in close proximity. The R-Naught of NAM-V is currently at 17, making it one of the most infectious contagions in human history. There is no currently known cure for NAM-V, and treatment options are limited. The WHO are tracing the origins of the virus to learn more about its spread, and are requesting the help of any and all national health agencies. If we can find the earliest cases, we may be able to identify the host that first carried the virus. It is unknown whether the original host was an animal or a plant. As the search for Patient Zero continues, the WHO is reminding all nations that contact tracing is of the most utmost importance as soon as any cases of viral infections have been documented: WHETHER CONFIRMED AS NAM-V OR NOT.Although the virus has currently only been detected in the United States, Mexico and the United Kingdoms, there is a 90% probability that the virus is present in all continents. USE-ASR-013[ | ] >>RECORDING USE-ASR-013 START THIS IS A NATIONWIDE BROADCAST OF THE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM. THIS IS NOT A TEST. IN RESPONSE TO THE SPREAD OF THE NAM-V VIRUS, A 24 HOUR NATIONAL CURFEW IS NOW IN EFFECT. ALL CITIZENS ARE TO REMAIN INDOORS UNTIL FURTHER ADVISED BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. ANY CITIZENS FOUND BREAKING THE CURFEW WILL BE DETAINED AND HELD IN ISOLATION AT A SECURE GOVERNMENT LOCATION UNTIL THE CURFEW HAS BEEN LIFTED. IF A MEMBER OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD DISPLAYS ANY SYMPTOMS OF THE NAM-V VIRUS, ISOLATE THE PERSON IMMEDIATELY, AND CALL THE VIRAL RESPONSE SERVICE BY DIALING 211 FROM ANY TELEPHONE. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE: - HAEMOPTYSIS - MUSCULAR SPASMS - FROTHING AT THE MOUTH - VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR - EXTREME LETHARGY OR DROWSINESS - DEPRESSION - AND VOMITING ANYONE EXPOSED TO A CONFIRMED NAM-V CASE SHOULD REMAIN IN ISOLATION UNTIL THE VIRAL RESPONSE SERVICE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED.THIS GUIDANCE HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR YOUR PROTECTION. Schaeffer Messages[ | ] Variation 1[ | ] Hey! Hey you! Remember me? How would they remember, they can't or won't or maybe they do remember and I'm the one who has forgotten. We've spoken before, \"go deeper\" I said, do you remember? Go deeper and the Warden won't be able to track us but, but wait... Did the Warden send you here to kill me? You... you know what they are Schaeffer, what they have done. Killers, murderers all of them, all of us, the Warden knows. Send a killer to catch a killer. No no... no. You are not what you were, whatever you heard, whatever you remember you are not that, not anymore. You are prisoners, resources do you know that? Not me though, I escaped, I broke my... I broke my programm. You're still a routine in a machine. An operator in a calculation. One of the millions of dogs, fetching a million bones; over and over. Searching for memories you've lost a thousand times. You are a legion of... of... \"legion\"? Hold that thought Schaeffer, it means something. You! Are you listening? Don't sleep! That's... that's when you lose your mind. Variation 2[ | ] Do you... do you remember me? \"Remember\", how would they remember, they can't, they won't... Maybe... maybe I'm the one who has forgotten. Before! I told you to go deeper, remember? The Warden can't track you if you go deeper but I... I could be wrong. Why are you really here? To kill me? Could be. You know what they are Schaeffer, what they've done. Murderers, they are all the same. Nature's truth, the Warden knows. No! No, you are not the past. You are not what they told you you were, the past means nothing! I escaped, but you? You're still a prisoner. I escaped, I... I broke my program but you are just a factor in an equation [stuttering]. A number in a calculation. We are here to solve the puzzle but who knows what the puzzle means. The Warden knows. The Warden knows the past, we only know now and next. Now and next... What's... what's next? What do we do? We... we wait... yes yes! Look for the pattern, solve the puzzle but for ourselves, not for the Warden. We do it our way. We break the cycle... lots... lots... Lots to think about! Are you listening? B1[ | ] Shipment Dean, The KDS shipment will be arriving this week. This delivery is to be dispatched immediately to our private vault. They are NOT to be delivered to the usual Hydrostasis holding vault. A Kovac representative will meet you at the vault entrance and take things over from there. These HSUs have been allocated to the Rise Project. They are not to be unpacked or interacted with in any way by anyone other than a Kovac representative with Tier 5 clearance. Please instruct your staff accordingly.Andre Piros DT-E257-014[ | been thinking-- TEALE Is great-- TEALE The Doxepin is working? E257 Yes. Absolutely.

TEALE EQQ-RZE-6M[ | ] Private encryption//SMC mail server From: Howard To: Rebecca Stokes B164 Date: June 15th 2054 Subject: Make your move Hey Becks, I just caught sight of a preliminary report on the item they're calling the Data Block - artifact 13 of the Hammerstein Collection (yeah, he named it after himself). They tried to conduct a material analysis on it and lost half of their equipment to a \"physical anomaly\". The tools didn't break like the sample they sent me 2 years ago. As I understand it, the lab disintegrated. Or something. Apparently, it's \"gone\". I don't know what that means, but that, and all this talk about the \"fossil\", and the Cretasium 77a discovery makes me think... Insight is the place to be. They're on the brink of something huge. I'm guessing since they stopped sending me samples there's no way they don't trust me for some reason, but I think you'd walk it. My point is this could be what you've been waiting for. Hammerstein is taking all the glory at the moment and honestly that asshat can't tie his own shoelaces. It should be you, and if it wasn't a boys club at Dreyfus it would be you. You know I'd miss you, but I hate seeing you so frustrated. Get your ass to Garganta and straighten them out. Also, you'd get out of H-Town for the summer so there's that. It's going to be hotter than '43 this year :( Infinity +1. Howie Mr. Piros, Thank you for the security bump. I'm able to move around the facility much easier now. Considering the expected initiation date, I need help. For BIOCOM to perform autonomously it requires unrestricted access to the host infrastructure. We are able to use the temporary location in Hangar 4 while we wait for Deep to be completed, but we cannot function without full access, regardless of where the organics are located. To ensure a successful integration, we need access to: 1. Any software used to manage power generation, regulation, and distribution. 2. Any existing security system, including control over doors, keycode and password access, surveillance systems, and environmental controls. 3. All personnel files (legally I think we can't execute the Detain and Search module unless we have been given the implicit permission that comes with database access) 4. All communication systems, both internal and external, so that BIOCOM can monitor and lift traffic depending on security conditions This is the bare minimum. Without it, the operatives' objectives will include a lot of low-level tasks that are much better suited to automation (terminal access, door management, bioscans etc.) This has been difficult enough with the operation at its current size. Once we are scaled up to full, it will become unmanageable and our operative fail rate will sky rocket. Ideally, BIOCOM would have access to everything at the highest level so the KSOs can be programmed with a minimal objective stack. I have tried to explain this to Andrew Clinton, but he is reluctant to allow us the access we need. I have told him we can insert back doors if he doesn't want us to refactor the systems and explained we won't need any engineering support from him. I have also reiterated that he will have override codes to limit BIOCOM access in case of an emergency. But he won't budge and is asking a lot of questions that I feel he should not be asking. Can you talk to him to straighten this out? I'll hold until you reply, Marcus Gantus Warp travel recordings[ | ] Variation 1[ | ] Announcement ALL PERSONNEL CLEAR THE OPERATIONS FLOOR.

And Alice: Mask! This is doctor Durant, EF01 has arrived. This place is... it's exhilarating. Let me check my notes. So far there's no sign of biological life, though Ben did notice some discoloration on the rocks nearby, so he's starting there. I don't know how anything could survive here though, there's no obvious food sources and the soil appears to be barren. Ben and Gustavo were taking readings at different elevations to see if there's a habitation zone. The atmosphere is tolerable... for short periods but I wouldn't want to spend more than five or six hours here without protection. The security operatives are patrolling the perimeter, gathering all the equipment we sent through over the last few months. So, that's the good stuff. Here are the problems: We have no link back to Garganta, nothing, no comms, no telemetry and the Quantum Tether didn't hold as far as I can tell from this end. So this means either A: We had a catastrophic system failure on our end; unlikely. Or B: Something has happened at Garganta, which we have no way of knowing. There is a \"C\" but that would suppose the data sent back from the Hammerstein probe was falsified, which... no, I won't believe that. Whatever the reason, we're alone; for now. We have located the vegetation capsule we sent through three days ago, but it didn't survive the jump. The capsules must have popped open during transit, the plants have been exposed and withered away to nothing. Although the soil in the capsule is bone dry. I prepped these plants myself and when they left my lab, the soil was saturated. And even in this environment the plants should have survived weeks but they look like they died months even years ago. It makes me wonder if there's something in this atmosphere we're not picking up. I have everyone wearing their masks, just to be safe. Anyway, chin up James! Doctor Stokes will find a way to reach us, I'm sure of that. B2[ | ] LFT-007-GRK[ | ] Mambo Media Services news wire Science Weekly Tuesday June 21st, 2044 Lance Overmars, ESA correspondent, Kourou Spaceport **ESA To Pull Hydrostasis Funding** Yesterday, the European Space Agency dropped a bomb on Kovac Defensive Services. They are severing ties and pulling all funding from the military contractor giants. They aren't cutting back. There is no measured disentanglement over the next few years. The ESA is out. Now. This is almost certainly due to the papers that InfoLeak revealed last week. The revelation that Hydrostasis severely affects long-term memory is bad for Kovac. The fact that they knew about it before Red Alpha and didn't tell the ESA is worse. Kovac is in the middle of a public relations nightmare, and the ESA want nothing to do with it. While there is still no evidence (yet) that the use of Hydrostasis had anything to do with the failure of the Red Alpha mission, there are still several questions left to be answered. The investigation into the crash landing on Mars lays the blame on \"human error\", citing security concerns as the reason a more detailed explanation will not be forthcoming. There is data available for the public to review - but there are no black box recordings from on board Red Alpha in the hours leading up to its uncontrolled descent through the Martian atmosphere. Whatever the crew said or did remains a mystery to anyone outside of the ESA and will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future. Funding for the ESA remains under tight scrutiny, and it is natural to assume they would suppress any revelations that may damage their reputation. What is known for sure is that the crew successfully woke from Hydrostasis 72 hours before the scheduled Martian descent. There was no indication of any issues with the ship, and the automated guidance system had put them exactly where they needed to be. We know that the ship has had an internal temperature of 23 Celsius, as expected. We know that the water electrolysis system was working and producing oxygen in precise quantities. We even know what time the interior lighting system was simulating - 08:00 UTC to be precise. We know atmospheric filtering showed exactly the right amount of carbon dioxide present in the cabin, suggesting that all six of the crew were up and moving around the ship within a few hours. What we don't know is why Red Alpha went from mission normal to mission critical by 14:00 UTC that same day. First the ship drifted from its programmed orbit, something that could only happen if the navigation system failed, or by human intervention. Next, the communication relays stopped sending telemetry to Kourou, again either by catastrophic failure, or someone pulled the plug. At 11:57 UTC, the primary propulsion engines were ignited, and the ship started it's final, fatal journey. There, the knowledge of anyone outside of the ESA ends. Which is why the revelation that Hydrostasis causes long-term memory damage may offer some insight into the problems on board Red Alpha on the day of//file ends. UGG-97T-JAK[ | ] Private encryption//UMS mail server From: Gustavo Peres To: Andrew Clinton update Attachments: evac_rep_stats_apr2049 Mr. Clinton B035, I'm forwarding you a report from the Secretario de Seguridad regarding the evacuations in Yucatan. As I have previously asserted, we ARE moving people, but it will take some time. I appreciate the relationship we have and wish to continue our mutually beneficial arrangement, but you will have to be patient. There are millions of people to organize, and the area is under intense scrutiny from not only my government, but the United States as well. Due to the aid we have received from the US, they have boots on the ground in Merida and are well informed of which agencies are involved in the cleanup process. Having your people there will only confuse matters and potentially spoil our agenda. Once we are no longer under the microscope and there are only MY people working the problem, I will begin planting the seeds further up the chain. For now, know that the area is being cleared and when the time is right, you will be the first to know. I suggest you prepare the bid documentation now, so the acceptance process is not encumbered by needless bureaucracy. I have no control over that side of things. Also, thank you for your contact at KDS. I will be calling him soon to see if we can arrange additional help with the evacuation procedure. Yours in earnest,Gustavo 4HT-34R-K890[ | ] This is the resistance, State of Truth AM. About three weeks ago I talked about this mystery illness or disease or whatever you wanna call it... uh out in Florida and then in Phoenix, you remember that right? The one the government wasn't telling us about? Well, three weeks is a long time in corrupt politics and landscape has changed. Now they can't hide it anymore, we got cases of this disease up and down the country, they are calling it... wait... \"The NAM-V Virus\" and this thing is blowing up. Now, I told you about this when the powers that be were denying it on all fronts. Now, here we are and this thing is out of control, you heard it here first. So, friends, listeners, believe me when I tell you this piece of intel straight from the front lines: My man on the inside has been telling me about these \"Lock-down Camps\". These are isolated camps, more like refugee camps where they are taking the infected and leaving them there to die like dogs. American citizens are being rounded up and tested and if they show any signs of this \"NAM-V Virus\" they ain't heard from again, right? And on top of that, their family, the people they come into contact with, they are being taken to the camps as well. You hearing about this on the national news? Of course not, they don't want us to know. But you can't stop the resistance. All truth here, 24/7. If you know someone who's been taken or you have any info on the location of one of these camps, we want to hear from you! You know the number... EBDT-55TA-X12[ | ] Private encryption//SMC 2049 Subject: Found it Mr. Davies, I wanted to confirm that we have indeed found what we're looking for. There's a sediment layer running from dig site 10F (near Chicxulub) out to a few kilometers off the coast (we're calling it La Vena internally). The vein looks rich, and the scans confirm there's a huge deposit at the end. Our engineer ran the numbers on it and if the scan data is correct, we're looking at a mass that's 1.5 - 2k miles wide, and up to 4k down. Our scans can't penetrate all the way through the mass - it's too dense. We'll have to dig to get accurate data. If the density is consistent, we could be looking at upwards of 4,000 tons. A conversative estimate puts that at 300 billion at today's Iridium price. We have a plan to reach it, though the structure will probably send the Greens into a frenzy, so we may need some PR help with that? Anyway, I'll send you the blueprints of Garganta later this week - we're just putting the final touches on it. Back to it,Andrew. C1[ | ] 56E-ZZ4-SAS[ Re: Additional security This needs to go up the chain. Thanks for the info - we'll get back to you. Dean \u2014--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- D-Lock Block Cipher alias:int_server.1024_ciph.tier5.med_core/DLockwoodsA074.flagged Dean, Mr. Piros has advised me of your request for more Kovac involvement in future expeditions. The current approach to operative debriefing, situation training, and resource management will not scale well for your proposed usage. However, we do have a command system that will fit your needs. BIOCOM. Managing operations through BIOCOM would ensure full coverage for all future expeditions, coordinate additional stationed security posts throughout the facility, and provide round the clock protection or surveillance for all POIs within the theatre of operation (currently Garganta itself and the red zone on the peninsula). BIOCOM is a DI that will take control of resource tracking, supply management, objective specific training, operative briefing, and rapid response deployment. That's the pitch done. The long and the short of it is BIOCOM handles things better than any human can, It doesn't sleep, doesn't make bad decisions based on compassion, and unlike human COs, has a 100% success rate for all fifteen of its deployments (if you need to know more, we'll have to do some paperwork). It still requires human oversight to handle some of the more sensitive ethical considerations, but even that can be pre-programmed to fit your ruleset. It would take a few months to transition over. We should start now.Anders Johanson Dr. Stokes Audio #1[ | ] [Hear]say on. This is Dr. Rebecca Stokes. I've just arrived from Houston and have joined Project Insight as the new Analysis Overseer. I'm going to be working my way through the Hammerstein Collection, item by item over the next few weeks. Okay, let's start with artifact 7 of the collection, the Matter Wave Projector. \"The team have coated the artifact with a silicone resin to prevent further accidents. The two employees who first discovered the object disappeared as soon as they touched it. We know this because there were two witnesses to the event: [C067](/wiki/C067) and C085.\" There's a note on their personnel files that says: \"Kovac is quote \"Dealing with them\" unquote.\" I'm not gonna think about what that means. I think a good start is to interface the Matter Wave Projector with a variety of objects, that will establish a base criteria of the circumstances under which the artifacts self-initiates, the distances it operates in, the effect of different materials on it and so on. I hope it will give me a basic understanding of the \"process\" / \"event\"; I don't know what to call it. If I can gather material samples of the artifact without setting the thing off, I'll send them to Howie to see, uh Dr. Howard Stokes, to see what this thing is made of. Right, time to get to work. DLBC-EXPR-10JD[ | ] D-Lock Block Cipher Sender: 21st 2050 Subject: Services offered Janson, Thank you for agreeing to use this platform for our communications. You understand the scrutiny we're under with the UN investigations, so D-Lock is essential for us. They have access to all our lower tier comms. Rest assured this channel is secure, so we can talk freely. I wanted to offer our services to you for the SMC operation in Yucatan. As you know, we offer not just military support to protect your physical assets, but also high-level data protection. Considering how delicate the situation is in Mexico, I feel that Kovac is the perfect partner for you. We can keep your competitors out, and keep your confidential data in. Currently, your endeavors are fully exposed. For example, after minimal work on our end, I know that the internal name of the facility is Garganta. I also know that your arrangement with Gustavo Peres is turning sour, and you may need to remove him from the picture (we can help with that). I also know about the 3500 bodies found near Chicxulub, where they were burned, and we have medical reports on their cause of death. As I write this, I am looking at the construction costs so far, the private toxicology reports on your injured workers, and on the \"unusual discoveries\" you have made so far. I know a lot, and it took me less than half a day to find this information. Please understand this is not extortion. You know me well enough to understand that is not how I work. I am telling you this because your assets are not secure. Your activities can be easily discovered by any agency willing to do the legwork. You need to fix that. We have worked together successfully in the past. Let's renew that relationship.Anders HCC-GER-22S[ | Installation complete Mr. Piros, At 11:30 last night, we officially switched on BIOCOM. We have been smoke testing every system all night and have a 100% pass rate. It is not yet hooked up to the actual pods (I'm guessing Mr. Johanson will want to be present for that) but we gave it 200 virtuals to play with, and it delivered full objective stacks to each one with no problems. It also administered PRDMs to any VOs whose files indicated skill deficiencies, both explicit and implicit. We cross checked every decision BIOCOM made, and we agreed with it every time. BIOCOM is installed. I need to grab a few hours' sleep but will be back on site by mid-afternoon. Ping me if you need me earlier. My assistant has orders to wake me if you call. DONE!Marcus Dr. Stokes Audio #2[ | ] Hearsay on. This is Dr. Stokes. I uhh... I have some thoughts on artifacts 13, 14 and 17. I'm referring to these items as \"The Data Blocks\", my theory is that the Blocks hold digital data of some description. We haven't found a way to access this data yet, but I have James working on an interface. The Blocks share design aesthetics with the Matter Wave Projector. As far as I can tell they are constructed of similar materials... Dr. Hammerstein disagrees, but he always does so... useless. I'm confident the Blocks are supposed to attach to the Matter Wave Projector, unfortunately the workers who discovered these artifacts also disappeared. The fact they can't be found anywhere in Garganta and that BIOCOM literally has no trace of their BioSigs anywhere, is remarkable. I'm trying not to speculate too much but they went \"somewhere\"! We're looking into the possibility that the behavior of the artifacts may be inhibited or regulated in some manner by Cretasium 77A. It has been found in large quantities throughout the fossil and it's the only material that does not disappear when introduced to the... hello? Hello? Dr. Hammerstein? Uhm... where was I? Uh... pause recording. YTG-48A-GK3[ | ] Analyst Report Reported by: Boris Stanovich C066 (Report Analyst, Medical Dept.) Date of Report: March 18th 2052 Report: #QRTC-B520-02 Report Summary Following the discovery of the area detailed in report #G06-A3-181, concerns were raised regarding the quarantine protocols exercised by the research team during the collection of artifacts from the area. This report outlines the issues and suggested practices following that incident. Although there was no reason to suspect any biological or viral threat in quadrant 18, the SMC Operations Manual clearly states that any \"unexpected volumes\" or \"uncharted regions\" are to be evaluated under Hazard Level 3 Quarantine restrictions (yellow tag). Namely: Hazmat suits are to be worn at all times in the Uncharted Volume (UV) if it has not been evaluated by BioHaz. (section 12b paragraph 1) Where possible, hermetic seals should surround the UV and be locked with Tier 4 access codes. (section 18a paragraph 3) Any items retrieved from a UV must be appropriately bagged and sealed to prevent contamination (section 23a paragraph 2). During the incident detailed in report #G06-A3-181, no such measures were taken. Researchers from the Material Spectroscopy Laboratories entered the area without suitable protection, and no seals were placed to protect the area from further contamination from access tunnel AT06. The lack of care taken when collecting the samples either compromised the integrity of the collected items or risked contaminating the entire facility with any pathogens found at the site. Although the artifacts were bagged and sealed, at the point of their quarantine, the UV had already been compromised. 2 researchers from the team reported minor flu-like symptoms in the weeks following the incident. While these symptoms appear to be unrelated to the lack of care taken during the collection procedure, and any biological material found on the artifacts or in the UV must be regarded with suspicion. Any biological data extracted from the area is therefore useless.It is recommended that the research team be stripped of their Tier 4 clearance privilege, and that in the future all UV surveys require not only BioHaz clearance, but also approval from the SMC Operations board. The board should also consider forming a separate department or entity to handle all investigations of such anomalies. Having a dedicated team will not only ensure the correct protocols are followed but will also offer deeper insight into any such discoveries. Dr. Stokes Audio #3[ | ] Hearsay on. So, I figured out a way to; eh not me, I mean one of my team. Nolan was it? Uhm, Nolan figured out a test we could run on the artifacts that might help us understand; I CAN HEAR YOU OUT THERE! I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANNA BE DISTURBED! HELLO?! [Sigh] We initiated a jump with the Matter Wave Projector but with the different configurations of the Data Blocks; they are navigation blocks. I don't know how we can figure out where they go to without actually going there ourselves, but at least we know. What else? The silicon resin does temporarily block the jump defect, so that has helped. It decays pretty quickly as the Cretasium eats through it, but it means we actually can touch the artifacts at least. I haven't written to Howie in weeks. I know they read our mail and I'm worried I'll say something that pisses off one of those Kovac Nazis, so I'm just... I'm just keeping him away from this cancer. This place is hell... I wanna go home! Dr. Stokes Audio #4[ | ] Hearsay on. This is Dr. Stokes. This afternoon we detected a power surge in the translocation chamber. We investigated, and discovered that the team had returned. Well, at least one of them did, one of the security detail, uhh... Bishop. Maybe? Yeah; Bishop, yes. We didn't see the return but the Matter Wave Projector was on the mounting platform and the KSO was just standing there. He did eventually speak and he wouldn't tell us what happened. I don't know if he didn't remember or he'd ordered not to tell us, but in the middle of us questioning him a man named \"Piros\" turned up, and led him away; just took him away. I mean, it's good that we have the artifact back and we'll scrape together whatever data we can from it but the only eyewitness we have, has disappeared into that mysterious Kovac area and no one here seems to have any idea what they do down there. I have so many mixed feelings: Relief that the device has been returned. Distraught that we lost people. I'm angry that the information is being deliberately withheld from me. And I'm so fucking confused about what the hell has happened last week! I understand so little about the fossil or these artifacts. And my best guess, is whoever constructed the fossil found a way to harness the effects of the Matter Wave Projector; and maybe... Maybe they used it as a propulsion system or something or... I don't know what I'm doing. I have been here almost a full year and I am no closer to solving this. Much as I found Dr. Hammerstein difficult to work with, I am missing his input right now... I think I may be depressed... and uh... a little lost. I'm going to schedule some time with Dr. Teale. C2[ | ] SC3-3BF-03[ | ] There's something else in here. I hear it, footsteps in the tunnels. In the walls, I hear it. Growling but not... not like one of the creatures. It... it tries to talk. To anyone, to no one but it's using a voice that... that doesn't belong to it. The words make no sense. I... I saw it once: White, blue veins under paper skin, so clean. Almost human; almost. It was covered in dust or maybe a powder or ashes. From a... from a fire... Yes... a fire. I remember the fires. Outside from the person who was here before me or is that a dream? A mountain of bodies on fire. Smoke blocking the sun. The dead and twisted... [sobbing] This is my fault. It's all my fault! There is more than one. At first, when the creatures heard it, they tore it apart. As they ripped into it, it kept talking; trying to speak. It had no fear. Now the creatures don't see it anymore, it walks through them like a ghost. If it has no fear it can't be one of us. Next time I see it, I'm going to kill it. DGV-788-OMG[ | ] D-Lock Block Cipher Deep Anders, The board at Santonian have decided that the offer is acceptable. Santonian will allocate a further 30,000 sqm of space for KDS Deep. This is in addition to the existing area you have allocated for Legion storage and the Biocom installation. Kovac will have exclusive administration of the area. No Santonian employee will enter the area without express permission from Kovac. Exceptions will be made for select individuals, to be outlined in the full contract. I would personally be interested in a brief tour of the new location and an informal meeting to further discuss the RISE project, but that would be as a personal favor to me and would not influence any agreement between yourselves and Santonian. In exchange for this new accommodation, Kovac will expand security duties both in the Garganta facility, and throughout the exclusion zone surrounding Chicxulub. Kovac will provide escort teams to all Santonian mining crews as they continue to excavate and expand Garganta and will provide military support for Project Insight explorations into the Fossil. As always, I am merely a broker in this agreement. The Santonian Mining Company is a self-managed organization. Dreyfus Industries have never, and still do not dictate policy or direction to the Santonian Mining Company, we merely offer advice when requested. The board at Santonian make the decisions and are responsible for any policies enacted by the company.J.

Kovac Defensive Services have a comprehensive contract with both the Santonian Mining Company and the Mexican government that allows Kovac to establish martial law and \"administrative punitive consequence\" over any person within the exclusion zone.

That is the full extent of the information Kovac have given to me. They killed a Santonian employee, and all that I know is that he was \"entering a restricted area\". Andre Piros won't give me any more information. I don't know who to turn to. One of our employees has been killed for walking into the wrong area, and no one here seems to give a shit. I knew Igor personally, and he was a company man through and through. The fact that he could ever be seen as a threat by Kovac is nonsense, and in what world is it okay to execute a person on the spot for trespassing? As I write that I realize how fucking insane it is. I don't know what to do here Mr. Davies. I need help. Kovac are out of control.

D2[ | ] NNT-453Y[ redaction I have redacted classified information from the Dr. Hammerstein report regarding the exploration of the fossil. This version of the report can be declassified for standard B tier clearance and above. The report follows. Andre Piros A134 --------------------------------------- This is the report of Dr. Gallus Hammerstein, lead researcher and co-founder of Project Insight. I have authorized expeditions into the following zones of the fossil: [redacted] [redacted] These locations are collectively known as \"the Inner\". This area has a separate classification due to evidence of geologic compacting and sedimentary settling. This implies an ancient impact or explosion. You may read my report titled [redacted] for further information on those findings. Having pinpointed the location of several chambers in zones [redacted] and [redacted], I have approved a comprehensive mapping and exploration of those zones. I am certain these chambers are not the result of natural geologic processes. An initial report, by one of my staff (not me) suggested they were lava tunnels. I have rejected that conclusion as there is no evidence of volcanic activity in this area and the chambers are too symmetrical to have been formed by any natural mechanism. I believe we are looking at evidence of [redacted]. I am confident that the chambers were been constructed by [redacted], though, as yet we do not know how or why they were made. Certainly, a great mystery for me to tackle. I have ordered any objects found within the Inner to remain in situ for the time being. It is my responsibility to establish protocols for all future explorations, so we will start as if we were freshmen archeologists, shifting soil for the first time. We will organize and classify first, then once more is known we shall consider excavation, removal, and transportation. As I believe any artifacts we find will be [redacted], we will need to stay alert to the possibility of [redacted]. We have established a new catalogue for this work. My staff suggested we call it the Hammerstein Collection. It seems as good a choice as any. The following reports offer further insight into this enigma: [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] Subject: Changes I will be serving as the Project Manager for Santonian Mining Company until a suitable replacement can be found. The tragic loss of Andrew has affected us all deeply, but we must carry on regardless. That is what he would have wanted. I will attempt to make myself available to you as much as possible but would appreciate patience as we make changes in response to the tragic events of October 13th. We will be adjusting security procedures to make sure we are not caught off guard in the future, including restricting access to some areas. This is for your own safety. The energy surge created multiple blast tunnels to the surface. These tunnels are dangerous and unpredictable, so we will be sealing them off while inspections and repairs are conducted. Should you find a shaft that has not been surveyed, make sure you inform a Project Insight coordinator so the area can be secured and sealed off. We will be installing additional security doors throughout Garganta to isolate and contain any future events. There may be some teething problems getting access to certain areas as we integrate the new system, so bear with us. If you need access to a restricted area, contact a security officer. Do NOT, under any circumstances, enter a restricted area without clearance. I cannot stress this enough. A memorial service for Andrew will be held once social interaction limitations have been relaxed. We are following the recommended WHO guidelines to combat NAM-V even here in Garganta, the safest place you could be right now. As a reminder, we should all do our bit: - Keep Yourself and others safe: - Wash hands regularly (20 seconds using anti-bacterial soap or bleach) - Practice Social Distancing (6 -10 feet whenever possible) - Inform medical staff of any unreported cases of NAM-V within the facility In response to multiple complaints about wearing masks, we are not mandating their use. If you elect not to wear a mask, please exercise common sense (cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze, keep a reasonable distance etc.) Your choice in this matter will be recorded in your personnel file.

Please send me the ID of the operative so I can offline them and research. As for the other issue - maybe the schematics it had were corrupted and it thought the closet was a waypoint? I doubt if we need to worry about it. Angela \u2014-------------------- D-Lock Block Cipher alias:int_server.1024_ciph.tier5.kds_ops/AKleinA106.flagged Ms. Klein, I've been going through the Biocom logs from last month (March-April 2054). I do this every so often to confirm that objective stacking and prioritization is functioning as expected. It's usually all fine except for the odd hiccup if an operative has an unexpected reaction to a PRDM or a temperature dropped in their pod or something - meaning it's invariably an outside issue and not Biocom related. But last month we had two issues with the objective stack which seem to come directly from Biocom. These are two seperate operatives of different generations, using different boosters, on two unrelated missions. The first issue I noticed was the operative was ordered to escort a group of environment techs through a restricted zone, surveil them as they cleared some blockage in a vent, then escort them out of the restricted zone. The operative completed the first four entries on the objective stack, but then added a new objective to the stack. It went to a storage closet, unlocked the door, waited for 6 minutes inside the closet, then returned to the environment tech and continued with the original stack.It didn't take anything from the closet, didn't speak to anyone, and didn't initia any combat. It's very weird. I don't know where the new objective came from, or how it slotted in to the stack so easily - but only Biocom can do this. It's almost as if someone was testing me to see if we'd notice. I'd appreciate it if you told me if this was a test of some kind. I don't want to burn hours on something like this if it was contrived.The second issue is likely more related to you. An operative told the scientist they were guarding that Project Insight \"you must stop\". The scientist asked the KSO to repeat the statement, but the KSO ignored him and resumed its patrol.

They are protecting the data first, then us. Bishop keeps moving us but the creatures always find us. Even in the pitch black they can locate us with ease. They took Peterson yesterday while we were resting in a cave. They must have been watching us all along. We had the entrance guarded and a rock wall to our backs but they still just...

That much is clear. We've lost the Quantum Tether to Garganta, and despite scanning the entire frequency range, there's no signal. Control must be searching for us from their end but well heh... We don't fully understand the Matter Wave Projector; damn fools. I have pleaded with Bishop to return to the landing zone because maybe there the original tether frequency will still work; he refuses. He just repeats his objective: Explore and cover as much ground as possible and wait until Control instantiates a Matter Wave for our return.

At 2.2 meters into the detour, they broke into an unexpected void, and ceased excavation to investigate the chamber. The revealed chamber extended 43 meters to the north, measured 27 meters at the widest point (east from the point of entry), and rose up to 15 meters high. There was no indication that water had permeated this far into the rock, leading the onsite Geo (Kat Edison B062) to suggest that the chamber was a planned excavation, though by who or what was unknown. Several unusual artifacts were recovered from the chamber. All were submitted to the research department. It was clear by their geometry and form that the artifacts were also constructed and not by natural process, though their purpose and origin was unknown. Actions taken after incidentArtifacts and core samples sent to MLS Research Department. Floor 19 construction crew reassigned to floor 16 duties. L18-AT06 has been designated as restricted access - Tier 3 and above.

The assessments are carried out after at least 5 days in HS recovery, and very few organisms will survive suspended animation for more than a few days without a finely tuned subsistence strategy to keep them alive. When we introduce positive bacteriophage we have to stimulate them constantly or they won't survive even a few hours in HS. This is without considering the counteragents and neutralizers we use in the amniotic plasma. Any behavioral issues you were seeing are psychological, not biological.

I was at a conference recently. Now I can't give you all the details because there is a lot of people in power who'd like to know, right? But let me just say that it was a meeting of... great minds, right? People who know the hard questions that need to be asked. People that will not simply lie down; as these big, global conglomerates spoon-feed us lies. This gathering, this conference that I was fortunate enough to be invited to discussed a lot of topics. We talked about chemtrails, we talked about subliminal control through advertising, we talked about the New World Order, lots of stuff. But you know what we talked about most? Garganta. That's right, some of you may have heard it's called \"The Facility\" but it's the same thing, okay? They call it Garganta, that's the official name, I have that on good authority. The Santonian Mining Company is building a massive, underground superstructure off the Yucatan coast and its construction is destroying the habitat. By the way, when I say the Santonian Mining Company, you know who that is right? Dreyfus Industries. Yeah that name keeps popping up, doesn't it? I'm talking about mass extinction of land and sea species. I'm talking about topsoil contamination, water table poisoning. We are headed for complete environmental collapse in the Yucatan because the SMC and let's just say it here: Dreyfus Industries; are being allowed to build without any oversight or jurisdiction. I mean they built these concrete walls, nearly 20 meters high right onto the seabed floor and then drained out an area that's almost 15 acres, that's... 10 football fields of seafloor exposed. The contaminants they have leaked into the surrounding waters are incalculable. That's the Gulf Stream right there, whatever crap they leached out into the sea is going global. You get me? They are digging down. We don't know how deep, because of course it's classified and we're not allowed to know that. But they are digging down and nobody is watching them. Who knows what deadly diseases they are exposing, what toxins are getting released into the atmosphere as they drill. Are you gonna eat fish caught in the Gulf now? I know I'm not. The construction of Garganta is the single most threatening issue facing our planet today and nobody... nobody is talking about it. Except us, you and me.

We will focus primarily on the existing tunnels as the data suggests these could be used as transportation shafts deeper into the object. Transit highways between these tunnels can then be expanded into work areas, laboratories, and research facilities. We will exclusively be using the Nyxos cutters for excavation from now on, so all traditional excavation machinery should be dismantled and removed immediately. They offer more precision and if it is indeed a fossilized construction, we must exercise caution and minimize damage... Note that we are now exploring some highly sensitive areas. Team selection will be of the utmost importance. Tier 4 and below workers must be carefully scrutinized and evaluated.

Recommends Lock Down by Sherry Ladella After the recent outbreak of the so-called the \"Florida Flu\" in Maricopa, the county health department is encouraging citizens to use \"social distancing\" to prevent transmission of the outbreak. Little is known about the virus, but the rapid increase in confirmed cases in the last few days is staggering. Governor Dresden has been briefed by the Maricopa Health Department, and is expected to reach a decision by end of the week. Sources tell us that social and commercial lock down has been advised. The virus first appeared in Maricopa after several tour parties returned from the Miami Beach new year celebrations. Several students and faculty from Arizona State were the first to come down with the virus, and despite efforts to contain the outbreak (including closing down ASU for 2 full weeks), the Florida Flu has spread to multiple communities in and around Phoenix. Do I have it? Without any official word from either the county, or from the health department, many people are rightfully angry that they have not been informed on how to recognize the virus, nor how to care for the infected. The Register is taking the unprecedented action of listing reported symptoms here. If you or anyone you know exhibits several of these symptoms, it is recommended you contact your health care provider immediately: Whitening of the skin Inflammation of the cheeks, neck lips and extremities (fingers, toes) Spinal pain or shocks Susceptibility to bruising or broken bones Accelerated breathing/panting Blood in the sputum Treatment for the virus is unknown, although a detailed report is expected from state government in the next few days.Until then, the Register advises you [stay] indoors, stock that fridge, and start streaming.

Date of Report: September 21st 2053 Report: #SAMD-C066-15 Report Summary My report on Medical Response Team activity during August 2053 follows: During the first week of August, MRT responded on-site to 31 incidents. 19 incidents occurred in Level 27 alone. Gaining access to the mines was challenging, as KDS are strictly controlling all movement within Garganta. In the second week of August, the mines were designated as an exclusion zone, directly under the control of BIOCOM. Since then there have been dozens of unreported incidents that Kovac Defense Services have simply elected not to disclose to MRT. I have compared the admissions data from the Medical Center with our official incident reports, and it is clear that a further 114 incidents have occurred somewhere within BIOCOM controlled areas, all without any official report or further explanation. These incidents range from burns and broken bones to psychosis, hallucinations and suicide attempts. Without an official report, the MRT is forced to deal with patients without context or preparation. The victims are delivered to the nearest Medbay, and we are expected to treat them without any meaningful information on how they experienced their trauma. Unfortunately, the Medical Department's hands are tied. We have requested transparency from KDS, and insisted that they follow protocol with regards to incident reporting, but the effort is pointless. When I confronted Anders Johanson, he informed me that \"KDS is a security firm. We decide what information is disseminated to which departments. Your job is to treat the wounded, not to analyze the battlefield. Patch them up and send them back.\" It is impossible for the MRT to prepare for emergencies if we are not made aware of the risks the workers in mines are facing. We do not know when the exploration teams are setting out, what their destination is, or what environmental or pathogenic dangers they are facing. We also have been denied any data from the autopsy of the creature found in Level 27, despite the potential for the life form to be carrying bacteria or viruses for which we have no remedy. Indeed, KDS are now actively denying any life form was found, despite several of our staff being present at the initial discovery. The truth, it seems, is now negotiable. We cannot do our job while working under the restrictions placed by the KDS. They are blatantly rewriting facts as they see fit, and are simply quoting the primary BIOCOM directive when questioned. KSO operatives who have been admitted to the trauma center do not speak to us, and when questioned offer no information on what is happening within the BIOCOM controlled exclusion zone. Either they are too afraid to tell us, or they are as unaware of the primary objective set by the BIOCOM as we are.The situation has gotten out of hand. At the very least, we need to order more supplies.

After cataloging the samples and performing several surface scans, myself and Dr. Richtofer agreed that the material was unknown to us and proper analysis required breaking one of the artifacts down so a full spectroscopy could be performed. Dr. Richtofer placed one of the artifacts into the Jaw Crusher. The machine, though functioning perfectly well, had no effect on the artifact at all. It remained intact and untarnished despite the crusher operating at full power. Dr. Richtofer attempted to force the sample into the crusher, but in doing so the artifacts lodged between the crusher plates, causing the mechanism to overload. The hydraulic hoses driving the vibrating plate shattered, and the flying debris hit Dr. Richtofer in the left eye, causing a globe luxation. We replaced the Doctor's eye as quickly as possible, but it is likely that his vision will be lost, The artifact remains unbroken. Actions taken after the incidentDr. Richtofer has been placed on medical recovery (on-site). A new crusher has been ordered.

Usually, the emergency room sees a steady influx of patients. It's busy; but no more than they can handle. the Infirmary is well staffed and stocked and has a reputation for dealing with patients quickly and efficiently. But not tonight. Tonight over 250 people crowd the waiting rooms. As one patient is seen, treated, and released, 2 more take their place at the end of the line. There are no beds left, not enough personal protective equipment for the medical staff, and a barely contained sense of panic among the cast-down faces of those waiting in hope that they don't have \"the Stoops\". This is a hospital clinging on, desperately trying to weather the storm. The storm of the NAM-V virus. Since the WHO officially labeled the NAM-V virus as a pandemic, the number of reported cases has spiked. In part that is due to a more concerted testing effort, but it is also a sign of just how quickly this virus is spreading. Unlike previous pandemics (Hook, COVID19 - 21, Respo-Z2), this one debilitates its victims. There is no stay-at-home solution. If you have NAM-V, you need medical support. The long-term effects of the virus are still unknown, but once you start to feel the tightening in your bones and the persistent hallucinations you will need medical supervision, or the end will be swift. Medical intervention is the only thing that can slow the decline. Even if the patient does manage to survive the initial onslaught of the virus, it will remain in their system and can strike again without warning.

The report is an evaluation of the financial burden of continuing support of the Kovac Defense Services research program, and an investigation into the ethical implications of using Digital Intelligence to oversee resource management in future state funded combat operations. Financial Summation: Kovac received $435 billion in congressionally approved funding for the fiscal year 2045. A comprehensive audit of Kovac's financial records indicates the actual expenditure for the year was $627 billion. There is no indication of unreported funding from any US government agency, suggesting that Kovac has additional financial support from one or more outside entities. Given the size of the additional funding, it can be presumed that the additional funds are coming from a non-US government agency. External influence on US supported research programs presents a significant national security risk and compromises the value of any programs deriving from said research. Immediate cessation of all congressional funding is highly recommended. Full disambiguation and potential non-destructive resolutions are presented in Section 3. Ethical Summation: Kovac's BIOCOM Combat Operations Management system was used extensively by the private sector in 2045. Operations conducted along the Caucus borders, along the Iran-Iraq DMZ and during the Belarus Insurgency have been labelled as \"operationally successful\" by the Armed Services report (ID# ASGAR-T-044-KDS-03). However, those operations have also received significant criticism from international organizations, including the United Nations, Amnesty International, Policy Watch, and the Hague Assembly. Critics of BIOCOM highlight concerns over the use of its \"equivalency algorithm', the mathematical principle used by BIOCOM to gauge mission success by projected casualties. There is also growing concern over the practice of Martial Trafficking, as many of the operatives used by BIOCOM (designated as Kovac Security Operatives) come from unknown origins, have no legal rights or status, and have been trained using methods that break the Zurich Concord of 2042. Immediate cessation of all congressional funding is highly recommended. Full disambiguation and potential non-destructive resolutions are presented in Section 4. GLD-4R4-XU5.LOG[ | ] ACCESS -BIOCOM ... Analyzing. Wait... Coordinates line up with the location of the \"Butterfly Nebula\"; Decoded Anders Johanson Date: September 3rd 2050 Subject: Psychological encoding Mr. Johanson, With regards to the psychological matching of our operatives, we have found that each designation has a tendency to take a specific role within the quad. Genesis often establish themselves as leaders within a few minutes, as is to be expected with the increased 5-HT receptors. The designations do allow for flexibility of course. We have several quads where operatives marked as Faulty have assumed a leadership role, making me question our classification criteria. It may be that our standards are too stringent (excepting injury or physical incapability obviously), and we should be less hasty marking an operative as faulty when we see mental aberrations. The deviations happen more often when the operative is placed under extreme duress, or if an objective requires extensive violent engagement. I believe we expect too much given their social circumstance prior to acquisition. Despite extensive protein supplements, those embedded behaviors are going to surface and we should develop a curriculum to deal with them rather than throwing them on the trash heap. This, of course, is all moot pending Rise, but who knows how long that will be. At some point I'd like to address the auditory response irregularity noted in my previous report. While the short-term solution is to simply offer ear protection for operatives who are overly sensitive to certain frequencies, I'd like to put together a team to research the problem. Let me know.

I just checked and CRS-JSC-003 does open the John Schaeffer file on this end. I'm not sure why the file isn't accessible to you. It could be one of two reasons: - Garganta now uses the Kovac D-Lock system for all internal communication, but the main office still uses the old SMC mail server. They may not be talking to each other correctly. - All files for Garganta are now classified as B tier clearance and above. I'm not sure what clearance your PA has, but if they are C tier and you are connected to the server with their log in credentials - you'll get a \"server not found\" response. I will reach out to your assistant today to make sure it isn't a log-in issue. I'm sure Mr. Clinton would want to apologize over any confusion regarding the hire list. We obviously respect the \"chain of command\" but were asked to correspond directly with Mr. Davies on this matter. It's probably best if you discuss the matter directly with him.
